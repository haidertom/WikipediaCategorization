'''ArtAbilitation''' is an international conference platform for people with [[disability|disabilities]] and a movement that started in 2006 as coined/originated by Anthony (aka Tony) Brooks. The concept was realized as an international conference, workshop series, and symposium, and was inaugurated in [[Esbjerg, Denmark]], in September 2006 when supporting the ICDVRAT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdvrat.rdg.ac.uk|title=ICDVRAT - International Conference Series on Disability, Virtual Reality and Associated Technologies|author=Paul Sharkey|website=Icdvrat.rdg.ac.uk|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in celebrating its tenth anniversary. Selected authors from this inaugural event published their papers in the Routledge International Journal Digital Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=g778864938~db=all|title=Editorial: ArtAbilitation|author=Tony Brooks|pages=65-68|date=18 May 2007|website=Informaworld.com|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a778860902~db=all~order=page|journal=

The events of ICDVRAT &amp; ArtAbilitation 2006 were reported in the International Journal for [[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijvr.org/reports%20and%20experts/report_ICDVRAT.pdf International Journal for Virtual Reality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119232458/http://www.ijvr.org/reports%20and%20experts/report_ICDVRAT.pdf |date=November 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the second ArtAbilitation conference supported the 17th International Conference for [[Artificial reality|Artificial Reality]] &amp; Telexistence (ICAT). ICAT is the oldest international conference on Virtual Reality and the hosting in Esbjerg, Denmark. This was the first time the event was held outside the [[Asia Pacific]] region. ICAT is organised by the Virtual Reality Society of Japan (VRSJ). ICAT 2006 was held at [[Zhejiang University of Technology]] in China.  Archives of ICAT2007 are online at IEEE site. The first international symposium ‘Ludic Engagement Designs for All’ supported.{{Clarify|date=October 2010}}

The 3rd ArtAbilitation Conference was held alongside ICDVRAT 2008 in [[Maia, Portugal]], on September 8 through 10th. A special session on music was hosted at [[Casa da Música|Casa da Musica]], Porto, Portugal, on 11 September. This was followed by the ''2nd International Congress on Art, Brain and Languages'', hosted in Casa da Musica in Porto on 11 and 12 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/ABL_Programme.pdf |title=2nd International Congress on Art, Brain &amp; languages |website=Cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk|accessdate=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference combines various areas of knowledge such as [[Neuropsychology]], [[Musicology|Musical Sciences]], [[Theatre|Theatrical Arts]], [[Art therapy|Art Therapy]], and [[Linguistics]]. It aims for a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to education, disability, and rehabilitation. It intends to question how the inter-related practice and processing of different types of language (musical, psychomotor, verbal, technological, and aesthetic) can intervene in education and disability (motor, verbal or mental).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

'''Berkeley Earth''' is a [[Berkeley, California]] based independent 501(c)(3) [[non-profit]] focused on land temperature data analysis for [[climate science]].  Berkeley Earth was founded in early 2010 (originally called the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project) with the goal of addressing the major concerns from outside the scientific community regarding [[global warming]] and the [[instrumental temperature record]]. The project's stated aim was a "transparent approach, based on data analysis."&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.berkeleyearth.org/index.php |title=Berkeley Earth home page |accessdate=26 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821233330/http://berkeleyearth.org/index.php |archive-date=2013-08-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2013, Berkeley Earth became an independent non-profit.  In August 2013, Berkeley Earth was granted 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by the US government. The primary product is air temperatures over land, but they also produce a global dataset resulting from a merge of their land data with HadSST.

Berkeley Earth founder [[Richard A. Muller]] told ''[[The Guardian]]''

&lt;blockquote&gt;...we are bringing the spirit of science back to a subject that has become too argumentative and too contentious, ....we are an independent, non-political, non-partisan group. We will gather the data, do the analysis, present the results and make all of it available. There will be no spin, whatever we find. We are doing this because it is the most important project in the world today. Nothing else comes close.&lt;ref name=Sample&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/feb/27/can-these-scientists-end-climate-change-war |title=Can a group of scientists in California end the war on climate change? |first=Ian |last=Sample |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2011-02-27 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The team's preliminary findings, data sets and programs were published beginning in December 2012. The study addressed scientific concerns including urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data [[selection bias]]. The Berkeley Earth group concluded that the warming trend is real, that over the past 50 years (between the decades of the 1950s and 2000s) the land surface warmed by 0.91±0.05&amp;nbsp;°C, and their results mirror those obtained from earlier studies carried out by the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[Hadley Centre]],  NASA's [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis, and the [[Climatic Research Unit]] (CRU) at the [[University of East Anglia]].  The study also found that the [[urban heat island]] effect and poor station quality did not bias the results obtained from these earlier studies.&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt;

==Initial results==
After completing the analysis of the full land temperature data set, consisting of more than 1.6 billion temperature measurements dating back to the 1800s from 15 sources around the world, and originated from more than 39,000 temperature stations worldwide, the group submitted four papers for peer-review and publication in scientific journals. The Berkeley Earth study did not assess temperature changes in the oceans, nor try to assess how much of the observed warming is due to human action.&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt; The Berkeley Earth team also released the preliminary findings to the public on October 20, 2011 in order to promote additional scrutiny. The data sets and programs used to analyze the information, and the papers undergoing peer review were also made available to the public.&lt;ref name=bbcBlack&gt;{{Cite news|title=Global warming 'confirmed' by independent study |first=Richard |last=Black |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15373071 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21533360 |title=Climate change: The heat is on |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2011-10-22 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111021144716.htm |title=Cooling the Warming Debate: Major New Analysis Confirms That Global Warming Is Real |work=[[Science Daily]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berkeley Earth study addressed scientific concerns raised by skeptics including urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data selection bias. The team's initial conclusions are the following:&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/20/global-warming-study-climate-sceptics |title=Global warming study finds no grounds for climate sceptics' concerns |first=Ian |last=Sample |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[urban heat island]] effect and poor station quality did not bias the results obtained from earlier studies carried out by the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[Hadley Centre]] and [[NASA]]'s GISS Surface Temperature Analysis. The team found that the urban heat island effect is locally large and real, but does not contribute significantly to the average land temperature rise, as the planet's urban regions amount to less than 1% of the land area. The study also found that while stations considered "poor" might be less accurate, they recorded the same average warming trend.
*Global temperatures closely matched previous studies from NASA GISS, NOAA and the Hadley Centre, that have found global warming trends. The Berkeley Earth group estimates that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911&amp;nbsp;°C, just 2% less than NOAA's estimate. The team scientific director stated that "...this confirms that these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions."&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;
*About 1/3 of temperature sites around the world with records of 70 years or longer reported cooling (including much of the United States and northern Europe). But 2/3 of the sites show warming. Individual temperature histories reported from a single location are frequently noisy and/or unreliable, and it is always necessary to compare and combine many records to understand the true pattern of global warming.
*The [[Atlantic multidecadal oscillation]] (AMO) has played a larger role than previously thought. The [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) is generally thought to be the main reason for inter-annual warming or cooling, but the Berkeley Earth team's analysis found that  the global temperature correlates more closely with the state of the Atlantic Multidecadal ''Oscillation'' index, which is a measure of sea surface temperature in the north Atlantic.

The Berkeley Earth analysis uses a new methodology and was tested against much of the same data as NOAA and NASA. The group uses an algorithm that attaches an automatic weighting to every data point, according to its consistency with comparable readings. The team claims this approach allows the inclusion of outlandish readings without distorting the result and standard statistical techniques were used to remove [[outlier]]s. The methodology also avoids traditional procedures that require long, continuous data segments, thus accommodating for short sequences, such as those provided by temporary weather stations. This innovation allowed the group to compile an earlier record than its predecessors, starting from 1800, but with a high degree of uncertainty because at the time there were only two weather stations in America, just a few in Europe and one in Asia.&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature1011/&gt;

===Reactions===
Given project leader Muller's well-publicised concerns regarding the quality of climate change research, other critics anticipated that the Berkeley Earth study would be a vindication of their stance. For example, when the study team was announced, [[Anthony Watts (blogger)|Anthony Watts]], a blogger who popularized several of the issues addressed by the Berkeley Earth group study, expressed full confidence in the team's methods:

{{quote|text=I'm prepared to accept whatever result they produce, even if it proves my premise wrong. ... [T]he method ''isn't'' the madness that we've seen from NOAA, NCDC, GISS, and CRU, and, there aren't any monetary strings attached to the result that I can tell. ... That lack of strings attached to funding, plus the broad mix of people involved especially those who have previous experience in handling large data sets gives me greater confidence in the result being closer to a bona fide ground truth than anything we've seen yet.|source=Anthony Watts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/03/06/briggs-on-berkeleys-best-plus-my-thoughts-from-my-visit-there/ |last=Watts |first=Anthony |title=Briggs on Berkeley's forthcoming BEST surface temperature record, plus my thoughts from my visit there |date=March 6, 2011 |website=Watts Up With That? |accessdate=2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the initial results were released, and found to support the existing consensus, the study was widely decried by deniers. Watts spoke to ''The New York Times'', which wrote: "Mr. Watts ... contended that the study's methodology was flawed because it examined data over a 60-year period instead of the 30-year-one that was the basis for his research and some other peer-reviewed studies. He also noted that the report had not yet been peer-reviewed and cited spelling errors as proof of sloppiness."&lt;ref name=NYT1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/climate-study-does-not-placate-skeptics/?ref=earth |title=Climate Study Does Not Placate Skeptics |first=Leslie |last=Kaufman |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/science/earth/21climate.html |title=Climate Skeptics Stay Unswayed |work=New York Times |date=October 21, 2011 |page=A25 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Mosher, a co-author of a book critical of climate scientists, also disapproved saying that the study still lacked transparency.

By contrast, the study was well received by Muller's peers in climate science research. [[James Hansen]], a leading climate scientist and head of [[NASA]] [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] commented that he had not yet read the research papers but was glad Muller was looking at the issue. He said "It should help inform those who have honest scepticism about global warming."&lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt; [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]] the director of the [[Climatic Research Unit]] (CRU) at the [[University of East Anglia]], said: "I look forward to reading the finalised paper once it has been reviewed and published.

Mann|Michael Mann]], director of the Earth System Science Center at [[Pennsylvania State University]], commented that "...they get the same result that everyone else has gotten," and "that said, I think it's at least useful to see that even a critic like Muller, when he takes an honest look, finds that climate science is robust."&lt;ref name=Scientist1011/&gt; Peter Thorne, from the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites in North Carolina and chair of the International Surface Temperature Initiative, said: "This takes a very distinct approach to the problem and comes up with the same answer, and that builds confidence that pre-existing estimates are in the right ballpark. There is very substantial value in having multiple groups looking at the same problem in different ways." &lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt; The ice core research scientist Eric Steig wrote at RealClimate.org that it was unsurprising that Berkeley Earth's results matched previous results so well: "Any of various simple statistical analyses of the freely available data ...show... that it was very very unlikely that the results would change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2011/10/berkeley-earthquake-called-off/ |first=Eric |last=Steig |title=Berkeley earthquake called off |publisher=RealClimate.org |date=6 December 2004 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expanded scope==
Since the publication of its papers in 2013, Berkeley Earth has broadened its scope. Berkeley Earth has three program areas of work: 1) further scientific investigations on the nature of climate change and extreme weather events, 2) an education and communications program, and 3) evaluation of mitigation efforts in developed and developing economies, with a focus on energy conservation and the use of natural gas as a bridging fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/science Berkeley Earth  Science]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/education-and-communications Berkeley Earth  Education &amp; Communications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204083539/http://berkeleyearth.org/education-and-communications |date=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/mitigation Berkeley Earth Mitigation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204080520/http://berkeleyearth.org/mitigation |date=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==July 2012 announcement==
In an [[op-ed]] published in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on 28 July 2012, Muller announced further findings from the project. He said their analysis showed that average global land temperatures had increased by {{convert|2.5|F-change|1}} in 250 years, with the increase in the last 50 years being {{convert|1.5|F-change|1}}, and it seemed likely that this increase was entirely due to human caused [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. His opening paragraph stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I'm now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.&lt;ref name="NYT 28 July 2012"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He said that their findings were stronger than those shown in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]. Their analysis, set out in five scientific papers now being subjected to scrutiny by others, had used statistical methods which Robert Rohde had developed and had paid particular attention to overcoming issues that skeptics had questioned, including the [[urban heat island]] effect, poor station quality, data selection and data adjustment. In the fifth paper which they now made public, they fitted the shape of the record to various forcings including volcanoes, solar activity and sunspots. They found that the shape best matched the curve of the calculated greenhouse effect from human caused greenhouse gas emissions. Muller said he still found "that much, if not most, of what is attributed to climate change is speculative, exaggerated or just plain wrong. I've analyzed some of the most alarmist claims, and my skepticism about them hasn't changed."&lt;ref name="NYT 28 July 2012" /&gt;

[[Buddhism]] played an important role in the development of [[Japanese art]] between the 6th and the 16th centuries. [[Buddhist art]] and [[Buddhist]] religious thought came to Japan from [[China]] through [[Korea]] and Buddhist art was encouraged by Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]] in the [[Suiko]] period in the sixth century and by [[Emperor Shōmu]] in the [[Nara period]] in the eighth century. In the early [[Heian period]] Buddhist art and architecture greatly influenced the traditional [[Shinto]] arts, and Buddhist painting became fashionable among wealthy Japanese. The Kamakura period saw a flowering of Japanese Buddhist sculpture, whose origins are in the works of Heian period sculptor [[Jōchō]]. &lt;!--Many of the great artists from [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara]] during the [[Kamakura period]] were also [[Buddhist monks]].
--&gt;
The [[Amitabha|Amida]] sect of Buddhism provided the basis for many popular artworks. Buddhist art became popular among the masses via [[Emakimono|scroll paintings]], paintings used in worship and paintings of [[Buddhas]], [[saint]]'s lives, [[hell]]s and other religious themes. Under the [[Zen]] sect of Buddhism, portraiture of priests such as Bodhidharma became popular as well as scroll calligraphy and sumi-e brush painting.

==Asuka and Nara periods==

[[File:Shakyamuni Triad Horyuji.JPG|thumb|Shakyamuni Triad by Tori Busshi depicts the Buddha Shakyamuni in the traditional sixth-century Chinese style with an elongated head and in front of a flaming mandorla - a lotus petal shaped cloud.]]

Buddhist art was introduced to Japan along with the Buddhist religion in the mid-sixth century, when according to tradition, [[Seong of Baekje]] sent a statue of the Buddha along with some sutras to the [[Emperor Kinmei]]. The [[Asuka period]] (552–645) saw the gradual growth of Chinese and Korean artistic and religious influences on Japanese culture. Chinese influence grew in the Nara Period (645–784) as the Japanese court began to model itself in a Chinese form, and Buddhism continued to spread throughout Japan, while integrating within it the Japanese religion of Shinto. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 211.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture of this period shows, as do most all subsequent sculpture, the influence of continental art. [[Tori Busshi]] a descendant of a Chinese immigrant followed the style of [[Northern Wei]] sculpture and established what has come to be known as the Tori school of sculpture. Notable examples of Tori works are the Sakyamuni Triad (or Shaka triad) which are the main icons of the Golden Hall of [[Hōryū-ji]] temple and the [[kannon]] [[Boddhisatva]] of Yumedono Hall of the same temple, also known as Guze Kannon. First built in the early 7th century as the private temple of Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]], [[Hōryū-ji]] consists of 41 independent buildings. The most important ones, the main worship hall, or ''Kondō'' (Golden Hall), and ''Gojū-no-tō'' (Five-story [[Pagoda]]), stand in the center of an open area surrounded by a roofed cloister. Inside the ''Kondō'', on a large rectangular platform, are some of the most important sculptures of the period including the Sakyamuni triad.

In the Sakyamuni Triad, [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni]], the center Buddha, is attended by two other figures, [[Bhaisajyaguru]] to its right and [[Amitabha|Amitābha]] to its left. The statues are dated to 623.&lt;ref name="ISBN477002939X"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN477002939X&amp;id=zMC4RMXQkn0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;vq=kannon&amp;dq=chuguji+miroku&amp;sig=Z5IBZpP5m89CZxi3XUnwfbEBsh4|title=Discovering the Arts of Japan: A Historical Overview, p42|accessdate=2007-04-03|publisher=Kodansha International|year=2003|author=Tsuneko S.

The Early Nara period saw a move towards more naturalistic styles emerging from China. The Triad of Yakushi shows the healing Buddha which presides over the Eastern Pure Land attended by two Bodhisattvas Nikko and Gakko. The triad, housed in the Yakushiji temple (7th century in Nara), reveals Chinese and central Asian influences in its anatomical definition, naturalism and realistic drapery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 212.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sculpture also demonstrates the roots of Japanese art in the 1st-3rd century CE [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], characterized by flowing dress patterns and realistic rendering,&lt;ref&gt;"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)&lt;/ref&gt; on which Chinese and Korean artistic traits were superimposed. After the [[Northern Wei|Chinese Northern Wei]] buddhist art had infiltrated a Korean peninsula, Buddhist icons was brought Japan by Korean immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Influence on Early Japanese Buddhist Sculpture [http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= buddhapia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111194158/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= |date=2011-01-11 }} "One must stress the obvious point that since Korean Buddhist art is directly based on developments in China, ultimately a study of Korean influence on Japan must be rooted in an understanding of the Chinese impact on Korea.""Since the territory of the Northern Wei was adjacent to that of Koguryo, it is natural that the Buddhist ideas and art current at the Northern Wei court would flow directly to Koguryo. ""It should also be pointed out that there was considerable influence from Koguryo on the southern kingdoms of Paekche and Silla even though Paekche also received direct influence from south China, as was mentioned above.""I have argued that various groups, including official envoys, monks and students, as well as Korean settlers, were responsible for bringing Korean icons to Japan."&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Ancient Greek art style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the [[Kōryū-ji]] [[Maitreya|Miroku]] Bosatsu and the [[Chūgū-ji]] [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] statues.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Three Kingdoms of Korea, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN070071605X&amp;id=e1BzL2lwPqEC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=korean+buddhist+art&amp;sig=4XlpYzvL4PF3TKAR7BO3ZwFBXbg]&lt;/ref&gt;
They illustrate the terminal point of the [[Silk Road transmission of art]] during the first few centuries of our era. Other examples can be found in the development of the iconography of the Japanese [[Fūjin]] Wind God,&lt;ref&gt;"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins.&amp;nbsp;... One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Niō]] guardians,&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of the image of [[Vajrapani]] should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modeled after that of Hercules.&amp;nbsp;... The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterward transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities (Niō)." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt; and the near-[[classical antiquity|Classical]] floral patterns in temple decorations.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple building in the 8th century was focused around the [[Tōdai-ji]] in Nara. Constructed as the headquarters for a network of temples in each of the provinces, the Tōdaiji is the most ambitious religious complex erected in the early centuries of Buddhist worship in Japan. Appropriately, the 16.2&amp;nbsp;m (53&amp;nbsp;ft) Buddha (completed 752) enshrined in the main Buddha hall, or ''Daibutsuden'', is a [[Rushana]] Buddha, the figure that represents the essence of Buddhahood, just as the Tōdaiji represented the center for Imperially sponsored Buddhism and its dissemination throughout Japan. Only a few fragments of the original statue survive, and the present hall and central Buddha are reconstructions from the [[Edo period]].

Under the [[Ritsuryō]] system of government in the [[Nara period]], Buddhism was heavily regulated by the state through the {{nihongo|Sōgō|僧綱||''Office of Priestly Affairs''}}.  During this time, Tōdai-ji served as the central administrative temple for the provincial temples&lt;ref name="abe"&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6 | pages=35, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Buddhism in Japan#Nara Period|six Buddhist schools in Japan]] at the time.

==[[Heian period]] (794–1185)==
[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|Taizokai (Womb World) mandala, second half of ninth century. Hanging scroll, color on silk. The center square represents the young stage of [[Vairocana]] Buddha.]]

In 784, the [[Emperor Kanmu]] threatened by the growing secular power of the Buddhist institutions in Nara moved the capital to [[Heian-kyō]] (Kyōto), which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2007 p.32&lt;/ref&gt; The term Heian period refers to the years between 794 and 1185, when the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at the end of the [[Genpei War]]. The period is further divided into the early Heian and the late Heian, or Fujiwara era, the pivotal date being 894, the year imperial embassies to China were officially discontinued.

[[Buddhism]] began to spread throughout Japan during the Heian period, primarily through two major esoteric sects, [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]]. Tendai originated in [[China]] and is based on the [[Lotus Sutra]], one of the most important [[sutra]]s of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism; [[Saichō]] was key to its transmission to Japan. [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] (true word school) is an indigenous sect with close affiliations to Chinese influenced Buddhist thought founded by [[Kūkai]] (best known by his posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, 774–835) who traveled to China and studied Indian and Chinese Buddhism, as well as Chinese calligraphy and poetry. Emperor Kanmu himself was a notable patron of the [[Tendai]] sect, which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries. Kūkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded [[Emperor Kanmu]], and also generations of Japanese, not only with his holiness but also with his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture. Shingon Buddhist practice is based on various rituals, including the chanting of [[mantras]], [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]], hand gestures ([[mudras]]) and meditation through visualization of [[mandala]]s. The central role of ritual in Japanese esoteric Buddhism led to a flourishing of the religious arts in the Heian period. These religious paintings, mandalas and statues provided practitioners with a way to contemplate on Buddhist deities and concepts. A famous example of Shingon Mandala is the Taizokai (Womb World) mandala. Part of the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]], the womb world is composed of 12 zones representing different dimensions of Buddha nature.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 215.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the center sits the [[Vairocana]] Buddha within the lotus of compassion surrounded by attendant Buddhas and [[Bodhisattva]]s. The Shingon sect believed that all beings have an innate Buddha nature.
&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"/&gt;

The temples erected for the Shingon sect such as that at [[Mt. Kōya]] were built in the Kii mountains, far away from the Court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced Japanese architects to rethink the problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design. Cypress-bark roofs replaced those of ceramic tile, wood planks were used instead of earthen floors, and a separate worship area for the laity was added in front of the main sanctuary. The temple that best reflects the spirit of early Heian Shingon temples is the Murō-ji (early 9th century), set deep in a stand of cypress trees on a mountain southeast of Nara.

[[File:Byodoin Wall Painting JYOHIN-CHUSEI South.JPG|right|thumb|upright| Wall Painting on South door of Byōdō-in]]

In the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara period]], [[Pure Land|Pure Land Buddhism]], which offered easy salvation through belief in [[Amitabha|Amida]] (the Buddha of the Western Paradise), became popular. This period is named after the [[Fujiwara clan]], then the most powerful in the country, who ruled as [[Sesshō and Kampaku|regents]] for the Emperor, becoming, in effect, civil dictators. Concurrently, the Kyoto nobility developed a society devoted to elegant aesthetic pursuits. 
The ''Hō-ō-dō'' (Phoenix Hall, completed 1053) of the [[Byōdō-in]], a temple in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] to the southeast of Kyoto, is the exemplar of Fujiwara Amida halls. It consists of a main rectangular structure flanked by two L-shaped wing corridors and a tail corridor, set at the edge of a large artificial pond. Inside, a single golden image of Amida (c. 1053) is installed on a high platform. The Amida sculpture was executed by [[Jōchō]], who popularized the Chinese technique of creating a work from several smaller pieces of sculpted wood (''[[yosegi]]''). Although it limited the amount of surface detail the artist could carve into each piece, the method forced the sculptor to convey his intended message within these limits. This resulted in more refined and ephemeral-looking pieces.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93"&gt;Paine 93.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, it allowed several assistants to work on the sculpture at once, greatly speeding the process.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163"&gt;Noma 163.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jōchō]], as the master, did the finishing work.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144"&gt;Mason 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The technique also led to systematized [[Body proportions|proportion]]s of body parts and simple surface details, as these sped the creation of the constituent parts and the formation of the finished piece.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

Art historians often cite this new [[canon (art)|canon]] of proportions as evidence of Jōchō's genius. He based the measurements on a unit equal to the distance between the sculpted figure's chin and hairline. The distance between each knee is equal to the distance from the bottoms of the legs to the hair.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144" /&gt; The widely spaced and level knees thus form the base of a triangular design, conveying a feeling of stability and peace. The effect is further accentuated by the contrast of other elements in the design, particularly the figures' [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]s. These are intricately detailed, featuring dancing [[tennin]], clouds, and flames.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93" /&gt; Jōchō's sculptures' expressions convey compassion and elegance, and the detailed and precise carving of the facial features projects a certain kindness.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

The workshop method of dividing work among several craftsmen caught on, as did Jōchō's style. His school was imitated by sculptors across Japan for the over next 150 years, as Japanese sculpture devolved into a conformist orthodoxy before being reinvented in the Kamakura period.&lt;ref&gt;Shively and McCullogh 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rising importance of Pure Land sects of Japanese Buddhism in the tenth century, new image-types were developed to satisfy the devotional needs of these sects. These include Raigozu (来迎図), which depict Amida Buddha along with attendant Bodhisattvas Kannon and Seishi arriving to welcome the souls of the faithful departed to Amida's Western Paradise. A noted early example dating from 1053 are painted on the interior of the Phoenix Hall of the Byōdō-in, a temple in Uji, Kyoto. This is also considered an early example of so-called [[Yamato-e]] (大和絵), or "Japanese-style painting", insofar as it includes landscape elements such as soft rolling hills that seem to reflect something of the actual appearance of the landscape of western Japan. Stylistically, however, this type of painting continues to be informed by Tang Dynasty Chinese "blue and green style" landscape painting traditions. "Yamato-e" is an imprecise term that continues to be debated among historians of Japanese art.

==[[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333)==
[[File:Seshin Vasubandhu Kofukuji.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Seshin]] (Vasubandhu), Wood, 186cm height, CE1208,The Northern Octagonal Hall of Kofukuji Temple, by [[Unkei]]]]

Japan suffered a series of civil wars in the late 12th century between several rival families, which eventually led to the rise of the feudalistic [[Kamakura shogunate]], so named because the victorious family, the [[Minamoto clan]], established their political base in Kamakura. The Emperor remained in Kyoto as a figurehead but the actual political power rested with the ''[[shōgun]]''. The Kamakura period saw the reestablishment of cultural ties with China, as well as the growth of [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Pure Land Buddhism]] as the two major branches of Japanese Buddhism.

These new Kamakura patrons also favored a more realistic and naturalistic art which is exemplified by the sculpture of the [[Kei school]]. The Kei school developed out of that led by the ''[[busshi]]'' (Buddhist sculptor) [[Jōchō]], his successor [[Kakujō]], and Kakujō's son [[Raijō]], the leading sculptors of the preceding generations. These artists are sometimes said to have founded the Kei school;&lt;ref name=jaanus&gt;"[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/keiha.htm Keiha]." ''Japanese Architecture and Art Users System (JAANUS).'' 2001. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the school would not come into its own, and become associated with the name "Kei" until Raijō was succeeded by [[Kōkei (sculptor)|Kōkei]] and [[Unkei]] around the year 1200.

Among sculptors of the [[Kei school]], [[Unkei]] is the most famous and considered to be the most accomplished sculptor of the period.&lt;ref name="Varley 94"&gt;Varley 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his works, a pair of large [[Nio]] (or Kongō Rikishi) in Tōdai-ji depict muscular guardians in a dramatic [[contrapposto]] stance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Unkei's sculptures of Indian priests Mujaku and Seshin in [[Kōfuku-ji]] demonstrate a new portrait-like realism.&lt;ref&gt;Noma 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Both statues sport priestly vestments that frame their bodies realistically. They stand life-size and alone and are fully sculpted in the round as if intended to be viewed from any angle. Mujaku is depicted as a thin man manipulating some sort of holy, cloth-wrapped object. He appears reserved and reflective. Seshin, in contrast, is depicted in mid conversation, gesturing and speaking, an extroverted counterweight to the solemn Mujaku.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The men are shown as specific people, not simply members of a stock type.&lt;ref name="Paine 112"&gt;Paine 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unkei]] had six sculptor sons and their work is also imbued with the new humanism. Tankei, the eldest son and a brilliant sculptor became the head of the studio. [[Kōshō]], the 4th son produced a remarkable sculpture of the 10th-century Japanese Buddhist teacher Kuya (903–972). [[Kaikei]] was a collaborator of [[Unkei]] and worked with him on the [[Nio]] statues in 1203. He worked with priest Chogen (1121–1206): the director of Tōdai-ji reconstruction project. Many of his figures are more idealized than Unkei and his sons, and are characterized by a beautifully finished surface, richly decorated with pigments and gold. His works have survived more than 40, many of which are signed by himself.

Much of the cities of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto]] were destroyed in the [[Genpei War]] of 1180–1185. The [[Kei school]] was granted the opportunity to restore Nara's greatest temples, the [[Tōdai-ji]] and [[Kōfuku-ji]], replacing their Buddhist sculptures. The leading figure in this effort was Shunjobo Chogen (1121–1206), who was known to have made three trips to China to study sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 218.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tōdai-ji restoration project lasted several generations, from roughly 1180 to 1212,&lt;ref name=munsterberg&gt;Munsterberg, Huge. ''The Arts of Japan: An Illustrated History''. Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1957. p98.&lt;/ref&gt; and drew extensively on [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] Chinese styles, introducing new stylistic elements while remaining true to tradition.

Some of the most popular paintings of the Kamakura period depict an ascending Amida Buddha. The main tenet of Pure Land Buddhism is that chanting the name of Amida could lead to a reincarnation in the pure land. Thus, scrolls of Amida would be hung in the room of the dying who would be saved by chanting the Amida mantra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 220.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kamakura period new Buddhists sects, such as Kegon and Nichiren emerged and grew in popularity. These sects produced several distinct genres of painting, including the [[Suijako]] paintings, which tried to reconcile the two main Japanese faiths by depicting Shinto deities as early manifestations of Buddha. Works like the Kegon Engi Emaki, a book illustrated to help people understand complicated Chinese character, became more popular with ordinary people. Emakimono, or long illustrated hand scrolls, also served to illustrate the life of the Buddha and the history of key Buddhist leaders.

==[[Muromachi period]] (1333–1573)==

[[File:Sesshu - Haboku-Sansui.jpg|thumb|upright|{{Nihongo|''Splashed-ink Landscape''|破墨山水|''[[Haboku sansui]]''}}, [[Sesshū]], 1495, ink on silk, 148.6 × 32.7 cm]]

During the [[Muromachi period]], also called the Ashikaga period, a profound change took place in Japanese culture. The [[Ashikaga clan]] took control of the shogunate and moved its headquarters back to Kyoto, to the Muromachi district of the city. With the return of government to the capital, the popularizing trends of the Kamakura period came to an end, and cultural expression took on a more aristocratic, elitist character. During the Muromachi Period, [[Zen Buddhism]] rose to prominence especially among the elite [[Samurai]] class, who embraced the Zen values of personal discipline, concentration and self-development. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 736.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the great Zen monasteries in Kamakura and Kyoto had a major impact on the visual arts. Because of secular ventures and trading missions to China organized by Zen temples, many Chinese paintings and objects of art were imported into Japan and profoundly influenced Japanese artists working for Zen temples and the shogunate. Not only did these imports change the subject matter of painting, but they also modified the use of color; the bright colors of [[Yamato-e]] yielded to the monochromes of painting in the Chinese manner of Sui-boku-ga (水墨画) or [[sumi-e]] (墨絵), this style mainly used only black ink — the same as used in East Asian calligraphy.

[[File:Shubun - Reading in a Bamboo Grove detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of "Reading in a Bamboo Grove", 1446, [[Shūbun]]]]

The foremost painter of the new [[Sumi-e]] style was [[Sesshū Tōyō]] (1420–1506), a [[Rinzai]] priest who traveled to China in 1468–69 and studied contemporary Ming painting. Some of his most dramatic works are in the Chinese splashed-ink (Haboku) style.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 737.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Japan, Sesshū built himself a studio and established a large following, painters that are now referred to as the Unkoku-rin school or "School of Sesshū". To make one of the calligraphic and highly stylized Haboku paintings, the painter would visualize the image and then made swift broad strokes into the paper resulting in a splashed and abstract composition, all done with meditative concentration. This impressionistic style of painting was supposed to capture the true nature of the subject. The [[Sumi-e]] style was highly influenced by calligraphy, using the same tools and style as well as its zen philosophy.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"/&gt; To paint in this style the practitioner had to clear his mind and apply the brush strokes without too much thinking, termed {{nihongo|''[[mushin (mental state)|mushin]]''|無心|"no mind state"}} by the Japanese philosopher [[Nishida Kitaro]].&lt;ref name="yuko"&gt;{{cite web |title=Shodo History |url=http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |author=Solana Yuko Halada |work=Japanese Calligraphy in Zen Spirit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102204715/http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |archivedate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[mushin (mental state)|mushin]] is central to many Japanese arts including the art of the sword, archery and the tea ceremony.

By the end of the 14th century, monochrome landscape paintings (sansuiga) had found patronage by the ruling Ashikaga family and was the preferred genre among Zen painters, gradually evolving from its Chinese roots to a more Japanese style. Another important painter in this period is [[Tenshō Shūbun]], a monk at the Kyoto temple of [[Shōkoku-ji]] who traveled to Korea and studied under Chinese painters. He returned to Japan in 1404 and settled in Kyoto, then the capital city. He became director of the court painting bureau, established by Ashikaga shoguns, who were influential art patrons. Shūbun's most well-known landscape painting, designated as a National Treasure in Japan, is Reading in a Bamboo Grove, now kept in the Tokyo National Museum.

Another style which developed in the Muromachi period is [[Shigajiku]] (詩画軸). This is usually a painting accompanied by poetry and has its roots in China, where painting and poetry were seen as inherently connected. This style grew out of literary circles, an artist would usually be given a subject to paint and the poets would write accompanying verses to be written above the work. A famous example is the scroll "Catching a Catfish with a Gourd" (Hyōnen-zu 瓢鮎図) located at [[Taizō-in]], [[Myōshin-ji]], Kyoto. Created by the priest-painter [[Josetsu]] ({{circa|1386}} – {{circa|1428}}), it includes 31 verses of many Zen priests inscribed above the painting. 
&lt;ref name="yuko-2"&gt;{{cite web |title = JAANUS Japanese architecture and art net users system |url =http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shigajiku.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground of the painting a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background, mountains appear to be far in the distance. The painting was commissioned by the 4th Shogun of the Muromachi Period, Ashikaga Yoshimochi (1386-1428) and was based on the nonsensical riddle "How do you catch a catfish with a gourd?". An example of one of the Koans illustrates the style of the poetry inscribed above the painting.

&lt;poem&gt;:::Poised! With the Gourd
:::He tries to pin that slippery fish.
:::Some oil on the gourd
:::Would add zest to the chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Circa 1492: art in the age of exploration, 1991, Jay A. Levenson. P 321–22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::::::::::(Shusu [1423] Trans. Matsushita, 1974)&lt;/poem&gt;

The painting and accompanying poems capture both the playfulness and the perplexing nature of Zen buddhist ''[[kōans]]'' which was supposed to aid the Zen practitioner in his meditation and was a central practice of the [[Rinzai]] school.

In the late Muromachi period, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries into the art world in general, as artists from the Kano school and the Ami school adopted the style and themes, but introducing a more plastic and decorative effect that would continue into modern times.

==[[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1573–1603)==
[[File:Hasegawa Tohaku - Pine Trees (Shōrin-zu byōbu) - left hand screen.jpg|thumb|250px|Left panel of the {{nihongo|''Pine Trees screen''|[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]|松林図 屏風}} by [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], c.1595]]

This period saw the rise of the [[Kanō school]] (狩野派 Kanō-ha?) which is one of the most famous schools of Japanese painting. The Kanō school of painting was the dominant style of painting until the Meiji period. It was founded by Kanō Masanobu (1434–1530), a contemporary of Sesshū and student of Shūbun who became an official painter in the Shogun's court. The artists who followed him including his son improved upon his style and methods. His son, [[Kanō Motonobu]] (1476–1559) established the Kano style as the main Japanese painting school during the Muromachi period.

In sharp contrast to the previous Muromachi period, the Azuchi Momoyama period was characterized by a grandiose polychrome style, with extensive use of [[gold]] and [[silver]] foil, and by works on a very large scale. [[Kanō school]] painters were patronized by [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and their followers. [[Kanō Eitoku]] developed a formula for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. These huge screens and wall paintings were commissioned to decorate the castles and palaces of the military nobility. This status continued into the subsequent Edo period, as the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] continued to promote the works of the Kanō school as the officially sanctioned art for the ''[[shōgun]]'', ''[[daimyō]]s'', and [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial court]]. The rise of the Kanō school saw a beginning of a move away from buddhist themes, as Kano school patrons commissioned paintings of a more secular nature to decorate their palaces.

However some painters in this period continued to look back to the Buddhist priest-painters which had initially influenced the Kano school. One of these painters was [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], who was influenced by the monochrome ink paintings of the Muromachi painter [[Sesshū]] and developed his own style of [[Sumi-e]] which looked back to the minimalism of its predecessors. Tōhaku was in fact so much enamored with the techniques of [[Sesshū Tōyō]] that he attempted to claim rights as his fifth successor, though he lost in a court battle to [[Unkoku Togan]].&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"&gt;[http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html HASEGAWA Tohaku (1539–1610)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208192923/http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html |date=2009-12-08 }} Mibura-Dera Temple Website. 10 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the influence of Sesshū is evident in many of Tōhaku's mid to late works, such as his famous {{nihongo|''[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]''|松林図 屏風|extra2=Pine Trees screen}}, which were declared a [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasure of Japan]] are argued to be the first paintings of their scale to depict only pine trees as subject matter.&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"/&gt;

The school founded by Hasegawa Tōhaku is known today as the [[Hasegawa school]]. This school was small, consisting mostly of Tōhaku and his sons. However small, its members conserved Tōhaku's quiet and reserved aesthetic, which many attribute to the influence of [[Sesshū]] as well as his contemporary and friend, [[Sen no Rikyū]]. It is suspected that these simple aesthetics protest the usage of intimidation and wealth rampant in the [[Kanō school]].&lt;ref&gt;Moes, Robert D.. "The Other Side of Tōhaku". Occasional Papers No. 11(1969): 3–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zen art===
Under the Zen sect of Buddhism, which became very popular in Japan in the 14th and 15th centuries, portraits of Zen priests were often produced. Zen was a sect of Buddhism which promoted simplicity and less involved in worship, so religious paintings were not needed for this reason. Instead, Zen priests often painted images of teachers and Zen masters. Unlike in the earlier Heian period, where it had been considered "rude in Heian times to copy a person's likeness"{{attribution needed|date=January 2018}} (Stanley-Baker 2000, 115), the Zen portraits were close-up portraits showing facial features and details. A portrait of [[Zen Teacher/Zen Master|Zen master]] Muso Kokushi painted by his student Muto Shui, shows a detailed portrait of the face, with the whole picture being only a head and shoulders portrait. This is unlike earlier Japanese painting which would depict people as much smaller figures. Zen priests also painted landscapes, such as the [[Ink and wash painting|suiboku-ga]], or water and black ink painting, which was inspired by Zen doctrine.

==Architecture==
Buddhism exerted tremendous influence on [[Japanese art]] in a variety of ways and through many periods of Japanese history. [[Buddhist temples]] with their halls and five-story towers were built all over Japan, and huge sculptures of Buddha were made for these temples.

The '''Center for Microbial Oceanography''' ('''C-MORE''') is a research and education organization established in 2006 as a [[National Science Foundation]] funded Science and Technology Center.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc/2006.jsp NSF: Science and Technology Centers Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
It has been said that more is known about the surface of the moon than about the Earth’s oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Kettlewell, Julianna.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3210544.stm "Ocean census discovers new fish"], ''BBC'', October 23, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; C-MORE was designed to explore the largely unknown world of [[microorganisms]] in the sea and to educate the public and other scientists about these organisms. The motto of the center is “From [[genomes]] to [[biomes]]” meaning that the researchers want to look at how the [[Biodiversity|diversity]] of microbes in the ocean influences the [[structure]] and [[Function (biology)|function]] of the world’s largest biome, the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, Tim.[http://currents.ucsc.edu/06-07/08-14/microbes.asp "UCSC collaborates in interdisciplinary center to study marine microbes"], ''UC Santa Cruz Currents online'', August 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The center was initially proposed, and is now directed by Professor [[David Karl]], of the [[University of Hawai'i at Manoa]].  C-MORE has affiliated researchers working at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]], [[Oregon State University]], the [[University of California Santa Cruz]], the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]], and the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]].  C-MORE is the only one of NSF’s 17 Science and Technology Centers that focuses on [[Environmental microbiology|microbial oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc/documents.jsp NSF: Science and Technology Centers Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
C-MORE scientists want to understand biological processes that begin at microscopic scales and are expressed in vitally significant issues such as [[climate change]].  Areas of research range from [[genomic]] surveys, to studies of the genetic basis of marine microbial [[biogeochemistry]] to building [[ecosystem models]].&lt;ref&gt;AP.[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/08/03/hawaii_gets_19_million_for_oceanography_center/ "Hawaii gets $19 million for oceanography center"], ''Boston.com'', August 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;   One of the strengths of the Center is its seagoing capability, as well as the long term studies that have been conducted by the [[Hawaii Ocean Time-series]] (HOT) Program in the [[North Pacific Subtropical Gyre]].  In addition to extensive laboratory experimentation, C-MORE also stages cruises to examine marine microbes in their environment.  One example was the [[SUPER HI-CAT]] cruise, which was the first effort to study the microbiology associated with the plastic particles in the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

==Education==

The '''Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques (CIRM)''' is a mathematics research institute associated with the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS) and the [[Société Mathématique de France]] (SMF). It is located in Luminy, Marseille, France and is affiliated with [[Aix-Marseille University]]. CIRM hosts weekly workshops on diverse topics where mathematicians and scientists from all over the world come to do collaborative research. Modeled as a "[[Medici villas|villa Medici]] of mathematics", it receives around 3,500 visitors per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lis|first1=Louise|title=Dans la villa Médicis des maths|url=https://lejournal.cnrs.fr/articles/dans-la-villa-medicis-des-maths|website=Le journal|publisher=Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|accessdate=9 July 2017|language=fr|date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1954, a report from the CNRS discussed potential sites for a meeting place to hold international seminars and workshops in mathematics similar to the [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach|Mathematisches Forschunginstitut Oberwolfach]]. The Luminy estate, formerly owned by the prominent [[Fabre Line|Fabre]] shipping family, was chosen in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bit of History|url=http://www.cirm-math.com/a-bit-of-history.html|website=Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate was handed over to the SMF in 1979. The center opened in 1981 and the first workshop was held in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Contrucci|first1=Jean|title=Le Centre international de rencontres mathématiques a été inauguré à Marseille|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1981/06/24/le-centre-international-de-rencontres-mathematiques-a-ete-inaugure-a-marseille_2729406_1819218.html|accessdate=9 July 2017|work=Le Monde|date=24 June 1981|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific programs==
CIRM supports a variety of residential programs and workshops. Each year, CIRM runs around 35 week-long workshops with an average of 75 weekly participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Propose an event|url=http://www.cirm-math.com/propose-an-event.html|website=Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIRM also supports joint programs with [[Société de Mathématiques Appliquées et Industrielles]], [[Institut Henri Poincaré]], and [[Société Mathématique de France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Centre d’Eté Mathématique de Recherche Avancée en Calcul Scientifique|url=http://smai.emath.fr/spip.php?article51&amp;lang=fr|website=Societe de Mathematiques Appliquees et Industrielles|accessdate=9 July 2017|language=fr|date=24 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean-Morlet Chair===
CIRM hosts the Jean-Morlet Chair, which is a six-month residential program for international researchers to collaborate with a local project leader from [[Aix-Marseille University]] to plan events and projects. The chair was named after [[Jean Morlet]], a French geophysicist who worked with Marseille-based researcher [[Alex Grossman]], among others, to develop the [[Wavelet transform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jean-Morlet Chair|url=http://www.chairejeanmorlet.com/|website=Chaire Jean-Morlet|publisher=Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past chairs have included Nicola Kistler, Boris Hasselblatt, Igor Shparlinski, [[Hans Georg Feichtinger]], Herwig Hauser, Francois Lalonde, [[Dipendra Prasad]], [[Mariusz Lemańczyk]], [[Konstantin Khanin]], Shigeki Akiyama, and Genevieve Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Semester Chairs|url=http://www.chairejeanmorlet.com/semesters.html|website=Chaire Jean-Morlet|publisher=Centre International de Recontres Mathematiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2968">[[Image:Qinnotation.png|thumb|Chinese [[Guqin notation]], 1425]]

Systems of [[musical notation]] have been in use in [[China]] for over two thousand years. Different systems have been used to record music for bells and for the ''[[guqin]]'' stringed instrument. More recently a system of numbered notes (''[[Numbered musical notation|jianpu]]'') has been used, with resemblances to Western notations.

== Ancient ==
The earliest known examples of text referring to music in China are inscriptions on musical instruments found in the Tomb of [[Marquess|Marquis]] Yi of Zeng (d. 433 B.C.). Sets of 41 chimestones and 65 bells bore lengthy inscriptions concerning pitches, scales, and transposition. The bells still sound the pitches that their inscriptions refer to. Although no notated musical compositions were found, the inscriptions indicate that the system was sufficiently advanced to allow for musical notation. Two systems of pitch nomenclature existed, one for relative pitch and one for absolute pitch. For relative pitch, a [[solmization]] system was used.&lt;ref&gt;Bagley, Robert (2004). "[http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/2004/abstracts/2004-bagley.htm The Prehistory of Chinese Music Theory]" (''Elsley Zeitlyn Lecture on Chinese Archaeology and Culture''), ''Britac.ac.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Guqin'' notations==
The tablature of the ''[[guqin]]'' is unique and complex. The older form is composed of written words describing how to play a melody step-by-step using the plain language of the time, i.e. ''descriptive notation'' ([[Classical Chinese]]).  

The newer form of ''guqin'' notation is composed of bits of Chinese characters put together to indicate the method of play is called ''prescriptive notation''. Rhythm is only vaguely indicated in terms of phrasing. Tablatures for the ''qin'' are collected in what is called ''[[qinpu]]''.

== ''Gongche'' notation ==
''[[Gongche notation]]'', dating from the [[Tang dynasty]], used Chinese characters for the names of the scale.

== ''Jianpu'' (numbered musical notation) ==
The ''[[Numbered musical notation|jianpu]]'' system of notation (probably an adaptation of a French Galin-Paris-Cheve system) had gained widespread acceptance by 1900. It uses a movable ''do'' system, with the scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 standing for ''do'', ''re'', ''mi'', ''fa'', ''sol'', ''la'', ''si''. Dots above or below a numeral indicate the octave of the note it represents. Key signatures, barlines, and time signatures are also employed. Many symbols from Western standard notation, such as bar lines, time signatures, accidentals, tie and slur, and the expression markings are also used. The number of dashes following a numeral represents the number of crotchets (quarter notes) by which the note extends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23488">The '''Conservation of South Asian household shrines''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation of [[Shrine|household shrines]] from [[South Asia]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]], held by either museums or private collectors, this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]. South Asian shrines held in museum collections around the world are principally shrines relate to [[Hinduism|Hindu,]] [[Jainism|Jain,]] or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] households. Due to their original use and sacred nature, these shrines present unique [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] challenges for those tasked with their care.

==Household shrines==
===Usage===
[[File:Svu kerala.jpg|thumb|A modern Srividya adept performs Tantric puja at his home shrine. Kerala, India, 2006.]]
In all three of these religions, daily ritual devotion is a central aspect.&lt;ref name="BCentre"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Buddhism?|url=https://thebuddhistcentre.com/buddhism|website=The Buddhist Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AsianArt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Worship of the Goddess in South Asia|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/worship-goddess-south-asia|website=Asian Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrines facilitate this practice by offering a sacred space within the home, serving as a focal point for [[meditation]] and [[Offering (Buddhism)|offerings]] to the gods and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] ones. Daily rituals at household shrines can take many forms, but often feature some of the following practices: meditation and/or [[prayer]],&lt;ref name="BCentre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt; ritual bathing of sculptures in water, anointing with oils,&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Samuel K.|title=Renovation, Disposal, and Conservation of  Hindu Temples and Images:  The Institutionalization of Creativity in South Indian and American Art Worlds|journal=Museum Anthropology Review|date=Fall 2009|volume=3|issue=2|pages=107–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; lighting of candles or burning of [[incense]],&lt;ref name="BCentre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JainCenter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Traditions|url=http://www.nyjaincenter.org/Traditions|website=Jain Center of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offering of flowers and/or food. Devotional practices vary not only from religion to religion, but also from person to person. The above list contains common actions, but the form of daily ritual is set by the individual. 
===Appearance and materials===
Shrines for household use vary in size, from simple tabletop setups with room for a sculpture and a few offerings&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt; to full shrines taking up entire walls.&lt;ref name="Philly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conserving a Tibetan Altar|url=https://www.philamuseum.org/exhibitions/243.html|website=Philadelphia Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devotional items and smaller shrines are typically purchased ready-made, though wealthier households often commissioned elaborate custom shrines.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Jain Shrine from India|url=https://nelson-atkins.org/events/a-jain-shrine-from-india/|website=Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though primarily made of wood and paint, household shrines sometimes feature extra adornment such as [[gold leaf]]&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WRV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Butsudan|url=http://www.wrvmuseum.org/journal/journal_ftbr_0799.htm|website=White River Journal: A Newsletter of the White River Valley Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; or leather fittings.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; In far Eastern countries, like [[China]] and [[Japan]], such shrines are often [[lacquer]]ed.&lt;ref name="WRV" /&gt;

==Damage and deterioration==
Household shrines can suffer damage from two overall sources: the materials used are at risk of deterioration particular to their nature, and the ways the shrines are used can cause specific types of wear and tear.

===Humidity=== 
As discussed, the majority of household shrines are made of painted wood, and both wood and paint are susceptible to the effects of humidity.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite book|title=NPS Museum Handbook: Appendix N, Curatorial Care of Wooden Objects|date=2002|publisher=National Park Service|pages=N1-N28|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/Appendix%20N.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterthur"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections|date=2009|publisher=The Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum, Inc.|location=Delaware|isbn=0-912724-52-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the [[relative humidity]] of the wood’s environment can cause it to swell (in increased humidity) or shrink (in decreased humidity). Extreme or prolonged swelling can result in [[Wood warping|warping]], while excess shrinkage can lead to cracks, particularly around nail or screw holes.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; In addition to damaging the wood, fluctuations in humidity can also deteriorate paint and other surface decoration: changes in humidity can result in loosening, flaking, and cracking paint.&lt;ref name="Getty"&gt;{{cite book|title=Painted Wood: History and Conservation; Part Four: Investigations and Treatment|date=1998|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute Publications|pages=278–397|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/paintedwood4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold leaf can dissolve in water, especially if applied with a water-soluble adhesive.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Lacquer, a layer of shellac creating a clear, hardened surface, can delaminate from the underlying paint and wood layers if changes in humidity cause the wood to flex too much.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

===Pests===
[[Pest (organism)|Pests]] can be attracted to the wood itself, or, in the case of shrines, to the offerings that are left on it. [[Insects]] feed on wood or burrow into it to build nests, weakening the structure and causing unsightly holes.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; The types of insects vary by region, but can include species of ants, bees, or termites.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; [[Fungi]] also feed on wood, albeit on a smaller scale, and depending on the type can cause everything from discoloration to disintegration.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

A family shrine is in less danger of [[rat]]s than the presence of food would lead one to believe, as the offerings are replaced on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; However, rats are attracted to food, and will gnaw through wood to get it,&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; leaving holes.

===Light===
Direct sunlight or artificial light, both present in a home environment, can bleach wood and paint colors and, over a long period of time, weaken or deteriorate the wood’s cellular structure.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

===Pollutants===
Humans are, unfortunately, a source of [[pollutant]]s that can damage a family shrine. Touching the surface can leave behind oils, salts, and acids present in skin, which over time can build up on the shrine and cause staining and surface erosion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[Dirt]] and [[dust]], if not frequently removed, can scratch and erode the wood.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Ancient shrines have been found buried and accumulated significant damage from being encased in the soil.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; The most common pollutant for home shrines, particular in Buddhist households, is [[smoke]]: burning incense or candles is a standard component of daily prayer, and the smoke blackens the shrine over time.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Superficial burns to the wood, though unlikely, are also possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Preventative conservation==
Protecting household shrines from further deterioration requires considering each of the agents of decay in terms of the activities of storage, handling, and display.

===Storage===
The ideal relative humidity for wooden objects is 50%; museums aim to keep the environment’s relative humidity within a few percentage points of this target; typically with no more than 10% fluctuation within a 24 hour period.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; A stable [[Temperature|temperature]] is also considered preferable, as any fluctuations directly affects relative humidity.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Conservators use an [[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated Pest Management]] policy to reduce the threats of pests and vermin to collections, pest eradication processes are carefully selected to take into account the sacred nature of the shrines. For some religious groups, certain pest control methods such as freezing and anoxia are considered just as deadly to the sacred nature of the object as to pests;&lt;ref name="Paine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paine|first1=Crispin|title=Religious Objects in Museums: Private Lives and Public Duties|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for sacred and culturally sensitive objects|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/care-objects/indigenous-materials/caring-sacred-culturally-sensitive-objects.html|website=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, they should not be undertaken if the appropriate religious community forbids them. Lights should only be used when needed, and should be kept as dim as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Frequent careful cleanings, combined with dust covers, will reduce the danger of pollutants.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Cleaning should be done with a soft cotton cloth or cosmetic brush, and a mild [[detergent]] and water if necessary.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt;

===Handling===
Best practice in museum handling of collection objects, such as shrines, dictates that objects be moved as little as possible. Shrines are frequently large, with intricate carvings, and there is significant risk of breakage through moving them.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;  When handling or moving is necessary, it is done with careful planning - gloves, typically [[nitrile]] or cotton, are worn to prevent transferring pollutants on the hands to the shrine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Display===
Lighting presents an additional challenge, since the object must be visible to viewers. Lights are kept as low as possible while still being bright enough to allow visitors to navigate the room and see the shrine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Sometimes lights will only be turned on when the shrine display is open to the public.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[UV filter]]s are typically installed on artificial lights and window glass to prevent UV light from sun causing damage.

==Treatment==
===Research===
Due to the religious nature of household shrines, in addition to determining the extent of the damage, [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] professionals advocate researching the spiritual nature of the shrine before restoration work begins. A recommended starting point is to ask why something is being conserved.&lt;ref name="WAAC"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Conservator's Approach to Sacred Art|journal=WAAC Newsletter|date=September 1995|volume=17|issue=3|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn17/wn17-3/wn17-310.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple approaches to conservation and restoration, and this initial question is a preferred guideline for deciding which approach to take. There are two possible approaches to restoration of household religious objects: materials-based and values-based.&lt;ref name="Jakobi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuh Jakobi|first1=Davina|title=Choices and Decision-making in Conservation: The Implications of Conserving Religious Icons|journal=Tropos|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=14–25|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1420196/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials-based restoration refers simply to fixing what is broken: the materials are damaged, so they will be fixed.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; Values-based restoration is concerned with preserving the “intangible” qualities of an object—in this case, its religious properties.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; This approach involves not removing evidence of use on the object as long as it is not contributing to its deterioration.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; Values-based is the approach most often argued for, but it is noted that a combination of the two types is frequently the most appropriate.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt;

===Wood restoration===
Wood restoration can be an invasive process: to repair warping, for example, shallow cuts are often made in the surface of the wood to allow it to be pulled back into its original position and secured in place.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt; Cracks can be filled with adhesive to both disguise them and prevent them from expanding,&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt; while holes or missing pieces are typically patched with [[replica]] parts.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Wood that has been bleached may be [[Wood stain|re-stained]] or inpainted to match the undamaged areas.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

===Paint restoration===
Loosened or flaking paint can be consolidated by injecting it with adhesive.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Scratches can be [[Inpainting|inpainted]],&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation and Care of Museum Collections|date=2011|publisher=MFA Publications|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-87846-729-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or repainted to reduce their appearance. Painted surfaces may be carefully cleaned with [[solvent]]s to ensure that only the grime is removed and not the paint layer underneath.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Lacquer that has delaminated from the paint layer may be glued back into place.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

==Ethics==
===Conflicting ideals===
Conservation and museum display of religious objects, like household shrines, represents two [[Ideology|ideologies]] in conflict. [[Museum]]s are secular spaces, and restoration is secular work, but family shrines are sacred.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Imogen|title=Exhibiting the Exotic, Simulating the Sacred: Tibetan Shrines at British and American Museums|journal=Ateliers d'Anthropologie|date=2016|volume=43|url=http://journals.openedition.org/ateliers/10300#text}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[education]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]]-focused missions of museums and conservators are inherently at odds with the religious, family, and social functions of household altars.&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=Ronald|title=Sacred objects in museum spaces|journal=Studies in Religion|date=December 1, 1992|volume=21|issue=4|pages=419–460|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000842989202100404?journalCode=sira}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoring a shrine for museum display and putting it on [[Exhibition|exhibit]] affects its function: it becomes art to those outside its subject religion,&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; but to adherents it can retain its status as an object of veneration even after being removed from its original context.&lt;ref name="Caple"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caple|first1=Chris|title=Conservation Skills: Judgement, Method and Decision Making|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-18880-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to these differing principles that affect how a shrine is perceived, religious communities may have restrictions on what actions are appropriate for storage, restoration, and exhibition.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caple" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadongei|first1=Alyce|title=What about Sacred Objects?|journal=WAAC Newsletter|date=May 2006|volume=28|issue=2|pages=14–15|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn28/wn28-2/wn28-205.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Buddhist writings and inscriptions show evidence of ongoing upkeep on ancient shrines and [[temple]]s, indicating a prescription within the faith to maintain holy objects.&lt;ref name="ICCROM"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Conservation of Living Religious Heritage|journal=ICCROM Conservation Studies|date=2003|url=https://www.iccrom.org/sites/default/files/ICCROM_ICS03_ReligiousHeritage_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jainic texts indicate that building a new shrine gives karmic reward, but a larger karmic reward is given for restoring an old shrine.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Hinduism, by contrast, commands that shrines and statues be worthy receptacles for the gods: if they become damaged, some Hindu groups believe, they should be ritually destroyed and replaced.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism not only vary from each other in their approaches to restoration, but groups and individuals within the religions may differ as well. As such, ethical standards state that the conservation methods undertaken for one object should not be applied to another, however similar, without consultation with the source religious community.&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;

===Consultation and care===
====Traditional care====
Multiple conservation organizations, including the [[Western Association for Art Conservation]] (WAAC) and the International Centre for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments (ICCROM), state that a goal of conservation is to preserve the intangible qualities of an object as well as the tangible, physical qualities.&lt;ref name="WAAC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICCROM" /&gt; To fully understand these intangible qualities, consultation with members of the religious community is necessary.

In addition to the preventative conservation methods described earlier, consultation with religious communities may disclose traditional or ritual care practices that the subject religion requires for sacred objects.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; These measure could include directives on how objects can be stored, who can handle them, and what—if any—restorative measures can be taken.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; Ritual care has the potential to prescribe religious practices to museum staff members who are not adherents of the subject religion; to avoid this, a recommended practice is active practice and passive accommodation: active practice refers to actions and behaviors with the object that can only be undertaken by a knowledgeable practitioner, while passive accommodation refers to the museum staff allowing the practitioner to conduct the practice within the museum space.&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt; Conservators and other museum professionals should be prepared to conduct restoration best practices within the confines of what the religious representatives allow.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAAC" /&gt;

====Varying approaches====
Museum and conservation professionals take several different stances on how best to approach the care of religious objects. [[The Victoria and Albert Museum]] in the United Kingdom, for example, provides all of its staff conservators with an Ethics Checklist that, among other measures, prescribes consultation with a number of interested parties before conservation begins, and asks conservators to consider how their actions will affect the “identity and significance of the object(s)”.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Appendix 1: Victoria &amp; Albert Museum Conservation Department Ethics Checklist|journal=Conservation Journal|date=Summer 2005|issue=50|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-50/appendix-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Government of Canada]] promotes an imperative of “respectful care”, wherein conservators fit their best practices into standards of care required by cultural representatives.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt; ICCROM takes an even more culturally-centered approach, stating that the entire conservation process, including the decision to conserve, should originate with and be directed by the source religious community.&lt;ref name="ICCROM" /&gt; Others suggest that consultation can go both ways, with religious representatives educating conservationists on proper care of the shrines, while conservationists can education the faithful on what their work entails to ensure that no boundaries are overstepped.&lt;ref name="Cotte"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cotte|first1=Sabine|title=Reflections Around the Conservation of Sacred Thangkas|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|url=https://www.jcms-journal.com/articles/10.5334/jcms.1021207/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an exhibition standpoint, some recommend advocating for the religious aspects of these objects by creating more immersive museum displays that promote and explain the devotional qualities of the shrines instead of reducing them to aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Grimes" /&gt; The WAAC, for its part, advocates presenting the source community with all possible options regarding care and treatment of the object in question and letting the final decision rest with the community.&lt;ref name="WAAC" /&gt; As this illustrates, although the bulk of museum and conservation organizations recommend consultation with religious representatives, as yet there is no complete consensus on the best ways to ethically care for and restore religious objects.

==Case studies==
===Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art===
The [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] spent more than a year restoring a Jain household shrine that had been in storage for over 70 years.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Analysis of the shrine revealed two paint layers underneath the surface dirt: the original layer from the 16th century, and a later coating from the 1800s.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; The decision was made by the conservators to remove only the surface grime and not attempt to remove the later paint layer: Jainism gives greater spiritual reward for restoring an old shrine than building a new one, so the conservators opted not to undo the spiritual work of the individual(s) who did the 1800s repainting.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; The shrine has been on display in the Nelson-Atkins Asian Art gallery since 2014.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;

===Philadelphia Museum of Art===
The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] acquired a one-hundred-year-old Tibetan home altar in 2004.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; At the time of acquisition, [[soot]] and oil from incense and lamp burning had built up on the surface.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; Consulting with Tibetan Buddhist sources revealed that such surface grime, though a direct result of ritual, is not in and of itself religiously significant and thus was safe to remove.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; The altar is on display in the museum’s Asian Art gallery.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt;

===Newark Museum===
The [[Newark Museum]] is also in possession of a Tibetan Buddhist altar; however, this one was built for the museum after the ritual destruction of a shrine dating from 1935.&lt;ref name="Newark"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhist Altar|url=https://www.newarkmuseum.org/tibetan-buddhist-altar|website=Newark Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; That shrine had also been built as a display piece for the museum and was never [[Consecration|consecrated]], but the presence of Tibetan ritual objects surrounding it had, in the opinion of religious representatives, sanctified the altar nonetheless.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; When the decision was made to replace it, a deconsecration ceremony was held by a Buddhist official, and the shrine was dismantled.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; The new shrine was designed and built by a Tibetan artist.&lt;ref name="Newark" /&gt;

'''Doris Duke''' (November 22, 1912 – October 28, 1993) was an American [[Beneficiary|heiress]], [[socialite]], [[horticulturalist]], [[art collector]], and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]].

The daughter of a wealthy tobacco tycoon, Duke was able to fund a life of global travel and wide-ranging interests. These extended across journalism, competition surfing, jazz piano, wildlife conservation, Oriental art and [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].

Much of her work centered on her father's estate at [[Hillsborough Township, New Jersey]], where she created many elaborately-themed gardens, furnished with artifacts acquired on her world travels, including one of America's largest indoor botanical displays. She was also active in preserving more than 80 historic buildings in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

Twice divorced, Duke enjoyed a colorful private life that was seldom out of the gossip columns.

Her philanthropic work in [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] research, medicine, and child welfare continued into her old age, some of it unknown to the public during her lifetime, and her estimated $1.3 billion fortune was largely left to charity. After much legal challenging of the executors and trustees, Duke's legacy is now administered by the [http://ddcf.org Doris Duke Charitable Foundation], dedicated to medical research, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, the performing arts, wildlife and ecology.

==Early life==
Duke was born in New York City, the only child of [[tobacco]] and [[hydroelectric power]] tycoon [[James Buchanan Duke]] and his second wife, Nanaline Holt Inman, widow of Dr. William Patterson Inman.{{sfn|Valentine|1987|p=9}} At his death in 1925, the elder Duke's will bequeathed the majority of his estate to his wife and daughter,&lt;ref name=jbdukewill&gt;{{cite news |title=James B.

Duke spent her early childhood at [[Duke Farms]], her father's {{convert|2700|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate in [[Hillsborough Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=suitsettled&gt;{{cite news |title=Girl of 14 to Run 3,000 Acre Estate | work = [[The New York Times]] |date=September 25, 1927 |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |page=E1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1927/09/25/archives/girl-of-14-to-run-3000acre-estate-daughter-of-the-late-james-b-duke.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to ambiguity in James Duke's will, a lawsuit was filed to prevent auctions and outright sales of real estate he had owned; in effect, Doris Duke successfully sued her mother and other executors to prevent the sales.&lt;ref name=suitsettled/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Schwarz | first = Ted  | title = Trust No One: The Glamorous Life and Bizarre Death of Doris Duke  | publisher = Vivisphere Publishing  | year = 1997   | isbn = 978-1-892323-17-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the pieces of real estate in question was [[James B. Duke House|a Manhattan mansion at 1 East 78th Street]]&lt;ref name=suitsettled/&gt; which later became the home of the [[Institute of Fine Arts]] at [[New York University]].

She was presented to society as a [[debutante]] in 1930, aged 18, at a ball at [[Rough Point]], the family residence in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Doris Duke Feted at Newport Dance | work = [[The New York Times]] |date= August 24, 1930 |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |page=N8 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/08/24/archives/doris-duke-feted-at-newport-dance-daughter-of-mrs-james-b-duke-is.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received large bequests from her father's will when she turned 21, 25, and 30; she was sometimes referred to as the "world's richest girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Doris Duke World's Richest Girl at Stroke of Midnight |date=November 21, 1933 |publisher=Washington Post |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police Guard Richest Girl |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=4 |date=January 22, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother died in 1962, leaving her jewelry and a coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=US News |work=[[Time Magazine]] |date=June 29, 1962 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897953,00.html |quote=All but passed over in the latest parceling was Skipper's Aunt Doris Duke—Nanaline's daughter—already worth an estimated $70 million, who was merely bequeathed some of her mother's jewelry.

==Adult life==
When Duke came of age, she used her wealth to pursue a variety of interests, including extensive world travel and the arts. During [[World War II]], she worked in a canteen for sailors in [[Egypt]], taking a [[One-dollar salary|salary of one dollar a year]].&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news |author=Pace, Eric |title=Doris Duke, 80, Heiress Whose Great Wealth Couldn't Buy Happiness, Is Dead |work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 28, 1993 |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/29/obituaries/doris-duke-80-heiress-whose-great-wealth-couldn-t-buy-happiness-is-dead.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke French fluently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventory of the Doris Duke Papers, 1798-2003 and undated (Duke University Libraries)|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/uadukedoris|website=Library.duk.edu|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Duke began a short-lived career as a foreign correspondent for the [[International News Service]], reporting from different cities across the war-ravaged Europe. After the war, she moved to Paris and wrote for the magazine ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''.

While living in Hawaii, Duke became the first non-Hawaiian woman to take up competitive surfing under the tutelage of surfing champion and Olympic swimmer [[Duke Kahanamoku]] and his brothers.&lt;ref name=pony/&gt; A lover of animals, in particular her dogs and pet camels, in her later years Duke became a [[wildlife refuge]] supporter, an environmental conservationist, and a patron of historic preservation.

Duke's interest in [[horticulture]] led to a friendship with [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author and scientific farmer [[Louis Bromfield]], who operated Malabar Farm, his country home in [[Lucas, Ohio|Lucas]], [[Ohio]] in [[Richland County, Ohio|Richland County]]. Today, his farm is part of [[Malabar Farm State Park]], made possible by a donation from Duke that helped purchase the property after Bromfield's death. A section of woods there is dedicated to her and bears her name.

At age 46, Duke started to create [[Duke Gardens (New Jersey)|Duke Gardens]], an exotic public-display garden, to honor her father James Buchanan Duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.njskylands.com/atdukgar.htm|title=The Gardens at Duke Farms| publisher=Skylands Visitor Guide|accessdate=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She extended new [[greenhouse]]s from the [[Horace Trumbauer]] conservatory&lt;ref name="New Greenhouse"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=282|title=New Greenhouse | publisher=Duke Farms|accessdate=May 7, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622073346/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=282 |archivedate = June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; at her home in [[Duke Farms]], New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=4|title=History | publisher=Duke Farms|accessdate=February 11, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111134008/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=4 |archivedate = January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the eleven interconnected gardens was a full-scale re-creation of a garden theme, country or period, inspired by DuPont's [[Longwood Gardens]]. She designed the architectural, artistic and botanical elements of the displays based on observations from her extensive international travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://wirednewyork.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3779|title=A Great Estate Opens Its Gates| publisher=wired|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also labored on their installation, sometimes working 16-hour days.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; Display construction began in 1958.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=300}}

Duke had learned to play the piano at an early age and developed a lifelong appreciation of [[jazz]] and befriended jazz musicians. She also liked [[gospel music]] and sang in a gospel choir.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 1966, Duke was behind the wheel of a rented car when it lurched forward and crushed interior designer [[Eduardo Tirella]] as he was opening the gates of the mansion they were restoring in Newport, Rhode Island. While it was ruled a freak accident by the police, Tirella's family sued and won $75,000 when Duke was found negligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McPhillips|first=Jody|last2=MacKay|first2=Scott|title=Doris Duke had it all -- and now her foundation is giving a lot back|url=http://www.projo.com/specials/century/month9/0961.htm|accessdate=March 22, 2011|newspaper=The Providence Journal|date=September 26, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homes===
[[File:Italian Garden at Duke Gardens.jpg|thumb|Duke created the Italian Garden to showcase sculptures that her father had collected, such as this replica of Canova's Three Graces]]
Duke acquired a number of homes. Her principal residence and official domicile&lt;ref name="courttv.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html |title=court TV becomes truTV |publisher=Courttv.com |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914172504/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html |archivedate=September 14, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Duke Farms]], her father's 2,700 acre (11&amp;nbsp;km²) estate in [[Hillsborough Township, New Jersey]]. Here she created [[Duke Gardens (New Jersey)|Duke Gardens]], {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} public indoor botanical display that were among the largest in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Garmey  | first = Jane   | title = Doris Duke's Storied Gardens Are No More  | newspaper = Wall Street Journal  | pages =   | date = May 28, 2008   | accessdate = May 28, 2008  | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121192910041724297#  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke's other residences were private during her lifetime: she spent summer weekends working on her [[Newport Restoration Foundation]] projects while staying at [[Rough Point]], the 49-room English manor-style mansion that she inherited in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=364}}

Winters were spent at an estate she built in the 1930s and named "[[Shangri La (Doris Duke)|Shangri La]]" in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]];{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=210}} and at "[[Falcon Lair]]" in [[Beverly Hills, California]],{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=270}} once the home of [[Rudolph Valentino]]. She also maintained two apartments in [[Manhattan]]: a 9-room penthouse with a {{convert|1000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} veranda at 475 Park Avenue that is currently owned by journalist [[Cindy Adams]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Swanson|first1=Carl|title=Only on Park Avenue, Kids|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=June 5, 2000|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/realestate/features/3364}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another apartment near [[Times Square]] that she used exclusively as an office for the management of her financial affairs.

She purchased her own [[Boeing 737]] jet and redecorated the interior to travel between homes and on her trips to collect art and plants. The plane included a bedroom decorated to resemble a bedroom in a real house. Doris Duke had difficulty remaining in one place, and whenever she arrived somewhere, she had the desire to go somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aimeedeheeren.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110142857/http://www.aimeedeheeren.com/ |archivedate=January 10, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke was a hands-on homeowner, climbing a ladder to a three-story scaffolding to clean tile murals in the courtyard of Shangri La,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Kam |first1=Nadine |title=Fantasyland |newspaper=Honolulu Star Bulletin |date=November 3, 2002 |url=http://starbulletin.com/2002/11/03/features/story1.htm |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AFantasyland&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2002&amp;as_yhi=2002&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |df=mdy }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and working side by side with her gardeners at Duke Farms.

Three of Duke's residences are currently managed by subsidiaries of the [[Doris Duke Charitable Foundation]] and allow limited public access. Duke Farms in New Jersey is managed by the Duke Farms Foundation; a video tour of former Duke Gardens is available. Rough Point was deeded to the [[Newport Restoration Foundation]] in 1999 and opened to the public in 2000. Tours are limited to 12 people. Shangri-La is operated by the [[Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art]]; small personal tours and an online virtual tour are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shangrilahawaii.org/page.asp?pageId=5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619070048/http://www.shangrilahawaii.org/page.asp?pageId=5 |date=June 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
[[File:James H. R. and Doris Cromwell.jpg|thumb|Duke with then husband [[James H. R. Cromwell]] in January 1940]]
Duke married twice, the first time in 1935 to [[James H. R. Cromwell]], the son of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] society doyenne Eva Stotesbury.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=132}} Cromwell, a [[New Deal]] advocate like his wife, used her fortune to finance his political career. In 1940 he served several months as U.S. Ambassador to Canada and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The couple had a daughter, Arden, who died one day after her birth.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=257}} They divorced in 1943.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|pages=199, 213–14}}

On September 1, 1947, while in Paris, Duke became the third wife of [[Porfirio Rubirosa]], a diplomat from the [[Dominican Republic]].{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=232}} She reportedly paid his second wife, actress [[Danielle Darrieux]], $1 million to agree to an uncontested divorce. Because of her great wealth, Duke's marriage to Rubirosa attracted the attention of the [[U.S. State Department]], which cautioned her against using her money to promote political agenda. Further, there was concern that in the event of her death, a foreign government could gain too much leverage. Therefore, Rubirosa had to sign a [[pre-nuptial agreement]]; during the marriage, though, she gave Rubirosa several million dollars in gifts, including a stable of polo ponies, sports cars, a converted [[B-25]] bomber, and, in the divorce settlement, a 17th-century house in Paris. One of Doris Duke's best friends was Brazilian socialite and "jetsetter" [[Aimée de Heeren]].

She reportedly had numerous affairs, with, among others, [[Duke Kahanamoku]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Alec Cunningham-Reid]], General [[George S. Patton]], [[Joe Castro (musician)|Joe Castro]], and [[Louis Bromfield]].{{efn|Duke had numerous lovers, as documented by biographer Stephanie Mansfield; these include Duke Kahanamoku{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=257}} and Errol Flynn.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=210}}{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=217}}{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|pages=229–31}}&lt;ref name=pony&gt;{{cite book|author=Pony Duke|title=Too Rich. Family Secrets of Doris Duke|publisher=HarperCollins, 1996|page=104ff|isbn=0-06-017218-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Duke posted a bail of $5,000,000 for her friend, former Philippine [[First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]] after the latter was arrested for racketeering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/03/world/doris-duke-offers-mrs-marcos-s-bail.html|title=DORIS DUKE OFFERS MRS. MARCOS'S BAIL|last=Bohlen|first=Celestine|date=1988-11-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-08|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 1992, at the age of 79, Duke had a [[Rhytidectomy|facelift]]. She began trying to walk while she was still heavily medicated and fell, breaking her hip. In January 1993, she underwent surgery for a knee replacement. She was hospitalized from February 2 to April 15. She underwent a second knee surgery in July of that year.

A day after returning home from this second surgery, she suffered a severe stroke. Doris Duke [[Harry Demopoulos#Duke Estate|died]] at her Falcon's Lair home on October 28, 1993, at the age of 80. The cause was progressive [[pulmonary edema]] resulting in [[cardiac arrest]], according to a spokesman.&lt;ref name="courttv.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

Duke was cremated 24 hours after her death and her executor, [[Bernard Lafferty (butler)|Bernard Lafferty]], scattered her ashes into the Pacific Ocean as her last will specified.&lt;ref name="courttv.com"/&gt;

==Net worth==
When Doris' father died, he left a fortune valued at $100 million,&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; with the largest share going to Duke and her mother. Nanaline was a shrewd businesswoman, often compared to [[Hetty Green]], and when she died in 1962, she left her daughter, then estimated to be worth $250 million, a fortune triple what J. B. had left her.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;

Duke also owned numerous shares in big-name companies, such as [[General Motors]], and had a large financial team of bankers and accountants to manage her holdings (since, despite rumors, Duke had little to no interest in money matters). In addition, Duke had a collection of artwork, which was said to include works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Monet, as well as her valuable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asia art and furniture. Also in Duke's collection were over 2,000 bottles of rare wine (worth over $5 million) and the extraordinary Duke collection of fine jewels. Her total net worth, including all property, was valued at $5.3 billion.

===Philanthropy===
Duke’s first major philanthropic act was to establish Independent Aid, Inc., in 1934, when she was 21 years old, in order to manage the many requests for financial assistance addressed to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Doris Duke Biographical History and Archival Collections (Duke University Libraries)| url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/collections/people/dorisduke/#item-14|website=Library.duk.edu|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, she established the [[Duke Gardens (New Jersey)|Duke Gardens]] Foundation to endow the public display gardens she started to create at Duke Farms. Her Foundation intended that Duke Gardens "reveal the interests and philanthropic aspirations of the Duke family, as well as an appreciation for other cultures and a yearning for global understanding.".&lt;ref name="New Greenhouse"/&gt; Duke Gardens were the center of a controversy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savedukegardens.org |title=Duke Gardens, Then and Now |publisher=www.SaveDukeGardens.org |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820103927/http://savedukegardens.org/ |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; over the decision by the trustees of the [[Doris Duke Charitable Foundation]] to close them on May 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Duke Farms Promotes "Greener" Future |publisher=Duke Farms |date=March 2, 2008 |url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=523 |language= |accessdate=April 14, 2008 |quote=it’s the final months of the gardens being on display in the greenhouses that have enchanted visitors since 1964 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328065214/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=523 |archivedate=March 28, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Duke created the [[Newport Restoration Foundation]] with the goal of [[historic preservation|preserving]] more than eighty colonial buildings in the town. Historic properties include [[Rough Point]], [[Samuel Whitehorne House]], [[Prescott Farm]], the Buloid-Perry House, the King's Arms Tavern, the Baptist Meetinghouse, and the  Cotton House. Seventy-one buildings are rented to tenants. Only five function as museums. She also funded the construction of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s ashram in India, [[The Beatles at Rishikesh|visited by the Beatles]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=NCH&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Gurus: A Woman of Many Worlds|first=Nancy Cooke|last= de Herrera|publisher=Blue Dolphin Publishing|year=1993|isbn=978-0-931892-49-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Duke's extensive travels led to an interest in a variety of cultures, and during her lifetime she amassed a considerable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asian art. After her death, numerous pieces were donated to The [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian Art Museum]] of San Francisco and the [[Walters Art Museum]] of Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tingley|first=Nancy|title=Doris Duke: The Southeast Asian Art Collection|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|pages=93–94|isbn=978-0-8248-2773-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke did much additional philanthropic work and was a major benefactor of medical research and child welfare programs. In the late 1980s, Duke donated $2 million to Duke University to be used for [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] research.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; Her foundation, Independent Aid, became the Doris Duke Foundation, which still exists as a private grant-making entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventory of the Doris Duke Foundation Records, 1934-2009 (Duke University Libraries)|accessdate=October 23, 2016|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/dorisdukefound|website=Library.duk.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation was established in 1996, supporting four national grant making programs and Doris Duke's three estates, [[Shangri La (Doris Duke)|Shangri La]], [[Rough Point]], and [[Duke Farms]].

===Trusts and wills===
Duke was the life beneficiary of two trusts created by her father, James Buchanan Duke, in 1917 and 1924. The income from the trusts was payable to any children after her death. In 1988, at the age of 75, Duke legally adopted a woman named Chandi Heffner, then a 35-year-old [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] devotee and sister of the third wife of billionaire [[Nelson Peltz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,164455,00.html |title=Sarandon to Play World's Richest Little Girl |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2005-08-02 |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke initially maintained that Heffner was the reincarnation of her only biological child Arden, who died soon after birth in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles/article15046.html|title=Top Three Inheritance Disputes|publisher=legalzoom|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two women had a falling out, and the final version of Duke's will specified that she did not wish Heffner to benefit from her father's trusts; she also negated the adoption. Despite the negation, after Duke's death, the estate's trustees settled a lawsuit brought by Heffner for $65 million.&lt;ref name="Top Three Inheritance Disputes"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles/article15046.html|title=Top Three Inheritance Disputes|publisher=legalzoom|accessdate=June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her final will, Duke left virtually all of her fortune to several existing and new charitable foundations. She appointed her butler, [[Bernard Lafferty]] born in [[Creeslough]], [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]], as executor of her estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-05/news/mn-61438_1_butler-made-wealthy-by-heiress|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Butler Made Wealthy by Heiress Dies|date=November 5, 1996|author=Lieberman, Paul|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lafferty appointed the US Trust company as corporate co-executor. Lafferty and Duke's friend Marion Oates Charles were named as her trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dukeminier|first=Jesse|title=Wills, Trusts, and Estates|publisher = Aspen Publishers|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However a number of lawsuits were filed against the will. At death, Duke's fortune was estimated at upwards of $1.2 billion.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; The best-known lawsuit&lt;ref name="nytimes1996"&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Natta|first=Dan|title=Deal Reached over the Estate of Doris Duke|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 11, 1996|accessdate=May 7, 2008|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5D91039F932A25757C0A960958260}}&lt;/ref&gt; was initiated by [[Harry Demopoulos]]. In an earlier will, Demopoulos had been named executor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/05/nyregion/bernard-lafferty-the-butler-for-doris-duke-dies-at-51.html|title=Bernard Lafferty the Butler for Doris Dukes Dies at 51|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and challenged Lafferty's appointment. Demopolous argued that Lafferty and his lawyers had cajoled a sick, sedated old woman into giving him control of her estate.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Even more sensational accusations were made by a nurse, Tammy Payette, who contended that Lafferty and a prominent Beverly Hills physician, Dr. Charles Kivowitz, had conspired to hasten Duke's death with morphine and Demerol.  In 1996, the year Lafferty died, the Los Angeles [[District Attorney]]'s office ruled there was no firm evidence of foul play.&lt;ref name="Top Three Inheritance Disputes"/&gt;

[[Duke University]] also filed suit, claiming entitlement to a larger share of the Duke assets than the $10 million provided in the will (although Duke's will also stated that any beneficiary who disputed its provisions should receive nothing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|title=Last Will of Duke, Section 19|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=September 10, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914172504/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|archivedate=September 14, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Litigation involving 40 lawyers at 10 different law firms tied up the Duke estate for nearly three years. New York courts ultimately removed Lafferty for using estate funds for his own support and US Trust for failing "to do anything to stop him."&lt;ref name="Top Three Inheritance Disputes"/&gt; The [[Surrogate Court]] of Manhattan overrode Duke's will and appointed new trustees from among those who had challenged it: [[Harry Demopoulos]]; J. Carter Brown (later also involved in overturning the will of [[Albert C. Barnes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barneswatch.org/menu_matisse.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116035542/http://www.barneswatch.org/menu_matisse.html |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;); Marion Oates Charles, the sole trustee from Duke's last will; James Gill, a lawyer; [[Nannerl O. Keohane]], president of Duke University; and [[John J. Mack]], president of [[Morgan Stanley]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1996"/&gt; The fees for their lawsuits exceeded $10 million, and were paid by the Duke estate. These trustees now control all assets of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which Doris Duke directed should support medical research, anti-vivisectionism, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, performance arts, wildlife, and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|title=Last Will of Doris Duke, Section 8|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=September 10, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914172504/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|archivedate=September 14, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DDCF also controls funding for the three separate foundations created to operate Duke's former homes: the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art, Duke Farms and Newport Restoration Foundation. The trustees have progressively reduced funding for these foundations, stating that Doris Duke's own works are "perpetuating the Duke family history of personal passions and conspicuous consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sudol |first=Valerie |title=Famed Duke Gardens To Become Ambitious 'Green' Lab |newspaper=Newhouse News Service |year=2008 |accessdate=May 6, 2008 |url=http://www.newhouse.com/famed-duke-gardens-to-become-ambitious-green-laboratory-4.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928021113/http://www.newhouse.com/famed-duke-gardens-to-become-ambitious-green-laboratory-4.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, these foundations have sold some assets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newportrestoration.com/pr/CarpetSale08.html|title=Sale of Rare Carpet to Benefit Newport Restoration Foundation Collections Fund|publisher=Newport Restoration Foundation|accessdate=June 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921162758/http://www.newportrestoration.com/pr/CarpetSale08.html|archive-date=September 21, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have closed Duke Gardens. Christie's, New York, published a heavily illustrated catalog of over 600 pages for its auction of "The Doris Duke Collection, sold to benefit the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation" which was held in New York City over three days in 2004.

==In popular culture==
Several biographies of Duke have been published, notably:

* Stephanie Mansfield's ''The Richest Girl in The World'' (Putnam 1994). 
* Pony Duke, her disinherited nephew, and Jason Thomas published ''Too Rich: The Family Secrets of Doris Duke'' (1996).
*  Ted Schwarz with Tom Rybak, co-authored by one of Duke's staff, ''Trust No One'' (1997)

Several films/television shows has been made about her life, including:

* A four-hour made-for-television mini-series, based on Mansfield's book, (starring [[Lauren Bacall]] as Duke and [[Richard Chamberlain]] as Lafferty) was aired with the title, ''[[Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke]]'' (1999)
* Her life is also the subject of the [[HBO]] film ''[[Bernard and Doris]]'', starring [[Susan Sarandon]] as Duke and [[Ralph Fiennes]] as the butler Lafferty ([[2007 in film|2007]])

'''''Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco''''' is an anthropological study of the [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wiccan]] community of [[San Francisco]]. It was written by the Scandinavian theologian [[Jone Salomonsen]] of the [[California State University, Northridge]] and first published in 2002 by the [[Routledge]].

==Background==

===Paganism and Wicca in the United States===
Contemporary Paganism, which is also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an [[umbrella term]] used to identify a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several Pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884&amp;ndash;1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934&amp;ndash;), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s which was influenced by [[second wave feminism]], emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as [[Starhawk]] (1951&amp;ndash;) who went on to found her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]], as well as publishing ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), a book which helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 340&amp;ndash;351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Magiocco's work, three American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's ''Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited'' (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Father Time''' is the [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] depiction of [[time]].

==Description==
Father Time is usually depicted as an elderly bearded man with [[wings]], dressed in a robe and carrying a [[scythe]] and an [[hourglass]] or other timekeeping device (which represents [[arrow of time|time's]] constant one-way movement, and more generally and abstractly, [[entropy]]). This image derives from several sources, including the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] and the misattribution of [[Cronus]] (not [[Chronos]]) as the Greek Titan of human time, reaping and calendars, or the Lord of Time.

Around New Year's Eve, the media (in particular [[editorial cartoons]]) use the convenient [[Trope (literature)|trope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Luckovich Copyright 2010 Creators Syndicate |url=http://theweek.com/section/cartoon/0/210634/all-cartoons |title=Father time takes a beating – Foreign Relations Political and Editorial Cartoons |publisher=The Week |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Father Time as the personification of the previous year (or "the Old Year") who typically "hands over" the duties of time to the equally allegorical [[Baby New Year]] (or "the New Year") or who otherwise characterizes the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonistgroup.com/bysubject/subjectbyartist.php?id=92&amp;sid=6259M |title=The Father Time Comics and Cartoons – Cartoonist Group – Lisa Benson's Editorial Cartoons |publisher=Cartoonist Group |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dePIXion studios www.depixion.com |url=http://editorialcartoonists.com/cartoon/display.cfm/94366/ |title=AAEC – Political Cartoons |publisher=Editorialcartoonists.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211042/http://editorialcartoonists.com/cartoon/display.cfm/94366/ |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these depictions, Father Time is usually depicted wearing a sash with the old year's date on it.

Time (in his allegorical form) is often depicted revealing or unveiling the allegorical Truth, sometimes at the expense of a personification of Falsehood, Fraud, or Envy. This theme is related to the idea of ''veritas filia temporis'' (Time is the father of Truth).

==In popular culture==
Father Time is an established symbol in numerous cultures, and appears in a variety of art and media. In some cases, they appear specifically as Father Time, while in other cases they may have another name (such as [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]) but the characters demonstrate the attributes which Father Time has acquired over the centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3861">The '''Forest of Avon Trust''' is the local charity for trees in the former county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]], which now comprises [[Bristol]], [[North Somerset]], [[South Gloucestershire]], and [[Bath and North East Somerset]].

The Trust's objectives are to plant trees in gardens, streets, green spaces and schools to benefit people and [[wildlife]]. It also provides support to communities and individuals to plant and manage trees, including [[woodland]] and [[orchard]] creation.

The Forest of Avon Trust also provides accredited  [[Open College Network|OCN]] level 3 training for [[Forest schools|Forest School]] leaders and runs woodland activity and [[Outdoor education|outdoor learning]] sessions for schools, nurseries and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OCN Forest School Training 2013 Forest School Taster Day|url=http://lwfarm.org.uk/learning.html|publisher=Lawrence Weston Community Farm|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011 the trust has also run projects with adults with [[Learning_disability#United_Kingdom|learning difficulties]] to increase skills, independence and wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Studies: Benefits to Health and Wellbeing of Trees and Green Spaces|url=http://www.communityforest.org.uk/resources/case_study_health_and_wellbeing.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Community Forest Partnership|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forest of Avon Trust currently manages a community woodland near Upton Cheney, [[South Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest of Avon Trust takes on its first woodland|url=http://www.outdoorswest.org.uk/Home/1173/1810|publisher=Outdoors West|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Forest of Avon Trust was established in 2008 to carry on the work of the Forest of Avon Community Forest, which planted over 1 million trees.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forestofavontrust.org/about/|title=About the Forest of Avon Trust|publisher=Forest of Avon Trust Trust|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the charity has campaigned for strategic woodland creation, in support of the principles of the [[Community forests in England|Community Forest]].

In their first three years work included: creating mini-orchards in school grounds, donating thousands of locally grown, native trees and shrubs to school and communities, providing advice and support to local groups to enable them to plant trees, delivering environmental awareness and play activities for local schools and nurseries, delivering tailored woodland activities for adults with learning disabilities, advising landowners on woodland management and [[Forestry Commission]] grants and taking on the lease of The Retreat community woodland.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47231">'''Functionalism''' is a view in the [[philosophy of the mind|theory of the mind]]. It states that mental states (beliefs, desires, being in pain, etc.) are constituted solely by their functional role – that is, they have causal relations to other mental states, numerous sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs.&lt;ref name="Block1996"&gt;Block, Ned. (1996). "What is functionalism?" a revised version of the entry on functionalism in ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy Supplement'', Macmillan. 
([http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/functionalism.pdf PDF online])&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalism developed largely as an alternative to the [[identity theory of mind]] and [[behaviorism]].

Functionalism is a theoretical level between the physical implementation and behavioral output.&lt;ref name="Marr1982"&gt;Marr, D. (1982). ''Vision: A Computational Approach''. San Francisco: Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is different from its predecessors of [[Cartesian dualism]] (advocating independent mental and physical substances) and Skinnerian [[behaviorism]] and [[physicalism]] (declaring only physical substances) because it is only concerned with the effective functions of the brain, through its organization or its "software programs".

Since mental states are identified by a functional role, they are said to be realized on multiple levels; in other words, they are able to be manifested in various systems, even perhaps computers, so long as the system performs the appropriate functions. While computers are physical devices with electronic substrate that perform [[computation]]s on inputs to give outputs, so brains are physical devices with neural substrate that perform computations on inputs which produce behaviors.

==Multiple realizability==
An important part of some accounts of functionalism is the idea of [[multiple realizability]]. Since, according to standard functionalist theories, mental states are the corresponding functional role, mental states can be sufficiently explained without taking into account the underlying physical medium (e.g. the brain, neurons, etc.) that realizes such states; one need only take into account the higher-level functions in the cognitive system. Since mental states are not limited to a particular medium, they can be realized in multiple ways, including, theoretically, within non-biological systems, such as computers. In other words, a silicon-based machine could, in principle, have the same sort of mental life that a human being has, provided that its cognitive system realized the proper functional roles. Thus, mental states are individuated much like a valve; a valve can be made of plastic or metal or whatever material, as long as it performs the proper function (say, controlling the flow of liquid through a tube by blocking and unblocking its pathway).

However, there have been some functionalist theories that combine with the identity theory of mind, which deny multiple realizability. Such ''Functional Specification Theories'' (FSTs) (Levin, § 3.4), as they are called, were most notably developed by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]&lt;ref name="Lewis1980"&gt;Lewis, David. (1980). "Mad Pain and Martian Pain". In Block (1980a) Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;216–222.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Malet Armstrong]].&lt;ref name="Armstrong1968"&gt;Armstrong, D.M. (1968). ''A Materialistic Theory of the Mind''. London: RKP.&lt;/ref&gt; According to FSTs, mental states are the particular "realizers" of the functional role, not the functional role itself.  The mental state of belief, for example, just is whatever brain or neurological process that realizes the appropriate belief function.  Thus, unlike standard versions of functionalism (often called ''Functional State Identity Theories''), FSTs do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states, because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential.  What often drives this view is the belief that if we were to encounter an alien race with a cognitive system composed of significantly different material from humans' (e.g., silicon-based) but performed the same functions as human mental states (e.g., they tend to yell "Yowzass!" when poked with sharp objects, etc.) then we would say that their type of mental state is perhaps similar to ours, but too different to say it's the same. For some, this may be a disadvantage to FSTs. Indeed, one of [[Hilary Putnam]]'s&lt;ref name="Putnam1960"&gt;Putnam, Hilary. (1960). "Minds and Machines". Reprinted in Putnam (1975a).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Putnam1967"&gt;Putnam, Hilary. (1967). "Psychological Predicates". In ''Art, Mind, and Religion'', W.H. Capitan and D.D. Merrill (eds.), pp.&amp;nbsp;37–48. (Later published as "The Nature of Mental States" in Putnam (1975a).&lt;/ref&gt; arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do, and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind.

==Types==

===Machine-state functionalism===
[[Image:Maquina.png|thumb|right| Artistic representation of a [[Turing machine]].]]
The broad position of "functionalism" can be articulated in many different varieties. The first formulation of a functionalist theory of mind was put forth by [[Hilary Putnam]]&lt;ref name="Putnam1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Putnam1967"/&gt; in the 1960s. This formulation, which is now called '''machine-state functionalism''', or just '''machine functionalism''', was inspired by the analogies which Putnam and others noted between the [[mind]] and the theoretical "machines" or computers capable of computing any given [[algorithm]] which were developed by [[Alan Turing]] (called '''[[Turing machine]]s'''). It should be noted that Putnam himself, by the mid-1970s, had begun questioning this position. The beginning of his opposition to machine-state functionalism can be read about in his [[Twin Earth thought experiment]].

In non-technical terms, a Turing machine is not a physical object, but rather an abstract machine built upon a mathematical model. Typically, a Turing Machine has a horizontal tape divided into rectangular cells arranged from left to right. The tape itself is infinite in length, and each cell may contain a symbol. The symbols used for any given "machine" can vary. The machine has a ''read-write head'' that scans cells and moves in left and right directions. The action of the machine is determined by the symbol in the cell being scanned and a table of transition rules that serve as the machine's programming. Because of the infinite tape, a traditional Turing Machine has an infinite amount of time to compute any particular function or any number of functions. In the below example, each cell is either blank (''B'') or has a ''1'' written on it. These are the inputs to the machine. The possible outputs are:

*Halt: Do nothing.
*''R'': move one square to the right.
*''L'': move one square to the left.
*''B'': erase whatever is on the square.
*''1'': erase whatever is on the square and print a '1''.

An extremely simple example of a Turing machine which
writes out the sequence '111' after scanning three blank squares and then stops as specified by the following machine table:

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|  ||'''State One''' || '''State Two''' || '''State Three'''
|-
|B || write 1; stay in state 1 || write 1; stay in state 2 || write 1; stay in state 3
|-
|1 || go right; go to state 2 || go right; go to state 3 || [halt]
|-
|}

This table states that if the machine is in state one and scans a blank square (''B''), it will print a ''1'' and remain in state one. If it is in state one and reads a ''1'', it will move one square to the right and also go into state two. If it is in state two and reads a ''B'', it will print a ''1'' and stay in state two. If it is in state two and reads a ''1'', it will move one square to the right and go into state three. If it is in state three and reads a ''B'', it prints a ''1'' and remains in state three. Finally, if it is in state three and reads a ''1'', then it will stay in state three.

The essential point to consider here is the ''nature of the states'' of the Turing machine. Each state can be defined exclusively in terms of its relations to the other states as well as inputs and outputs. State one, for example, is simply the state in which the machine, if it reads a ''B'', writes a ''1'' and stays in that state, and in which, if it reads a ''1'', it moves one square to the right and goes into a different state. This is the functional definition of state one; it is its causal role in the overall system. The details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant. 

The above point is critical to an understanding of machine-state functionalism. Since Turing machines are not required to be physical systems, "anything capable of going through a succession of states in time can be a Turing machine".&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. (1967). “The Mental Life of Some Machines,” in H.-N. Castaneda (Ed.), Intentionality, Minds, and Perception. Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Because biological organisms “go through a succession of states in time”, any such organisms could also be equivalent to Turing machines.  

According to machine-state functionalism, the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the Turing machine states described above. If one can show the rational functioning and computing skills of these machines to be comparable to the rational functioning and computing skills of human beings, it follows that Turing machine behavior closely resembles that of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. (1967). “The Mental Life of Some Machines,” in H.-N. Castaneda (Ed.), Intentionality, Minds, and Perception. Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, pp. 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is not a particular physical-chemical composition responsible for the particular machine or mental state, it is the programming rules which produce the effects that are responsible. To put it another way, any rational preference is due to the rules being followed, not to the specific material composition of the agent.

===Psycho-functionalism===
A second form of functionalism is based on the rejection of [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] theories in psychology and their replacement with empirical cognitive models of the mind. This view is most closely associated with [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] and has been labeled '''psycho-functionalism'''.

The fundamental idea of psycho-functionalism is that psychology is an irreducibly complex science and that the terms that we use to describe the entities and properties of the mind in our best psychological theories cannot be redefined in terms of simple behavioral dispositions, and further, that such a redefinition would not be desirable or salient were it achievable. Psychofunctionalists view psychology as employing the same sorts of irreducibly [[teleology|teleological]] or purposive explanations as the biological sciences. Thus, for example, the function or role of the heart is to pump blood, that of the kidney is to filter it and to maintain certain chemical balances and so on—this is what accounts for the purposes of scientific explanation and taxonomy. There may be an infinite variety of physical realizations for all of the mechanisms, but what is important is only their role in the overall biological theory. In an analogous manner, the role of mental states, such as belief and desire, is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best ''scientific'' psychological theory. If some mental state which is postulated by [[folk psychology]] (e.g. hysteria) is determined not to have any fundamental role in cognitive psychological explanation, then that particular state may be considered not to exist .
On the other hand, if it turns out that there are states which theoretical cognitive psychology posits as necessary for explanation of human behavior but which are not foreseen by ordinary folk psychological language, then these entities or states exist.

===Analytic functionalism===
A third form of functionalism is concerned with the meanings of theoretical terms in general. This view is most closely associated with [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] and is often referred to as '''analytic functionalism''' or '''conceptual functionalism'''. The basic idea of analytic functionalism is that theoretical terms are implicitly defined by the theories in whose formulation they occur and not by intrinsic properties of the phonemes they comprise. In the case of ordinary language terms, such as "belief", "desire", or "hunger", the idea is that such terms get their meanings from our common-sense "folk psychological" theories about them, but that such conceptualizations are not sufficient to withstand the rigor imposed by materialistic theories of reality and causality. Such terms are subject to conceptual analyses which take something like the following form:

:Mental state M is the state that is preconceived by P and causes Q.

For example, the state of '''pain''' is ''caused'' by sitting on a tack and ''causes'' loud cries, and higher order mental states of anger and resentment directed at the careless person who left a tack lying around. These sorts of functional definitions in terms of causal roles are claimed to be ''[[Logical truth|analytic]]'' and ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths about the submental states and the (largely fictitious) propositional attitudes they describe. Hence, its proponents are known as ''analytic'' or ''conceptual'' functionalists. The essential difference between analytic and psychofunctionalism is that the latter emphasizes the importance of laboratory observation and experimentation in the determination of which mental state terms and concepts are genuine and which functional identifications may be considered to be genuinely [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' identities. The former, on the other hand, claims that such identities are [[Logical truth|necessary]] and not subject to empirical scientific investigation.

===Homuncular functionalism===
'''Homuncular functionalism''' was developed largely by [[Daniel Dennett]] and has been advocated by [[William Lycan]]. It arose in response to the challenges that [[Ned Block]]'s [[China Brain]] (a.k.a. Chinese nation) and [[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]] thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism (see below under "Criticism"). In attempting to overcome the conceptual difficulties that arose from the idea of a nation full of Chinese people wired together, each person working as a single neuron to produce in the wired-together whole the functional mental states of an individual mind, many functionalists simply bit the bullet, so to speak, and argued that such a Chinese nation would indeed possess all of the qualitative and intentional properties of a mind; i.e. it would become a sort of systemic or collective mind with propositional attitudes and other mental characteristics. Whatever the worth of this latter hypothesis, it was immediately objected that it [[logical consequence|entailed]] an unacceptable sort of mind-mind supervenience: the ''systemic'' mind which somehow emerged at the higher-level must necessarily supervene on the individual minds of each individual member of the Chinese nation, to stick to Block's formulation. But this would seem to put into serious doubt, if not directly contradict, the fundamental idea of the supervenience thesis: there can be no change in the mental realm without some change in the underlying physical substratum. This can be easily seen if we label the set of [[mental fact]]s that occur at the higher-level ''M1'' and the set of mental facts that occur at the lower-level ''M2''. Given the transitivity of supervenience, if ''M1'' supervenes on ''M2'', and ''M2'' supervenes on ''P'' (physical base), then ''M1'' and ''M2'' both supervene on ''P'', even though they are (allegedly) totally different sets of mental facts.

Since mind-mind supervenience seemed to have become acceptable in functionalist circles, it seemed to some that the only way to resolve the puzzle was to postulate the existence of an entire hierarchical series of mind levels (analogous to [[homunculi]]) which became less and less sophisticated in terms of functional organization and physical composition all the way down to the level of the physico-mechanical neuron or group of neurons. The homunculi at each level, on this view, have authentic mental properties but become simpler and less intelligent as one works one's way down the hierarchy.

===Mechanistic functionalism===

Mechanistic functionalism, originally formulated and defended by [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]&lt;ref name="Piccinini, G. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Piccinini G | year = 2010 | title = The mind as neural software? Understanding functionalism, computationalism, and computational functionalism | url = | journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 269–311 | doi = 10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00356.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carl Gillett&lt;ref&gt;Gillett, C. (2007). “A Mechanist Manifesto for the Philosophy of Mind: The Third Way for Functionalists”. Journal of Philosophical Research, invited symposium on “Mechanisms in the Philosophy of Mind”, vol.32, pp. 21-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillett, C. (2013). “Understanding the Sciences through the Fog of ‘Functionalism(s)’”. In Hunneman (ed.) Functions: Selection and Mechanisms. Dordrecht: Kluwer, pp.159-81.&lt;/ref&gt; independently, augments previous functionalist accounts of mental states by maintaining that any psychological explanation must be rendered in mechanistic terms. That is, instead of mental states receiving a purely functional explanation in terms of their relations to other mental states, like those listed above, functions are seen as playing only a part—the other part being played by structures— of the explanation of a given mental state.
 
A mechanistic explanation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Machamer P. | author2 = Darden L. | author3 = Craver C. F. | year = 2000 | title = Thinking about mechanisms | url = | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 67 | issue = 1| pages = 1–25 | doi=10.1086/392759}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves decomposing a given system, in this case a mental system, into its component physical parts, their activities or functions, and their combined organizational relations.&lt;ref name="Piccinini, G. 2010"/&gt; On this account the mind remains a functional system, but one that is understood mechanistically. This account remains a sort of functionalism because functional relations are still essential to [[Cognitive psychology|mental states]], but it is mechanistic because the functional relations are always manifestations of concrete structures—albeit structures understood at a certain level of abstraction. Functions are individuated and explained either in terms of the contributions they make to the given system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Craver C. F. | year = 2001 | title = Role functions, mechanisms, and hierarchy | url = | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 68 | issue = 1| pages = 53–74 | doi=10.1086/392866}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[teleological]] terms. If the functions are understood in teleological terms, then they may be characterized either [[etiological]]ly or non-etiologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maley C. J. | author2 = Piccinini G. | year = 2013 | title = Get the Latest Upgrade: Functionalism 6.3.1 | url = | journal = Philosophia Scientiae | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 135–149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Mechanistic functionalism leads functionalism away from the traditional functionalist autonomy of psychology from neuroscience and towards integrating psychology and neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Piccinini G. | author2 = Craver C. F. | year = 2011 | title = Integrating psychology and neuroscience: Functional analyses as mechanism sketches | url = | journal = Synthese | volume = 183 | issue = 3| pages = 283–311 | doi = 10.1007/s11229-011-9898-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing an applicable framework for merging traditional psychological models with neurological data, mechanistic functionalism may be understood as reconciling the functionalist theory of mind with neurological accounts of how the brain actually works. This is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states (mental states) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms.

==Physicalism==
There is much confusion about the sort of relationship that is claimed to exist (or not exist) between the general thesis of functionalism and [[physicalism]]. It has often been claimed that functionalism somehow "disproves" or falsifies physicalism ''[[tout court]]'' (i.e. without further explanation or description). On the other hand, most philosophers of mind who are functionalists claim to be physicalists—indeed, some of them, such as David Lewis, have claimed to be strict reductionist-type physicalists.

Functionalism is fundamentally what Ned Block has called a broadly metaphysical thesis as opposed to a narrowly [[ontological]] one.  That is, functionalism is not so much concerned with ''what there is'' than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state, e.g. pain, as the type of state that it is. Previous attempts to answer the mind-body problem have all tried to resolve it by answering ''both'' questions: dualism says there are two substances and that mental states are characterized by their immateriality; behaviorism claimed that there was one substance and that mental states were behavioral disposition; physicalism asserted the existence of just one substance and characterized the mental states as physical states (as in "pain = C-fiber firings").

On this understanding, '''type physicalism''' can be seen as incompatible with functionalism, since it claims that what characterizes mental states (e.g. pain) is that they are physical in nature, while functionalism says that what characterizes pain is its functional/causal role and its relationship with yelling "ouch", etc. However, any weaker sort of physicalism which makes the simple ontological claim that everything that exists is made up of physical matter is perfectly compatible with functionalism. Moreover,  most functionalists who are physicalists require that the properties that are quantified over in functional definitions be physical properties. Hence, they ''are'' physicalists, even though the general thesis of functionalism itself does not commit them to being so.

In the case of David Lewis, there is a distinction in the concepts of "having pain" (a [[rigid designator]] true of the same things in all possible worlds) and just "pain" (a non-rigid designator). Pain, for Lewis, stands for something like the definite description "the state with the causal role x". The referent of the description in humans is a type of brain state to be determined by science. The referent among silicon-based life forms is something else. The referent of the description among angels is some immaterial, non-physical state. For Lewis, therefore, ''local'' type-physical reductions are possible and compatible with conceptual functionalism. (See also Lewis's [[mad pain and Martian pain]].) There seems to be some confusion between types and tokens that needs to be cleared up in the functionalist analysis.

==Criticism==

=== China brain ===
{{Main|China brain}}
Ned Block&lt;ref name="Block1980b"&gt;Block, Ned. (1980b). "Troubles With Functionalism", in (1980a).&lt;/ref&gt; argues against the functionalist proposal of [[multiple realizability]], where hardware implementation is irrelevant because only the functional level is important.  The "China brain" or "Chinese nation" thought experiment involves supposing that the entire nation of China systematically organizes itself to operate just like a brain, with each individual acting as a neuron.  (The tremendous difference in speed of operation of each unit is not addressed.). According to functionalism, so long as the people are performing the proper functional roles, with the proper causal relations between inputs and outputs, the system will be a real mind, with mental states, consciousness, and so on. However, Block argues, this is patently absurd, so there must be something wrong with the thesis of functionalism since it would allow this to be a legitimate description of a mind.

Some functionalists believe China would have qualia but that due to the size it is impossible to imagine China being conscious.&lt;ref name="Lycan1987"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lycan | first = William | title = Consciousness | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780262121248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it may be the case that we are constrained by our [[theory of mind]]&lt;ref ="see, eg" name="BCLF1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20%26%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; and will never be able to understand what Chinese-nation consciousness is like.

===The Chinese room===
{{Main|Chinese room}}

The [[Chinese room]] argument by [[John Searle]]&lt;ref name="Searle1980"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Searle, John |year=1980 |title=Minds, Brains and Programs |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=3 |url=http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.searle2.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221025515/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.searle2.html |archivedate=2001-02-21 |df= | doi = 10.1017/s0140525x00005756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions. The thought experiment asserts that it is possible to mimic intelligent action without any interpretation or understanding through the use of a purely functional system. In short, Searle describes a person who only speaks English who is in a room with only Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around.  The person is then ordered by people outside of the room to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols. Further suppose that the people outside of the room are Chinese speakers and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols.  According to Searle, it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside knows Chinese simply based on these syntactic processes.  This thought experiment attempts to show that systems which operate merely on syntactic processes (inputs and outputs, based on algorithms) cannot realize any semantics (meaning) or intentionality (aboutness).  Thus, Searle attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules; that is, functionalism is an insufficient theory of the mind.

As noted above, in connection with Block's Chinese nation, many functionalists responded to Searle's [[thought experiment]] by suggesting that there was a form of mental activity going on at a higher level than the man in the Chinese room could comprehend (the so-called "system reply"); that is, the system does know Chinese. Of course, Searle responds that there is nothing more than syntax going on at the higher-level as well, so this reply is subject to the same initial problems. Furthermore, Searle suggests the man in the room could simply memorize the rules and symbol relations. Again, though he would convincingly mimic communication, he would be aware only of the symbols and rules, not of the meaning behind them.

===Inverted spectrum===
{{Main|Inverted spectrum}}

Another main criticism of functionalism is the [[inverted spectrum]] or inverted [[qualia]] scenario, most specifically proposed as an objection to functionalism by Ned Block.&lt;ref name=Block1980b/&gt;&lt;ref name="BF1972"&gt;Block, Ned and Fodor, J. (1972). "What Psychological States Are Not". ''Philosophical Review'' 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This thought experiment involves supposing that there is a person, call her Jane, that is born with a condition which makes her see the opposite spectrum of light that is normally perceived. Unlike normal people, Jane sees the color violet as yellow, orange as blue, and so forth. So, suppose, for example, that you and Jane are looking at the same orange.  While you perceive the fruit as colored orange, Jane sees it as colored blue.  However, when asked what color the piece of fruit is, both you and Jane will report "orange".  In fact, one can see that all of your behavioral as well as functional relations to colors will be the same.  Jane will, for example, properly obey traffic signs just as any other person would, even though this involves the color perception. Therefore, the argument goes, since there can be two people who are functionally identical, yet have different mental states (differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects), functionalism is not robust enough to explain individual differences in qualia.&lt;ref name="Block1994"&gt;Block, Ned. (1994). Qualia. In S. Guttenplan (ed), ''A Companion to Philosophy of Mind''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Chalmers]] tries to show&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1996"&gt;Chalmers, David. (1996). ''The Conscious Mind''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that even though mental content cannot be fully accounted for in functional terms, there is nevertheless a ''nomological correlation'' between mental states and functional states in this world. A silicon-based robot, for example, whose functional profile matched our own, would ''have'' to be fully conscious. His argument for this claim takes the form of a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''. The general idea is that since it would be very unlikely for a conscious human being to experience a change in its qualia which it utterly fails to notice, mental content and functional profile appear to be inextricably bound together, at least in the human case. If the subject's qualia were to change, we would expect the subject to notice, and therefore his functional profile to follow suit. A similar argument is applied to the notion of [[Absent qualia|''absent'' qualia]]. In this case, Chalmers argues that it would be very unlikely for a subject to experience a fading of his qualia which he fails to notice and respond to. This, coupled with the independent assertion that a conscious being's functional profile just could be maintained, irrespective of its experiential state, leads to the conclusion that the subject of these experiments would remain fully conscious. The problem with this argument, however, as Brian G. Crabb (2005) has observed, is that it begs the central question: How could Chalmers ''know'' that functional profile can be preserved, for example while the conscious subject's brain is being supplanted with a silicon substitute, unless he already assumes that the subject's possibly changing qualia would not be a determining factor? And while changing or fading qualia in a conscious subject might force changes in its functional profile, this tells us nothing about the case of a permanently inverted or unconscious robot. A subject with inverted qualia from birth would have nothing to notice or adjust to. Similarly, an unconscious functional simulacrum of ourselves (a zombie) would have no experiential changes to notice or adjust to. Consequently, Crabb argues, Chalmers' "fading qualia" and "dancing qualia" arguments fail to establish that cases of permanently inverted or absent qualia are nomologically impossible.

A related critique of the inverted spectrum argument is that it assumes that mental states (differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects) can be independent of the functional relations in the brain. Thus, it [[begs the question]] of functional mental states: its assumption denies the possibility of functionalism itself, without offering any independent justification for doing so. (Functionalism says that mental states are produced by the functional relations in the brain.) This same type of problem—that there is no argument, just an antithetical assumption at their base—can also be said of both the Chinese room and the Chinese nation arguments. Notice, however, that Crabb's response to Chalmers does not commit this fallacy: His point is the more restricted observation that ''even if'' inverted or absent qualia turn out to be nomologically impossible, and it is perfectly possible that we might subsequently discover this fact by other means, Chalmers' argument fails to demonstrate that they are impossible.

===Twin Earth===
{{Main|Twin Earth thought experiment}}
The [[Twin Earth thought experiment]], introduced by Hilary Putnam,&lt;ref name="Putnam1975b"&gt;Putnam, Hilary. (1975b). "The Meaning of 'Meaning{{'"}}, reprinted in Putnam (1975a).([http://internalism.googlegroups.com/web/Putnam%20-%20The%20meaning%20of%20%27meaning%27.pdf?gda=twdJY1oAAABFSTngQf24Sy1RD7yNn1iVgy3Odg0ZctAT1N_Bh2qhdGG1qiJ7UbTIup-M2XPURDQe1sJTwbuelxnpaL6JzH4yeFMfiRQRvg6UTOJgQe0faGtRc9Sp7hcxNJ_gjwZr8bQ PDF online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618031552/http://internalism.googlegroups.com/web/Putnam%20-%20The%20meaning%20of%20%27meaning%27.pdf?gda=twdJY1oAAABFSTngQf24Sy1RD7yNn1iVgy3Odg0ZctAT1N_Bh2qhdGG1qiJ7UbTIup-M2XPURDQe1sJTwbuelxnpaL6JzH4yeFMfiRQRvg6UTOJgQe0faGtRc9Sp7hcxNJ_gjwZr8bQ |date=June 18, 2013 }})&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for one of the main arguments used against functionalism, although it was originally intended as an argument against [[internalism and externalism|semantic internalism]]. The thought experiment is simple and runs as follows. Imagine a Twin Earth which is identical to Earth in every way but one: water does not have the chemical structure H₂O, but rather some other structure, say XYZ. It is critical, however, to note that XYZ on Twin Earth is still called "water" and exhibits all the same macro-level properties that H₂O exhibits on Earth (i.e., XYZ is also a clear drinkable liquid that is in lakes, rivers, and so on). Since these worlds are identical in every way except in the underlying chemical structure of water, you and your Twin Earth [[doppelgänger]] see exactly the same things, meet exactly the same people, have exactly the same jobs, behave exactly the same way, and so on. In other words, since you share the same inputs, outputs, and relations between other mental states, you are functional duplicates. So, for example, you both believe that water is wet. However, the content of your mental state of believing that water is wet differs from your duplicate's because your belief is of H₂O, while your duplicate's is of XYZ. Therefore, so the argument goes, since two people can be functionally identical, yet have different mental states, functionalism cannot sufficiently account for all mental states.

Most defenders of functionalism initially responded to this argument by attempting to maintain a sharp distinction between internal and external content. The internal contents of propositional attitudes, for example, would consist exclusively in those aspects of them which have no relation with the external world ''and'' which bear the necessary functional/causal properties that allow for relations with other internal mental states. Since no one has yet been able to formulate a clear basis or justification for the existence of such a distinction in mental contents, however, this idea has generally been abandoned in favor of externalist ''causal theories of mental contents'' (also known as [[informational semantics]]). Such a position is represented, for example, by [[Jerry Fodor]]'s account of an "asymmetric causal theory" of mental content. This view simply entails the modification of functionalism to include within its scope a very broad interpretation of input and outputs to include the objects that are the causes of mental representations in the external world.

The twin earth argument hinges on the assumption that experience with an imitation water would cause a different mental state than experience with natural water. However, since no one would notice the difference between the two waters, this assumption is likely false. Further, this basic assumption is directly antithetical to functionalism; and, thereby, the twin earth argument does not constitute a genuine argument: as this assumption entails a flat denial of functionalism itself (which would say that the two waters would not produce different mental states, because the functional relationships would remain unchanged).

===Meaning holism===
Another common criticism of functionalism is that it implies a radical form of [[semantic holism]]. Block and Fodor&lt;ref name="BF1972"/&gt; referred to this as the ''damn/darn problem''. The difference between saying "damn" or "darn" when one smashes one's finger with a hammer can be mentally significant. But since these outputs are, according to functionalism, related to many (if not all) internal mental states, two people who experience the same pain and react with different outputs must share little (perhaps nothing) in common in any of their mental states. But this is counterintuitive; it seems clear that two people share something significant in their mental states of being in pain if they both smash their finger with a hammer, whether or not they utter the same word when they cry out in pain.

Another possible solution to this problem is to adopt a moderate (or molecularist) form of holism. But even if this succeeds in the case of pain, in the case of beliefs and meaning, it faces the difficulty of formulating a distinction between relevant and non-relevant contents (which can be difficult to do without invoking an [[analytic–synthetic distinction]], as many seek to avoid).

===Triviality arguments===

According to Ned Block, if functionalism is to avoid the chauvinism of type-physicalism, it becomes overly liberal in "ascribing mental properties to things that do not in fact have them".&lt;ref name=Block1980b/&gt; As an example, he proposes that the economy of Bolivia might be organized such that the economic states, inputs, and outputs would be isomorphic to a person under some bizarre mapping from mental to economic variables.&lt;ref name=Block1980b/&gt;

These arguments typically use the assumption that physics leads to a progression of unique states, and that functionalist realization is present whenever there is a mapping from the proposed set of mental states to physical states of the system. Given that the states of a physical system are always at least slightly unique, such a mapping will always exist, so any system is a mind. Formulations of functionalism which stipulate absolute requirements on interaction with external objects (external to the functional account, meaning not defined functionally) are reduced to behaviorism instead of absolute triviality, because the input-output behavior is still required.

[[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] has argued further&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith2009"&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith, "Triviality Arguments against Functionalism". 2009. Philosophical studies 145 (2). [http://philpapers.org/rec/GODTAA]/{{cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~pgs/TrivArgtsFnm-08-Zweb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522022444/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~pgs/TrivArgtsFnm-08-Zweb.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that such formulations can still be reduced to triviality if they accept a somewhat innocent-seeming additional assumption. The assumption is that adding a ''transducer layer'', that is, an input-output system, to an object should not change whether that object has mental states. The transducer layer is restricted to producing behavior according to a simple mapping, such as a lookup table, from inputs to actions on the system, and from the state of the system to outputs. However, since the system will be in unique states at each moment and at each possible input, such a mapping will always exist so there will be a transducer layer which will produce whatever physical behavior is desired.

Godfrey-Smith believes that these problems can be addressed using [[causality#Theories|causality]], but that it may be necessary to posit a continuum between objects being minds and not being minds rather than an absolute distinction. Furthermore, constraining the mappings seems to require either consideration of the external behavior as in behaviorism, or discussion of the internal structure of the realization as in identity theory; and though multiple realizability does not seem to be lost, the functionalist claim of the autonomy of high-level functional description becomes questionable.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith2009"/&gt;

[[Image:Surface water cycle.svg|thumb|Water balance]]
'''Groundwater recharge''' or '''deep drainage''' or '''deep percolation''' is a [[Hydrology|hydrologic]] process where [[water]] moves downward from [[surface water]] to [[groundwater]]. Recharge is the primary method through which water enters an [[aquifer]].  This process usually occurs in the [[vadose zone]] below plant [[root]]s and is often expressed as a [[flux]] to the [[water table]] surface. Recharge occurs both naturally (through the [[water cycle]]) and through anthropogenic processes (i.e., "artificial groundwater recharge"), where rainwater and or [[reclaimed water]] is routed to the subsurface.

==Processes==
Groundwater is recharged naturally by [[rain]] and [[snow]] melt and to a smaller extent by surface water (rivers and lakes). Recharge  may be impeded somewhat by human activities including paving, development, or [[logging]].  These activities can result in loss of topsoil resulting in reduced water infiltration, enhanced [[surface runoff]] and reduction in recharge. Use of groundwaters, especially for [[irrigation]], may also lower the water tables. Groundwater recharge is an important process for [[sustainable]] groundwater management, since the volume-rate [[water abstraction|abstracted]] from an [[aquifer]] in the long term should be less than or equal to the volume-rate that is recharged.

Recharge can help move excess salts that accumulate in the root zone to deeper soil layers, or into the groundwater system. Tree roots increase water [[Soil#Soil water|saturation]] into [[groundwater]] reducing water [[Surface runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref name="trees water infiltration"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.agronomy.org/news-media/releases/2008/1117/221/ | title=Urban Trees Enhance Water Infiltration | publisher=The American Society of Agronomy | work=Fisher, Madeline | date=November 17, 2008 | accessdate=October 31, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602034025/https://www.agronomy.org/news-media/releases/2008/1117/221/ | archivedate=June 2, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Flooding]] temporarily increases [[stream bed|river bed]] [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] by moving clay soils downstream, and this increases aquifer recharge.&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/major-floods-recharge-aquifers/ | title=Major floods recharge aquifers | publisher=University of New South Wales Science | date=January 24, 2011 | accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial groundwater recharge is becoming increasingly important in India, where [[Overdrafting|over-pumping]] of groundwater by farmers has led to underground resources becoming depleted. In 2007, on the recommendations of the [[International Water Management Institute]], the Indian government allocated {{INRConvert|1800|c|year=2007}} to fund dug-well [[Aquifer storage and recovery|recharge projects]] (a dug-well is a wide, shallow well, often lined with concrete) in 100 districts within seven states where water stored in hard-rock aquifers had been over-exploited. Another environmental issue is the disposal of waste through the water flux such as dairy farms, industrial, and urban [[Surface runoff|runoff]].

===Wetlands===
[[Wetlands]] help maintain the level of the water table and exert control on the hydraulic head (O'Brien 1988; Winter 1988). This provides force for groundwater recharge and discharge to other waters as well. The extent of groundwater recharge by a wetland is dependent upon [[soil type|soil]], [[vegetation]], site, perimeter to volume ratio, and water table gradient (Carter and Novitzki 1988; Weller 1981). Groundwater recharge occurs through [[soil type|mineral soils]] found primarily around the edges of wetlands (Verry and Timmons 1982) The soil under most wetlands is relatively impermeable. A high perimeter to volume ratio, such as in small wetlands, means that the surface area through which water can infiltrate into the groundwater is high (Weller 1981). Groundwater recharge is typical in small wetlands such as [[Prairie Pothole Region|prairie potholes]], which can contribute significantly to recharge of regional groundwater resources (Weller 1981). Researchers have discovered groundwater recharge of up to 20% of wetland volume per season (Weller 1981).

===Depression-focused recharge===
If water falls uniformly over a field such that [[field capacity]] of the soil is not exceeded, then negligible water percolates to [[groundwater]].  If instead water puddles in low-lying areas, the same water volume concentrated over a smaller area may exceed field capacity resulting in water that percolates down to recharge groundwater.  The larger the relative contributing runoff area is, the more focused infiltration is.  The recurring process of water that falls relatively uniformly over an area, flowing to groundwater selectively under surface depressions is depression focused recharge.  Water tables rise under such depressions.

====Depression pressure====
Depression focused groundwater recharge can be very important in [[arid region]]s.  More rain events are capable of contributing to groundwater supply.

Depression focused groundwater recharge also profoundly effects [[contaminant]] transport into groundwater.  This is of great concern in regions with [[karst]] geological formations because water can eventually dissolve tunnels all the way to [[aquifer]]s, or otherwise disconnected streams.  This extreme form of preferential flow, accelerates the transport of contaminants and the [[erosion]] of such [[tunnel]]s.  In this way depressions intended to trap [[Surface runoff|runoff]] water—before it flows to vulnerable water resources—can connect underground over time.  [[Cavitation]] of surfaces above into the tunnels, results in [[pothole]]s or caves.

Deeper ponding exerts [[pressure]] that forces water into the ground faster.  Faster flow dislodges contaminants otherwise adsorbed on soil and carries them along. This can carry [[pollution]] directly to the raised [[water table]] below and into the [[groundwater supply]].  Thus the quality of water collecting in [[infiltration basin]]s is of special concern.

====Pollution====
Pollution in stormwater [[Surface runoff|runoff]] collects in retention basins.  Concentrating degradable contaminants can accelerate [[biodegradation]].  However, where and when water tables are high this affects appropriate design of [[detention pond]]s, [[retention pond]]s and [[rain garden]]s.

==Estimation methods==

Rates of groundwater recharge are difficult to quantify since other related processes, such as [[evaporation]], [[transpiration]] (or [[evapotranspiration]]) and [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] processes must first be measured or estimated to determine the balance.

===Physical===

Physical methods use the principles of [[soil physics]] to estimate recharge. The ''direct'' physical methods are those that attempt to actually measure the volume of water passing below the root zone. ''Indirect'' physical methods rely on the measurement or estimation of soil physical parameters, which along with soil physical principles, can be used to estimate the potential or actual recharge. After months without rain the level of the rivers under humid climate is low and represents solely drained groundwater. Thus, the recharge can be calculated from this base flow if the catchment area is already known.

===Chemical===

Chemical methods use the presence of relatively [[Chemically inert|inert]] water-soluble substances, such as an [[isotopic tracer]] or [[chloride]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allison |first=G.B. |author2=Hughes, M.W. |year=1978 |title=The use of environmental chloride and tritium to estimate total recharge to an unconfined aquifer |journal=Australian Journal of Soil Research |volume=16 |pages=181–195 |doi=10.1071/SR9780181 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving through the soil, as deep drainage occurs.

===Numerical models===

Recharge can be estimated using [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]], using such [[Source code|codes]] as [[Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance]], [[UNSAT-H]], [[SHAW]], [[Weap|WEAP]], and [[MIKE SHE]]. The 1D-program [[Hydrus (software)|HYDRUS1D]] is available online. The codes generally use [[climate]] and [[soil]] data to arrive at a recharge estimate and use the [[Richards equation]] in some form to model groundwater flow in the [[vadose zone]].

The city sequence is divided into 5 phases based on major changes of the site architecture. The initial phase on the hill top is usually dated to first centuries AD and was dominated by a single building constructed using characteristic technique of pre-Islamic south Arabia. Only one room in the structure with preserved floor exist. It appears, from the fill beneath the plaster floor, that at one point, the building was renewed. Glacis (4–6 m wide) was also constructed on the site, however whether it encircle the entire tell is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Two seasons at Hajar Am-Dhaybiyya, Yemen, Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy (AEE):  P.93&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging from the surface layers of the necropolis, the tombs appear to span over several centuries. Grave 3 is dated approximately between 1st to 4th century AD. And the artifacts found there shows detectable Roman artistic influence.

Four burials had been excavated in the site necropolis, only grave 3 was intact, and it yielded great amount of funerary possessions. Which apparently belonged to either an upper class individual, or rather a soldier as suggested by the presence of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=dasi_prj_sit&amp;prjId=1&amp;corId=0&amp;colId=0&amp;navId=36512484&amp;recId=279/ DASI: Hajar am-Dhaybiyya]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 10.JPG|thumb|275px|Model of '''Herod's Jerusalem Palace-Fortress''' in the northwest corner of the Upper City walls. The three towers, from L to R, are Phasael, Hippicus, and Mariamne. Just beneath the latter two, a portion of the reconstruction of the palace building itself is visible.]]

'''Herod's Palace at Jerusalem''' was built in the last quarter of the 1st century BC by [[Herod the Great|Herod I the Great]], [[List of Hasmonean and Herodian rulers|King of Judea]] from 37 BC to 4 BC. It was the second most important building in [[Jerusalem]], after the [[Herod's Temple|Temple]] itself, in Herod’s day and was situated at the northwestern wall of the Upper City of Jerusalem (the Western Hill abandoned after the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|sacking of Jerusalem]]). Herod lived in it as a principal residence, but not permanently, as he owned other palace-fortresses, notably at [[Masada]], [[Herodium]] and [[Caesarea Maritima]]. Nothing remains of the Jerusalem Palace today except for portions of the surrounding wall-and-tower complex, much altered and generally known as "the Citadel" (see [[Tower of David]]). The site of the former palace is now occupied by the [[Tower of David#Tower of David Museum|Tower of David Museum]], a police station, and a former Turkish barracks/prison known as the ''Kishle''.

==Location and associated structures==
[[Image:Jerusalem-TowerOfDavid 001.jpg|thumb|right|The "Tower of David"—seen here from the inner courtyard of the Citadel—was built on the base of the Tower of Hippicus.]]

Herod's palace-fortress in Jerusalem stood along the western city wall, in the area now taken by the [[Armenian Quarter]], starting in the north at the Kishle building and ending at the gate called by [[Bargil Pixner]] the Gate of the Essenes on [[Mount Zion]]. It consisted mainly of two palace wings placed north and south of a large garden. Immediately north of the complex, in the area of today's [[Tower of David|Citadel]] and [[Jaffa Gate]], Herod erected three huge towers, as an additional protection and last refuge in case of danger. These he called after people close to him - Hippicus after a friend, [[Phasael]] after his brother, and [[Mariamne I|Mariamne]] after his favourite wife. These towers strengthened the northwest corner of the [[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period#Hasmonean Kingdom|First Wall]], the city wall built by the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmoneans]] sometime between 142-BC. Of the three towers, only the massive lower part of the [[Hippicus Tower]] (or the Phasael Tower, after some researchers)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 27925783|title = The 'Tower of David'—Phasael or Hippicus?|journal = Israel Exploration Journal|volume = 31|issue = 1/2|pages = 57–65|last1 = Geva|first1 = Hillel|year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; have survived. Remains of two older, Hasmonean towers (the Southern and Middle Towers) have been found in the present Citadel courtyard, which are unrelated to the missing Herodian towers.

During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, the tower, and by extension the Citadel as a whole, acquired its alternative name - the [[Tower of David]] - after the Byzantines, mistakenly identifying the hill as [[Mount Zion]], presumed it to be David's palace. This name is still in use today, although in the 19th century an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] minaret erected between 1635-65 over the southern wall of the Citadel took over the title of "Tower of David", so that the name can now refer to either the whole Citadel or the minaret alone.

==Description==
As with his [[Herod's Temple|Temple]], Herod's Jerusalem Palace was constructed on an elevated platform of about 1,000 feet (north-south) by 180 feet (east-west). Resting on a series of retaining walls rising 13 to 16 feet above ground level. It consisted of two main buildings, each with its own banquet halls, baths, and accommodations for hundreds of guests. The two wings were named after [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Augustus|Caesar]]. In the center of the palace were gardens with porticoes. The grounds included groves, canals, and ponds fitted with bronze fountains. The ''[[praetorium]]'' at the Palace was, after Herod's death, the official residence of the Roman governors when they came to Jerusalem during major Jewish festivals. This was probably the site of the trial of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] by [[Pontius Pilate]] (see [[Pilate's court]]).

To the north of Herod's Palace were the three immense towers,
* The [[Phasael Tower]] was the largest. It was named after [[Phasael|Herod's brother]] and stood 145 feet high.
* The [[Hippicus Tower]] was named after a friend of Herod and stood 132 feet high.
* The [[Mariamne Tower]] was named after Herod’s [[Mariamne (second wife of Herod)|Hasmonean wife]] whom he had executed. Josephus said that "the king considering it appropriate that the tower named after a woman should surpass in decoration those called after men." It stood 74 feet high and was accounted the most beautiful of the three.

==Josephus’ description==
The ancient writer and historian [[Josephus]] vividly described the "wondrous" palace in ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' (''ca.'' 75 AD). Book 5, chapter 4 tells that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The largeness also of the stones was wonderful; for they were not made of common small stones, nor of such large ones only as men could carry, but they were of white marble, cut out of the rock; each stone was twenty cubits in length, and ten in breadth, and five in depth. They were so exactly united to one another, that each tower looked like one entire rock of stone, so growing naturally, and afterward cut by the hand of the artificers into their present shape and corners; so little, or not at all, did their joints or connexion appear low as these towers were themselves on the north side of the wall, the king had a palace inwardly thereto adjoined, which exceeds all my ability to describe it; for it was so very curious as to want no cost nor skill in its construction, but was entirely walled about to the height of thirty cubits, and was adorned with towers at equal distances, and with large bed-chambers, that would contain beds for a hundred guests a-piece, in which the variety of the stones is not to be expressed; for a large quantity of those that were rare of that kind was collected together. Their roofs were also wonderful, both for the length of the beams, and the splendor of their ornaments. The number of the rooms was also very great, and the variety of the figures that were about them was prodigious; their furniture was complete, and the greatest part of the vessels that were put in them was of silver and gold. There were besides many porticoes, one beyond another, round about, and in each of those porticoes curious pillars; yet were all the courts that were exposed to the air everywhere green. There were, moreover, several groves of trees, and long walks through them, with deep canals, and cisterns, that in several parts were filled with brazen statues, through which the water ran out. There were withal many dove-courts of tame pigeons about the canals. But indeed it is not possible to give a complete description of these palaces; and the very remembrance of them is a torment to one, as putting one in mind what vastly rich buildings that fire which was kindled by the robbers hath consumed; for these were not burnt by the Romans, but by these internal plotters, as we have already related, in the beginning of their rebellion. That fire began at the tower of Antonia, and went on to the palaces, and consumed the upper parts of the three towers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Flavius Josephus]], ''The Wars of the Jews, or History of the Destruction of Jerusalem'', trans. [[William Whiston]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/book5.htm#noteref-11 Book V, Chapt. 4, Verse 4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fate of the Palace==
At the creation of the Roman province of [[Roman Judea|Judaea]] in the year 6 CE, its governors—holding the rank of a [[Prefect#Ancient Rome|prefect]] until the year 41 and that of a [[Procurator (Roman Empire)|procurator]] after that—took up residence in Herod's palace.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 66 CE, the Roman governor [[Gessius Florus]] set up a mass crucifixion of Jews, sparking the [[First Jewish Rebellion]]. Rebelling Jews entered and burnt the palace. Only the three towers remained partially standing.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} When the future Roman emperor [[Titus]] destroyed most of Jerusalem in 70 CE, he spared these and set up the camp of the [[Legio X Fretensis|Tenth Legion Fretensis]] in the area of the palace ruins, a camp which covered the entire Western Hill.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} One of the towers—a rebuilt Hippicus (or Phasael) Tower on its intact base—became known as the "[[Tower of David]]".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} This was due to the fact that during the Byzantine Period, the Western Hill had been mistakenly identified as [[Mount Zion]] and the remains of the one surviving Herodian tower were presumed to be King David's palace.

Evidence shows that Crusaders fortified and heightened the 15 foot thick Hasmonean city wall and that Arabs, who [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|conquered Jerusalem]] in 637, did the same.{{dubious|Terrible mess. 1- If it only concerns the city walls outside the royal palace area, it's irrelevant here. 2- What Arabs? Early Isl. Period (Rashidun, Umayyad etc. through Fatimid) or post-Crusader (Ayyubid, Mamluk)? 900-year span! 3- Why mention 638 AFTER 12th c. Crusaders?|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

During the 1160s the kings of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem built in the same general area a royal palace of their own, of which close to nothing remains.&lt;ref name="BoasJlm"&gt;Adrian J. Boas.

[http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_9.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 19th-century Egyptian barracks and later prison—locally known as the ''Kishle''—was built adjacent to the Citadel's southern moat and was used, successively, by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]]'s troops (1834-40/41), the Turks (1840/41-1917), the British (1917–48), the Jordanians (1948–67) and in parts by the Israeli police after 1967. The very popular Tower of David Museum, located at the Citadel, is also administering the Kishle building, thus covering the northernmost part of the palace.

==20th and 21st century excavations==
In the 1970s, excavations outside the city wall disclosed the exit of a water drain belonging to Herod's Palace. This culvert transported water from the palace into the [[Hinnom Valley]]. Until recently, no portion of Herod's palace proper—excluding, that is, the surrounding walls-and-towers complex—had ever been uncovered. In 2001, however, excavations disclosed two palace walls, constructed of the easily recognizable Herodian hewn giant blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Schaalje, Jacqueline (2001),  [http://www.jewishmag.com/48mag/herod/herod.htm "Israeli Archaeologists Discover Herod's Palace"], ''[[The Jewish Magazine]]'' (October 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Even these probably did not belong to the palace proper, but were part of the retaining walls for its base, a construction similar to that used by Herod at the Temple Mount. Excavations by [[Ruth Amiran]] and [[Avraham Eitan]] have also revealed some parts of the superstructure which included sections of painted plaster.

The ''Kishle'' prison excavations are accessible every Friday morning when guided tours are organised by the Tower of David Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Tower of David Museum: reservations for guided tours of the Kishle and Citadel moat  [http://www.tod.org.il/en/the-kishle-and-the-citadel-moat/]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=July 2014}}
'''Hyperreality''', in [[semiotics]] and [[postmodernism]], is an inability of [[consciousness]] to distinguish [[reality]] from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced postmodern [[Society|societies]]. Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which what is real and what is fiction are seamlessly blended together so that there is no clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins.&lt;ref name="Tiffin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiffin|first=John|author2=Nobuyoshi Terashima|title=Paradigm for the third millennium|journal=Hyperreality|year=2005|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the co-mingling of physical [[reality]] with [[virtual reality]] (VR) and [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]] with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).&lt;ref name="Tiffin" /&gt; Individuals may find themselves, for different reasons, more in tune or involved with the hyperreal world and less with the physical real world. Some famous theorists of hyperreality/hyperrealism include [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], [[Neil Postman]] and [[Umberto Eco]].

==Origins and usage==
The postmodern semiotic concept of "hyperreality" was contentiously coined by French sociologist [[Jean Baudrillard]] in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]''. Baudrillard defined "hyperreality" as "the generation by models of a real without origin or reality";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|title=Simulacra &amp; Simulation|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=The Precession of Simulacra|page=1|url=https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309115319/https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; hyperreality is a representation, a sign, without an original referent. Baudrillard believes hyperreality goes further than confusing or blending the 'real' with the symbol which represents it; it involves creating a symbol or set of signifiers which represent something that does not actually exist, like Santa Claus. Baudrillard in particular suggests that the world we live in has been replaced by a copy world, where we seek simulated stimuli and nothing more. Baudrillard borrows, from [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' "[[On Exactitude in Science]]" (already borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]]),the example of a society whose [[Cartography|cartographers]] create a map so detailed that it covers the very things it was designed to represent. When the empire declines, the map fades into the landscape.  He says that, in such a case, neither the representation nor the real remains, just the hyperreal.  Baudrillard's idea of hyperreality was heavily influenced by [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[semiotics]], and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. Baudrillard challenges McLuhan's famous statement that the 'medium is the message', by suggesting that information devours its own content. Hyperreality is the inability of consciousness to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced societies.&lt;ref&gt;Zompetti, J. P., &amp; Moffitt, M. A. (2008). Revisiting Concepts of Public Relations Audience Through Postmodern Concepts of Metanarrative, Decentered Subject, and Reality/Hyperreality. Journal of Promotion Management, 14(3/4), 275-291. doi:10.1080/10496490802623762.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baudrillard's hyperreality theory goes a step further than McLuhan's medium theory: "There is not only an implosion of the message in the medium, there is, in the same movement, the implosion of the medium itself in the real, the implosion of the medium and of the real in a sort of hyperreal nebula, in which even the definition and distinct action of the medium can no longer be determined".&lt;ref name="Laughey, D. 2010"&gt;Laughey, D. (2010). Key themes in media theory. Maidenhead: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] explores the notion of hyperreality further by suggesting that the action of hyperreality is to desire reality and in the attempt to achieve that desire, to fabricate a false reality that is to be consumed as real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eco |first=Umberto |title=Travels in Hyperreality |url=http://public.callutheran.edu/~brint/American/Eco.pdf |work=The fortress of Solitude |accessdate=16 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521085018/http://public.callutheran.edu/~brint/American/Eco.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linked to contemporary [[western culture]] Umberto Eco and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] would argue, that in current cultures fundamental ideals are built on desire and particular [[Sign system|sign-systems]].

Hyperreality can also be thought of as "reality by proxy"; simply put, an individual takes on someone else's version of reality and claims it as his or her own. For example, persons who watch soap operas for an extended period of time may develop a view of interpersonal relationships (reality) that are skewed by how the writers depict the characters and situations within the show. Individuals may begin to believe that these extreme dramatic relationships are authentic and real, and they may begin to judge social relationships and situations by this heightened lens of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crystal|first=Garry|title=What is Hyperreality|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-hyperreality.htm|publisher=wiseGEEK|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Hyperreality is significant as a [[paradigm]] to explain current cultural conditions. [[Consumerism]], because of its reliance on sign exchange value (e.g. brand X shows that one is fashionable, car Y indicates one's wealth), could be seen as a contributing factor in the creation of hyperreality or the hyperreal condition. Hyperreality tricks consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement, instead opting for artificial simulation, and endless reproductions of fundamentally empty appearance. Essentially (although Baudrillard himself may balk at the use of this word), fulfillment or [[happiness]] is found through simulation and imitation of a transient [[simulacrum]] of reality, rather than any interaction with any "real" [[reality]].

While hyperreality is not a relatively new concept, its effects are more relevant today than when it was first conceptualized.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} This is attributed to the way it effectively captured the postmodern condition, particularly how people in the postmodern world seek stimulation by creating unreal worlds of spectacle and seduction and nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Social and Sociological Theory: Visualizing Social Worlds|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412978200|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are dangers to the use of hyperreality within our culture; individuals may observe and accept hyperreal images as role models when the images don't necessarily represent real physical people. This can result in a desire to strive for an unobtainable ideal, or it may lead to a lack of unimpaired role models. [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] cautions against confusing celebrity worship with hero worship, "we come dangerously close to depriving ourselves of all real models. We lose sight of the men and women who do not simply seem great because they are famous but who are famous because they are great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel J.|title=The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America|year=1992|publisher=Random House|location=New York, NY|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bemoans the loss of old heroes like [[Moses]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Aeneas]], [[Jesus]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Muhammad|Muhammed]], [[Joan of Arc]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[George Washington]], [[Napoleon]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]], who did not have [[public relations]] (PR) agencies to construct hyperreal images of themselves. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel J.|title=The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America|year=1992|publisher=Random House|location=New York, NY|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dangers of hyperreality are also facilitated by information technologies, which provide tools to dominant powers that seek to encourage it to drive consumption and materialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge and Critical Pedagogy: An Introduction|last=Kincheloe|first=Joe|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2008|isbn=9781402082238|location=New York|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The danger in the pursuit of stimulation and seduction emerge not in the lack of meaning but, as Baudrillard maintained, "we are gorged with meaning and it is killing us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mapping the Subject: Geographies of Cultural Transformation|last=Pile|first=Steve|last2=Thrift|first2=Nigel|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=0415102251|location=London|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperreality, some sources point out, may provide insights into the postmodern moment by analyzing how simulations disrupt the [[binary opposition]] between reality and [[illusion]] but  it does not address or resolve the contradictions inherent in this tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Postmodernism, Page 2|last=Taylor|first=Victor|last2=Winquist|first2=Charles|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=0415152941|location=London|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key relational themes==
Simulation/Simulacra: 
The concepts most fundamental to hyperreality are those of simulation and the simulacrum, first conceptualized by [[Jean Baudrillard]] in his book ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]''.  The two terms are separate entities with relational origin connections to Baudrillard's theory of hyperreality.

===Simulation===
[[Simulation]] is characterized by a blending of 'reality' and representation, where there is no clear indication of where the former stops and the latter begins. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance; "It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|title=Simulacra &amp; Simulation|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=The Precession of Simulacra|page=1|url=https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard suggests that simulation no longer takes place in a physical realm; it takes place within a space not categorized by physical limits i.e., within ourselves, technological simulations, etc.

===Simulacrum===
The [[simulacrum]] is often defined as a copy with no original, or as [[Gilles Deleuze]] (1990) describes it, "the simulacrum is an image without resemblance". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boundas|first=Gilles Deleuze ; translated by Mark Lester with Charles Stivale ; edited by Constantin V.|title=The logic of sense|year=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231059831|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right. He created four steps of reproduction: (1) basic reflection of reality, (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretense of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which "bears no relation to any reality whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Doug|title=Jean Baudrillard|url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~dmann/baudrillard1.htm|work=A Very Short Introduction|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotations ==
"Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory—precession of simulacra—it is the map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map." — Jean Baudrillard, "The Precession of Simulacra," ''Simulacra and Simulation''

== Examples ==

=== Disneyland ===
Both [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]] refer to [[Disneyland]] as an example of hyperreality. Eco believes that Disneyland with its settings such as Main Street and full sized houses has been created to look "absolutely realistic", taking visitors' imagination to a "fantastic past".&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', New York, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1986, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; This false reality creates an illusion and makes it more desirable for people to buy this reality. Disneyland works in a system that enables visitors to feel that technology and the created atmosphere "can give us more reality than nature can".&lt;ref&gt;Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The "fake nature" of Disneyland satisfies our imagination and daydream fantasies in real life.The idea is that nothing in this world is real. Nothing is original, but all are endless copies of reality. Since we do not imagine the reality of simulations, both imagined and real are equally hyperreal, for example, the numerous simulated rides, including the submarine ride and the Mississippi boat tour.&lt;ref name="Laughey, D. 2010"/&gt; When entering Disneyland, consumers form into lines to gain access to each attraction. Then they are ordered by people with special uniforms to follow the rules, such as where to stand or where to sit. If the consumers follow each rule correctly, they can enjoy "the real thing" and see things that are not available to them outside of Disneyland's doors.&lt;ref&gt;Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'', Baudrillard argues the "imaginary world" of Disneyland magnetizes people inside and has been presented as "imaginary" to make people believe that all its surroundings are "real". But he believes that the Los Angeles area is not real; thus it is hyperreal. Disneyland is a set of apparatuses which tries to bring imagination and fiction to what is called "real". This concerns the American values and way of life in a sense and "concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, "Simulacra and Simulations," in ''Selected Writings'', Mark Poster, ed. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Disneyland imaginary is neither true or false: it is a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real. Whence the debility, the infantile degeneration of this imaginary. It's meant to be an infantile world, in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the "real" world, and to conceal the fact that real childishness is everywhere, particularly among those adults who go there to act the child in order to foster illusions of their real childishness."&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, "Simulacra and Simulations," pp. 166-184&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts}}

An '''incest taboo ''' is any [[Convention (norm)|cultural rule]] or [[Norm (social)|norm]] that prohibits [[Human sexual activity|sexual relations]] between closely related persons. [[Cultural universal|All human cultures]] have norms that exclude certain close relatives from those considered suitable or permissible [[Sexual partner|sexual]] or [[marriage]] partners, making such relationships [[taboo]]. However, different norms exist among cultures as to which blood relations are permissible as sexual partners and which are not. The sexual relations between related persons which are subject to the taboo are called [[Incest|incestuous relationship]]s.

Some cultures proscribed sexual relations between [[clan]]-members, even when no traceable biological relationship exists, while members of other clans are permissible irrespective of the existence of a biological relationship. In many cultures, certain types of cousin relations are preferred as sexual and marital partners, whereas in others these are taboo. Some cultures permit sexual and marital relations between aunts/uncles and nephews/nieces. In some instances, brother–sister marriages have been practiced by the elites with some regularity. Parent–child and sibling–sibling unions are almost universally taboo.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tapestry of Culture An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology'', Ninth Edition, Abraham Rosman, Paula G. Rubel, Maxine Weisgrau, 2009, AltaMira Press. {{ISBN|9780759111394}}. p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source of the taboo==
Debate about the origin of the incest taboo has often been framed as a question of whether it is based in [[nature or nurture]].

One explanation sees the incest taboo as a cultural implementation of a biologically evolved preference for sexual partners with whom one is unlikely to share genes, since [[inbreeding]] may have detrimental outcomes. The most widely held hypothesis proposes that the so-called [[Westermarck effect]] discourages adults from engaging in sexual relations with individuals with whom they grew up. The existence of the Westermarck effect has achieved some empirical support.&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005&gt;''Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century'', Arthur P. Wolf and William H. Durham (Editors),  Stanford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0804751414}}. Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

Another school argues that the incest prohibition is a cultural construct which arises as a side effect of a general human preference for group [[exogamy]], which arises because intermarriage between groups construct valuable [[Alliance theory|alliances]] that improve the ability for both groups to thrive. According to this view, the incest taboo is not necessarily universal, but is likely to arise and become more strict under cultural circumstances that favour exogamy over [[endogamy]], and likely to become more lax under circumstances that favor endogamy. This hypothesis has also achieved some empirical support.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Limits to biological evolution of taboo===
While it is theoretically possible that [[natural selection]] may, under certain [[genetics|genetic]] circumstances, select for individuals that [[instinct]]ively avoid mating with (close) relatives, biological evolution cannot select for punishing others for incest, since even genetically weakened, [[inbreeding|inbred]] individuals are better watchposts against [[predator]]s than none at all, and weak individuals are useful for the stronger individuals in the group as looking out for predators without being able to seriously compete with the stronger individuals.&lt;ref&gt;E. O. Wilson, Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, New York, Knopf, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design, Richard Dawkins, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Punishing both parties in an incestous relation cannot even be beneficial for the genes of individuals punishing a somewhat more distant relative for mating with a closer relative, since punishing the closer relative as well is counterproductive to any function of protecting the closer relative and the health of its offspring (in a context where predation and [[starvation]] are significant factors, as opposed to a rich [[welfare state]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gorrell J.C., McAdam A.G., Coltman D.W., Humphries M.M., Boutin S., Jamieson C.; McAdam, Andrew G.; Coltman, David W.; Humphries, Murray M.; Boutin, Stan (June 2010). "Adopting kin enhances inclusive fitness in asocial red squirrels". Nature Communications 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Sewall (1922). "Coefficients of inbreeding and relationship". American Naturalist 56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic sexual attraction]] theory is also incompatible with the theory of [[Odor|smell]] being a significant factor in avoiding inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;Smelling Away: How the sense the smell can influence our behavior, Lorena Vernaz Asadi, Park university&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on the taboo==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}

Modern [[anthropology]] developed at a time when a great many human societies were illiterate, and much of the research on incest taboos has taken place in societies without legal codes, and, therefore, without written laws concerning marriage and incest. Nevertheless, anthropologists have found that the institution of marriage, and rules concerning appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, exist in every society.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 250, 253&lt;/ref&gt; The following excerpt from ''Notes and Queries on Anthropology'' (1951), a well-established field manual for [[ethnographic]] research, illustrates the scope of ethnographic investigation into the matter:

{{quote|''Incest is sexual intercourse between individuals related in certain prohibited degrees of [[kinship]].'' In every society there are rules prohibiting incestuous unions, both as to sexual intercourse and recognized marriage. The two prohibitions do not necessarily coincide. There is no uniformity as to which degrees are involved in the prohibitions. The rules regulating incest must be investigated in every society by means of the [[Genealogical Method]]. The prohibition may be so narrow as to include only one type of parent–child relationship (though this is very rare), or those within the elementary family; or so wide as to include all with whom genealogical or classificatory kinship can be traced. The more usual practice is that unions with certain relatives only are considered incestuous, the relationships being regulated by the type of descent emphasized. In some societies unions with certain persons related by [[affinity (law)|affinity]] are also considered incestuous.

What penalties fall on (a) the individuals concerned; (b) the community as a whole? Are such penalties enforced by authority, or are they believed to ensure automatically by all action of supernatural force?  Is there any correlation between the severity of the penalty and the nearness of the blood-tie of the partners in guilt? Should children be born as the result of incestuous unions, how are they treated? Are there any methods, ritual or legal, by which persons who fall within the prohibited degrees and wish to marry can break the relationship and become free to marry?&lt;ref&gt;A Committee of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, 1951. ''Notes and Queries on Anthropology'', 6th edition. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, Ltd. p. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As this excerpt suggests, anthropologists distinguish between social norms and actual social behavior; much social theory explores the difference and relationship between the two. For example, what is the purpose of prohibitions that are routinely violated (as for example when people claim that incest is taboo yet engage in incestuous behavior)?

It should be further noted that in these theories anthropologists are generally concerned solely with brother–sister incest, and are not claiming that all sexual relations among family members are taboo or even necessarily considered incestuous by that society. These theories are further complicated by the fact that in many societies people related to one another in different ways, and sometimes distantly, are classified together as siblings, and others who are just as closely related genetically are not considered family members.

Moreover, the definition restricts itself to sexual intercourse; this does not mean that other forms of sexual contact do not occur, or are proscribed, or prescribed. For example, in some Inuit societies in the Arctic, and traditionally in [[Bali]], mothers would routinely stroke the penises of their infant sons; such behavior was considered no more sexual than breast-feeding.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Jean Louise ''Never in anger: portrait of an Eskimo family'' 1970 Harvard University Press, Cambridge (Mass.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bateson, ''Steps to an ecology of mind: collected essays in anthropology, psychiatry, evolution, and epistemology'' preface by Mark Engel 1972 Chandler, San Francisco 112–115&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that, in these theories, anthropologists are primarily concerned with marriage rules and not actual sexual behavior. In short, anthropologists were not studying "incest" per se; they were asking informants what they meant by "incest", and what the consequences of "incest" were, in order to map out social relationships within the community.

This excerpt also suggests that the relationship between sexual and marriage practices is complex, and that societies distinguish between different sorts of prohibitions. In other words, although an individual may be prohibited from marrying or having sexual relations with many people, different sexual relations may be prohibited for different reasons, and with different penalties.

For example, [[Trobriand Islanders]] prohibit both sexual relations between a woman and her brother,&lt;ref&gt;Bronislow Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 389, 392&lt;/ref&gt; and between a woman and her father,&lt;ref name=Malinowski29&gt;Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 384&lt;/ref&gt; but they describe these prohibitions in very different ways: relations between a woman and her brother fall within the category of forbidden relations among members of the same clan; relations between a woman and her father do not.&lt;ref name=Malinowski29/&gt; This is because the Trobrianders are matrilineal; children belong to the clan of their mother and not of their father. Thus, sexual relations between a man and his mother's sister (and mother's sister's daughter) are also considered incestuous, but relations between a man and his father's sister are not.&lt;ref&gt;Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 450–451&lt;/ref&gt;  A man and his father's sister will often have a flirtatious relationship, and, far from being taboo, Trobriand society encourages a man and his father's sister or the daughter of his father's sister to have sexual relations or marry.&lt;ref&gt;Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 449–450&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instinctual and genetic explanations===
{{technical|section|date=August 2015}}
An explanation for the taboo is that it is due to an instinctual, inborn aversion that would lower the adverse [[Heredity|genetic effects]] of [[inbreeding]] such as a higher incidence of congenital [[birth defect]]s (see article [[Inbreeding depression]]). Since the rise of modern genetics, belief in this theory has grown.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Richard 1977 "Natural Selection and the Analyusis of Human Sociology" in ''The Changing Scenes in the Natural Sciences, 1776–1976'' pp. 283–337 Academy of Natural Science Special Publication 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bittles | display-authors = etal  | year = 1991 | title = Reproductive Behavior and Health in Consangueneous Marriages | url = | journal = Science | volume = 2 | issue = 52| pages = 789–794 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/ng1094-117"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bittles | first1 = A.

The increase in frequency of birth defects often attributed to inbreeding results directly from an increase in the frequency of homozygous alleles inherited by the offspring of inbred couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Livingstone | first1 = Frank B | year = 1969 | title = Genetics, Ecology, and the Origins of Incest and Exogamy | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 45–62 | doi=10.1086/201009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to an increase in homozygous allele frequency within a population, and results in diverging effects. Should a child inherit the version of homozygous alleles responsible for a birth defect from its parents, the birth defect will be expressed; on the other hand, should the child inherit the version of homozygous alleles not responsible for a birth defect, it would actually decrease the ratio of the allele version responsible for the birth defect in that population. The overall consequences of these diverging effects depends in part on the size of the population. In small populations, as long as children born with inheritable birth defects die (or are killed) before they reproduce, the ultimate effect of inbreeding will be to ''decrease'' the frequency of defective genes in the population; over time, the gene pool will be healthier. However, in larger populations, it is more likely that large numbers of carriers will survive and mate, leading to more constant rates of birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, Nancy, ed. 1993 ''The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding''. Chicago: UNiversity of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; Besides recessive genes, there are also other reasons why inbreeding may be harmful, such as a narrow range of certain [[immune system]]s genes in a population increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases (see [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection]]). The biological costs of incest also depend largely on the degree of genetic proximity between the two relatives engaging in incest. This fact may explain why the cultural taboo generally includes prohibitions against sex between close relatives but less often includes prohibitions against sex between more distal relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antfolk|first1=Jan|last2=Lieberman|first2=Debra|last3=Santtila|first3=Pekka|title=Fitness Costs Predict Inbreeding Aversion Irrespective of Self-Involvement: Support for Hypotheses Derived from Evolutionary Theory|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2012|volume=7|issue=11|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613|pages=e50613|pmid=23209792|pmc=3509093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children born of close relatives have decreased survival.&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/ng1094-117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moral"/&gt; Many mammal species, including humanity's closest [[primate]] relatives, avoid incest.&lt;ref name="WolfDurham2005"/&gt;

The [[Westermarck effect]], first proposed by [[Edvard Westermarck]] in 1891, is the theory that children reared together, regardless of biological relationship, form a sentimental attachment that is by its nature non-erotic.&lt;ref&gt;Westermarck, Edvard A. (1921). ''The history of human marriage'', 5th edn. London: Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melford Spiro]] argued that his observations that unrelated children reared together on Israeli Kibbutzim nevertheless avoided one another as sexual partners confirmed the Westermarck effect.&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, M. (1965). Children of the Kibbutz. New York: Schocken.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Shepher in a study examined the second generation in a kibbutz and found no marriages and no sexual activity between the adolescents in the same peer group. This was not enforced but voluntary. Looking at the second generation adults in all kibbutzim, out of a total of 2769 marriages, none were between those of the same peer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepher | first1 = J. | title = Mate selection among second generation kibbutz adolescents and adults: Incest avoidance and negative imprinting | doi = 10.1007/BF01638058 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 293–307 | year = 1971 | pmid =  24179077| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a book review by John Hartung of a book by Shepher, out of 2516 marriages documented in Israel, 200 were between couples reared in the same kibbutz. These marriages occurred after young adults reared on kibbutzim had served in the military and encountered tens of thousands of other potential mates, and 200 marriages is higher than what would be expected by chance. Of these 200 marriages, five were between men and women who had been reared together for the first six years of their lives, which would argue against the Westermarck effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartung | first1 = John | year = 1985 | title = Review of ''Incest: A Biological View'' by J.

''Sexual attraction and childhood association: a Chinese
brief for Edward Westermarck''. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is looking at moral objections to third-party incest. This increases the longer a child has grown up together with another child of the opposite sex. This occurs even if the other child is genetically unrelated.&lt;ref name=moral/&gt; Humans have been argued to have a special kin detection system that besides the incest taboo also regulates a tendency towards [[altruism]] towards kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = D. | last2 = Tooby | first2 = J. | last3 = Cosmides | first3 = L. | doi = 10.1038/nature05510 | title = The architecture of human kin detection | journal = Nature | volume = 445 | issue = 7129 | pages = 727–731 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17301784| pmc = 3581061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One objection against an instinctive and genetic basis for the incest taboo is that incest does occur.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicchetti and Carlson eds. 1989 ''Child Maltreatment: Theory and Research on the Causes and Consequences of Child Abuse and Neglect. New York, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glaser and Frosh 1988 ''Child and Sexual Abuse'' Chicago: Dorsey Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists have also argued that the social construct "incest" (and the incest taboo) is not the same thing as the biological phenomenon of "inbreeding". For example, there is equal genetic relation between a man and the daughter of his father's sister and between a man and the daughter of his mother's sister, such that biologists would consider mating incestuous in both instances, but Trobrianders consider mating incestuous in one case and not in the other. Anthropologists have documented a great number of societies where marriages between some first cousins are prohibited as incestuous, while marriages between other first cousins are encouraged. Therefore, it is argued that the prohibition against incestuous relations in most societies is not based on or motivated by concerns over biological closeness.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies on cousin marriages have found support for a biological basis for the taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kushnick | first1 = G. | last2 = Fessler | first2 = D.

===Sociological explanations===
[[Psychoanalytic theory]]—in particular, the claimed existence of an [[Oedipus complex]], which is not an instinctual aversion against incest but an instinctual desire—has influenced many theorists seeking to explain the incest taboo using sociological theories.&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005/&gt;

====Exogamy====
The anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] developed a general argument for the universality of the incest taboo in human societies. His argument begins with the claim that the incest taboo is in effect a prohibition against [[endogamy]], and the effect is to encourage [[exogamy]]. Through exogamy, otherwise unrelated households or lineages will form relationships through marriage, thus strengthening social solidarity. That is, Lévi-Strauss views marriage as an exchange of women between two social groups. This theory is based in part on [[Marcel Mauss]]'s theory of ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]'', which (in Lévi-Strauss' words) argued:

{{quote|that exchange in primitive societies consists not so much in economic transactions as in reciprocal gifts, that these reciprocal gifts have a far more important function than in our own, and that this primitive form of exchange is not merely nor essentially of an economic nature but is what he aptly calls "a total social fact", that is, an event which has a significance that is at once social and religious, magic and economic, utilitarian and sentimental, jural and moral.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is also based on Lévi-Strauss's analysis of data on different kinship systems and marriage practices documented by anthropologists and historians. Lévi-Strauss called attention specifically to data collected by [[Margaret Mead]] during her research among the [[Arapesh]]. When she asked if a man ever sleeps with his sister, Arapesh replied: "No we don't sleep with our sisters. We give our sisters to other men, and other men give us their sisters." Mead pressed the question repeatedly, asking what would happen if a brother and sister did have sex with one another. Lévi-Strauss quotes the Arapesh response:

{{quote|What, you would like to marry your sister? What is the matter with you anyway? Don't you want a brother-in-law? Don't you realize that if you marry another man's sister and another man marries your sister, you will have at least two brothers-in-law, while if you marry your own sister you will have none? With whom will you hunt, with whom will you garden, who will you visit?&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969  ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 485&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By applying Mauss's theory to data such as Mead's, Lévi-Strauss proposed what he called [[alliance theory]]. He argued that, in "primitive" societies, marriage is not fundamentally a relationship between a man and a woman, but a transaction involving a woman that forges a relationship—an alliance—between two men.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 492-496&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' takes this as a starting point and uses it to analyze kinship systems of increasing complexity found in so-called primitive societies (that is, those not based on agriculture, class inequalities, and centralized government).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This theory was debated intensely by anthropologists in the 1950s. It appealed to many because it used the study of incest taboos and marriage to answer more fundamental research interests of anthropologists at the time: how can an anthropologist map out the social relationships within a given community, and how do these relationships promote or endanger social solidarity?&lt;ref&gt;H. Befu "Social Exchange" in ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Volume 6, Page 255–281, Oct 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.G. Peletz "Kinship Studies in Late Twentieth-Century Anthropology" in ''Annual Review of Anthropology.'' Volume 24, Page 343–372, Oct 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, anthropologists never reached a consensus, and with the [[Vietnam War]] and the process of [[decolonization]] in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, anthropological interests shifted away from mapping local social relationships.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Some anthropologists argue that nuclear family incest avoidance can be explained in terms of the ecological, demographic, and economic benefits of exogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leavitt | first1 = Gregory | year = 1989 | title = Disappearance of the Incest Taboo | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 116–131 | doi=10.1525/aa.1989.91.1.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Lévi-Strauss generally discounted the relevance of alliance theory in Africa, a particularly strong concern for incest is a fundamental issue among the age systems of East Africa. Here, the avoidance between men of an age-set and their daughters is altogether more intense than in any other sexual avoidance. Paraphrasing Lévi-Strauss's argument, without this avoidance, the rivalries for power between age-sets, coupled with the close bonds of sharing between age-mates, could lead to a sharing of daughters as spouses. Young men entering the age system would then find a dire shortage of marriageable girls, and extended families would be in danger of dying out. Thus, by parading this avoidance of their daughters, senior men make these girls available for younger age-sets and their marriages form alliances that mitigate the rivalries for power.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Paul. 1988. ''The Maasai of Matapato: a Study of Rituals of Rebellion'', Manchester University Press, Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endogamy====
Exogamy between households or descent groups is typically prescribed in [[Classless society|classless societies]]. Societies that are stratified—that is, divided into unequal classes—often prescribe different degrees of endogamy. Endogamy is the opposite of exogamy; it refers to the practice of marriage between members of the same social group. A classic example is [[India]]'s [[caste system]], in which unequal castes are endogamous.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 250, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Inequality between [[ethnic group]]s and [[Race (classification of humans)|races]] also correlates with endogamy.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt; Class, caste, ethnic, and racial endogamy typically coexists with family exogamy and prohibitions against incest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

An extreme example of this principle, and an exception to the incest taboo, is found among members of the ruling class in certain ancient states, such as the Inca, Egypt, China, and Hawaii; brother–sister marriage (usually between half-siblings) was a means of maintaining wealth and political power within one family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bixler | first1 = Ray | year = 1982 | title = Comment on the Incidence and Purpose of Royal Sibling Incest | url = | journal = American Ethnologist | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 580–582 | doi=10.1525/ae.1982.9.3.02a00100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have argued that in Roman-governed Egypt this practice was also found among commoners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Ashley | last = Jones | title = Incest in Ancient Egypt | url = http://cnersundergraduatejournal.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/incest_in_ancient_egypt_revised_.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Strong | first = Anise | title = Incest Laws and Absent Taboos in Roman Egypt | journal = Ancient History Bulletin | volume = 20 | year = 2006 | url = https://www.academia.edu/205164/Incest_Laws_and_Absent_Taboos_in_Roman_Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = N. | title = Life in Egypt under Roman Rule | isbn = 0-19-814848-8 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] | year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frier |first=Bruce W. |last2=Bagnall |first2=Roger S. |author2-link=Roger S.

An '''institute of technology''' (also: '''university of technology''', '''polytechnic university''', '''technikon''' and '''technical university''') is a type of [[university]] which specializes in [[engineering]], [[technology]], [[applied science]] and sometimes [[natural science]]s.  

The English term '''polytechnic''' appeared in the early 19th century, from the French ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', an engineering school founded in 1794 in [[Paris]]. The [[French language|French]] term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''πολύ'' (''polú'' or ''polý'') meaning "many" and ''τεχνικός'' (''tekhnikós'') meaning "arts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=polytechnic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutes of technology versus polytechnics==
The institutes of technology and polytechnics have been in existence since at least the 18th century, but became popular after [[World War II]] with the expansion of engineering and applied science education, associated with the new needs created by [[industrialization]]. The world's first institution of technology, the Berg-Schola (today its legal successor is the [[University of Miskolc]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uni-miskolc.hu/uni/univ/booklet/MandU.html | title = Misckolc and the University | date = | publisher = Miskolci Egyetem (University of Miskolci) | access-date = 29 October 2017}}{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was founded by the Court Chamber of Vienna in [[Selmecbánya]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Banská Štiavnica]], [[Slovakia]]), in 1735 in order to train specialists of precious metal and copper mining according to the requirements of the industrial revolution in Hungary. The oldest German Institute of Technology is the [[Braunschweig University of Technology]], founded in 1745 as "Collegium Carolinum". Another exception is the ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', which has educated [[France|French]] ''élites'' since its foundation in 1794. In some cases, polytechnics or institutes of technology are engineering schools or technical colleges.

In several countries, like Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey, institutes of technology and polytechnics are institutions of [[higher education]] and have been accredited to award academic degrees and doctorates. Famous examples are the [[Istanbul Technical University]], [[ETH Zurich]], [[İYTE]], [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[RWTH Aachen]], all considered universities.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In countries like Iran, Finland, Malaysia, Portugal, Singapore or the United Kingdom, there is often a significant and confused distinction between polytechnics and universities. In the UK a binary system of higher education emerged consisting of universities (research orientation) and polytechnics (engineering and applied science and professional practice orientation).  Polytechnics offered university equivalent degrees mainly in [[Science, technology, engineering and mathematics|STEM]] subjects from [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's]] and [[PhD]] that were validated and governed at the national level by the independent UK [[Council for National Academic Awards]]. In 1992 UK polytechnics were designated as universities which meant they could award their own degrees. The CNAA was disbanded. The UK's first polytechnic, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the [[University of Westminster]]), was founded in 1838 in Regent Street, London. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the term "institute of technology" is the more favored synonym of a "[[regional technical college]]" though the latter is the legally correct term; however, [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] is a university in all but name as it can confer degrees in accordance with law, [[Cork Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.hetac.ie/docs/Cork%20IT-DA%20Evaluation%20Group%20Report.pdf | title = Report of the Delegated Authority Evaluation Group on the Cork Institute of Technology | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912200434/http://www.hetac.ie/docs/Cork%20IT-DA%20Evaluation%20Group%20Report.pdf | archive-date=September 12, 2008 | format = PDF | date = June 2005 | author = Evaluation Group for the Delegation of Authority to Make Awards | publisher = Higher Education and Training Awards Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Institutes of Technology have delegated authority from HETAC to make awards to and including master's degree level — Level 9 of the Republic of Ireland's National Framework for Qualifications (NFQ) — for all areas of study and Doctorate level in a number of others.

In a number of countries, although being today generally considered similar institutions of higher learning across many countries, polytechnics and institutes of technology used to have a quite different statute among each other, its teaching competences and organizational history.  In many cases "polytechnic" were elite technological universities concentrating on applied science and engineering and may also be a former designation for a vocational institution, before it has been granted the exclusive right to award academic degrees and can be truly called an "institute of technology". A number of polytechnics providing higher education is simply a result of a formal upgrading from their original and historical role as intermediate technical education schools. In some situations, former polytechnics or other non-university institutions have emerged solely through an administrative change of statutes, which often included a name change with the introduction of new designations like "institute of technology", "polytechnic university", "[[university of applied sciences]]", or "university of technology" for marketing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Argentina===
{{See also|Education in Argentina|List of universities in Argentina}}

In the so-called ''[[Latin American docta]]'' the main higher institution advocates to the study of technology is the [[National Technological University]] which has brand ramifications through all the country geographic space in the way of ''Regional Faculties''. The [[Buenos Aires Institute of Technology]] (ITBA) is other important recognized institute of technology with renowned and prestige in the country.

===Australia===
{{See also|Education in Australia|Technical and Further Education|College of Advanced Education|Category:Australian tertiary institutions}}

;1970s–1990s
During the 1970s to early 1990s, the term was used to describe state owned and funded technical schools that offered both [[vocational education|vocational]] and higher education. They were part of the [[College of advanced education|College of Advanced Education]] system. In the 1990s most of these merged with existing universities, or formed new ones of their own. These new universities often took the title University of Technology, for marketing rather than legal purposes. AVCC report The most prominent such university in each state founded the [[Australian Technology Network]] a few years later.

;1990s–today
Since the mid-1990s, the term has been applied to some technically minded [[technical and further education]] (TAFE) institutes. A recent example is the [[Melbourne Polytechnic]]  rebranding and repositioning in 2014 from Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE.&lt;ref&gt;Kylie Adoranti, Herald Sun, 3 October 2014 ''[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/news/northern-melbourne-institute-of-tafe-to-be-rebranded-as-melbourne-polytechnic/story-fnglekhp-1227078125350 Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE to be rebranded as Melbourne Polytechnic]'', Retrieved 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These primarily offer [[vocational education]], although some like Melbourne Polytechnic are expanding into higher education offering vocationally oriented applied bachelor degrees. This usage of the term is most prevalent historically in NSW and the ACT. The new terminology is apt given that this category of institution are becoming very much like the institutes of the 1970s–1990s period.

In Tasmania in 2009 the old college system and TAFE Tasmania have started a 3-year restructure to become the Tasmanian Polytechnic www.polytechnic.tas.edu.au, Tasmanian Skills Institute www.skillsinstitute.tas.edu.au and Tasmanian Academy www.academy.tas.edu.au

In the higher education sector, there are seven designated Universities of Technology in Australia (though, note, not all use the phrase "university of technology", such as the Universities of Canberra and South Australia, which used to be Colleges of Advanced Education before transitioning into fully-fledged universities with the ability - most important of all - to confer doctorates):
* [[Curtin University]], [[Western Australia]]
* [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[Queensland]]
* [[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]
* [[Swinburne University of Technology]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]
* [[University of Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]]
* [[University of South Australia]], [[South Australia]]
* [[University of Technology, Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]

* [[Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt]] (Faculty of Technical Sciences founded 2007)


;Fachhochschulen
'''[[Fachhochschule]]''' is a German type of tertiary education institution and adopted later in Austria and Switzerland. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor's degrees and master's degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2010, there were 20 Fachhochschulen in Austria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mokka Medienagentur GmbH |url=http://www.bmwf.gv.at/startseite/hochschulen/fachhochschulen/ |title=Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung: Fachhochschulen |publisher=Bmwf.gv.at |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119223842/http://www.bmwf.gv.at/startseite/hochschulen/fachhochschulen/ |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium and the Netherlands===
''Hogeschool'' is used in [[Belgium]] and in the [[Netherlands]]. The hogeschool has many similarities to the ''Fachhochschule'' in the German language areas and to the ''ammattikorkeakoulu'' in Finland.

''Hogeschool'' institutions in the [[Flemish Community]] of Belgium (such as the [[Erasmus Hogeschool Brussel]]) are currently undergoing a process of academization. They form associations with a university and integrate research into the curriculum, which will allow them to deliver academic master's degrees. &lt;!-- Don't the Walloon universities do the same?--&gt;

In the Netherlands, four former institutes of technology have become universities over the past decades. These are the current three Technical Universities (at [[Delft University of Technology|Delft]], [[Eindhoven University of Technology|Eindhoven]] and [[Universiteit Twente|Enschede]]), plus the former agricultural institute in [[Wageningen University|Wageningen]]. A list of all ''hogescholen'' in the Netherlands, including some which might be called polytechnics, can be found [[List of universities in the Netherlands#Vocational universities|here]].

===Canada===
In Canada, there are affiliate schools, colleges, institutes of technology/polytechnic institutes and universities that offer instruction in a variety of programs that can lead to engineering and applied science degrees, apprenticeship and trade programs, certificates and diplomas. Affiliate schools are polytechnic divisions belonging to a national university and offer select technical and engineering programs. Colleges, institutes of technology/polytechnic institutes and universities tend to be independent institutions.

Credentials are typically conferred at the undergraduate level; however, university-affiliated schools like the École de technologie supérieure and the École Polytechnique de Montréal (both of which are located in Quebec), also offer graduate and postgraduate programs, in accordance with provincial higher education guidelines. Canadian higher education institutions, at all levels, undertake directed and applied research with financing allocated through public funding, private equity, or industry sources.

Some of Canada's most esteemed colleges and polytechnic institutions also partake in collaborative institute-industry projects, leading to technology commercialization, made possible through the scope of [[Polytechnics Canada]], a national alliance of eleven leading research-intensive colleges and institutes of technology.

;Affiliate schools

===Finland===
;Universities of technology
Universities of technology are categorised as universities, are allowed to grant B.Sc. (Tech.), [[Diplomi-insinööri|M.Sc. (Tech.)]], Lic.Sc. (Tech.), Ph.D. and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees and roughly correspond to Instituts de technologie of French-speaking areas and Technische Universität of Germany in prestige. In addition to universities of technology, some universities, e.g. University of Oulu and Åbo Akademi University, are allowed to grant the B.Sc. (tech.), M.Sc. (tech.) and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees.

Universities of technology are academically similar to other (non-polytechnic) universities. Prior to Bologna process, M.Sc. (Tech.) required 180 credits, whereas M.Sc. from a normal university required 160 credits. The credits between universities of technology and normal universities are comparable.

Some Finnish universities of technology are:
*[[Aalto University]], formed from [[Helsinki University of Technology]] and other universities
*[[Lappeenranta University of Technology]]
*[[Tampere University of Technology]]

;Polytechnics
Polytechnic schools are distinct from academic universities in Finland. ''[[Ammattikorkeakoulu]]'' is the common term in [[Finland]], as is the Swedish alternative "''yrkeshögskola''" – their focus is on studies leading to a degree (for instance ''insinööri'', engineer; in international use, Bachelor of Engineering) in kind different from but in level comparable to an academic bachelor's degree awarded by a university. Since 2006 the polytechnics have offered studies leading to master's degrees (Master of Engineering).  After January 1, 2006, some Finnish ammattikorkeakoulus switched the English term "polytechnic" to the term "university of applied sciences" in the English translations of their legal names. The ammattikorkeakoulu has many similarities to the ''hogeschool'' in Belgium and in the Netherlands and to the ''Fachhochschule'' in the German language areas.

Some recognized Finnish polytechnics are:
*[[Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Lapland University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Tampere University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Turku University of Applied Sciences]]

A complete list may be found in [[List of polytechnics in Finland]].

===France and Francophone regions===

;Instituts de technologie (grandes écoles)
[[Collegiate university|Collegiate universities]] grouping several engineering schools or multi-site clusters of French [[grandes écoles]] provide sciences and technology curricula as autonomous higher education engineering institutes. They include:
* [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]]
* [[Centrale Graduate School]]
* [[Grenoble Institute of Technology]]
* [[Institut national des sciences appliquées]]
* [[Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace]]
* [[Paris Institute of Technology]]
* [[ESTIA Institute of Technology]]
They provide science and technology master's degrees and doctoral degrees.

;'Universités technologiques / instituts universitaires de technologie'' / polytechs
French education system also includes three universities of technology:
*''[[Université de technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard]]''
*[[University of Technology of Compiègne]]
*[[University of Technology of Troyes]]

In addition, France's education system includes many institutes of technology, embedded within most French universities. They are referred-to as ''institut universitaire de technologie'' (IUT). Instituts universitaires de technologie provide undergraduate technology curricula. 'Polytech institutes', embedded as a part of eleven French universities provide both undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula.

In the French-speaking part of Switzerland exists also the term ''haute école specialisée'' for a type of institution called ''Fachhochschule'' in the German-speaking part of the country. (see below).

;Écoles polytechniques
Higher education systems, that are influenced by the French education system set at the end of the 18th century, use a terminology derived by reference to the French ''[[École polytechnique]]''. Such terms include ''Écoles Polytechniques'' (Algeria, Belgium, Canada, France, Switzerland, Tunisia), Escola Politécnica (Brasil, Spain), Polytechnicum (Eastern Europe).

In [[French language]], higher education refers to ''écoles polytechniques'', providing science and engineering curricula:
* [[École polytechnique]] or '''X''' (near [[Paris]])
* École polytechnique de Bruxelles
* [[École polytechnique de Montréal]]
* [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]]
*[[National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine]]
*[[National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse]]

===Germany===
;Fachhochschule{{Main|Fachhochschule}}

''Fachhochschulen'' were first founded in the early 1970s. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor's degrees and master's degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2009/10, there existed about 200 ''Fachhochschulen'' in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Statistiken/BildungForschungKultur/Hochschulen/AktuellZusatz,templateId=renderPrint.psml#Fussnote1|title=Startseite&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis)|work=destatis.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[:de:Liste der Fachhochschulen in Deutschland|German Wikipedia]] for a list.

;Technische Universität
''[[Technische Universität]]'' (abbreviation: ''TU'') is the common term for universities of technology or technical university. These institutions can grant habilitation and doctoral degrees and focus on research.

The nine largest and most renowned ''Technische Universitäten'' in Germany have formed [[TU9|TU9 German Institutes of Technology]] as community of interests. Technische Universitäten normally have faculties or departements of natural sciences and often of economics but can also have units of cultural and social sciences and arts. RWTH Aachen, TU Dresden and TU München also have a faculty of medicine associated with [[Teaching hospital|university hospitals]] ([[Klinikum Aachen]], [[University Hospital Dresden]], [[Rechts der Isar Hospital]]).

There are 17 universities of technology in Germany with about 290,000 students enrolled. The four states of [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]] are not operating a ''Technische Universität''. [[Saxony]] and [[Lower Saxony]] have the highest counts of ''TUs'', while in Saxony three out of four universities are universities of technology.

===Ireland===
{{see |Institutes of technology in Ireland}}
An "Institute of Technology" was formerly referred to as Regional Technical College (RTCs) system. The abbreviation '''IT''' is now widely used to refer to an Institute of Technology. These institutions offer sub-degree, degree and post-graduate level studies. Unlike the Irish university system an Institute of Technology also offers sub-degree programmes such as 2-year [[Higher Certificate]] programme in various academic fields of study. Some institutions have "delegated authority" that allows them to make awards in their own name, after authorisation by the [[Higher Education &amp; Training Awards Council]].

[[Dublin Institute of Technology]] developed separately from the Regional Technical College system and after several decades of association with the [[University of Dublin, Trinity College]] it acquired the authority to confer its own degrees before becoming a member of the T.U. Dublin.

The IOTI, is the representative body for the various Institutes of Technology in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ioti.ie/ Institutes of Technology Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Politecnico di Torino]], established 1859;
* [[Politecnico di Milano]], established 1863.
A third ''Politecnico'' was added in the south in 1990:
* [[Politecnico di Bari]], established 1990.
However, many other universities have a faculty of engineering.

In 2003, the [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of Education, Universities and Research]] and the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)|Ministry of Economy and Finance]] jointly established the [[Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia]] (Italian Institute of Technology), headquartered in [[Genoa]] with 10 laboratories around Italy, which however focuses on research, not entirely in the fields of engineering and does not offer undergraduate degrees.

;Technical University
There are 4 technical universities in Malaysia and all are belongs to [[Malaysian Technical University Network]]: 
*[[Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia]]
*[[Universiti Malaysia Perlis]]
*[[Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka]]
*[[Universiti Malaysia Pahang]]

===Mauritius===
The only technical university in [[Mauritius]] is the [[University of Technology, Mauritius]] with its main campus situated in La Tour Koenig, Pointe aux Sables. It has a specialized mission with a technology focus. It applies traditional and beyond traditional approaches to teaching, training, research and consultancy. The university has been founded with the aim to play a key role in the economic and social development of Mauritius through the development of programmes of direct relevance to the country’s needs, for example in areas like technology, sustainable development science and public sector policy and management.

===Moldova===
{{See also|Education in Moldova}}

* [[Technical University of Moldova]], 1964

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Public sector organisations in New Zealand#Polytechnics and institutes of technology|Education in New Zealand}}

[[New Zealand]] polytechnics are established under the Education Act 1989 as amended and are typically considered state-owned tertiary institutions along with [[university|universities]], colleges of education and [[wananga|wānanga]]; there is today often much crossover in courses and qualifications offered between all these types of [[Tertiary Education Institution]]s. Some have officially taken the title 'institute of technology' which is a term recognized in government strategies equal to that of the term 'polytechnic'.  One has opted for the name '[[Universal College of Learning]]' (UCOL) and another '[[Unitec New Zealand]]'. These are legal names but not recognized terms like 'polytechnic' or 'institute of technology'.  Many if not all now grant at least bachelor-level degrees. Some colleges of education or institutes of technology are privately owned, however, the qualification levels vary widely.

Since the 1990s, there has been consolidation in New Zealand's state-owned tertiary education system. In the polytechnic sector: Wellington Polytechnic amalgamated with [[Massey University]]. The Central Institute of Technology explored a merger with the [[Waikato Institute of Technology]], which was abandoned, but later, after financial concerns, controversially amalgamated with Hutt Valley Polytechnic, which in turn became [[Wellington Institute of Technology]]. Some smaller polytechnics in the [[North Island]], such as Waiarapa Polytechnic, amalgamated with [[Universal College of Learning|UCOL]]. (The only other amalgamations have been in the colleges of education.)

The [[Auckland University of Technology]] is the only polytechnic to have been elevated to [[university]] status; while [[Unitec New Zealand|Unitec]] has had repeated attempts blocked by government policy and consequent decisions; Unitec has not been able to convince the courts to overturn these decisions.

===Nigeria===
{{See also|List of polytechnics in Nigeria}}
Virtually every state in [[Nigeria]] has a polytechnic university operated by either the federal or state government. In [[Rivers State]] for example, there are two state-owned polytechnic universities; [[Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic]], [[Bori City]] and the [[Rivers State College of Arts and Science]], [[Port Harcourt]]. The former was established on 13 May 1988 while the latter–though founded in 1984–was approved by the [[National Board for Technical Education|NBTE]] in 2006. The first private polytechnic university in the state is the [[Eastern Polytechnic, Port Harcourt|Eastern Polytechnic]], established in 2008.

===Pakistan===

The polytechnic institutes in [[Pakistan]] offer [[diploma]] spanning three years in different engineering branches. This diploma is known as [[Diploma of Associate Engineering]] (DAE). Students are admitted to the diploma program based on their results in the 10th grade standardized exams. The main purpose of the diploma offered in polytechnic institutes is to train people in various trades.

These institutes are located throughout Pakistan and have been in service since early 1950s.

After successfully completion of diploma at a polytechnic, students can get employment or enroll either in [[Bachelor of Technology]] (B.Tech) or [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (BE) degree programs.

===Poland===
'''Politechnika''' (translated as a "technical university" or "university of technology") is the designation of a technical university in Poland. Here are some of the larger Polytechnics in Poland:
*[[Politechnika Śląska]]
*[[Politechnika Wrocławska]]
*[[Politechnika Warszawska]]
*[[Poznań University of Technology|Politechnika Poznańska]]

*[[West Pomeranian University of Technology|Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny]]

===Portugal===
{{Main|Polytechnic (Portugal)}}
The designation "Institute of Technology" is not applied at all, being meaningless in [[Portugal]]. However, there are a number of non-university [[list of higher education institutions in Portugal|higher educational institutions]] which are called [[Polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic institutes]] since the 1970s. Some of these institutions existed since the 19th century with different designations (industrial and commercial institutes, agricultural managers, elementary teachers and nurses schools, etc.). In theory, the polytechnics higher education system is aimed to provide a more practical training and be profession-oriented, while the university higher education system is aimed to have a stronger theoretical basis and be highly research-oriented. The polytechnics are also oriented to provide shorter length studies aimed to respond to local needs. The Portuguese polytechnics can then be compared to the US [[community colleges]].

Since the implementation of [[Bologna Process]] in Portugal in 2007, the polytechnics offer the 1st cycle (licentiate degree) and 2nd cycle (master's degree) of higher studies. Until 1998, the polytechnics only awarded bachelor ({{lang-pt|bacharelato}}) degrees (three-year short-cycle degrees) and were not authorized to award higher degrees. They however granted post-bachelor diplomas in specialized higher studies (DESE, ''diploma de estudos superiores especializados''), that could be obtained after the conclusion of a two-year second cycle of studies and were academical equivalent to the university's [[licentiate degree]]s (''licenciatura''). After 1998, they started to be allowed to confer their own licentiate degrees, which replaced the DESE diplomas.

The Polytechnics in Singapore do not offer bachelors, masters or PhD degrees. However, the Polytechnics in Singapore offers three-year diploma courses in fields such as information technology, engineering subjects and other vocational fields, like psychology and nursing. The Polytechnic diploma certification in Singapore is equivalent to a [[junior college]] in the UK or a [[community college]] in the United States. There are 5 polytechnics in Singapore. They are namely: [[Singapore Polytechnic]], [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]], [[Temasek Polytechnic]], [[Nanyang Polytechnic]] and [[Republic Polytechnic]].

A Polytechnic diploma in Singapore is known to be parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first years at a bachelor's degree-granting institution, thus, Polytechnic graduates in Singapore have the privilege of being granted transfer credits or module exemptions when they apply to local and overseas universities, depending on the university's policies on transfer credits.

The only university in Singapore with the term "institute of technology", most notably the [[Singapore Institute of Technology]] were developed in 2009 as an option for Polytechnic Diploma graduates who desire to pursue a bachelor's degree. Other technological university in Singapore includes the [[Nanyang Technological University]] (1981) and the [[Singapore University of Technology and Design]] (2009).

has completed a process of transforming its "higher education landscape". Historically a division has existed in South Africa between Universities and Technikons (polytechnics) as well between institutions servicing particular racial and language groupings. In 1993 Technikons were afforded the power to award [[Bachelor of Technology#South Africa|certain technology degrees]].
Beginning in 2004 former Technikons have either been merged with traditional Universities to form Comprehensive Universities or have become Universities of Technology, however the Universities of Technology have not to date acquired all of the traditional rights and privileges of a University (such as the ability to confer a wide range of degrees).&lt;ref&gt;Mentz, J., Kotzé, P., Van der Merwe, A.

Most of Thailand's institutes of technology were developed from [[technical college]]s, in the past could not grant bachelor's degrees; today, however, they are [[university]] level institutions, some of which can grant degrees to the [[doctorate|doctoral]] level. Examples are [[Pathumwan Institute of Technology]] (developed from Pathumwan Technical School), [[King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang]] (Nondhaburi Telecommunications Training Centre) and [[King Mongkut's Institute of Technology North Bangkok]] (Thai-German Technical School).

There are two former institutes of technology, which already changed their name to "University of Technology": [[Rajamangala University of Technology]] (formerly Institute of Technology and Vocational Education) and [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]] (Thonburi Technology Institute).

Institutes of technology with different origins are [[Asian Institute of Technology]], which developed from [[SEATO]] Graduate School of Engineering and [[Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology]], an engineering school of [[Thammasat University]]. [[Suranaree University of Technology]] is the only government-owned technological university in Thailand that was established (1989) as such; while [[Mahanakorn University of Technology]] is the most well known private technological institute.

===United Kingdom===
'''Polytechnics'''{{Main|Polytechnic (United Kingdom)}}

Polytechnics were [[tertiary education]] teaching institutions in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The comparable institutions in [[Scotland]] were collectively referred to as [[Central Institution]]s.

From 1965 to 1992, UK polytechnics operated under the [[Binary Divide|binary system]] of education along with universities.  Polytechnics offered diplomas and degrees (bachelor's, master's, PhD) validated at the national level by the [[Council for National Academic Awards]] (CNAA). They particularly excelled in engineering and applied science degree courses and other [[science, technology, engineering and mathematics|STEM]] subjects similar to technological universities in the USA and continental Europe.  Polytechnics were associated with innovations including [[women’s studies]], the academic study of [[communication studies|communications]] and [[media studies|media]], [[sandwich degree]]s and the rise of management and [[business studies]]. 

Britain's first polytechnic, the [[Royal Polytechnic Institution]] later known as the [[Polytechnic of Central London]] (now the [[University of Westminster]]) was established in 1838 at Regent Street in London and its goal was to educate and popularize engineering and scientific knowledge and inventions in Victorian Britain "at little expense."  The London Polytechnic led a mass movement to create numerous polytechnic institutes across the UK in the late 19th century.  Most polytechnic institutes were established at the centre of major metropolitan cities and their focus was on engineering, applied science and technology education.

The designation "institute of technology" was occasionally used by polytechnics (Bolton), [[Central Institution]]s (Dundee, Robert Gordon's) and postgraduate universities, (Cranfield and Wessex), most of which later adopted the designation university and there were two "institutes of science and technology": [[UMIST]] and UWIST, part of the [[University of Wales]]. [[Loughborough University]] was called Loughborough University of Technology from 1966 to 1996, the only institution in the UK to have had such a designation.

Polytechnics were granted university status under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].  This meant that polytechnics could confer degrees without the oversight of the national CNAA organization.  These institutions are sometimes referred to as [[New universities (United Kingdom)#Post-1992 universities that trace their roots to former polytechnics|post-1992 universities]].

'''Technical colleges'''

In 1956, some colleges of technology received the designation [[college of advanced technology (United Kingdom)|college of advanced technology]]. They became universities in 1966 meaning they could award their own degrees. 

Institutions called "technical institutes" or "technical schools" that were formed in the early 20th century provided further education between high school and university or polytechnic.  Most technical institutes have been merged into regional colleges and some have been designated university colleges if they are associated with a local university.

In 2016 the UK government announced plans to establish new "institutes of technology" in England as part of its reforms to post-16 skills provision "to provide technical education in STEM subjects at levels 3, 4 and 5. Each IoT is likely to build on infrastructure that already exists but will have its own independent identity, governance arrangements which directly involve employers and national branding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536068/56259_Cm_9280_print.pdf |title=Data |website=www.gov.uk |format=PDF}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Institute of Technology (United States)}}
[[Image:Teamsolvingpuzzle.jpg|thumb|Students from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]]]
Polytechnic institutes in the USA are technological universities, many dating back to the mid-19th century.  A handful of American universities include the phrases "Institute of Technology", "Polytechnic Institute", "Polytechnic University", or similar phrasing in their names; these are generally [[research]]-intensive universities with a focus on engineering, science and technology. The earliest of these institutions include: [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI, 1824), [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT, 1829), [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute]] (1854), [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]  (MIT, 1861), [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] (1865), [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] (1870), [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] (VPI or VT, 1872), [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (1881), [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (1885), [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech, 1891), [[Drexel University|Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry]] (1891) and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (1900). Conversely, schools dubbed "technical colleges" or "technical institutes" generally provide post-secondary training in technical and mechanical fields, focusing on training vocational skills primarily at a [[community college]] level, parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first two years at a bachelor's degree-granting institution.

===Venezuela===
Institutes of technology in Venezuela were developed in the 1950s as an option for post-secondary education in technical and scientific courses, after the ''polytechnic'' French concepts.  At that time, technical education was considered essential for the development of a sound [[middle class]] economy.

Nowadays, most of the ''Institutos de Tecnología'' are privately run businesses, with varying degrees of quality.

Most of these institutes award diplomas after three or three and a half years of education. The institute of technology implementation (IUT, from ''Instituto universitario de tecnologia'' in Spanish) began with the creation of the first IUT at Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela, called IUT. Dr. Federico Rivero Palacio adopted the French "Institut Universitaire de Technologie"s system, using French personnel and study system based on three-year periods, with research and engineering facilities at the same level as the main national universities to obtain French equivalent degrees. This IUT is the first and only one in Venezuela having French equivalent degrees accepted, implementing this system and observing the high-level degrees some other IUTs were created in 
Venezuela, regardless of this the term IUT was not used appropriately resulting in some institutions with mediocre quality and no equivalent degree in France. Later, some private institutions sprang up using IUT in their names, but they are not regulated by the original French system and award lower quality degrees.

[[image:IWRSuedWestAnsicht.jpg|thumb|right|200px|South west view of the '''IWR building''', located at Heidelberg's New Campus (until March 2016)]]

The '''Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing''' (short '''IWR''') is a scientific research institute of the [[Heidelberg University]], Germany. It centralizes scientific activity and promotes research and work in [[scientific computing]].
Founded in 1987 by the Heidelberg University and the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], IWR participates in joint project and cooperations with industry in Germany as well as abroad. As a research institute with about 380 staff, IWR is considered one of the world's largest research centers for scientific computing.

== Objectives ==
The main objectives of the IWR are the
* Mathematical Modeling and Computational Simulation of Complex Systems in Science and Technology,
* Development and Use of Computer Methods and Software for Applications in Industry and Economy,
* Visualization, Computer Graphics, Image Processing and the
* Education in Scientific Computing.

Within the ''Zukunftskonzept'' (institutional strategy) of the 2nd [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]] further research and application areas were exploited with a focus on [[Digital Humanities]] and [[Computational archaeology]].

== Graduate School ==
Since November 2007 the training and education of Ph.D. students at IWR is supported by the Heidelberg Graduate School of Mathematical and Computational Methods for the Sciences (HGS MathComp). As part of the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]], HGS MathComp is a supported institution partially established and located at IWR, in order to realize innovative concepts for a structured education of Ph.D. students in interdisciplinary research projects.

== History ==
The initial concept of the IWR was proposed in 1985 and accepted by the University
Senate two years later. After securing the necessary finances, the first parallel computer was purchased in 1989. The Graduiertenkolleg
"Modellierung und Wissenschaftliches Rechnen in Mathematik und Naturwissenschaften" (Modelling and Scientific Computing in Mathematics and the Sciences) was established in 1992 and evaluated by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] (DFG) in 1994 and 1998. 

The founding director is [[Willi Jäger]] managing the IWR from 1987 until 1998.  
The managing director from 1999 to 2004 was professor [[Jürgen Warnatz]].
From 2005 to 2016 the board of directors consisted of professor [[Hans Georg Bock]] as managing director, professor Willi Jäger, and professor Bernd Jähne.

In the first quarter of 2016 all the IWR groups moved to the a new building called ''Mathematikon''&lt;ref name="Mathematikon_GmbH" /&gt; (Im Neuenheimer Feld 205), which can easily reached by public transportation and is located at the border of the campus at the Berliner Straße (main road). This enabled an optimal integration with the [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science|Faculty for Mathematics and Computer Science]], which also moved into the ''Mathematikon''.

Since 2017 the managing director is professor Andreas Dreuw. Michael Winckler is the administrative director of the IWR and the Heidelberg Graduate School of Mathematical and Computational Methods for the Sciences (HGS MathComp). The chairman of the HGS MathComp is professor Peter Bastian together with professor Dieter W. Hermann and professor Hans Georg Bock as deputy chairman.

'''Intergroup dialogue''' is a "face to face facilitated conversation between members of two or more social identity groups that strives to create new levels of understanding, relating and action." This process promotes conversation around controversial issues, specifically, in order to generate new "collective visions" that uphold the dignity of all people.&lt;ref name="Bridging Differences"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zúñiga|first1=Ximena|title=Bridging Differences through Dialogue |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/JamesOlive/ClassMaterials/EDC551/Zuniga%20%282002%29.pdf |publisher=About Campus |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup dialogue is based in the philosophies of the democratic and popular education movements. It is most commonly used on college campuses, but may assume different namesakes in other settings.

== History ==

Intergroup dialogue is rooted in "philosophical and cultural traditions that have valued dialogue as a method of communication and inquiry" to explore shared concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schoem &amp; Hurtado (Eds.)|title=Intergroup dialogue: Deliberative democracy in school, college, community and workplace|location=Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press|pages=306–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traditions heavily influenced 20th century movements for [[democratic education]], which included intergroup dialogue as a core objective. The application of dialogue in education was a core tenet of the democratic education movement, drawing on the work of public intellectuals like [[John Dewey]] who envisioned "schools as social centers" that "educate youth for democratic citizenship." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=Harkavy|title=The Enduring Appeal of Community Schools|journal=American Educator|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and other advocates of democratic education at the time envisioned dialogue as "the practice of deliberative democracy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trifonas|first1=Peter|title=Revolutionary Pedagogies: Cultural Politics, Instituting Education and the Discourse of Theory|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civic engagement]], [[experiential learning]] and [[student-centered learning]] are also products of this movement. For example, [[Paulo Freire]], a core figure in [[popular education]], adopted a theoretical approach to intergroup dialogue that emphasized the importance of people's own experiences, and need to build dialogue capacity to enable people to "analyze their situation and take action to transform themselves and their conditions.” [[Myles Horton]], another popular education thinker, co-founded the [[Highlander Research and Education Center]] (1932) - one of the earliest U.S. mainstream examples of a community center that offered dialogue, "popular education and literacy...as a means of promoting civic participation and social action organizing." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minkler|first1=Meredith (Ed.)|title=Community Organizing and Community Building for Health and Welfare|date=2012|publisher=Rutgers Press|location=New Jersey|page=65|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intergroup education movement in the 1940s and 1950s built upon the idea of "dialogue as liberatory educational practice," also drawing from feminist, antiracist and [[critical theory]] as well as the Intergroup [[Contact hypothesis]]. This movement was a response in some capacities to 20th century U.S. political turmoil. The [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the rapid internal movement of [[African Americans]] from the rural South to the industrial north, contributed to considerable social unrest within the United States. Similar effects were felt in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] with the mass migration of [[Mexican Americans]] following [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zúñiga, Nagda et. al.|title=Intergroup Dialogue in Higher Education: Meaningful Learning About Social Justice|date=October 13, 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intergroup education was the foundation for "antibias, antiracist, multicultural, [and] [[social justice]] education" that sought to address this unrest, primarily in college campus settings.&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al." /&gt; In the 1980s, the [[University of Michigan]] inaugurated its [http://igr.umich.edu/ Program on Intergroup Relations], which inspired similar models at a number of universities throughout the U.S. The growing popularity of intergroup dialogue programs on college campuses coincided with other shifts in higher education, including, for instance, the integration of [[Critical race theory]] as academic discipline in law and other fields.

== Methodology and Approach ==

=== Intergroup Dialogue Goals ===

Intergroup dialogue is intended to build relationships amongst participants with different social identities through the use of personal storytelling, empathetic listening and interpersonal inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Joohan|last2=Kim|first2=Eun Joo|title=Theorizing Dialogic Deliberation: Everyday Political Talk as Communicative Action and Dialogue|journal=Communication Theory|date=2008|volume=18|issue=1|pages=51–70|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2007.00313.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It integrates three core educational goals: "consciousness raising, building relationships across differences and conflicts, and strengthening individual and collective capacities to promote social justice." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuniga|first1=Ximena|last2=Nagda|first2=Biren|last3=Chesler|first3=Mark|last4=Cytron-Walker|first4=Adena|title=Intergroup Dialogue in Higher Education|date=2007|publisher=Wiley Periodicals, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780787995799|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intergroup dialogue distinguishes its approach from other dialogic methods such as debate and discussion.

==== Dialogic Goals ====

'''Debate:''' To clarify pros and cons of issues, to develop critical thinking skills

'''Discussion:''' To generate different perspectives on issues, to consider decisions among different options

'''Intergroup Dialogue:'''To increase critical self and societal awareness, to increase intergroup communication, understand and collaborative actions&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al." /&gt;

|}

=== Multi-partiality ===

Intergroup dialogue draws the work of  [[Freire]] whose work focuses on consciousness raising, a process through which members of an oppressed group come to understand the history and circumstances of their oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freire|first1=Paolo|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|date=1970|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=New York, NY|isbn=0826412769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup dialogue further aims to raise the consciousness of all participants, including those from advantaged and disadvantaged groups, through the use of  multi-partial facilitation. This approach was developed by Janet Rifkin, Professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, as a method of conflict resolution, and was adopted by the Program on Intergroup Relations as a method of facilitating dialogue across difference of social identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roger|first1=Fisher|title=Multipartiality|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MX3FfacNco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multi-partial approach to facilitation differs from both a neutral or impartial approach, as well as a model in which the facilitator acts as an advocate, such as in many feminist models. Multi-partial facilitation acknowledges the presence of “dominant narratives”, within dialogue, or sets of assumptions and beliefs based on socialization and cultural values. If the facilitator were to be impartial and neutral in moments of conflict between dialogue participants, the dominant narrative would affirm the experiences and voices of the dominant group members and further marginalize the experience of marginalized participants. A multi-partial facilitation approach differs from facilitator-advocate approaches in that it is equally invested in the participation and growth of all dialogue participants; it encourages self-reflection and awareness through engagement rather than direct confrontation, an approach based on the belief that “people who are not feeling threatened are more open to discussing their feelings and interests and are more open to discussing the effects the conflict is having on both groups.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephan|first1=W|title=Psychological and Communication Processes Associated With Intergroup Conflict Resolution|journal=Small Group Research|date=2008|volume=39|issue=28|doi= 10.1177/1046496407313413|pages=28–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than directly confronting a group member’s bias,  a multi-partial facilitator “pursues” the dominant narrative and encourages group members to share their experiences, while simultaneously encouraging a critical analysis of the underlying assumptions and narratives at play.

== Presence on College Campuses ==

Universities worldwide offer intergroup dialogue programs to their students. Intergroup dialogue programs are frequently launched as part of larger campus diversity and social justice initiatives seeking to address tensions and conflict related to social identity, most centrally, race.  Campuses vary in their approach to intergroup dialogue, "tailor[ing] to the specific needs of the campus, school, academic department or student affairs unit that it serves." &lt;ref name="Bridging Differences" /&gt; Dialogue groups are generally housed in on-campus organizations or academic departments, included as course offerings in [[Social Work]], [[Sociology]], [[Psychology]], [[American Studies]], [[Peace and Conflict Studies]] and [[Education]]. Students enrolled in intergroup dialogue coursework are typically required to complete supplementary readings, reflections, papers and in some cases, field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zúñiga|first1=Ximena|title=Fostering Intergroup Dialogue on Campus: Essential Ingredients|url=http://www.diversityweb.org/digest/w98/fostering.html|website=Diversity Digest|publisher=Association of American Colleges and Universities|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation and Outcomes ==

Research shows that Intergroup dialogue has positive impacts on participants' understanding of diversity and social justice issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alimo|first1=Craig|last2=Kelly|first2=Robert|last3=Clarke|first3=Christine|title=Diversity initiatives in higher education: Intergroup Dialogue Program student outcomes and implications for campus radical climate: A case study|journal=Multicultural Education|date=2002|volume=10|issue=1|pages=49–53|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/216312081}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting a qualitative interview study with dialogue participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeakley|first1=Anna|title=The nature of prejudice change: Positive and negative change processes arising from intergroup contact experiences.|journal=Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Yeakley found that "connecting through a depth of personal sharing" has been shown to play a significant role in creating positive dialogue outcomes, while participants who "disconnected in response to hurtful intergroup conflicts" reported negative outcomes. Yeakley highlights the importance of facilitator training, and finds that five facilitation skills are essential to promoting positive outcomes:  ( 1 ) creating a safe space, ( 2 ) recognizing signs of negative processes, ( 3 ) encouraging and supporting depth of personal sharing, ( 4 ) engaging conflicts as teachable moments, and ( 5 ) attending to identity differences in awareness and experience.&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al." /&gt;

The '''Jewish Historical Institute''' ({{lang-pl|Żydowski Instytut Historyczny}} or ''ŻIH'', {{lang-yi|‏ייִדישער היסטאָרישער אינסטיטוט‎}}) also known as the [[Emanuel Ringelblum]] Jewish Historical Institute, is a research foundation in [[Warsaw]], Poland, primarily dealing with the [[history of Jews in Poland]].

==History==
The Jewish Historical Institute was created in 1947 as a continuation of the Central Jewish Historical Commission, founded in 1944. The Jewish Historical Institute Association is the corporate body responsible for the building and the Institute’s holdings. The Institute falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. In 2009 it was named after [[Emanuel Ringelblum]]. The institute is a repository of documentary materials relating to the Jewish historical presence in Poland. It is also a centre for academic research, study and the dissemination of knowledge about the history and culture of Polish Jewry.&lt;ref name=JHI&gt;[http://www.jhi.pl/en/institute/history The Jewish Historical Institute, homepage.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most valuable part of the collection is the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] Archive, known as the Ringelblum Archive (collected by the [[Oyneg Shabbos (group)|Oyneg Shabbos]]). It contains about 6000 documents (about 30 000 individual pieces of paper).&lt;ref name=JHI/&gt;

[[Image:Exhibition Jewish Historical Institute Warsaw.JPG|thumb|left|An exhibition on the first floor]]

Other important collections concerning World War II include testimonies (mainly of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust), memoirs and diaries, documentation of the Joint and Jewish Self-Help (welfare organizations active in Poland under the occupation), and documents from the Jewish Councils (Judenräte). The section on the documentation of Jewish historical sites holds about 40 thousand photographs concerning Jewish life and culture in Poland.&lt;ref name=JHI/&gt;

The Institute has published a series of documents from the Ringelblum Archive, as well as numerous wartime memoirs and diaries.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Stach ''Geschichtsschreibung und politische Vereinnahmungen: Das Jüdische Historische Institut in Warschau 1947-1968'', in: Jahrbuch des Simon-Dubnow-Instituts / Simon Dubnow Institute Yearbook VII (2008), 401-431, {{ISBN|978-3-525-36934-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, for over 60 years now, the Institute has been publishing an academic journal renamed in 2001 as ''The Jewish History Quarterly'', registered on the Master Journal List of outstanding academic journals in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Historical Institute, ''[http://www.jhi.pl/en/blog/2013-03-01-the-jewish-history-quarterly The Jewish History Quarterly.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Paweł Śpiewak]], a Professor of Sociology at [[Warsaw University]] and former politician, was nominated as the Director of the Jewish Historical Institute by [[Bogdan Zdrojewski]], Minister of Culture and National Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Uncredited, [http://www.jewishinstitute.org.pl/en/home/index/0.html Change at the top] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203214108/http://www.jewishinstitute.org.pl/en/home/index/0.html |date=February 3, 2009 }}; Jewish Historical Institute.

[[Image:Leo Mechelin 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Leo Mechelin]]
'''Leopold (Leo) Henrik Stanislaus Mechelin''' (24 November 1839 in [[Hamina]], Finland – 26 January 1914 in [[Helsinki]], Finland) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] professor, statesman, senator and [[Liberalism|liberal]] reformer. A leading defender of the [[autonomy]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], and of the rights of women and minorities, Mechelin's 1905–1908 government
("Mechelin's Senate") made Finland the first nation in the world with the [[Universal suffrage|universal right to vote]] and to be elected. During his period in office the freedom of [[freedom of expression|expression]], the [[freedom of press|press]], and of [[freedom of assembly|assembly]] were introduced.

==Career==
He also founded the [[Liberal Party of Finland]] (1880–1885), wrote its program, was one of the founders of the Union Bank of Finland 1862 (now part of Nordea Bank) and co-founded the [[Nokia|Nokia Company]] (1871) with [[Fredrik Idestam]], was the first chairman of the [[town council]] of [[Helsinki]] (1875–1876 and 1892–1899) and an internationally respected expert on politology and member of peace movement. Emperor Alexander II ennobled Mechelin 1876.

Mechelin led the passive resistance in Finland during the [[Russification of Finland|first period of oppression]] (1899–1905) until and even after his banishment (1903), from which officials had to let him return as a member of parliament (House of Nobles) 1904, welcomed by a celebrating crowd of 10,000 people. In a secret meeting of the [[Kagaali]], Mechelin had written a petition against the draft of Finns to the Russian army, which collected almost 500,000 signatures. His coalition, the Constitutionals, managed to end the draft through boycott.

==Biography==
[[File:Leo Mechelin Bust.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Leo Mechelin's bust in [[Helsinki]].]]
Born in [[Hamina]] in 1839, the son of Gustaf Johan Mechelin and Amanda Gustava Costiander, Leo Mechelin studied at the [[University of Helsinki]], gaining his [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|Master's]] degree's in [[Philosophy]] in 1860, a bachelor's degree in law in 1864, and a [[Licentiate (degree)|License]] and [[Doctorate]] in 1873.

As professor of jurisdiction and politology 1874-82, Mechelin had argued that the tsars were bound by the [[Swedish Constitution of 1772|old constitutional laws]] from the time of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] rule of Finland (before 1809), and hence affirmed that Finland was a separate, constitutional state, which the tsar could only rule by law, whereas in Russia he had absolute power. During the periods of oppression, the tsar tried to impose unconstitutional laws, which Mechelin opposed. The [[Russian Revolution of 1905|unrests in Russia]] and [[Finnish general strike of 1905|Finland]] (1905) finally compelled the tsar to comply with the [[November Manifesto]] written by Mechelin. This allowed Mechelin to form a government (1905–1908) and to transform Finland into what was in many respects the first [[liberal democracy]] (e.g., in [[New Zealand]] women already had the right to vote but not to be voted; in [[Australia]] only white people had those rights) in 1906. In 1907, the first universal elections to the one-chamber [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]] ("eduskunta") were held, and 19 of its 200 first members were women. However, the constitutionals of all parties did not obtain the majority of seats, and the tsar realised that he could carry on with the oppression, starting the [[Russification of Finland|second period of oppression]] (1908–1917). After Mechelin's death (in 1914), the two revolutions in Russia allowed  Finland to declare its independence (1917) and Mechelin's younger co-workers were able to complete his work.

[[Nokia]], once a world-leading [[mobile phone]] corporation, was founded by Mechelin and his student days' roommate [[Fredrik Idestam]] as a [[forestry]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=HugmyrqibtwC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=leo+mechelin+and+nokia&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit75W7ydbVAhXGWBQKHe7YDoYQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=leo%20mechelin%20and%20nokia&amp;f=false|title=Wireless Horizon: Strategy and Competition in the Worldwide Mobile Marketplace|last=Steinbock|first=Dan|date=2003|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|isbn=9780814407141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Mechelin's wish to expand into the electricity business was at first thwarted by Idestam's opposition, but Mechelin managed to convince most shareholders of his plans and became the company chairman (1898–1914), thus being able to realise his visions.

Mechelin was also active in [[civil society]] and President of the current [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] and of the [[Finnish Art Society]]. As a politician he was always highly respected among all parties and citizens, although after the dissolution of the Liberal Party (1885) he never joined any other party.

Mechelin demanded peaceful [[nonviolent resistance]] and did not bend even during hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/3553 | title = Mechelin, Leo (1839 - 1914) | author = Tapio Helen | date = 1997-09-16 | publisher = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lexicon''', '''word-hoard''', '''wordbook''', or '''word-stock''' is the [[vocabulary]] of a person, [[language]], or branch of [[knowledge]] (such as [[nautical]] or [[medical]]).  In [[linguistics]], a '''lexicon''' is a language's inventory of [[lexeme]]s. The word "lexicon" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|λεξικόν}} (''lexicon''), neuter of {{lang|grc|λεξικός}} (''lexikos'') meaning "of or for words."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikos λεξικός] in Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (Perseus Digital Library). Sc. βιβλίον "book").&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic theories generally regard human languages as consisting of two parts: a lexicon, essentially a catalogue of a language's words (its [[wikt:wordstock|wordstock]]); and a [[grammar]], a system of rules which allow for the combination of those words into meaningful sentences. The lexicon is also thought to include [[bound morpheme]]s, which cannot stand alone as words (such as most [[affix]]es).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=OKvziaqXzXwC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=morphemes+lexicon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CB_0QMidAO&amp;sig=1YiUJnAc0kj-Pbh0V6duJhHPktg&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl99OPt_TTAhWK0xoKHUolARo4ChDoAQgpMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=morphemes%20lexicon&amp;f=false|title=Morphological structure, lexical representation, and lexical access|last2=Taft|first2=Marcus|date=1994|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|last1=Dominiek|first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some analyses, [[compound word]]s and certain classes of [[idiom]]atic expressions and other [[collocation]]s are also considered to be part of the lexicon. [[Dictionary|Dictionaries]] represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included.

== Size and organization ==

Items in the lexicon are called lexemes, or lexical items, or word forms. Lexemes are not atomic elements but contain both phonological and morphological components. When describing the lexicon, a reductionist approach is used, trying to remain general while using a minimal description. To describe the size of a lexicon, [[lexeme]]s are grouped into lemmas. A [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] is a group of lexemes generated by [[Inflection#Inflectional morphology|inflectional morphology]]. Lemmas are represented in dictionaries by headwords which list the [[citation form]]s and any [[English irregular verbs|irregular forms]], since these must be learned to use the words correctly. Lexemes derived from a word by derivational morphology are considered new lemmas. The lexicon is also organized according to open and closed categories. [[Part of speech|Closed categories]], such as [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] or [[pronoun]]s, are rarely given new lexemes; their function is primarily [[Syntax|syntactic]]. Open categories, such as [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s, have highly active generation mechanisms and their lexemes are more [[Semantics|semantic]] in nature.

== Lexicalization and other mechanisms in the lexicon ==
{{anchor#Lexicalization}}

A central role of the lexicon is the documenting of established ''lexical norms and conventions''. [[Lexicalization]] is the process in which new words, having gained widespread usage, enter the lexicon. Since lexicalization&lt;ref name="Geert2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Geert |first=Booij |title=The grammar of words : an introduction to linguistic morphology |series=Oxford textbooks in linguistics |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-928042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; may modify lexemes phonologically and morphologically, it is possible that a single etymological source may be inserted into a single lexicon in two or more forms. These pairs, called a [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublet]], are often close semantically. Two examples are ''[[wikt:aptitude|aptitude]]'' versus ''[[wikt:attitude|attitude]]'' and ''[[wikt:employ|employ]]'' versus ''[[wikt:imply|imply]]''.&lt;ref name="Skeat 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skeat |first=Walter |title=A Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRGhnkZq3HQC |date=2010-04-17 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=978-1-4400-5722-9 |page=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ornan |first=Uzzi |authorlink=Uzzi Ornan |title=The Final Word — Mechanism For Hebrew Word Generation |year=2003 |publisher=Haifa University Press |location=Haifa |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf |first=Allan |title=Predicting New Words — The Secrets of Their Success |year=2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston |isbn=0-618-13006-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the planned creation of new roots (often on a large-scale), such as ''slang'', ''branding''.
* Borrowing of foreign words.
* [[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] (composition), the combination of lexemes to make a single word.
* [[Abbreviation]] of compounds.
* [[Acronyms]], the reduction of compounds to their initial letters, such as [[wikt:NASA|NASA]] and [[wikt:laser|laser (from "LASER")]].
* [[Inflection]], a morphology change with a category, such as number or tense.
* [[Morphological derivation|Derivation]], a morphological change resulting in a change of category.
* [[Agglutination]], the compounding of morphemes into a single word.

===Neologisms (new words)===
[[Neologism]]s are new lexeme candidates which, if they gain wide usage over time, become part of a language's lexicon. Neologisms are often introduced by children who produce erroneous forms by mistake.&lt;ref name="Jaeger2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaeger |first=Jeri J. |title=Kid's slips: what young children's slips of the tongue reveal about language development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1YGd1FkRgAC |accessdate=8 April 2012 |year=2005 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-8058-3579-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common source is slang and activities such as advertising and branding.

===Neologisms that maintain the sound of their external source===
There are two types of borrowings (neologisms based on external sources) that retain the sound of the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] material:
* Borrowing using the source language lexical item as the basic material for the neologization: guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords
* Borrowing using a target language lexical items as the basic material for the neologization: phono-semantic matching, semanticized phonetic matching and phonetic matching.

====Guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords====
The following are examples of external lexical expansion using the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] lexical item as the basic material for the neologization, listed in decreasing order of phonetic resemblance to the original lexical item (in the source language):&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guestword (in German: ''Gastwort''): unassimilated borrowing.
* Foreignism (in German: ''Fremdwort''): foreign word, e.g. phonetic adaptation.
* Loanword (in German: ''Lehnwort''): totally assimilated borrowing, e.g. morphemic adaptation.

====Phono-semantic matches, semanticized phonetic matches and phonetic matches====
The following are examples of simultaneous external and internal lexical expansion using [[Target language (translation)|target language]] lexical items as the basic material for the neologization but still resembling the sound of the lexical item in the source language:&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in ''Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew'', by Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phono-semantic matching]] (PSM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item both phonetically and semantically.
* Semanticized phonetic matching (SPM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically, and only in a loose way semantically.
* Phonetic matching (PM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically but not semantically.

===Role of morphology===
Another mechanism involves [[Generative grammar|generative]] devices that combine morphemes according to a language's rules. For example, the [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] "-able" is usually only added to [[transitive verb]]s, as in "readable" but not "cryable".

===Compounding===
A compound word is a lexeme composed of several established lexemes, whose semantics is not the sum of that of their constituents. They can be interpreted through [[analogy]], [[Pragmatics|common sense and, most commonly, context]].&lt;ref name="Geert2005" /&gt; Compound words can have simple or complex morphological structures. Usually only the head requires inflection for agreement. Compounding may result in lexemes of unwieldy proportion. This is compensated by mechanisms that reduce the length of words. A similar phenomenon has been recently shown to feature in social media also where hashtags compound to form longer-sized hashtags that are at times more popular than the individual constituent hashtags forming the compound.&lt;ref name="Maity2016"&gt;Suman Kalyan Maity, Ritvik Saraf and Animesh Mukherjee (2016). #Bieber + #Blast = #BieberBlast: Early Prediction of Popular Hashtag Compounds. In ''ACM CSCW'', San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding is the most common of word formation strategies cross-linguistically. 

== Diachronic mechanisms ==

Comparative historical linguistics studies the evolutions languages and takes a [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] view of the lexicon. The evolution of lexicons in different languages occurs through parallel mechanism. Over time historical forces work to  shape the lexicon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutscher |first=Guy |authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist) |title=The Unfolding of Language: An Evolutionary Tour of Mankind's Greatest Invention  |date=May 19, 2005 |publisher=Metropolitan Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it simpler to acquire and often creating an illusion of great regularity in language.
* [[Assimilation (linguistics)|Phonological assimilation]], the modification of loanwords to fit a new language's sound structure more effectively. If, however, a loanword sounds too "foreign", inflection or derivation rules may not be able to transform it.
* [[Analogy]], where new words undergo inflection and derivation analogous to that of words with a similar sound structure.
* [[Stress (linguistics)|Emphasis]], the modification of words' stress or accenting.
* [[Metaphor]], a form of semantic extension.

== Second-language lexicon ==
{{main|Bilingual lexical access}}

The term "lexicon" is generally used in the context of single language. Therefore, multi-lingual speakers are generally thought to have multiple lexicons. Speakers of language variants ([[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[European Portuguese]], for example) may be considered to possess a single lexicon. Thus a ''[[wikt:cash dispenser|cash dispenser]]'' (British English) as well as an  [[wikt:automatic teller machine|automatic teller machine]] or [[wikt:ATM|ATM]] in American English would be understood by both American and British speakers, despite each group using different dialects.

When linguists study a lexicon, they consider such things as what constitutes a word; the word/[[concept]] relationship; [[lexical access]] and lexical access failure; how a word's [[phonology]], [[syntax]], and meaning intersect; the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]-word relationship; vocabulary structure within a given language; language use ([[pragmatics]]); [[language acquisition]]; the history and evolution of words ([[etymology]]); and the relationships between words, often studied within [[philosophy of language]].

Various models of how lexicons are organized and how words are retrieved have been proposed in [[psycholinguistics]], [[neurolinguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]].

'''Mathematical geophysics''' is concerned with developing mathematical methods for use in [[geophysics]]. As such, it has application in many fields in geophysics, particularly [[geodynamics]] and [[seismology]].

== Areas of mathematical geophysics ==

=== Geophysical fluid dynamics ===
[[Geophysical fluid dynamics]] develops the theory of [[fluid dynamics]] for the atmosphere, ocean and Earth's interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pedlosky|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications include geodynamics and the theory of the [[geodynamo]].

=== Geophysical inverse theory ===
Geophysical [[inverse theory]] is concerned with analyzing geophysical data to get model parameters.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tarantola&gt;{{Harvnb|Tarantola|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with the question: What can be known about the Earth's interior from measurements on the surface? Generally there are limits on what can be known even in the ideal limit of exact data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1994|loc=chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of inverse theory is to determine the spatial distribution of some variable (for example, density or seismic wave velocity). The distribution determines the values of an observable at the surface (for example, gravitational acceleration for density). There must be a ''forward model'' predicting the surface observations given the distribution of this variable.

Applications include [[geomagnetism]], [[magnetotellurics]] and seismology.

=== Fractals and complexity ===
Many geophysical data sets have spectra that follow a [[power law]], meaning that the frequency of an observed magnitude varies as some power of the magnitude. An example is the distribution of [[earthquake]] magnitudes; small earthquakes are far more common than large earthquakes. This is often an indicator that the data sets have an underlying [[fractal]] geometry. Fractal sets have a number of common features, including structure at many scales, irregularity, and [[self-similarity]] (they can be split into parts that look much like the whole). The manner in which these sets can be divided determine the [[Hausdorff dimension]] of the set, which is generally different from the more familiar [[topological dimension]]. Fractal phenomena are associated with [[Chaos theory|chaos]], [[self-organized criticality]] and [[turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turcotte|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data assimilation ===
[[Data assimilation]] combines numerical models of geophysical systems with observations that may be irregular in space and time. Many of the applications involve geophysical fluid dynamics. Fluid dynamic models are governed by a set of [[partial differential equations]]. For these equations to make good predictions, accurate initial conditions are needed. However, often the initial conditions are not very well known. Data assimilation methods allow the models to incorporate later observations to improve the initial conditions. Data assimilation plays an increasingly important role in [[weather forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|Zou|Zhu|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geophysical statistics ===
Some statistical problems come under the heading of mathematical geophysics, including [[model validation]] and quantifying uncertainty.

The '''Mauna Kea Observatories''' ('''MKO''') are a number of independent astronomical research facilities and large telescope observatories that are located at the summit of [[Mauna Kea]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island of Hawaiʻi]], [[United States]]. The facilities are located in a 525-acre (212&amp;nbsp;ha) special land use zone known as the "Astronomy Precinct", which is located within the 11,228-acre (4,544&amp;nbsp;ha) Mauna Kea Science Reserve.&lt;ref name=uhero&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economic Impact of Astronomy in Hawai‘i|url=http://www.uhero.hawaii.edu/assets/UHERO_Astronomy_Final.pdf|publisher=University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization|accessdate=14 July 2015|date=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Astronomy Precinct was established in 1967 and is located on land protected by the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966|Historical Preservation Act]] for its significance to Hawaiian culture.

The location is near ideal because of its:
* [[light pollution|dark skies]] from lack of light pollution,
* good [[astronomical seeing]], 
* low [[Relative humidity|humidity]],  
* high altitude of {{convert|4,205|meter}}, 
* position above most of the water vapor in the atmosphere, 
* clean air, 
* good weather and 
* low latitude location.&lt;ref name="About Mauna Kea Observatories"&gt;[http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/mko/about_maunakea.htm About Mauna Kea Observatories]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and background==
After studying photos for [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]] that contained greater detail than any ground-based telescope, [[Gerard Kuiper]] began seeking an arid site for infrared studies.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc.1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gcAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|date=November 1964|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|page=35|issn=0096-3402}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he first began looking in Chile, he also made the decision to perform tests in the Hawaiian Islands. Tests on [[Maui]]'s [[Haleakalā]] were promising, but the mountain was too low in the inversion layer and often covered by clouds. On the "Big Island" of Hawaiʻi, Mauna Kea is considered the highest island mountain in the world. While the summit is often covered with snow, the air is extremely dry.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt; Kuiper began looking into the possibility of an observatory on Mauna Kea. After testing, he discovered the low humidity was perfect for infrared signals. He persuaded Hawaiʻi Governor [[John A.

NASA, in turn decided to make the project open to competition. Professor of physics, John Jefferies of the [[University of Hawaii]] placed a bid on behalf of the university.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leverington2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Leverington|title=A History of Astronomy: from 1890 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r47qBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4471-2124-4|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaminsPotter1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert M.

The proposal was for a two-meter telescope to serve both the needs of NASA and the university. While large telescopes are not ordinarily awarded to universities without well-established astronomers, Jefferies and UH were awarded the NASA contract, infuriating Kuiper, who felt that "his mountain" had been "stolen" from ''him''.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tatarewicz1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph N.

After considerable testing by Jefferies' team, the best locations were determined to be near the summit at the top of the cinder cones. Testing also determined Mauna Kea to be superb for nighttime viewing due to many factors, including the thin air, constant trade winds and being surrounded by sea. Jefferies would build a 2.24 meter telescope with the State of Hawaiʻi agreeing to build a reliable, all weather roadway to the summit. Building began in 1967 and first light was seen in 1970.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. B.

Other groups began requesting subleases on the newly accessible mountaintop. By 1970, two {{convert|24|in|m|1|abbr=on}} telescopes had been constructed by the [[United States Air Force]] and [[Lowell Observatory]]. In 1973, Canada and France agreed to build the 3.6&amp;nbsp;m [[Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope|CFHT]] on Mauna Kea.&lt;ref name="astro-timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Astronomy in Hawaiʻi|url=http://mkooc.org/css-timeline.html|publisher=Mauna Kea Observatories Outreach Committee|accessdate=October 2, 2010|first=Andrew|last=Pickles|date=2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727090520/http://mkooc.org/css-timeline.html|archivedate=July 27, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, local organizations started to raise concerns about the environmental impact of the observatory. This led the Department of Land and Natural Resources to prepare an initial management plan, drafted in 1977 and supplemented in 1980. In January 1982, the University of Hawaiʻi [[Governing boards of colleges and universities in the United States|Board of Regents]] approved a plan to support the continued development of scientific facilities at the site.&lt;ref name="uh-2009"/&gt;  In 1998, {{convert|2033|acre|ha|0|abbr=on}} were transferred from the observatory lease to supplement the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.

==Management==
The Reserve was established in 1968, and is leased by the [[Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources|State of Hawaiʻi's Department of Land and Natural Resources]] (DLNR).&lt;ref name="burns"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malamamaunakea.org/about-us/history |title=History |publisher=Office of Mauna Kea Management |accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawaiʻi]] manages the site&lt;ref name="burns"/&gt; and leases land to several multi-national facilities, which have invested more than $2 billion in science and technology.&lt;ref name=uhero/&gt; The lease expires on 2033 and after that 40 of 45 square kilometers (25 of 28 square miles) revert to the state of Hawaii &lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Mauna Kea Observatories.jpg|alt=Mauna Kea Observatories seen from the base of Mauna Kea|thumb|Mauna Kea Observatories seen from the base of [[Mauna Kea]]]]
The altitude and isolation in the middle of the [[Pacific Ocean]] makes Mauna Kea one of the best locations on earth for ground-based astronomy. It is an ideal location for submillimeter, infrared and optical observations. The [[astronomical seeing|seeing]] statistics show that Mauna Kea is the best site in terms of optical and infrared image quality; for example, the CFHT site has a median seeing of 0.43 arcseconds.

Accommodations for research astronomers are located at the [[Onizuka Center for International Astronomy]] (often called Hale Pōhaku), {{convert|7|miles}} by unpaved steep road from the summit at {{convert|9300|ft|m}} above sea level.

An adjacent visitor information station is located at {{convert|9200|ft|m}}. The summit of Mauna Kea is so high that tourists are advised to stop at the visitor station for at least 30 minutes to acclimate to atmospheric conditions before continuing to the summit, and scientists often stay at Hale Pōhaku for eight hours or more before spending a full night at observatories on the summit, with some telescopes requiring observers to spend one full night at Hale Pōhaku before working at the summit.

==Telescopes==

Telescopes found at the summit of Mauna Kea are funded by government agencies of various nations. The University of Hawaiʻi directly administers two telescopes. In total, there are twelve facilities housing thirteen telescopes&lt;ref name=Telescopes&gt;{{cite web|title=Mauna Kea Observatories|url=https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/mko/telescope_table.shtml|website=Maunakea Telescopes|publisher=University of Hawaii Institute of Astronomy|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at or around the summit of Mauna Kea. It may also be the site of the [[Thirty Meter Telescope]] and is a proposed site for [[Pan-STARRS]].

==Opposition and protests==
{{main|Opposition to the Mauna Kea Observatories}}
In Honolulu, the governor and legislature, enthusiastic about the development, set aside an even larger area for the observatory after the initial project, causing opposition on the Big Island, in the city of [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]]. [[Native Hawaiians]] (kānaka ʻōiwi) believed the entire site was sacred and that developing the mountain, even for science, would spoil the area. Environmentalists were concerned about rare native bird populations and other citizens of Hilo were concerned about the sight of the domes from the city. Using town hall meetings, Jefferies was able to overcome opposition by weighing the economic advantage and prestige the island would receive.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt; There has been substantial opposition to the Mauna Kea observatories that continues to grow.&lt;ref name="Oswalt2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry D. Oswalt|title=The Future of Small Telescopes in the New Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZqLBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=2003|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-010-0253-0|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the opposition to the observatories may have become the most visible example of the conflict science has encountered over access and use of environmental and culturally significant sites.&lt;ref name="DearKetchum2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Dear|author2=Jim Ketchum|author3=Sarah Luria|author4=Doug Richardson|title=GeoHumanities: Art, History, Text at the Edge of Place|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwrJBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT476|date=13 April 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-88347-7|page=476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to development grew shortly after expansion of the observatories commenced. Once access was opened up by the roadway to the summit, skiers began using it for recreation and objected when the road was closed as a precaution against vandalism when the telescopes were being built. Hunters voiced concerns, as did the [[National Audubon Society|Hawaiian Audubon Society]] who were supported by Governor [[George Ariyoshi]].&lt;ref name="PARKER2013" /&gt;{{rp|56}}

The Audubon Society objected to further development on Mauna Kea over concerns to habitat of the endangered [[Palila]], a species [[Endemism|endemic]] to only specific parts of this mountain. The bird is the last of the finch billed honeycreepers existing on the island. Over 50% of native bird species had been killed off due to loss of habitat from early western settlers or the introduction of non-native species competing for resources. Hunters and sportsmen were concerned that the hunting of feral animals would be affected by the telescope operations.&lt;ref name="Gordon2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Gordon|title=Recollections of "Tucson Operations": The Millimeter-Wave Observatory of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWPbIrwEKpMC&amp;pg=PA136|date=18 July 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-3236-3|pages=136–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Save Mauna Kea" movement was inspired by the proliferation of telescopes, with opposition believing development of the mountain to be sacrilegious.&lt;ref name="Oaks2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert F.

=== Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium ===
[[File:Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts Belgique 1101.jpg|thumb|353x353px|Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]
The Museums’ collections trace the history of the visual arts – painting, sculpture and drawing – from the 15th to the 21st centuries. They preserve the works of the [[Flemish primitives|Flemish Primitives]], of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Jacob Jordaens|Jacques Jordaens]], [[Jacques-Louis David|Jacques Louis David]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[James Ensor]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Paul Delvaux]], [[René Magritte]], [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Jan Fabre]] and many others. This jewel among Belgium's cultural institutions comprises several entities: the [[Oldmasters Museum|Musée Old Masters Museum]], the Musée Modern Museum, the [[Wiertz Museum|Musée Wiertz Museum]] and the [[Constantin Meunier|Musée Meunier Museum]], the [[Magritte Museum|Musée Magritte Museum]] and the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Musée Fin-de-Siècle Museum]].

Michel Draguet repositioned the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] nationally as well as internationally through a redeployment of the collection focused on the specificity of Belgian creation as well as on the particularity of Belgian reception of European creation.

In 2009, he created the [[Magritte Museum]] with, for the first time in Belgium, a private-public partnership (with [[Engie|GDF-Suez]]) on competencies. The selection of works exhibited in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is constantly expanding with a changing selection of external loans. With the support of Belgian and foreign museums as well as private collectors, works are being made available that have previously never been exhibited. The visitor can thus discover many treasures that are still in private possession. Since its creation, this museum, measuring 2500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has welcomed more than two million visitors and thus contributed to the economic and cultural development of the Belgian capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/debats/ripostes/brandir-l-importance-economique-de-la-culture-pour-la-defendre-544aa05a3570fe7cfbf80d01|title=Brandir l'importance économique de la culture pour la défendre ?|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=2018-05-09|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magritte Museum]] has already received 8 nominations and prizes. Every year more than 300,000 visitors come here from all over the world to discover the life and the works of [[René Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/uploads/pages/files/magritte_museum_key_figures_2009_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Michel Draguet inaugurated the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Fin-de-siècle Museum]] as first chapter of a new conception of a museum of Modern Art. Famous visual artists like [[Constantin Meunier]], [[James Ensor]], [[Henri Evenepoel]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Léon Spilliaert]] and [[George Minne|Georges Minne]] testify to the effervescent activity of this period, reflected also in all other creative fields: literature, opera, music, architecture, photography and poetry ([[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Émile Verhaeren|Emile Verhaeren]], [[Octave Maus]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Henry van de Velde|Henry Van de Velde]], [[Maurice Kufferath]], [[Guillaume Lekeu]] and others). [[Art Nouveau]] architecture is evoked by means of a 3D reconstruction of six buildings Art Nouveau. This was the first introduction of new technologies inside de Museum. Located at the heart of Brussels, where between 1884 and 1914 the exhibitions of ''Les XX'' and ''La Libre Esthétique'' made the city one of the artistic capitals of the late 19th century, this museum is distinguished by its multidisciplinary nature, through a partnership formed with the [[Royal Library of Belgium|Royal Library]], the [[La Monnaie|Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie]], the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], [[Cinematek]], the [[Bibliotheca Wittockiana]], the [[King Baudouin Foundation]] and the [[Brussels Capital Region]] for housing the Gillion Crowet collection, which is one of the museum's highlights.The [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum]], which was applauded internationally when it opened,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/belgique-bruxelles-s-offre-un-musee-fin-de-siecle-06-12-2013-1765553_3.php&lt;/ref&gt; welcomed 170,000 visitors during its first operating year.

Michel Draguet also initiate a highly popular yet challenging exhibition program from ancient masters to contemporary art mounting up to eight major shows per year. The quality and quantity of this program has been supported by a renewing strategy to the public in its diversity. In this way, Draguet initiate “Museum on measure”: a program dedicated to fragilized public supported by charity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.article27.be/IMG/pdf/accompagner_les_publics_socialement_fragilises_au_musees_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the educational services have developed a range of new activities and the social programs have been extended. This is a result of the increase in partnerships between the public and private sectors .

Among the highlights of the programme have been large exhibitions such as “Art Nouveau Bing”, “Rubens in Brussels”, “CoBrA”, “Alechinsky”, “Leon Spilliaert” “Jordaens and Antiquity”, “The Flemish Primitives in  Brussels”, “Andres Serrano”, “Marc Chagall”, “Kandinsky and Europe”, “Symbolism in Belgium” and “Stanley Kubrick Photographer”. Michel Draguet introduced also a wide spectrum of new exhibition formats with from small “cabinet exhibitions” on such artists Pierre Lahaut, [[Jules Schmalzigaug]], [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]], and others. He placed permanent installation of contemporary artist inside the [[Oldmasters Museum|OldMasters]] department like [[David Altmejd]] or [[Jan Fabre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/the-collection|title=The collection – Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|website=www.fine-arts-museum.be|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years now, the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]  has been the most popular art institution in Belgium. In 2015, the Museum had its best attended year so far with a total of 767.355 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Visitor-Figures-2015-LO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was accompanied by a significant increase in corporate funding. From 2005 until 2017, the number of visitors has doubled and the turnover tripled, thereby reducing the State contribution from 54.4% of the global budget to 32%. And this has been achieved during a period of very severe budgetary cuts: 11% in 2013 and 2014, 30% for the period 2015-2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/michel-draguet-reconduit-la-direction-des-musees-royaux-des-beaux-arts-de-belgique-132655|title=Michel Draguet reconduit à la direction des Musées royaux des beaux-arts de Belgique - 28 avril 2017 - lejournaldesarts.fr|website=Le Journal Des Arts|language=fr|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online and digital outreach of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is considered as pioneer. In this perspective, Draguet initiated the ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' project which allows members of the public to delve into the works of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] († Brussels, 1569). While the artist and his paintings are instantly recognizable worldwide, every composition also depicts a whole host of characters - some surprising, others familiar - and vignettes that provide the subtext of history, which are masterpieces worthy of exploration in their own right.

Drawing on a wide spectrum of virtual and on-site experiences, this unique initiative offers everyone the chance to immerse themselves in Bruegel’s works by honing in on the details of each painting and accessing expert knowledge. By delving deeper into the artist’s world, the viewer will discover the unexpected elements in Bruegel’s works which constitute the pinnacle of the Flemish master’s craft. The [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] launched this project jointly with the [[Google Cultural Institute]] in anticipation of the 450thanniversary of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]’s death, in 2019. The project brings together major international museums, many of which are European, around the focal figure of Bruegel the Elder. This innovative concept is the fruit of in-depth thinking on current transformations in the field of museology as it adapts to the digital era.

The ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' virtual exhibitions' can be accessed on the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]’s interactive screens, on their mobile app and on the [[Google Cultural Institute]] platform.

=== Royal Museums of Art and History ===
[[File:Park of the Cinquantenaire - Royal Museums of Art and History, Brussels, 2010 (HDR 1).jpg|thumb|339x339px|Royal Museums of Art and History of Belgium]]
From 1st August 2010 till 28 February 2014, Michel Draguet was designated temporary Director-General of the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This entity includes the [[Cinquantenaire Museum|Museum of Antiquities]], the Museum of Non-European Civilizations, the Museum of the Decorative Arts, the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower, [[Halle Gate]], and the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]].

He was charged to manage this institution, which was then in crisis, to overhaul its accounts and structure. Under his leading, the museum put together a restructuring plan that, starting with the merging of the support staff, created enough flexibility to allow modernization of the administrative organizations of both entities – the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]] and [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]].

Michel Draguet initiated a large project of redeployment of both institutions. The home of the former would house collections of a more universalist nature, on the model of the [[Louvre]] and [[British Museum]], and that of the latter would offer a more “national” foundation that broadens to embrace a European dynamic comprising the very future of Brussels as the capital of what is today a common space. From there came the idea of redeploying the collections in accordance with two guidelines: first, to bring the federal collections together in one place; second, to develop theme-based museums that complement rather than compete with one another.

Together the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]] and [[Royal Museums of Art and History|Art and History]] welcome more than 1.1 million visitors a year: this is the equivalent of the population of Brussels. Merged, the two institutions would increase their attractiveness to the public: by reorganizing the presentation of the collections between the different institutions; by creating poles of scientific excellence based on the strong points of the collections; by creating new museum entities that offer a new dimension for marketing the city of Brussels; and by rationalizing the teams and practices employed. For the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], the entities proposed are as follows : a Museum of Non-European Civilizations, which would initially be a world museum through the eyes of Europeans, on the basis of which a new intercultural dialogue could be initiated; a Museum of Antiquities as a platform for the European identity; and a Museum of Music that will broaden the perspectives of the current [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]]. Plus a few heritage assets – the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower and [[Halle Gate]] – which contribute to the attractiveness of the city.

His plan for redeployment of both the collections and personnel that would culminate in the fusion of the two entities was discussed at the Belgian Parliament in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml&lt;/ref&gt; Without initiative from the politics and considering that his Secretary of State was not supporting the reforme led by him and by the Chairman of [[BELSPO|Belspo]] [http://plus.wikimonde.com/wiki/Philippe_Mettens Philippe Mettens], Michel Draguet decided to step down in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml|title=La Chambre des représentants de Belgique|website=www.dekamer.be|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Microjazz''''' is a long-running series of [[sheet music]] publications by [[New Zealand]]-born [[United Kingdom|British]] pianist and composer [[Christopher Norton]]. The series is published by [[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]].
Based on classical technique yet using popular contemporary styles such as [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[rock 'n' roll]] and [[funk]], ''Microjazz'' aims to "develop musicianship and technique through the familiar sounds and styles of popular music". The series has established itself as a leading educational music series around the world, and has expanded over 20 years to include music for all of the major instruments with piano, ensemble books and midi file backings. It is now the biggest selling music series for Boosey &amp; Hawkes, with over a million sales to date.

'''Non-equilibrium thermodynamics''' is a branch of [[thermodynamics]] that deals with physical systems that are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] but can be described in terms of variables (non-equilibrium state variables) that represent an extrapolation  of the variables used to specify the system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with transport processes and with the rates of chemical reactions. It relies on what may be thought of as more or less nearness to thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress, not an established edifice. This article will try to sketch some approaches to it and some concepts important for it.

Almost all systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium, for they are changing or can be triggered to change over time, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems and to chemical reactions. Some systems and processes are, however, in a useful sense, near enough to thermodynamic equilibrium to allow description with useful accuracy by currently known non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Nevertheless, many natural systems and processes will always remain far beyond the scope of non-equilibrium thermodynamic methods.{{Citation needed|reason=This assumes that non-equilibrium thermodynamic methods will not change over time.  ''Always'' is too broad.|date=April 2018}} This is because of the very small size of atoms, as compared with macroscopic systems.

The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by [[equilibrium thermodynamics]]. One fundamental difference between equilibrium thermodynamics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics lies in the behaviour of inhomogeneous systems, which require for their study knowledge of rates of reaction which are not considered in equilibrium thermodynamics of homogeneous systems. This is discussed below. Another fundamental and very important difference is the difficulty or impossibility, in general, in defining [[entropy]] at an instant of time in macroscopic terms for systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium; it can be done, to useful approximation, only in carefully chosen special cases, namely those that are throughout in local thermodynamic equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Grandy 2008"&gt;Grandy, W.T., Jr (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"&gt;Lebon, G., Jou, D., Casas-Vázquez, J. (2008). ''Understanding Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics: Foundations, Applications, Frontiers'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin, e-{{ISBN|978-3-540-74252-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of non-equilibrium thermodynamics==

===Difference between equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics===
A profound difference separates equilibrium from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Equilibrium thermodynamics ignores the time-courses of physical processes. In contrast, non-equilibrium thermodynamics attempts to describe their time-courses in continuous detail.

Equilibrium thermodynamics restricts its considerations to processes that have initial and final states of thermodynamic equilibrium; the time-courses of processes are deliberately ignored. Consequently, equilibrium thermodynamics allows processes that pass through states far from thermodynamic equilibrium, that cannot be described even by the variables admitted for non-equilibrium thermodynamics,&lt;ref name="EY 5"&gt;[[Elliott H. Lieb|Lieb, E.H.]], [[Jakob Yngvason|Yngvason, J.]] (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; such as time rates of change of temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Gyarmati, I. (1967/1970), pp.&amp;nbsp;8–12.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in equilibrium thermodynamics, a process is allowed to include even a violent explosion that cannot be described by non-equilibrium thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="EY 5"/&gt; Equilibrium thermodynamics does, however, for theoretical development, use the idealized concept of the "quasi-static process".  A quasi-static process is a conceptual (timeless and physically impossible) smooth mathematical passage along a continuous path of states of thermodynamic equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), §&amp;nbsp;4–2.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an exercise in differential geometry rather than a process that could occur in actuality.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, on the other hand, attempting to describe continuous time-courses, need its [[State function|state variables]] to have a very close connection with those of equilibrium thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Glansdorff, P., Prigogine, I. (1971), Ch. {{math|II}},§&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; This profoundly restricts the scope of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and places heavy demands on its conceptual framework.

===Non-equilibrium state variables===
The suitable relationship that defines non-equilibrium thermodynamic state variables is as follows. On occasions when the system happens to be in states that are sufficiently close to thermodynamic equilibrium, non-equilibrium state variables are such that they can be measured locally with sufficient accuracy by the same techniques as are used to measure thermodynamic state variables, or by corresponding time and space derivatives, including fluxes of matter and energy. In general, non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems are spatially and temporally non-uniform, but their non-uniformity still has a sufficient degree of smoothness to support the existence of suitable time and space derivatives of non-equilibrium state variables. Because of the spatial non-uniformity, non-equilibrium state variables that correspond to extensive thermodynamic state variables have to be defined as spatial densities of the corresponding extensive equilibrium state variables. On occasions when the system is sufficiently close to thermodynamic equilibrium, intensive non-equilibrium state variables, for example temperature and pressure, correspond closely with equilibrium state variables. It is necessary that measuring probes be small enough, and rapidly enough responding, to capture relevant non-uniformity. Further, the non-equilibrium state variables are required to be mathematically functionally related to one another in ways that suitably resemble corresponding relations between equilibrium thermodynamic state variables.&lt;ref name="Gyarmati 1970"/&gt; In reality, these requirements are very demanding, and it may be difficult or practically, or even theoretically, impossible to satisfy them. This is part of why non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress.

==Overview==
Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress, not an established edifice. This article will try to sketch some approaches to it and some concepts important for it.

Some concepts of particular importance for non-equilibrium thermodynamics include time rate of dissipation of energy (Rayleigh 1873,&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1873"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strutt | first1 = J.

''An Introduction to Thermomechanics'', North-Holland, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0-444-86503-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balescu"&gt;Balescu, R. (1975). ''Equilibrium and Non-equilibrium Statistical Mechanics'', Wiley-Interscience, New York, {{ISBN|0-471-04600-0}}, Section 3.2, pages 64-72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[dissipative structure]],&lt;ref name="G&amp;P 1971"/&gt; and non-linear dynamical structure.&lt;ref name="Lavenda 1978"/&gt;

One problem of interest is the thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium [[steady state]]s, in which [[entropy]] production and some [[flux|flows]] are non-zero, but there is no [[Time-variant system|time variation]] of physical variables.

One initial approach to non-equilibrium thermodynamics is sometimes called 'classical irreversible thermodynamics'.&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"/&gt; There are other approaches to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, for example [[extended irreversible thermodynamics]],&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JCVL 1993"/&gt; and generalized thermodynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Eu, B.C. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; but they are hardly touched on in the present article.

===Quasi-radiationless non-equilibrium thermodynamics of matter in laboratory conditions===
According to Wildt&lt;ref name="Wildt 1972"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wildt |first=R. |year=1972 |title=Thermodynamics of the gray atmosphere. IV.

At laboratory temperatures, in laboratory quantities of matter, thermal radiation is weak and can be practically nearly ignored. But, for example, atmospheric physics is concerned with large amounts of matter, occupying cubic kilometers, that, taken as a whole, are not within the range of laboratory quantities; then thermal radiation cannot be ignored.

===Local equilibrium thermodynamics===
The terms 'classical irreversible thermodynamics'&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"/&gt; and 'local equilibrium thermodynamics' are sometimes used to refer to a version of non-equilibrium thermodynamics that demands certain simplifying assumptions, as follows. The assumptions have the effect of making each very small volume element of the system effectively homogeneous, or well-mixed, or without an effective spatial structure, and without kinetic energy of bulk flow or of diffusive flux. Even within the thought-frame of classical irreversible thermodynamics, care&lt;ref name="Lavenda 1978"/&gt; is needed in choosing the independent variables&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I., Defay, R.

In some writings, it is assumed that the intensive variables of equilibrium thermodynamics are sufficient as the independent variables for the task (such variables are considered to have no 'memory', and do not show hysteresis); in particular, local flow intensive variables are not admitted as independent variables; local flows are considered as dependent on quasi-static local intensive variables.

Also it is assumed that the local entropy density is the same function of the other local intensive variables as in equilibrium; this is called the local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption&lt;ref name="Gyarmati 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lavenda 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G&amp;P 1971"&gt;Glansdorff, P., Prigogine, I.

Radiation is ignored because it is transfer of energy between regions, which can be remote from one another. In the classical irreversible thermodynamic approach, there is allowed very small spatial variation, from very small volume element to adjacent very small volume element, but it is assumed that the global entropy of the system can be found by simple spatial integration of the local entropy density; this means that spatial structure cannot contribute as it properly should to the global entropy assessment for the system. This approach assumes spatial and temporal continuity and even differentiability of locally defined intensive variables such as temperature and internal energy density. All of these are very stringent demands. Consequently, this approach can deal with only a very limited range of phenomena. This approach is nevertheless valuable because it can deal well with some macroscopically observable phenomena.{{examples|date=February 2015}}

In other writings, local flow variables are considered; these might be considered as classical by analogy with the time-invariant long-term time-averages of flows produced by endlessly repeated cyclic processes; examples with flows are in the [[thermoelectric effect|thermoelectric phenomena]] known as the Seebeck and the Peltier effects, considered by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in the nineteenth century and by [[Lars Onsager|Onsager]] in the twentieth.&lt;ref name="De Groot Mazur 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D. (2008). ''Introduction to Modern Thermodynamics'', Wiley, Chichester UK, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01598-8}}, pages 333-338.&lt;/ref&gt; These effects occur at metal junctions, which were originally effectively treated as two-dimensional surfaces, with no spatial volume, and no spatial variation.

====Local equilibrium thermodynamics with materials with "memory"====
A further extension of local equilibrium thermodynamics is to allow that materials may have "memory", so that their [[constitutive equation]]s depend not only on present values but also on past values of local equilibrium variables. Thus time comes into the picture more deeply than for time-dependent local equilibrium thermodynamics with memoryless materials, but fluxes are not independent variables of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coleman | first1 = B.D. | last2 = Noll | first2 = W. | year = 1963 | title = The thermodynamics of elastic materials with heat conduction and viscosity | url = | journal = Arch.

===Extended irreversible thermodynamics===
'''Extended irreversible thermodynamics''' is a branch of non-equilibrium thermodynamics that goes outside the restriction to the local equilibrium hypothesis. The space of state variables is enlarged by including the [[flux]]es of mass, momentum and energy and eventually higher order fluxes.
The formalism is well-suited for describing high-frequency processes and small-length scales materials.

==Basic concepts==
There are many examples of stationary non-equilibrium systems, some very simple, like a system confined between two thermostats at different temperatures or the ordinary  [[Couette flow]], a fluid  enclosed between two flat walls moving in opposite directions and defining non-equilibrium conditions at the walls. [[Laser]] action is also a non-equilibrium process, but it depends on departure from local thermodynamic equilibrium and is thus beyond the scope of classical irreversible thermodynamics; here a strong temperature difference is maintained between two molecular degrees of freedom (with molecular laser,  vibrational and rotational molecular motion), the requirement for two component 'temperatures' in the one small region of space, precluding local thermodynamic equilibrium, which demands that only one temperature be needed. Damping of acoustic perturbations or shock waves are non-stationary non-equilibrium processes.  Driven [[complex fluids]], turbulent systems and glasses are other examples of non-equilibrium systems.

The mechanics of macroscopic systems depends on a number of extensive quantities. It should be stressed that all systems are permanently interacting with their surroundings, thereby causing unavoidable fluctuations of [[extensive quantity|extensive quantiti]]es. Equilibrium conditions of thermodynamic systems are related to the maximum property of the entropy.  If the only extensive quantity that is allowed to fluctuate is the internal energy, all the other ones being kept strictly constant, the temperature of the system is measurable and meaningful. The system's properties are then most conveniently described using the thermodynamic potential [[Helmholtz free energy]] (''A'' = ''U'' - ''TS''), a  [[Legendre transformation]] of the energy. If, next to fluctuations of the energy, the macroscopic dimensions (volume) of the system are left fluctuating, we use the [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G'' = ''U'' + ''PV'' - ''TS''), where the system's properties are determined both by the temperature and by the pressure.

Non-equilibrium systems are much more complex and they may undergo fluctuations of more extensive quantities. The boundary conditions impose on them particular intensive variables, like temperature gradients or distorted collective motions (shear motions, vortices, etc.), often called thermodynamic forces. If free energies are very useful in equilibrium thermodynamics, it must be stressed that there is no general law defining stationary non-equilibrium properties of the energy as is the second law of thermodynamics for the [[entropy]] in equilibrium thermodynamics.  That is why in such cases a more generalized Legendre transformation should be considered. This is the extended Massieu potential.
By definition, the [[entropy]] (''S'') is a function of the collection of [[extensive quantity|extensive quantiti]]es &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt;. Each extensive quantity has a conjugate intensive variable &lt;math&gt;I_i&lt;/math&gt; (a restricted definition of intensive variable is used here by comparison to the definition given in this link)  so that:

:&lt;math&gt; I_i = \partial{S}/\partial{E_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

We then define the extended [[Massieu function]] as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\ k_b M = S - \sum_i( I_i E_i),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ k_b&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], whence

:&lt;math&gt;\ k_b \, dM = \sum_i (E_i \, dI_i).&lt;/math&gt;

The independent variables are the intensities.

Intensities are global values, valid for the system as a whole. When boundaries impose to the system different local conditions, (e.g. temperature differences), there are intensive variables representing the average value and others representing gradients or higher moments. The latter are the thermodynamic forces driving fluxes of extensive properties through the system.

It may be shown that the Legendre transformation changes the maximum condition of the entropy (valid at equilibrium) in a minimum condition of the extended Massieu function for stationary states, no matter whether at equilibrium or not.

==Stationary states, fluctuations, and stability==
In thermodynamics one is often interested in a stationary state of a process, allowing that the stationary state include the occurrence of unpredictable and experimentally unreproducible fluctuations in the state of the system. The fluctuations are due to the system's internal sub-processes and to exchange of matter or energy with the system's surroundings that create the constraints that define the process.

If the stationary state of the process is stable, then the unreproducible fluctuations involve local transient decreases of entropy. The reproducible response of the system is then to increase the entropy back to its maximum by irreversible processes: the fluctuation cannot be reproduced with a significant level of probability. Fluctuations about stable stationary states are extremely small except near critical points (Kondepudi and Prigogine 1998, page 323).&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D., Prigogine, I, (1998). ''Modern Thermodynamics. From Heat Engines to Dissipative Structures'', Wiley, Chichester, 1998, {{ISBN|0-471-97394-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The stable stationary state has a local maximum of entropy and is locally the most reproducible state of the system. There are theorems about the irreversible dissipation of fluctuations. Here 'local' means local with respect to the abstract space of thermodynamic coordinates of state of the system.

If the stationary state is unstable, then any fluctuation will almost surely trigger the virtually explosive departure of the system from the unstable stationary state. This can be accompanied by increased export of entropy.

==Local thermodynamic equilibrium==
The scope of present-day non-equilibrium thermodynamics does not cover all physical processes. A condition for the validity of many studies in non-equilibrium thermodynamics of matter is that they deal with what is known as ''local thermodynamic equilibrium''.

===Local thermodynamic equilibrium of ponderable matter===
''Local thermodynamic equilibrium of matter''&lt;ref name="Gyarmati 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G&amp;P 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balescu 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mihalas Mihalas 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schloegl 1989"/&gt; (see also Keizer (1987)&lt;ref name="Keizer 1987"/&gt; means that conceptually, for study and analysis, the system can be spatially and temporally divided into 'cells' or 'micro-phases' of small (infinitesimal) size, in which classical thermodynamical equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation. These conditions are unfulfilled, for example, in very rarefied gases, in which molecular collisions are infrequent; and in the boundary layers of a star, where radiation is passing energy to space; and for interacting fermions at very low temperature, where dissipative processes become ineffective. When these 'cells' are defined, one admits that matter and energy may pass freely between contiguous 'cells', slowly enough to leave the 'cells' in their respective individual local thermodynamic equilibria with respect to intensive variables.

One can think here of two 'relaxation times' separated by order of magnitude.&lt;ref name="Zubarev 1971/1974"&gt;[[Dmitry Zubarev|Zubarev D. N.]],(1974). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SQy3AAAAIAAJ&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI Nonequilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics]'', translated from the Russian by P.J. Shepherd, New York, Consultants Bureau. {{ISBN|0-306-10895-X}}; {{ISBN|978-0-306-10895-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The longer relaxation time is of the order of magnitude of times taken for the macroscopic dynamical structure of the system to change. The shorter is of the order of magnitude of times taken for a single 'cell' to reach local thermodynamic equilibrium. If these two relaxation times are not well separated, then the classical non-equilibrium thermodynamical concept of local thermodynamic equilibrium loses its meaning&lt;ref name="Zubarev 1971/1974"/&gt; and other approaches have to be proposed,  see for instance [[Extended irreversible thermodynamics]]. For example, in the atmosphere, the speed of sound is much greater than the wind speed; this favours the idea of local thermodynamic equilibrium of matter for atmospheric heat transfer studies at altitudes below about 60&amp;nbsp;km where sound propagates, but not above 100&amp;nbsp;km, where, because of the paucity of intermolecular collisions, sound does not propagate.

===Milne's 1928 definition of local thermodynamic equilibrium in terms of radiative equilibrium===
Milne (1928),&lt;ref name="Milne 1928"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Milne |first1= E.A. |year=1928 | title= The effect of collisions on monochromatic radiative equilibrium |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume= 88|pages=493–502|bibcode=1928MNRAS..88..493M | doi = 10.1093/mnras/88.6.493 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking about stars, gave a definition of 'local thermodynamic equilibrium' in terms of the [[thermal radiation]] of the [[matter]] in each small local 'cell'. He defined 'local thermodynamic equilibrium' in a 'cell' by requiring that it macroscopically absorb and spontaneously emit radiation as if it were in radiative equilibrium in a cavity at the [[temperature]] of the matter of the 'cell'. Then it strictly obeys Kirchhoff's law of equality of radiative emissivity and absorptivity, with a black body source function. The key to local thermodynamic equilibrium here is that the rate of collisions of ponderable matter particles such as molecules should far exceed the rates of creation and annihilation of photons.

==Entropy in evolving systems==

Grandy Jr that entropy, though it may be defined for a non-equilibrium system, is when strictly considered, only a macroscopic quantity that refers to the whole system, and is not a dynamical variable and in general does not act as a local potential that describes local physical forces. Under special circumstances, however, one can metaphorically think as if the thermal variables behaved like local physical forces. The approximation that constitutes classical irreversible thermodynamics is built on this metaphoric thinking.

This point of view shares many points in common with the concept and the use of entropy in continuum thermomechanics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Rational Thermodynamics | year = 1984 | last1 = Truesdell | first1 = Clifford | publisher = Springer | edition = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Continuum Thermomechanics | year = 2002 | last1 = Maugin | first1 = Gérard A. | publisher = Kluwer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Continua | year = 2010 | last1 = Gurtin | first1 = Morton E. | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Thermodynamics of Materials with Memory: Theory and Applications | year = 2012| last1 = Amendola | first1 = Giovambattista | publisher = Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt; which evolved completely independently of statistical mechanics and maximum-entropy principles.

===Entropy in non-equilibrium===

To describe deviation of the thermodynamic system from equilibrium, in addition to constitutive variables  &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt;  that are used to fix  the equilibrium state, as was described above, a set of variables &lt;math&gt;\xi_1, \xi_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;  that are called ''internal variables'' have been introduced. The equilibrium state is considered to be stable and the main property of the internal variables, as measures of [[non-equilibrium]] of the system, is their trending to disappear; the local law of disappearing can be written as relaxation equation for each internal variable
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\xi_i}{dt} = - \frac{1}{\tau_i} \, \left(\xi_i - \xi_i^{(0)} \right),\quad i =1,\,2,\ldots , 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
where &lt;math&gt; \tau_i= \tau_i(T, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;  is a relaxation time of a corresponding variables. It is convenient to consider the initial value &lt;math&gt; \xi_i^0&lt;/math&gt;  are equal to zero. The above equation is valid for small deviations from equilibrium; The dynamics of internal variables in general case is considered by Pokrovskii&lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N. (2013) A derivation of the main relations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Hindawi Publishing Corporation: ISRN Thermodynamics, vol. 2013, article ID 906136, 9 p.  https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/906136. &lt;/ref&gt;.    

Entropy of the system in  non-equilibrium is a function of the total set of variables 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
S=S(T, x_1, x_2, , x_n; \xi_1, \xi_2,  \ldots) 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
The essential contribution to the thermodynamics of the  [[non-equilibrium systems]] was brought by [[Prigogine]],  when he and his collaborators  investigated the systems of  chemically reacting substances. The stationary  states of such systems exists due to exchange both particles and energy with the environment. In section 8 of the third chapter of his book &lt;ref&gt;[[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]] (1955/1961/1967). ''Introduction to Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes''. 3rd edition, Wiley Interscience, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;, Prigogine has specified three contributions to the variation of entropy of the considered system at the given volume and constant temperature &lt;math&gt; T&lt;/math&gt; . The increment of [[entropy]] &lt;math&gt; S&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated according to the formula 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
T\,dS = \Delta Q - \sum_{j} \, \Xi_{j} \,\Delta \xi_j  + \sum_{\alpha =1}^k\, \mu_\alpha \, \Delta N_\alpha.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
The first term on the right hand side of the equation presents a stream of thermal energy into the  system;  the last term --  a stream of energy into the system coming with the stream of particles of substances  &lt;math&gt; \Delta N_\alpha &lt;/math&gt;  that can be positive or negative, &lt;math&gt; \mu_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;  is [[chemical potential]] of substance &lt;math&gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.   The  middle term in (1) depicts [[ energy dissipation]] ([[entropy production]])  due to the  relaxation of internal variables &lt;math&gt; \xi_j&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of chemically  reacting substances, which  was investigated  by Prigogine, the internal variables appear to be measures of incompleteness of chemical reactions, that is  measures of how much  the considered system with chemical reactions is  out of equilibrium. The theory can be  generalised &lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N. (2005) Extended thermodynamics in a discrete-system approach,  Eur. J. Phys.  vol. 26,  769-781.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N.

==Flows and forces==
The fundamental relation of classical equilibrium thermodynamics &lt;ref name="W. Greiner et. al. 1997"&gt;W. Greiner, L. Neise, and H.

: &lt;math&gt;dS=\frac{1}{T}dU+\frac{p}{T}dV-\sum_{i=1}^s\frac{\mu_i}{T}dN_i&lt;/math&gt;

expresses the change in [[entropy]] &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; of a system as a function of the intensive quantities [[temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, [[pressure]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; [[chemical potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; and of the differentials of the extensive quantities [[energy]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; [[particle number]] &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Following Onsager (1931,I),&lt;ref name="Onsager 1931 I"/&gt; let us extend our considerations to thermodynamically non-equilibrium systems. As a basis, we need locally defined versions of the extensive macroscopic quantities &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; and of the intensive macroscopic quantities &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt;.

For classical non-equilibrium studies, we will consider some new locally defined intensive macroscopic variables. We can, under suitable conditions, derive these new variables by locally defining the gradients and flux densities of the basic locally defined macroscopic quantities.

Such locally defined gradients of intensive macroscopic variables are called 'thermodynamic forces'. They 'drive' flux densities, perhaps misleadingly often called 'fluxes', which are dual to the forces. These quantities are defined in the article on [[Onsager reciprocal relations]].
 
Establishing the relation between such forces and flux densities is a problem in statistical mechanics. Flux densities (&lt;math&gt;J_i&lt;/math&gt;) may be coupled. The article on [[Onsager reciprocal relations]] considers the stable near-steady thermodynamically non-equilibrium regime, which has dynamics linear in the forces and flux densities.

In stationary conditions, such forces and associated flux densities are by definition time invariant, as also are the system's locally defined entropy and rate of entropy production. Notably, according to [[Ilya Prigogine]] and others, when an open system is in conditions that allow it to reach a stable stationary thermodynamically non-equilibrium state, it organizes itself so as to minimize total entropy production defined locally. This is considered further below.

One wants to take the analysis to the further stage of describing the behaviour of surface and volume integrals of non-stationary local quantities; these integrals are macroscopic fluxes and production rates. In general the dynamics of these integrals are not adequately described by linear equations, though in special cases they can be so described.

==The Onsager relations==
{{Main article|Onsager reciprocal relations}}
Following Section III of Rayleigh (1873),&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1873"/&gt; Onsager (1931, I)&lt;ref name="Onsager 1931 I"/&gt; showed that in the regime where both the flows (&lt;math&gt;J_i&lt;/math&gt;) are small and the thermodynamic forces (&lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;) vary slowly, the rate of creation of entropy &lt;math&gt;(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is [[linear relation|linearly related]] to the flows:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma =  \sum_i J_i\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

and the flows are related to the gradient of the forces, parametrized by a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of coefficients conventionally denoted &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;J_i =  \sum_{j} L_{ij} \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_j} &lt;/math&gt;

from which it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma =  \sum_{i,j} L_{ij} \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_j} &lt;/math&gt;

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires that the matrix &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]. [[Statistical mechanics]] considerations involving microscopic reversibility of dynamics imply that the matrix &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]]. This fact is called the ''Onsager reciprocal relations''.

The generalization of the above equations for the rate of creation of entropy was given by Pokrovskii  &lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N. (2013) A derivation of the main relations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Hindawi Publishing Corporation: ISRN Thermodynamics, vol. 2013, article ID 906136, 9 p.  https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/906136. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculated extremal principles for non-equilibrium processes==
{{main article|Extremal principles in non-equilibrium thermodynamics}}

Until recently, prospects for useful extremal principles in this area have seemed clouded. C. Nicolis (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/qj.49712555718 | last1 = Nicolis | first1 = C. | year = 1999 | title = Entropy production and dynamical complexity in a low-order atmospheric model | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society | volume = 125 | issue = 557| pages = 1859–1878 |bibcode = 1999QJRMS.125.1859N }}&lt;/ref&gt; concludes that one model of atmospheric dynamics has an attractor which is not a regime of maximum or minimum dissipation; she says this seems to rule out the existence of a global organizing principle, and comments that this is to some extent disappointing; she also points to the difficulty of finding a thermodynamically consistent form of entropy production. Another top expert offers an extensive discussion of the possibilities for principles of extrema of entropy production and of dissipation of energy: Chapter 12 of Grandy (2008)&lt;ref name="Grandy 2008"/&gt; is very cautious, and finds difficulty in defining the 'rate of internal entropy production' in many cases, and finds that sometimes for the prediction of the course of a process, an extremum of the quantity called the rate of dissipation of energy may be more useful than that of the rate of entropy production; this quantity appeared in Onsager's 1931&lt;ref name="Onsager 1931 I"/&gt; origination of this subject. Other writers have also felt that prospects for general global extremal principles are clouded. Such writers include Glansdorff and Prigogine (1971), Lebon, Jou and Casas-Vásquez (2008), and Šilhavý (1997).

A recent proposal may perhaps by-pass those clouded prospects.&lt;ref name="Attard 2012"&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Attard|first=P.|title=Optimising Principle for Non-Equilibrium Phase Transitions and Pattern Formation with Results for Heat Convection|journal=|year=2012|arxiv=1208.5105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attard, P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24461">'''Nudge''' is a concept in [[behavioral science]], [[political theory]] and [[behavioral economics]] which proposes [[positive reinforcement]] and indirect suggestions as ways to [[Social influence|influence]] the behavior and [[decision making]] of groups or individuals. Nudging contrasts with other ways to achieve compliance, such as [[education]], [[legislation]] or [[enforcement]]. The concept has influenced British and American politicians. Several nudge units exist around the world at the national level (UK, Germany, Japan and others) as well as at the international level (e.g. [[OECD]], [[World Bank]], [[United Nations|UN]]).

==Definition of a nudge==
[[File:Nudge_Toilet_1.jpg|thumb|Example of a nudge: a housefly painted onto the ceramic of a [[urinal]] in a men's public toilet]]
The first formulation of the term and associated principles was developed in [[cybernetics]] by James Wilk before 1995 and described by Brunel University academic D. J. Stewart as "the art of the nudge" (sometimes referred to as micronudges&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Wilk, J. | year=1999 | chapter=Mind, nature and the emerging science of change: An introduction to metamorphology. | editor1=G. Cornelis|editor2=S. Smets|editor3=J. Van Bendegem | title=EINSTEIN MEETS MAGRITTE: An Interdisciplinary Reflection on Science, Nature, Art, Human Action and Society: Metadebates on science | volume=6 | pages=71–87 | publisher=Springer Netherlands | doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2245-2_6| isbn=978-90-481-5242-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It also drew on methodological influences from clinical [[psychotherapy]] tracing back to [[Gregory Bateson]], including contributions from [[Milton Erickson]], [[Paul Watzlawick|Watzlawick]], [[John Weakland|Weakland]] and Fisch, and [[Bill O'Hanlon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=O'Hanlon, B.|author2=Wilk, J. | year=1987 | title=Shifting contexts : The generation of effective psychotherapy. | publisher=New York, N.Y.: Guilford Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this variant, the nudge is a microtargetted design geared towards a specific group of people, irrespective of the scale of intended intervention.

In 2008, [[Richard Thaler]] and [[Cass Sunstein]]'s book ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]]'' brought nudge theory to prominence. It also gained a following among US and UK politicians, in the private sector and in [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.shponline.co.uk/features-content/full/cpd-article-nudge-nudge-think-think Dr. Jennifer Lunt and Malcolm Staves]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors refer to influencing behaviour without coercion as [[libertarian paternalism]] and the influencers as choice architects.&lt;ref name=speak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lucidez.pe/economia/richard-thaler-y-el-auge-de-la-economia-conductual-por-marco-carrasco/|title=Richard Thaler y el auge de la Economía Conductual|last=Carrasco-Villanueva|first=Marco|date=2017-10-18|language=es|work=Lucidez|access-date=2018-10-31|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thaler and Sunstein defined their concept as:

{{quote|''A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the [[choice architecture]] that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not.''}}

In this form, drawing on [[behavioral economics]], the nudge is more generally applied to influence behaviour.

One of the most frequently cited examples of a nudge is the etching of the image of a housefly into the men's room [[Urinal|urinals]] at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, which is intended to "improve the aim".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A nudge makes it more likely that an individual will make a particular choice, or behave in a particular way, by altering the environment so that automatic cognitive processes are triggered to favour the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual’s behaviour is not always in alignment with their intentions (termed a [[value-action gap]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common knowledge that humans are not fully rational beings; that is, people will often do something that is not in their own self interest, even when they are aware that their actions are not in their best interest.&lt;ref name="Kosters"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosters|first1=M|last2=Van der Heijden|first2=J|title=From mechanism to virtue: evaluating nudge theory|journal=Evaluation|date=2015|volume=21|issue=3|page=276–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, when hungry, dieters often under-estimate their ability to lose weight, and their intentions to eat healthy can be temporarily weakened until they are satiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordgren|first1=L.|last2=Van der Pligt|first2=J.|last3=van Harreveld|first3=F.|title=The instability of health cognitions: visceral states influence self-efficacy and related health beliefs|journal=Health Psychology|date=2008|volume=27|issue=6|page=722–727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaler and Sunstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; describe two distinct systems for processing information as to why people sometimes act against their own self-interest: System 1 is fast, automatic, and highly susceptible to environmental influences; System 2 processing is slow, reflective, and takes into account explicit goals and intentions.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt; When situations are overly complex or overwhelming for an individual’s cognitive capacity, or when an individual is faced with time-constraints or other pressures, System 1 processing takes over decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; System 1 processing relies on various judgmental heuristics to make decisions, resulting in faster decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this can also lead to sub-optimal decisions. In fact, Thaler and Sunstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; trace maladaptive behaviour to situations in which System 1 processing over-rides an individual’s explicit values and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well documented that habitual behaviour is resistant to change without a disruption to the environmental cues that trigger that behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudging techniques aim to use judgmental heuristics to our advantage. In other words, a nudge alters the environment so that when heuristic, or System 1, decision-making is used, the resulting choice will be the most positive or desired outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a nudge is switching the placement of junk food in a store, so that fruit and other healthy options are located next to the cash register, while junk food is relocated to another part of the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroese|first1=F.|last2=Marchiori|first2=D.|last3=de Ridder|first3=D.|title=Nudging healthy food choices: a field experiment at the train station|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=2016|volume=38|issue=2|page=e133–e137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of nudges==
Nudges are small changes in environment that are easy and inexpensive to implement.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several different techniques exist for nudging, including defaults, social proof heuristics, and increasing the salience of the desired option.

A default option is the option an individual automatically receives if he or she does nothing. People are more likely to choose a particular option if it is the default option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Pichert &amp; Katsikopoulos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pichert|first1=D.|last2=Katsikopoulos|first2=K.V.|title=Green defaults: information presentation and pro-environmental behavior|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|date=2008|volume=28|page=63–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that a greater number of consumers chose the [[renewable energy]] option for electricity when it was offered as the default option.

A social proof heuristic refers to the tendency for individuals to look at the behavior of other people to help guide their own behavior. Studies have found some success in using social proof heuristics to nudge individuals to make healthier food choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheung|first1=T.|last2=Kroese|first2=F.|last3=Fennis|first3=B.|last4=de Ridder|first4=D.|title=The hunger games: using hunger to promote healthy choices in self-control conflicts|journal=Appetite|date=2017|volume=116|page=401–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an individual’s attention is drawn towards a particular option, that option will become more salient to the individual, and he or she will be more likely to choose to that option.  As an example, in [[snack]] shops at train stations in the Netherlands, consumers purchased more fruit and [[healthy diet|healthy snack]] options when they were relocated next to the cash register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroese|first1=F.|last2=Marchiori|first2=D.|last3=de Ridder|first3=D.|title=Nudging healthy food choices: a field experiment at the train station|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=2016|volume=38|issue=2|page=e133–e137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of theory==
In 2008, the United States appointed Sunstein, who helped develop the theory, as administrator of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]].&lt;ref name=speak&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favorite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|publisher=''[[The Spectator]]''|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable applications of nudge theory include the formation of the British [[Behavioural Insights Team]] in 2010. It is often called the "Nudge Unit", at the British [[Cabinet Office]], headed by [[David Halpern (psychologist)|David Halpern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/behavioral-insights-team/about#responsibilities|title=About us - Behavioural Insights Team - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and President [[Barack Obama]] sought to employ nudge theory to advance [[domestic policy]] goals during their terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/first-obama-now-cameron-embraces-nudge-theory-2050127.html|title=First Obama, now Cameron embraces 'nudge theory'|date=12 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the government of New South Wales established a Behavioural Insights community of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bi.dpc.nsw.gov.au/|title=Behavioural Insights Unit - What's new in the Behavioural Insights Unit|first=corporateName=Department of Premier and Cabinet; address=1 Farrer Place, Sydney, NSW, 2000; contact=+61 2 9228|last=5555|website=bi.dpc.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudge theory has also been applied to [[business management]] and [[corporate culture]], such as in relation to [[Environment, health and safety|health, safety and environment]] (HSE) and human resources. Regarding its application to HSE, one of the primary goals of nudge is to achieve a "zero accident culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rydermarsh.co.uk/pdfs/SHP.0112.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cast No Shadow|website=Rydermarsh.co.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leading [[Silicon Valley]] companies are forerunners in applying nudge theory in corporate setting. These companies are using nudges in various forms to increase productivity and happiness of employees. Recently, further companies are gaining interest in using what is called "nudge management" to improve the productivity of their white-collar workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Philip|last2=Freibichler|first2=Wolfgang|year=2017|title=Nudge management: applying behavioural science to increase knowledge worker productivity|journal=Journal of Organization Design|volume=6:4|pages=|doi=10.1186/s41469-017-0014-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral insights and nudges are currently used in many countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carrasco-Villanueva |first=Marco |editor=上海社会科学院 [Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences]|title=2016上海青年汉学家研修计划论文集|language=zh|publisher=中国社会科学出版社 [China Social Sciences Press]|date=2016 |pages=368–392 |chapter=中国的环境公共政策：一个行为经济学的选择 [Environmental Public Policies in China: An Opportunity for Behavioral Economics]|isbn=978-1-234-56789-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Nudging has also been criticised. Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation [[The King's Fund]], has said: "We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behaviour changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/unhealthy-lifestyles-here-to-stay-in-spite-of-costly-campaigns-1055693.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Unhealthy lifestyles here to stay, in spite of costly campaigns | first=Nina | last=Lakhani | date=December 7, 2008 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cass Sunstein has responded to critiques at length in his ''The Ethics of Influence''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TlvWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=ethics+of+influence+sunstein#v=onepage&amp;q=ethics%20of%20influence%20sunstein&amp;f=false|title=The Ethics of Influence: Government in the Age of Behavioral Science|last=Sunstein|first=Cass R.|date=2016-08-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107140707|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the case in favor of nudging against charges that nudges diminish [[autonomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Christian|date=2015-10-12|title=On the Ethics of Public Nudging: Autonomy and Agency|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2672970|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;, threaten [[dignity]], violate liberties, or reduce [[welfare]].

Ethicists have debated nudge theory rigorously&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barton|first=Adrien|last2=Grüne-Yanoff|first2=Till|date=2015-09-01|title=From Libertarian Paternalism to Nudging—and Beyond|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=341–359|doi=10.1007/s13164-015-0268-x|issn=1878-5158}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Wilkinson for example charges nudges for being manipulative, while others such as Yeung question their scientific credibility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Karen|date=2012-01-01|title=Nudge as Fudge|journal=The Modern Law Review|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=122–148|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.2012.00893.x|issn=1468-2230}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Public opinion on the ethicality of nudges has also been shown to be susceptible to “partisan nudge bias”.&lt;ref name="NT"&gt;[https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/todd_rogers/files/tannenbaum_fox_rogers.2017.pdf Tannenbaum, D., Fox, C.

Fox, and Todd Rogers (2017) found that adults and policymakers in the United States found behavioral policies to be more ethical when they aligned with their own political leanings.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt; Conversely, people found these same mechanisms to be more unethical when they differed from their politics.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt; The researchers also found that nudges are not inherently partisan: when evaluating behavioral policies absent of political cues, people across the political spectrum were alike in their assessments.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt;

Some, such as Hausman &amp; Welch&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hausman|first=Daniel M.|last2=Welch|first2=Brynn|date=2010-03-01|title=Debate: To Nudge or Not to Nudge*|journal=Journal of Political Philosophy|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=123–136|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9760.2009.00351.x|issn=1467-9760}}&lt;/ref&gt; have inquired whether nudging should be permissible on grounds of (distributive{{clarify|date=February 2018}}) justice; Lepenies &amp; Malecka &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepenies|first=Robert|last2=Małecka|first2=Magdalena|date=2015-09-01|title=The Institutional Consequences of Nudging – Nudges, Politics, and the Law|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=427–437|doi=10.1007/s13164-015-0243-6|issn=1878-5158}}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned whether nudges are compatible with the rule of law.

Behavioral economists such as Bob Sugden have pointed out that the underlying normative benchmark of nudging is still [[homo economicus]], despite the proponents' claim to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugden|first=Robert|date=2017-06-01|title=Do people really want to be nudged towards healthy lifestyles?|journal=International Review of Economics|language=en|volume=64|issue=2|pages=113–123|doi=10.1007/s12232-016-0264-1|issn=1865-1704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists an anticipation and, simultaneously, implicit criticism of the nudge theory in works of Hungarian social psychologists who emphasize the active participation in the nudge of its target (Ferenc Merei)&lt;ref&gt;MÉREI Ferenc (1987): A perem-helyzet egyik változata: a szociálpszichológiai kontúr (A variant of the edge-position: the contour socialpsychological); Pszichológia (1987), 1, pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;, Laszlo Garai&lt;ref&gt;Garai L.

The '''Oceanographic Institute of the University of São Paulo''' ({{lang-pt|Instituto Oceanográfico da Universidade de São Paulo}}, '''IO-USP'''), due to its name in Portuguese, was founded in 1946. It began as an independent institute, sponsored by the government, but was later incorporated into the [[University of São Paulo]], in 1951. It founded because its creators needed scientific basis to [[fishery]] and exploitation of all the available [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[natural resource|resources]] along the [[Brazil]]ian [[coast]], especially in the state of [[São Paulo]].

IO-USP was transformed into a University Unit in 1972, and started to offer post-graduate Masters courses in biological and [[physical oceanography]] in 1973. It offers an undergraduate course as well, and performs many different researches. Now, the institute has two departments - [[Biological Oceanography]] and Physical, Chemical and Geological Oceanography. The institute has 34 teachers and around 150 general non-teaching workers.

Its current director is [[Michel Michaelovitch de Mahiques]].

== Research vessels ==
[[Image:Profwbesnard.jpg|right|thumb|210px|The W. Besnard Oceanographic Ship out in the ocean.]]
The institution has the support of three major vessels - the W. Besnard Oceanographic Ship, as well as the Albacora and the Veliger, used mostly by the graduation students in their field research.

== Research bases ==

The institute has two research bases - Dr. João de Paiva Carvalho base, in the estuarine city of [[Cananéia]], and the Clarimundo de Jesus base, in the coastal city of [[Ubatuba]]. Both are equipped with advanced laboratories and sufficient research vessels, with the fundamental support of the main vessel, the W. Besnard Oceanographip Ship.

{{Politics |Related}}

'''Political psychology''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field dedicated to understanding [[politics]], [[politician]]s and [[political behavior]] from a [[psychology|psychological]] perspective. The relationship between politics and psychology is considered bi-directional, with psychology being used as a lens for understanding politics and politics being used as a lens for understanding psychology. As an interdisciplinary field, political psychology borrows from a wide range of other disciplines, including: [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[international relations]], [[economics]], [[philosophy]], [[Media (communication)|media]], [[journalism]] and [[history]].

Political psychology aims to understand interdependent relationships between individuals and contexts that are influenced by beliefs, motivation, perception, cognition, information processing, learning strategies, socialization and attitude formation. Political psychological theory and approaches have been applied in many contexts such as: leadership role; domestic and foreign policy making; behavior in ethnic violence, war and genocide; group dynamics and conflict; racist behavior; voting attitudes and motivation; voting and the role of the media; nationalism; and political extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology|edition = 2nd |publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence political psychologists study the foundations, dynamics, and outcomes of political behavior using cognitive and social explanations.

==History and early influences==

===France===
Political psychology originated from Western Europe, France, where it was closely tied to the emergence of new disciplines and paradigms as well as to the precise social and political context in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., 'Outline of a cultural history of political psychology'. Chapter 1, pp. 3-22 in: Stone, W. &amp; Schaffner, P. (1988), The psychology of politics. New York: Springer (2nd ed.). More elaborate backgrounds in: Van Ginneken. J. (1992). Crowds, psychology and politics. New York: Cambridge University Press. And its sequel: Van Ginneken, J. (2007). Mass movements. Apeldoorn (Neth.): Spinhuis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The discipline political psychology was formally introduced during the Franco-Prussian war and the socialist revolution, stirred by the rise of the [[Paris Commune]] (1871).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Monroe, K.R.|year=2002 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers| page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "political psychology" was first introduced by the [[ethnologist]] Adolph Bastian in his book ''[[Man in History]]'' (1860). The philosopher [[Hippolyte Taine]] (1828–1893), a founder of the Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, applied Bastian's theories in his works ''[[The Origins of Contemporary France]]'' (1875–1893), to ideas on the founding and development of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. The head of Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, [[Emile Boutmy]] (1835–1906), was a famous explorer of social, political and geographical concepts of national interactions. He contributed various works on political psychology such as ''English People; A study of their Political Psychology'' (1901) and ''The American People; Elements of Their Political Psychology'' (1902).&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudmin |first=F. W. |title= G.B.Grundy's 1917 Proposal for Political Psychology: "A science shich has yet to be Created" |journal= ISPP News |year=2005 |volume=16 |pages=6–7 |url= http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/RudminGrundyBio6.pdf|accessdate=5 Dec 2011 |doi= |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contributor of [[Crowd psychology|crowd theory]] [[Gustave Le Bon]] (1841–1931) suggested that crowd activity subdued will and polluted rational thought which resulted in uncontrollable impulses and emotions. He suggested in his works ''Psychology of Socialism'' (1896) and ''Political Psychology and Social Defense'' (1910)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Monroe, K.R.|year=2002 |title= Political Psychology (p.70)|edition=2nd|publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers| page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in the uncontrollable state of a crowd people were more vulnerable to submission and leadership, and suggested that embracing [[nationalism]] would remedy this.

===Italy===
Meanwhile in Italy, the [[Risorgimento]] (1870) instigated various social reforms and voting rights. The large division in social class during this period led lawyer [[Gaetano Mosca]] (1858–1914) to publish his work, ''The Ruling Class: Elements of Political Science'' (1896), which theorized the presence of the ruling and the ruled classes of all societies.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The psychology of Politics|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing| page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1828–1923), inspired by Mosca's concepts, contributed ''The Rise and Fall of the Elites'' (1901) and ''The Socialist System'' (1902–1903) to the discipline of political psychology, theorizing on the role of class and social systems. His work ''[[The Mind and Society]]'' (1916) offers a sociology [[treatise]].&lt;ref name="VanGinneken-c1"&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.9)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosca and Pareto's texts on the Italian elite contributed to the theories of Robert Michels (1875–1936). Michels was a German socialist fascinated by the distinction between the largely lower class run parliament in Germany and upper class run parliament in Italy. He wrote ''Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchic Tendencies of Modern Democracy'' (1911).&lt;ref name="VanGinneken-c1" /&gt;

===Austria===
A large psychoanalytical influence was contributed to the discipline of political psychology by [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939). His texts ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913) and ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1921) linked psychoanalysis with politics. Freud and [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|Bullitt]] (1967) developed the first psychobiographical explanation to how the personality characteristics of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] affected his decision making during World War I. [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1897–1957), inspired by the effects of World War II, was interested in whether personality types varied according to epoch, culture and class. He described the bidirectional effect of group, society and the environment with personality. He combined Freudian and [[Marxist]] theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' (1933). He also edited ''The Journal for Political Psychology and Sexual Economy'' (1934–1938) which was the first journal to present political psychology in the principal of western language.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.11)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany, novice political alterations and [[fascist]] control during World War II spurred research into authoritarianism from [[Frankfurt school]]. Philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] (1898–1979) opened up issues concerning freedom and authority in his book, ''[[Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory]]'' (1941), where he suggested groups compromise on individual rights. [[Theodor Adorno]] (1903–1969) also investigated authoritarian individuals and anti-Semitism. His report ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) attempts to determine the personality type susceptible to following fascism and anti-democratic propaganda. Nazi movements during World War II also spurred controversial psychologists such as [[Walther Poppelreuter]] (1932) to lecture and write about political psychology that identified with Hitler. The psychologist [[Eric Jaensch]] (1883–1940) contributed the racist book ''The Anti-type'' (1933).

===United Kingdom===
At the turn of the century, [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]] introduced disciplinary political psychology courses such as "The Sciences of the Man", along with the foundation of the Psychological society (1901) and the Sociological society (1904).&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.15)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford historian [[G. B. Grundy]] (1861–1948) noted political psychology (1917) as a sub-discipline of history. Motivated by social and political behavior during World War I, he deemed a new branch of historical science, "The Psychology of Men Acting in Masses".&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7" /&gt; He referred to science to instrument the clarification of mistaken beliefs about intention.&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7" /&gt; The intellectual [[Graham Wallas]] (1859–1932) implicated the significance of studying psychology in politics in  ''Human Nature in Politics'' (1908). Wallace emphasized the importance of enlightening politicians and the public about the psychological processes in order to raise awareness on exploitation while developing control over one's own psychological intellect. He suggested in ''[[Great Society (book)|Great Society]]'' (1917) that recognition of such processes could help to build a more functional humanity.

===United States===
Across the Atlantic the first American to be considered a political psychologist was [[Harold Lasswell]] (1902–1978) whose research was also spurred by a sociological fascination of World War I. His work ''Propaganda Technique in the World War'' (1927) discussed the use of applying psychological theories in order to enhance propaganda technique.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.19)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasswell moved to Europe shortly after where he started to tie Freudian and Adler personality theories to politics and published ''Psychopathology and Politics'' (1930). His major theories involved the motives of the politically active and the relation between propaganda and personality.

Another contributing factor to the development of Political Psychology was the introduction of psychometrics and "The Measurement of Attitude" by [[Thurstone]] and [[Chave]] (1929). The methodological revolution in social science gave quantitative grounds and therefore more credibility to Political Psychology. Research into political preference during campaigns was spurred by [[George Gallup]] (1901–1984), who founded the "American Institute of Public Opinion". The 1940s election in America drew a lot of attention in connection with the start of World War II. Gallup, Roper and Crossley instigated research into the chances of Roosevelt being re-elected. Lazarsfeld, Berelson and Gaudet (1944) also conducted a famous panel study "The People's Choice" on the 1940s election campaign. These studies drew attention to the possibility of measuring political techniques using psychological theories.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.20)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the US into World War II spiraled vast research into fields such as war technique, propaganda, group moral, psycho-biography and culture conflict to name a few, with the U.S. army and Navy recruiting young psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.21)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the discipline quickly developed and gained international accreditation.

McGuire identifies three broad phases in the development of political psychology, these three phases are:
1.The era of [[personality studies]] in the 1940s and 1950s dominated by psychoanalysis 
2.The era of [[political attitudes]] and voting behavior studies in the 1960s and 1970s characterized by the popularity of "rational man" assumptions
3.An era since the 1980s and 1990s, which has focused on [[political beliefs]], information processing and decision making, and has dealt in particular with international politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=David Patrick Houghton|year=2013 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and politics==

The study of [[Personality psychology|personality]] in political psychology focuses on the effects of leadership personality on decision-making, and the consequences of mass personality on leadership boundaries. Key personality approaches utilized in political psychology are psychoanalytic theories, trait-based theories and motive-based theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.15)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A psychoanalytical approach===
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) made significant contributions to the study of personality in political psychology through his theories on the unconscious motives of behavior. Freud suggested that a leader's behavior and decision making skill were largely determined by the interaction in their personality of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#id|id]], [[Id, ego and super-ego#ego|ego]] and [[superego]], and their control of the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] and [[reality principle]]. The psychoanalytic approach has also been used extensively in psychobiographies of political leaders. Psychobiographies draw inferences from personal, social and political development, starting from childhood, to understand behavior patterns that can be implemented to predict decision-making motives and strategies.

===A trait-based approach===
Traits are personality characteristics that show to be stable over time and in different situations, creating predispositions to perceive and respond in particular ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press| page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] (1897-1967) realized the study of traits introducing central, secondary, cardinal and common traits. These four distinctions suggest that people demonstrate traits to varying degrees, and further that there is a difference between individual and common traits to be recognized within a society. [[Hans Eysenck]] (1916-1997) contributed three major traits, currently however [[Paul Costa Jr|Costa]] and [[Robert R. McCrae|McCrae]]'s (1992)  "Big Five" personality dimensions are the most recognized. These include; neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience and conscientiousness. Theories in political psychology induce that one's combination of these traits has implications for leadership style and capacity. For example, individuals who score highly on extroversion are demonstrated as having superior leadership skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.20)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Myers-Briggs Type indicator (MBTI) is a personality assessment scale commonly used in the study of political personality and for job profiling.

===A motive-based approach===
In terms of political psychology [[motivation]] is viewed as goal-oriented behavior driven by a need for three things; [[Power (social and political)|power]], affiliation intimacy, and [[Goal#Achieving personal goals|achievement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.21)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categories were grouped by Winter (1996) from Murray's (1938) twenty suggested common human goals. Need for power affects the style in which a leader performs. Winter and Stewart (1977) suggested that leaders high in power motivation and low in need of affiliation intimacy motivation make better presidents. Affiliation-motivated leaders alternatively tend to collaborate joint efforts in the absence of threat. Lastly, achievement motivation has demonstrated to not correspond with political success, especially if it is higher than power motivation (Winter, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sears, D.O., Huddy, L., Jervis, R.|year=2003 |title= Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology (p.122)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation between a leader and those whom they are ruling needs to be consistent with success. Motives have been shown to be correlated more highly with situation and time since last goal-fulfillment, rather than consistent traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sears, D.O., Huddy, L., Jervis, R.|year=2003 |title= Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology (p.132)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thematic Apperception Test]] (TAT) is commonly used for assessing motives. However, in the case of leadership assessment this test is more difficult to implement therefore more applicable tests are often used such as content analysis of speeches and interviews.

==Frameworks for assessing personality==

===The authoritarian personality===
The [[authoritarian personality]] is a syndrome theory that was developed by the researchers [[Adorno]], [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik|Frenkel-Brunswick]], [[Daniel Levinson|Levinson]] and [[Nevitt Sanford|Sanford]] (1950) at The University of California. The American Jewish Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jost, J.T., Sidanius, J.|year=2004 |title= Political Psychology: Key Readings (p.47)|edition=1st|publisher= London: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsidized research and publishing on the theory since it revolved around ideas developed from World War II events. [[Adorno]] (1950) explained the authoritarian personality type from a psychoanalytic point of view suggesting it to be a result of highly controlled and conventional parenting. Adorno (1950) explained that individuals with an authoritarian personality type had been stunted in terms of developing an ability to control the sexual and aggressive id impulses. This resulted in a fear of them and thus a development of defense mechanisms to avoid confronting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.40)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian personality types are persons described as swinging between depending on yet resenting authority. The syndrome was theorized to encompass nine characteristics; conventionalism, authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, anti-intraception (an opposition to subjective or imaginative tendencies), superstition and stereotypy, power and toughness, destructiveness and cynicism, sex obsession, and projectivity. The authoritarian personality type is suggested to be; ethnocentric, ego-defensive, mentally rigid, conforming and conventional, adverse to the out of the ordinary, and as having conservative political views. The book ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) introduces several scales based on different authoritarian personality types. These are; the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] which measures from where and to what degree fascist attitudes develop, the anti-Semitism scale, the ethnocentrism scale and the politico economic conservatism scale. The F-scale however, is the only scale that is expected to measure implicit authoritarian personality tendencies.

[[Bob Altemeyer]] (1996) deconstructed the authoritarian personality using trait analysis. He developed a [[Right-wing Authoritarianism]] (RWA) scale based on the traits; authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism. Altmeyer (1996) suggested that those who score high on the F-scale have a low ability for critical thinking and therefore are less able to contradict authority. Altmeyer's theories also incorporate the psychodynamic point of view, suggesting that authoritarian personality types were taught by their parents to believe that the world was a dangerous place and thus their impulses lead them to make impulsive, emotional and irrational decisions. The beliefs and behavior of an authoritarian are suggested to be easily manipulated by authority instead of being based on internal values.  Altmeyer also theorized that leaders with authoritarian personality types were more susceptible to the [[fundamental attribution error]]. There are many weaknesses associated with this syndrome and the F-scale. It may have been more relevant during the period in which it was produced, being shortly after World War II. The authoritarian personality is generally related to a fascist image however it is suggested to explain behavior of individuals in all political fields.

===Trait-based frameworks===
Trait-based frameworks, excluding the Freudian approach, were suggested by [[James David Barber|James Barber]] (1930–2004) in ''The Presidential Character'' (1972) who highlighted the importance of [[psychobiography]] in political personality analysis. Barber suggested that leadership personality comprised three dimensions; "character", "world view", and "style".&lt;ref name="Cottam-p28"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.28)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barber also proposed that leadership typology followed a pattern leading from an individuals first political success and that it is includes two variables; the effort that a leader puts in and the personal satisfaction that the leader gains. This typology is fairly limited in its dimensions.

[[Etheredge]] (1978) proposed the importance of the traits; "dominance", "interpersonal trust", "self-esteem" and "introversion-extroversion", in leadership views and policy shaping. Etheredge found from studies on leaders during the Soviet Union, that those who scored highly on dominance were more likely to support the use of force during debate settlement. He found that the trait introversion can lead to a lack of co-operation, and that extroversion usually leads to cooperation and negotiation. Further he suggested that interpersonal trust and self-esteem were closely related to not advocating force.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p28" /&gt;

[[Margaret Hermann]] (1976) introduced the [[Leader Trait Assessment]] (LTA) and advocated the development of the [[Profiler-Plus]]. The Profiler-Plus is a computer system used to code spontaneous interview answers for seven major characteristics; need for power, cognitive complexity, task-interpersonal emphasis, self-confidence, locus of control, distrust of others, and ethnocentrism. This method can profile large bodies of leadership related text whilst removing any subjective bias from content analysis. It is efficient and has high reliability.
Hermann and Preston (1994) suggested 5 distinct variables of leadership style; their involvement in policy making, their willingness to tolerate conflict, their level and reasons for motivation, their information managing strategies, and their conflict resolving strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.30)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach is the [[Operational-Code]] method introduced by [[Nathan Leites]] (1951) and restructured by [[Alexander George (philosopher)|Alexander George]] (1979). The code is based on five philosophical beliefs and five instrumental beliefs. A [[Verbs in Context]] (VIC) coding system employed through the Profiler-Plus computer program once again allows substantial bodies of written and spoken speech, interviews and writings to be analyzed subjectively.  The method attempts to be able to predict behavior thorough applying knowledge of various beliefs.

Although political behavior is governed and represented by a leader the consequential influence of the leader largely depends upon the context in which they are placed and in which type of political climate they are running. For this reason group behavior is also instrumental for understanding sociopolitical environments

==The political psychology of groups==

[[Group behavior]] is key in understanding the structure, stability, popularity and ability to make successful decisions of political parties. Individual behavior deviates substantially in a group setting therefore it is difficult to determine group behavior by looking solely at the individuals that comprise the group. Group form and stability is based upon several variables; size, structure, the purpose that the group serves, group development and influences upon a group.

===Group size===
Group size has various consequences. In smaller groups individuals are more committed (Patterson and Schaeffer, 1997) and there is a lower turnover rate (Widmeyer, Brawley and Carron, 1990).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.67)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large groups display greater levels of divergence (O'Dell, 1968) and less conformity (Olson and Caddell, 1994). Group performance also diminishes with size increase, due to decreased co-ordination and free-riding.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt; The size of a [[political party]] or nation can therefore have consequential effects on their ability to co-ordinate and progress.

===Group structure===
The structure of a group is altered by member diversity, which largely affects its efficiency. Individual diversity with in a group has proven to demonstrate less communication and therefore to increase conflict (Maznevski, 1994).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt; This has implications for political parties based in strongly colonial or multiracial nations.
Member diversity has consequences for; status, role allocation and role strain within a group, all of which can cause disagreement. Thus maintenance of group cohesion is key. Cohesion is affected by several factors; the amount of time members spend in the group, the amount that members like one another, the amount of reward that the group offers, the amount of external threat to the group and the level of warmth offered by leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.69)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors should be considered when attempting to form an efficient political group. President decision efficiency for example is affected by the degree to which members of the advisory group have a hierarchical status and by the roles that each member is assigned.

===Group function===
Studying the purpose for formation of a group, whether it is serving a "functional" purpose or an "interpersonal attraction" purpose (Mackie and Goethals, 1987), has implications for political popularity. Often people join groups in order to fulfill certain survival, interpersonal, informational and collective needs.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt;  A political party that provides; stability, clear information, offers power to individuals and satisfies a sense of affiliation, will gain popularity. [[William Schutz|Shutz's]] (1958) "[[Fundamental interpersonal relations orientation]]" theory suggests that groups satisfy the need for control, intimacy and inclusion. Groups also form due to natural attraction. Newcomb (1960)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.70)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that we are drawn to others close in socioeconomic status, beliefs, attitudes and physical appearance. Similarity in certain respects can thus be related to how much a person is attracted to joining one group over another.

===Group development===
[[Group development]] tends to happen in several stages; forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning (Tuckman, 1965). Group awareness of these stages is important in order for members to acknowledge that a process is taking place and that certain stages such as storming are part of progression and that they should not be discouraged or cause fear of instability. Awareness of group development also allows for models to be implemented in order to manipulate different stages. External influences upon a group will have different effects depending upon which stage the group is at in its course. This has implications for how open a group should be depending upon the stage of development it is at, and on its strength.
Consistency is also a key aspect in a group for success (Wood, 1994).

===The influence of conformity in groups===
The application of conformity is key for understanding group influence in political behaviour. Decision making within a group is largely influenced by conformity. It is theorized to occur based on two motives; [[normative social influence]] and [[informational social influence]] (Asch, 1955).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p74"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.74)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance of conformity is influenced by several factors; an increase in group size but only to a certain degree at which it plateaus, and degree of unanimity and commitment to the group. Therefore, the degree of popularity of a political group can be influenced by its existing size and the believed unanimity and commitment by the public of the already existing members. The degree by which the group conforms as a whole can also be influenced by the degree of individuation of its members.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p74" /&gt;
Also, the conformity within political groups can be related to the term, 'political coalition.' Humans represent groups as if there was a special category of an individual. For example, for cognitive simplicity, ancestral groups anthropomorphize each other because they have similar thoughts, values, and a historical background.  Even though the member of a group may have an irrational or wrong argument about a political issue, there is a high possibility for the other members to conform to it because of the mere fact that they are in the same coalition. &lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott, Michael Bang Petersen, “States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics,” International Security, Vol. 36, No. 2, Fall 2011, pp. 48-83&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of power in groups===
Power is another influential factor within a group or between separate groups. The "critical bases of power" developed by French and Raven (1959) allocates the following types of power as the most successful; reward power, coercive power, legitimate power, [[referent power]] and expert power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.76)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The way in which power is exerted upon a group can have repercussive outcomes for popularity. Referent power results in greater popularity of a political group or leader than coercive power (Shaw and Condelli, 1986).&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.77)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has implications for leaders to manipulate others to identify with them, rather than to enforce consequential punishment. However, if coercive power is enforced, success and a trusted leader (Friedland, 1976) are necessary in order for group conflict not to escalate.&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77" /&gt; Extrinsic punishment and reward are also suggested to detract from intrinsic motivation. A sense of freedom must be advocated to the group.&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77" /&gt;

===Decision-making in groups===
[[Decision-making]] is an important political process which influences the course of a country's policy. Group decision-making is largely influenced by three rules; "[[majority]]-wins rule", "[[truth]]-wins rule", and "first-shift rule". Decision-making is also coerced by [[conformity]]. [[Irrational]] decisions are generally made during emotional periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.83)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an unpopular political party may receive more votes during a period of actual or perceived economic or [[political instability]]. Controversial studies by George Marcus (2003) however imply that high levels of [[anxiety]] can actually cause an individual to analyze information more rationally and carefully, resulting in more well-informed and successful decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schildkraut |first=D. J. |title= All Politics is psychological: A Review of Political Psychology Syllabi |journal= Perspectives on Politics |date=December 2004 |volume=2 |pages=807–819 |url= http://ase.tufts.edu/polsci/faculty/schildkraut/Perspectives2004.pdf |accessdate=5 Dec 2011 |doi= 10.1017/s1537592704040575|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychology of decision-making however must be analyzed in accordance with whether it is within a leadership context or a between group context. The implementation of successful decision-making is often enhanced by group decision-making (Hill, 1982) especially if the decision is important to the group and when the group has been working together for an extended period of time (Watson, Michaelson and Sharp, 1991). However groups can also hinder decision-making if a correct answer is not clear. Janis (1972) introduced the notion of [[Groupthink]] that advocates an increased chance of groups making faulty decisions under several conditions; strong group cohesion, isolation of group decision from public review, the presence of a directive leader in the group, and high stress levels.
[[Group polarization]] (Janis, 1972) suggests that group decision-making is often more extreme whether is it more risky or cautious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.84)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Groupthink" refers to "a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=David Patrick Houghton|year=2015 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques to establish more effective decision making skills in political dimensions have been suggested. Hirt and Markman (1995) claim that implementing an individual in a group to find faults and to critique will enable the members to establish alternative view points. George (1980) suggested "multiple advocacy" which implements that a neutral person analyses the pros and cons of various advocate suggestions and thus makes an informed decision.

Applied psychology theories to improve productivity of political groups include implementing "[[team development]]" techniques, "quality circles" and autonomous work groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.81)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using psychology in the understanding of certain political behaviors==

===Evolution===

[[Evolutionary Psychology]] plays a significant role in understanding the state and people of how the current political regime came to be. It is an approach that focuses on the structure of human behavior claiming it’s dependence on the social and ecological environment. Developed through natural selection, the human brain functions to react appropriately to environmental challenges of coalitional conflict using psychological mechanisms and modifications. An example of political conflict would involve state aggression such as war. Psychological mechanisms work to digest what is taken in from internal and external information regarding the current habitat and project it in the most suited form of action such as acts of aggression, retrieval, dominance, and so forth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anthony C. Lopez |author2=Rose McDermott |author3=Michael Bang Petersen |authorlink1=States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics |title= States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics |volume=36 |issue=2 fall 2011 |pages=48-83 |publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting behavior===

In order to make inferences and predictions about behavior concerning voting decision, certain key public influences must be considered. These influences include the role of emotions, political socialization, [[political sophistication]], tolerance of diversity of political views and the media. The effect of these influences on [[voting behavior]] is best understood through theories on the formation of attitudes, beliefs, schema, knowledge structures and the practice of information processing. The degree to which voting decision is affected by internal processing systems of political information and external influences, alters the quality of making truly democratic decisions.

===Conflict===

The application of psychology for understanding conflict and extreme acts of violence can be understood in both individual and group terms. Political conflict is often a consequence of ethnic disparity and "ethnocentrism" Sumner (1906).

On an individual level participators in situations of conflict can either be perpetrators, bystanders or altruists. The behavior of perpetrators is often explained through the authoritarian personality type. Individual differences in levels of empathy have been used to explain whether an individual chooses to stand up to authority or ignore a conflict. Rotter's (1954) [[locus of control]] theory in personality psychology has also been used to determine individual differences in reaction to situations of conflict.

Group behavior during conflict often affects the actions of an individual. The [[bystander effect]] introduced by Darley and Latane (1968) demonstrates that group behavior causes individuals to monitor whether others think it is necessary to react in a situation and thus base their behavior on this judgment. They also found that individuals are more likely to diffuse responsibility in group situations. These theories can be applied to situations of conflict and genocide in which individuals remove personal responsibility and therefore justify their behavior. [[Social identity theory]] explains that during the Holocaust of World War II political leaders used the Jews as an out-group in order to increase in-group cohesion. This allowed for the perpetrators to depersonalize from the situation and to diffuse their responsibility. The out-groups were held in separate confines and dehumanized in order to aid the in-group to disengage themselves from relating.

Research by Dr. Dan Kahan has demonstrated that individuals are resistant to accepting new political views even if they are presented with evidence that challenges their views.  The research also demonstrated that if the individual was required to write a few sentences about experiences they enjoyed or spend a few moments affirming their self-worth, the individual was more likely to accept the new political position.&lt;ref&gt;Motivated Numeracy and Enlightened Self-Government. retrieved on August 25, 2014. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319992&lt;/ref&gt;

Although somewhat unusual, [[evolutionary psychology]] can also explain conflicts in politics and the international society. A journal by Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott and Michael Bang Petersen uses this idea to give out hypothesis to explain political events. According to the authors, instincts and psychological characteristics developed through evolution is still existent with modern people. They suggest human being as "adaptation executers"; people designed through natural selection, and not "utility maximizers"; people who strive for utility in every moment. Though a group of people, perhaps those who are in the same political coalition, may seem as if they pursue a common utility maximization, it is difficult to generalize the theory of "utility maximizers" into a nation-view because people evolved in small groups. This approach helps scholars to explain seemingly irrational behaviors like aggressiveness in politics and international society because "irrational behavior" would be the result of a mismatch between the modern world and evolutionary psychology.

For example, according to evolutionary psychology, coalitional aggression is more commonly found with males. This is because of their [[psychological mechanism]] designed since ancestral times. During those times men had more to earn when winning wars compared to women (they had more chance of finding a mate, or even many mates). Also, the victorious men had more chance of reproduction which eventually led to the succession of aggressive, eager-to-war DNAs. As a result, the authors hypothesize that countries with more men will tend to show more aggressive politics thereby having more possibility of triggering conflicts within and especially among states.

Indeed some exceptions do exists in this theory as this is just a hypothesis. However it is viable enough to be a hypothesis to be tested to explain certain political events like war and crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott, Michael Bang Petersen. "States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics"." International Security 36.2 (2011): 48-83. 20 Sept 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorism===

On an individual level terrorism has been explained as a display of psychopathological personality disorders. Terrorists have demonstrated to show narcissistic personality traits (Lasch, 1979, Pearlstein, 1991). Post (2004) argues that narcissistic and borderline personality disorders are found in terrorists and that mechanisms such as [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] and [[externalization]] are used by terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.271)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Silke (2004) and Mastors and Deffenbaugh (2007) refute this view. Crenshaw (2004) showed that certain terrorist groups are actually careful in not enlisting those demonstrating pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.272)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[authoritarian personality]] theory has also been used as an explanation for terrorist behavior in individuals.

In terms of explaining reasons for which individuals join terrorist groups, motivational theories such as need for power and need for affiliation intimacy are suggested. Festinger (1954) explained that people often join groups in order to compare their own beliefs and attitudes. Joining a terrorist group could be a method to remedy individual uncertainty. Taylor and Louis (2004) explained that individuals strive for meaningful behavior. This can also be used to explain why terrorists look for such radical beliefs and demonstrations. Studies on children in northern Ireland by Field (1979) have shown that exposure to violence can lead to terrorist behavior later on. Implicating the effect of developing acceptable norms in groups. However this view has also been criticized (Taylor, 1998). Other theories suggest that goal frustration can result in aggression (Dollard, Doob. Miller, mower, and Sears, 1939)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.273)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that aggression can lead to frustration (Borum, 2004).
Group settings can cause a social identity and terrorist behavior to manifest. Methods such as dehumanization allow individuals to detach more easily from moral responsibility, and group influence increase the chance that individuals will concede to conformity and compliance. Manipulations of social control and propaganda can also instrument terrorist involvement.

In fact, a strategic model has been proposed to examine the political motivations of terrorists. The strategic model, the dominant paradigm in terrorism studies, considers terrorists are rational actors who attack civilians for political ends. According to this view, terrorists are political utility maximizers. The strategic model rests on three core assumptions which are: (1)terrorists are motivated by relatively stable and consistent political preferences; (2)terrorists evaluate the expected political payoffs of their available options; and (3)terrorism is adopted when the expected political return is superior to those of alternative options. However, it turns out that terrorists' decision-making process does not fully conform to the strategic model. According to Abrahms, Max who is the author of "What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and [[Counterterrorism]] Strategy." &lt;ref&gt;Abrahms, Max. "What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and Counterterrorism Strategy." International Security, vol. 32 no. 4, 2008, pp. 78-105. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/237009&lt;/ref&gt;there are seven common tendencies that represent important empirical puzzles for the strategic model, going against the conventional thought that terrorists are rational actors.

'''Political sociology''' is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State, to civil society, to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. The lineage of this discipline is typically traced from such thinkers as Montesquieu, Smith and Ferguson through the "founding fathers" of sociology – Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber – to such contemporary theorists as Gellner, Giddens, Habermas and Mann. 
Where a typical research question in political [[sociology]] might have been "Why do so few American or European citizens choose to [[Voting|vote]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Why Americans Don't Vote: And Why Politicians Want it That Way | publisher=Pantheon | author=Piven, F. | year=1988 | isbn=0-679-72318-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even "What difference does it make if women get elected?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Phillips |date=1991|title= Engendering Democracy | location= Cambridge| publisher=Polity | URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7EUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; political sociologists also now ask: "How is the body a site of power?",&lt;ref&gt;R. Sassatelli (2011) 'Body Politics' in E. Amenta, K. Nash and A. Scott (eds) The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology, Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; "How are emotions relevant to global [[poverty]]?",&lt;ref&gt;K. Nash (2008) 'Global citizenship as show business: the cultural politics of Make Poverty History' Media, Culture and Society 30/1 &lt;http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/94/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or "What difference does knowledge make to [[democracy]]?"&lt;ref&gt;B.

== Traditional divisions ==
Traditionally there were four main areas of research:

# The sociopolitical formation of the [[modern state]];
# "Who rules?" How [[social inequality]] between [[Social group|groups]] ([[Social class|class]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], etc.) influences [[politics]];&lt;ref&gt;Domhoff G. William. Power Structure Research and the hope for Democracy. Adam Schneider, April 2005. Web Retrieved 29 Sept. 2009. From: &lt;http://www.polycola.com/search.php?stypes=&amp;eng1=yahoo&amp;eng2=google&amp;st=Web&amp;q=three+major+theoretical+frameworks+are+elite+pluralism+and+managerial+theory.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
# How [[public opinion]], [[ideology|ideologies]], personalities, [[social movement]]s, and trends outside of the formal institutions of political power affect formal politics;
# Power relationships within and between social groups (e.g. families, workplaces, bureaucracy, media, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Buzzell,Timothy, Betty A. Dobratz,and Lisa K. Waldner."The Politics of Social Inequality." 14 Mar. 2001. Web. 29 Sept 2009. From: &lt;http://books.emeraldinsight.com/display.asp?K=9780762307562&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, political sociology was traditionally concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes, as well as exploring how various social forces work together to change political policies.&lt;ref&gt;Nachtigal M. Paul."Political Trends Affecting Nonmetropolitan America." Journal of Research in Rural Education Vol.10 (1994):161–166. Print. From: &lt;http://www.jrre.psu.edu/articles/v10,n3,p161-166,Nachtigal.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], elite or managerial theory, and class analysis (which overlaps with [[Marxism|Marxist]] analysis).&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Peter, Arnold Rose, [[Talcott Parsons]], and Neil Smelser. "Political Sociological Theories:Theories of the State and Power." 16 Jan. 2003. Web. 28 Sept 2009 from: &lt;{{cite web |url=http://stmarys.ca/~evanderveen/wvdv/political_sociology/political_sociological_theories.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212105955/http://stmarys.ca/~evanderveen/wvdv/political_sociology/political_sociological_theories.htm |archivedate=2009-12-12 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is [[Theda Skocpol]]. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis A. Coser]]. Masters of sociological Thought.Class Theory 1977: 48–50. Web. Retrieved 29 Sept 2009 from &lt;http://www.polycola.com/search.php?stypes=&amp;eng1=yahoo&amp;eng2=google&amp;st=Web&amp;q=social+class+theory+emerged+when&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It can be split into two parts: one is the "power structure" or "instrumentalist" approach, whereas another is the [[Structural functionalism|structuralist]] approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is [[G. William Domhoff]]. The structuralist approach emphasizes the way a capitalist economy operates; only allowing and encouraging the state to do some things but not others ([[Nicos Poulantzas]], [[Bob Jessop]]).

== Pluralism and power relations ==
Contemporary political sociology takes these questions seriously, but it is concerned with the play of power and politics across societies, which includes, but is not restricted to, relations between the state and society. In part, this is a product of the growing complexity of social relations, the impact of social movement organizing, and the relative weakening of the state as a result of globalization. To a significant part, however, it is due to the radical rethinking of [[social theory]]. This is as much focused now on micro questions (such as the formation of identity through social interaction, the politics of knowledge, and the effects of the contestation of meaning on structures), as it is on macro questions (such as how to capture and use state power). Chief influences here include cultural studies ([[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]), post-structuralism ([[Michel Foucault]], [[Judith Butler]]), pragmatism ([[Luc Boltanski]]), structuration theory ([[Anthony Giddens]]), and cultural sociology ([[Jeffrey C. Alexander]]).

Political sociology attempts to explore the dynamics between the two institutional systems introduced by the advent of Western capitalist system that are the democratic constitutional liberal state and the capitalist economy. While democracy promises impartiality and legal equality before all citizens, the capitalist system results in unequal [[economic power]] and thus possible political inequality as well.

For pluralists,&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, R. (1989). Democracy and its Critics, New Haven&lt;/ref&gt; the distribution of political power is not determined by economic interests but by multiple social divisions and political agendas. The diverse political interests and beliefs of different factions work together through collective organizations to create a flexible and fair representation that in turn influences political parties which make the decisions. The distribution of power is then achieved through the interplay of contending interest groups. The government in this model functions just as a mediating broker and is free from control by any economic power. This pluralistic democracy however requires the existence of an underlying framework that would offer mechanisms for citizenship and expression and the opportunity to organize representations through social and industrial organizations, such as trade unions. Ultimately, decisions are reached through the complex process of bargaining and compromise between various groups pushing for their interests. Many factors, pluralists believe, have ended the domination of the political sphere by an economic elite. The power of organized labour and the increasingly interventionist state have placed restrictions on the power of capital to manipulate and control the state. Additionally, capital is no longer owned by a dominant class, but by an expanding managerial sector and diversified shareholders, none of whom can exert their will upon another.

The pluralist emphasis on fair representation however overshadows the constraints imposed on the extent of choice offered. Bachrauch and Baratz&lt;ref&gt;Bachrach, P. and M. Baratz (1963). Decision and non-decisions. American Political Science Review, Vol 57&lt;/ref&gt; (1963) examined the deliberate withdrawal of certain policies from the political arena. For example, organized movements that express what might seem as radical change in a society can often by portrayed as illegitimate.

'''Popular culture studies''' is the [[academic discipline]] studying [[popular culture]] from a [[critical theory]] perspective. It is generally considered as a combination of [[communication studies]] and [[cultural studies]]. The first department to offer Popular Culture bachelor's and master's degrees is the [[Bowling Green State University Department of Popular Culture]] which was founded by [[Ray B. Browne]].&lt;ref name="raybrowne"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/education/28browne.html?_r=0 | title=Ray Browne, 87, Founder of Pop-Culture Studies, Dies | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date=27 October 2009 | accessdate=12 March 2014 | author=Fox, Margalit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the work of the [[Frankfurt School]], popular culture has come to be taken more seriously as a terrain of academic inquiry and has also helped to change the outlooks of more established disciplines. Conceptual barriers between so-called [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture]] have broken down, accompanying an explosion in scholarly interest in popular culture, which encompasses such diverse media as [[comic books]], [[television]], and the [[Internet]]. Reevaluation of mass culture in the 1970s and 1980s has revealed significant problems with the traditional view of mass culture as degraded and elite culture as uplifting. Divisions between high and low culture have been increasingly seen as political distinctions rather than defensible aesthetic or intellectual ones.&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji &amp; Schudson 1991:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional theories of popular culture==

===The theory of mass society===
[[Mass society]] formed during the 19th-century [[industrialization]] process through the [[division of labor]], the large-scale industrial organization, the concentration of urban populations, the growing centralization of decision making, the development of a complex and international communication system and the growth of mass political movements. The term "mass society", therefore, was introduced by [[anticapitalism|anticapitalist]], aristocratic ideologists and used against the values and practices of industrialized society. Theories of popular culture are often subjected to bias and originate from a generalist perspective.

As [[Alan Swingewood]] points out in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:5-8&lt;/ref&gt; the aristocratic theory of mass society is to be linked to the moral crisis caused by the weakening of traditional centers of authority such as family and religion. The society predicted by [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and others would be dominated by philistine masses, without centers or hierarchies of moral or cultural authority. In such a society, art can only survive by cutting its links with the masses, by withdrawing as an asylum for threatened values. Throughout the 20th century, this type of theory has modulated on the opposition between disinterested, pure autonomous art and commercialized mass culture.

===The theory of culture industry===
Diametrically opposed to the aristocratic view would be the theory of [[culture industry]] developed by [[Frankfurt School]] [[critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]]. In their view, the masses are precisely dominated by an all-encompassing culture industry obeying only to the logic of [[consumer capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s concept of hegemony (see: [[cultural hegemony]]), that is, the domination of society by a specific group which stays in power by partially taking care of and partially repressing the claims of other groups, does not work here anymore. The principle of hegemony as a goal to achieve for an oppressed [[social class]] loses its meaning. The system has taken over; only the state apparatus dominates.

===The theory of progressive evolution===
A third view on popular culture, which fits in the liberal-pluralist ideology and is often called "progressive evolutionism", is overtly optimistic. It sees capitalist economy as creating opportunities for every individual to participate in a culture which is fully democratized through mass education, expansion of leisure time and cheap records and paperbacks. As Swingewood points out in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:22&lt;/ref&gt; there is no question of domination here anymore. In this view, popular culture does not threaten [[high culture]], but is an authentic expression of the needs of the people.

==Contemporary popular culture studies==
Aside from precursors such as [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Roland Barthes]], popular culture studies as we know them today were developed in the late seventies and the eighties. The first influential works were generally politically left-wing and rejected the "aristocratic" view. However, they also criticized the pessimism of the Frankfurt School: contemporary studies on mass culture accept that, apparently, popular culture forms do respond to widespread needs of the public. They also emphasized the capacity of the consumers to resist indoctrination and passive reception. Finally, they avoided any monolithic concept of mass culture. Instead they tried to describe culture as a whole as a complex formation of [[discourse]]s which correspond to particular interests, and which can be dominated by specific groups, but which also always are dialectically related to their producers and consumers.

An example of this tendency is Andrew Ross's ''No Respect. Intellectuals and Popular Culture'' (1989). His chapter on the history of jazz, blues and rock does not present a linear narrative opposing the authentic [[popular music]] to the commercial record industry, but shows how popular music in the U.S., from the twenties until today, evolved out of complex interactions between [[Popular culture|popular]], [[avant-garde]] and [[commerce|commercial]] circuits, between lower- and middle-class youth, between [[African American|blacks]] and [[whites]].

===Traces of the theory of culture industry===
{{Cleanup|section|date=July 2010}}
Still the traditional views have a long life.&lt;ref&gt;overview based on Clem Robyns, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The theory which has been abandoned most massively is the monolithic, [[Cultural pessimism|pessimistic]] view on the culture industry of the [[Frankfurt School]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}{{Dubious|date=July 2010}} However, it is still hotly debated. The criticism raised can be summarized in three main arguments. First of all, the culture industry theory has completely abandoned the [[Marxist]] [[dialectic]] conception of society. Every impulse, according to this view, comes from above. Resistance and contradiction are impossible, and the audience is manipulated into passivity. Alan Swingewood and others emphasize that the Frankfurt theory has to be seen in the light of left-wing frustrations about the failure of proletarian revolutions early this century, and the easy submission of the European nations to [[fascism]].

A second reproach is that this view may be as elitist as its aristocratic counterpart. Both establish the lonely, autonomous, avant-garde intellectual as the only light in a zombie society. Thus the former Marxists arrive at an uncritical praise of the elitist and antirevolutionary upper-class culture. This brings us to a third argument, already made in the sixties by [[Umberto Eco]].&lt;ref&gt;Eco 1988&lt;/ref&gt; In a state-dominated mass society, the lonely, lucid, intellectual [[Übermensch]] can only retreat in his ivory tower. The historicity of the contemporary situation is not taken into account, so its internal contradictions are ignored, and thus revolution can only be seen as purely utopian. The culture industry theory, therefore, would lead to passivity and thereby becomes an objective ally of the system it pretends to criticize.

It is of course mainly the influence exercised by the Frankfurt School which matters here: not all of their texts present the same rigid view. In ''Das Schema der Massenkultur'',&lt;ref&gt;Adorno 1973-1986:331&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, Adorno discusses a "nucleus of individuality" that the culture industry cannot manipulate, and which forces him to continuously repeat his manipulation.

However questioned this view on popular culture may be, it still leaves some traces, for instance, in theories depicting [[narrative]] as necessarily ideologically conservative, like Charles Grivel's ''Production de l'intérêt romanesque''.&lt;ref&gt;Grivel 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories see dominant ideology as purely a matter of messages, propagated in this case through the forms of narrative fiction. Thus they easily arrive at an exaltation of experimental literature as necessarily revolutionary. However, they may neglect the fact that the ideology is never simply in the message, but in the position of the message in the general social discourse, and in the position of its producers in the social formation.

Other theories easily yielding to monolithic thought stem from the emancipation movements of oppressed groups. Early [[feminist theory]], for instance, often described society as universally and transhistorically dominated by patriarchy in every aspect of life, thereby presenting a pejorative view of the women they claim to defend. As Andrew Ross&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989&lt;/ref&gt; argues, the same remark goes for the widely accepted account of rock history as a continuous appropriation of [[Afro-American music|black music]] by a white [[music industry]]. Only studies analyzing the cultural oppression of homosexuality seem to take a less deterministic position.

===Contemporary liberal pluralism===
In liberal-pluralist accounts of popular culture, the theorizing on its supposedly liberating, democratizing function is nowadays most often pushed to the background. This type of criticism, often produced by people who are also active in popular literary writing themselves, often amounts to paraphrase and suffers from an uncritical identification with the study object. One of the main aims of this type of criticism is the establishment of ahistorical [[wiktionary:canon|canon]]s of and within popular genres in the image of legitimized culture. This approach, however, has been accused of [[elitism]] as well.

To put it simply: the [[intellectual]], in this view, can fully enjoy junk culture because of his or her high culture background, but the average reader can never raise to the learned intellectual discourse of which he or she is the object. An example of this form of appropriation is Thomas Roberts's ''An Aesthetics of Junk Fiction'' (1990). Though Roberts claims to take a distance from studies of canonical fiction, he justifies his (implicit) decision to impose canonical models on [[popular fiction]] as follows: "If people who read [[Goethe]] and [[Alessandro Manzoni]] and [[Pushkin]] with pleasure are also reading [[detective fiction]] with pleasure, there is more in the detective story than its critics have recognized, perhaps more than even its writers and readers have recognized",&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1989:5&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates a frequent strategy: the legitimation of popular fiction on the basis of its use of canonized [[literary fiction]], and of the legitimized public's response to it.

If we consider all the views depicted in the present article as instances of both the thesis and the antithesis of an argument, it is a less known scholar, [[Blanca de Lizaur]] who manages to finally produce the synthesis. In the sociological line of Mims and Lerner, she sees Literature as a ''necessary'' social institution -id est: fulfilling an essential social need: That of explaining, justifying and promoting its society's world-view, values, ideas and beliefs, through depicting them "in action" in lyrics and narratives from which we all learn. Not only this: The expression of the feelings that may be expected to accompany depicted actions and events, also constitutes a fundamental part of its social role, as we naturally expect Literature to constructively account for, inform, modulate and educate our feelings. Hence why Literature is present in every human culture, all along history.

Because of its fundamental role and our need for it, Literature will always find its way to, and adapt to the latest technologies and to the furthest reaching distribution channels available. It is also because of this reason that works that successfully represent their audiences' values, ideas and beliefs, and attain commercial success, will at the same time become the subject of unsurmountable pressures -...losing success once power actors manage to substitute their society's message for their own.

De Lizaur, emerging from the field of Literary Studies, also developed a full literary theory that accounts for popular works' aesthetics, strategies, resources, genres, and meaningful criticism, as opposed to ideologized or prejudiced criticism.

===Contemporary apocalyptic thought===
[[Image:MarshallMcLuhan.png|thumb|205px|right|[[Marshall McLuhan]] caused wide irritation with his statement that the traditional, book-oriented intellectuals had become irrelevant for the formulation of cultural rules in the [[electronic age]].]]
Equally alive is the aristocratic apocalyptic view on mass culture as the destruction of genuine art. As Andrew Ross&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:5&lt;/ref&gt; writes, a history of popular culture is also a history of intellectuals, of cultural experts whose self-assigned task it is to define the borders between the popular and the legitimate. But in contemporary society the dispersed authority is ever more exercised by "technical" intellectuals working for specific purposes and not for mankind. And in the academic world, growing attention for popular and marginal cultures threatens the absolute values on which intellectuals have built their autonomy.

In the sixties, [[Marshall McLuhan]] caused wide irritation with his statement that the traditional, book-oriented intellectuals had become irrelevant for the formulation of cultural rules in the electronic age. This is not to say that they lost any real political power, which humanist intellectuals as such hardly ever had. It does mean, however, that they are losing control of their own field, the field of art, of restricted symbolical production ([[Pierre Bourdieu]]). While in the 19th century, intellectuals managed to construct art as a proper, closed domain in which only the in-crowd was allowed to judge, they have seen this autonomy become ever more threatened by 20th-century mass society. The main factor here was not the quantitative expansion of consumption culture, nor the intrusion of commerce into the field of art through the appearance of paperbacks and [[Book sales club|book clubs]]. After all, protecting art from simplicity and commerce was precisely the task intellectuals set for themselves.

More important is the disappearance of what has been called the [[Metanarrative|"grand narratives"]] during this century, the questioning of all-encompassing world views offering coherent interpretations of the world and unequivocal guides for action. As Jim Collins argues in Uncommon Cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1989:2&lt;/ref&gt; there is no master's voice anymore, but only a decentralized assemblage of conflicting voices and institutions. The growing awareness of the historical and cultural variability of moral categories had to be a problem for an intellectual class which had based its position on the defense of secular but transhistorical values.

This brings us to a second problem humanist intellectuals face, that is, the fragmentation of the public. 19th-century intellectuals could still tell themselves that they were either writing for their colleagues, or teaching the undifferentiated masses. 20th-century intellectuals face a heterogeneous whole of groups and media producing their own discourses according to their own logic and interests. Thus they cannot control the reception of their own messages anymore, and thereby see their influence on the structuring of culture threatened. Many neo-apocalyptic intellectuals, such as [[Alain Finkielkraut]] and [[George Steiner]], emphasize their concern about the growing "illiteracy" of the masses. In practice they seem to be mainly concerned with high culture illiteracy, the inability to appreciate difficult art and literary classics.

The neo-aristocratic defense of so-called transhistorical and universal human values may also often be linked to a conservative political project. A return to universal values implies the delegitimation of any group which does not conform to those values. It is no coincidence, therefore, that attempts in the United States to define a common "American cultural legacy" tend to neglect the cultures of ethnic minority groups. Or that the fight against [[franglais]] (French "contaminated" by American English) in France was mainly fought by intellectuals seeing their traditional position in French society threatened by the import of American cultural products, as Clem Robyns&lt;ref&gt;Robyns 1995&lt;/ref&gt; describes.

==Recurring issues in popular culture studies==

===The interactions between popular and legitimized culture===
The blurring of the boundaries between [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture]] is one of the main complaints made by traditional intellectuals about contemporary mass society.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, John Edgar. “Horror and the Gothic’s utility as a cultural resource and critical tool.” ''Palgrave Communications'' 4 (2018): 1-4. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-018-0092-x.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of sociological studies on literary institutions which are held responsible for this mix.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Among the first were commercial [[Book sales club|book clubs]], such as the [[Book of the Month Club|Book-of-the-Month-Club]], appearing from the twenties on. The aggressive reactions they provoked are described by [[Janice Radway]]&lt;ref&gt;Radway 1989&lt;/ref&gt; in "The Scandal of the Middlebrow". According to Radway, the book clubs were perceived as scandalous because they blurred some basic distinctions of cultural discourse. In a society haunted by the spectre of cultural standardization and leveling towards below, they dared to put "serious" fiction on the same level as detective stories, adventure stories, biographies and popular nonfiction. Book clubs were scandalous because they created a space where high and low could meet.

Soon, the term "[[middlebrow]]" was introduced to qualify this phenomenon and to dismiss it as a threat to the authenticity of both high and popular culture. After the book clubs came the mass-production of the [[paperback]] format, and its influence was even more wide-ranging. More about this can be found in Thomas Bonn's book.&lt;ref&gt;Bonn 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It shows through what elaborate strategies the respectable hardcover editors had to go in order to hide the fact that, from the sixties on, paperback publishers had taken over the control on the production of serious literature.

===The possibility of a "subversive" popular culture===
The question whether popular culture or mass culture is inherently conservative, or whether it can be used in a [[Subversion (political)|subversive]] strategy as well,&lt;ref&gt;Browning 2018: 3&lt;/ref&gt; is equally hotly debated. It seems widely accepted that popular culture forms can function at any moment as anti-cultures. [[taste (aesthetics)|"Bad taste"]] products such as [[pornography]] and [[horror fiction]], says for instance Andrew Ross,&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:231&lt;/ref&gt; draw their popular appeal precisely from their expressions of disrespect for the imposed lessons of educated taste. They are expressions of social resentment on the part of groups which have been subordinated and excluded by today's "civilized society".

The question whether popular culture can actually resist dominant ideology, or even contribute to social change, is much more difficult to answer. Many critics easily read popular fiction and film as "attacks against the system", neglecting both the exact ways in which the so-called revolutionary message is enacted, and the capacities of dominant doctrines to recuperate critical messages. Tania Modleski in "The Terror of Pleasure",&lt;ref&gt;Modleski 1986:159&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, presents [[Exploitation film|exploitation horror films]] as attacks on the basic aspects of bourgeois culture. Thus a loving father cannibalizes his child, and priests turn into servants of the devil. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Clem Robyns 1991&lt;/ref&gt; claim that, by presenting their [[perversion]] as supernatural, or at least pathological, [[horror film]]s precisely contribute to perpetuating those institutions.

Similarly, many critics exalt stories which feature a lone hero fighting for his ideals against an inert and amoral system. Thus Jim Collins in ''Uncommon Cultures''&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1989:30-31&lt;/ref&gt; sees [[crime fiction]] opposing a smart private detective and an inefficient police force as a critique of state justice. On the other hand, Thomas Roberts demonstrates in ''An Aesthetics of Junk Fiction'',&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1990:173-174&lt;/ref&gt; a study of the historical background of the private detective model, how the detective story came into existence in the middle of the 19th century, at the time the institution of state police was developed. This force consisted mainly of lower-class people, but nevertheless disposed of a certain authority over the upper class. The fears among the upper classes for this uncontrolled force were eased by domesticating the police in stories explicitly devoted to them. Their inability to pass on correct judgment was amply demonstrated, and forced them to bow for the individual intellect of the detective, who always belonged to the threatened upper class.

Finally, Umberto Eco's studies on [[Superman]] and [[James Bond]]&lt;ref&gt;Eco 1988:211-256, 315-362&lt;/ref&gt; as myths of a static good-and-evil world view should be mentioned as very early and lucid examples of a combination of [[semiotic]] and political analysis.

Still, there may be ways to wage revolt in an age of [[mass media]]. One way could be to introduce small gradual changes in products otherwise conforming to the requirements of a dominant ideology. The problem here, of course, is that isolated messages get drowned in the discourse as a whole, and that they can be used to avoid real changes. Some scholars, however, describe how opposition forces use the logic of the media to subvert them. In ''No Respect'',&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:123&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Ross mentions the late sixties [[Yippie]] movement. Yippies would stage media events, such as the public burning of dollar bills in [[Wall Street]], thereby drawing heavy media coverage. This politics of the spectacle brought the [[counterculture]] right into the conservative media and filled their forms with subversive content.

Whether this strategy is effective or not, it points to an important fact: the mass media are not above, but dependent on the public. As Alan Swingewood states in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:84&lt;/ref&gt; the ideological messages the mass media receive are already mediated by a complex network of institutions and discourses. The media, themselves divided over innumerable specific discourses, transform them again. And finally the public meaningfully relates those messages to individual existences through the mediation of social groups, family networks, etc., which they belong to.

'''Precision mechanics''' (also "fine mechanics") is an engineering discipline that deals with the design and construction of smaller precision [[machine]]s, often including measuring and control mechanisms of different kinds.

The study may be further defined as the practices of rigid body [[kinematics]] to the positioning and holding of objects on the micrometre scale and smaller.

'''Religious Attribution''' in social psychology refers to how individuals attempt to explain/understand causes of behavior and/or events.  Religious attribution is a theory derived from [[attribution theory]] of [[social psychology]].

==Types of religious attributions==
The two types of attributions when considering religion are naturalistic and religious attributions.

===Naturalistic attributions===
Evidence supports that most people under most circumstances initially employ naturalistic attributions and explanations such as references to people, natural events, accidents, or chance.&lt;ref name=Lupfer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lupfer |author2=Brock |author3=DePaola |title=The use of secular and religious attributions to explain everyday behavior|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=1992|volume=31|pages=486–503|doi=10.2307/1386858}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the attribution type that is most common among most, in many different situations.  For example, say one finds himself in a house all alone during a tornado.  Say the man's house gets ripped to shreds, but he somehow survives.  For a naturalistic attributor they may say "that was lucky" or "the tornado must have hit just the right way".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Religious attributions===
Depending upon an array of situational and personal characteristics, there is a good chance of shifting to a more religious attribution type when naturalistic ones do not satisfy the needs for meaning, control, and esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spilka |author2=Shaver |author3=Kirkpatrick |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=1985|doi=10.2307/1386272 |volume=24|pages=1–20|title=A General Attribution Theory for the Psychology of Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Say for example we go back to the man whose house was destroyed by tornado.  A religious attributor would be much for likely to say that they "miraculously" survived, or that it was the work of God that they are still alive.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Why use religious attribution==
The question is why would people use religious attributions anyway.  This question takes us to a few very basic motivational themes that underlie much religious thinking and behavior—namely, the human need for meaning, control and [[Self-esteem|esteem]].&lt;ref name=Spilka2&gt;{{cite book|last=Spilka|first=Ralph W. Hood, Jr., Peter C. Hill, Bernard|title=The psychology of religion : an empirical approach|year=2009|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60623-303-0|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nature of people makes us "need to know" things, and we have need for control and mastery of our lives.  This is where need for control and meaning play in. But why esteem?  Research suggests that people assign causality in order to maintain and enhance their self-esteem. Attributions are triggered when meanings are unclear; and when meaning is unclear control is unclear and self-esteem is challenged.&lt;ref name=Spilka2 /&gt;

===Influences===
There are certain situational factors that combine and intertwine to play are significant role in the prevalence and use of religious attribution. These situational influences fall into two broad categories: "contextual factors" and "event character factors".  Contextual factors is concerned with the degree to which situations are religiously structured i.e. was the person at church? In deep prayer? Event character factors is more concerned with the nature of the event.  When examining research done on contextual factors it is found the salience of religion in general seems to be the largest influence.  This suggests that the [[availability heuristic]] works here, and that religious influence in situations increases the probability of making religious attributions.&lt;ref name=Fiske&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Susan T. Fiske, Shelley E.|title=Social cognition|year=1991|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0070211914|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taking a closer look at event character factors we find that there are a number of internal influences that can factor in, such as: Importance of what takes place; whether the event is positive or negative; the domain of the event (medical, financial, etc.); and whether the event happens to the attributing person, or someone they know.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Importance of event===
People attribute things that are out of their hands to God.  Death of a loved one, natural disaster, etc., all of these things can be "explained" with religious attribution by saying it is God's will.  Science can cover a lot of things but it cannot answer questions like "why me" that people seem to ask whenever something momentous happens in their life.&lt;ref name=Spilka2 /&gt;

===Positivity vs. negativity of event===
Positivity and negativity of an event are important to consider because people often make attributions to God, but not very often to people blame God for the bad things that happen to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulman|author2=Wortman |title=Attributions of blame and coping in the real world: Severe accident victims react to their lot|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1977|volume=35|pages=351–363|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.5.351}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Attributions to God are overwhelmingly positive.&lt;ref name=Lupfer /&gt; Often when something negative happens there is still attribution to God, but it is not negative.  It is not God is punishing me, or God is a giant kid with a magnifying glass smiting everyone; it is rather things like "God is trying to teach me something" or "God is making me stronger".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Event domain===
It is important to consider the event domains when explaining attribution.  There are some domains that are "ready made" for the application of secular understanding, while others seem more appropriate for invoking religious possibilities; for example medical situations elicit more religious attributions than other social or economic type circumstances, like money problems.&lt;ref name=Spilka2 /&gt;

===Personal relevance===
When events occur to us, they are much more personally important than when they happen to others.  We may be upset or deeply concerned when something bad happens to one of our friends, but when it is us suffering from something the question "why me?" comes into play, and attribution is the means to find the answer.  On the other side of the coin if something good happens for someone else, like someone winning the lottery, we may say "well that is lucky" and be happy for the person.  But if you were the one to win it is far more likely to attribute this stroke of luck to "God looking out for you", in other words personal relevance elicits more religious attribution.&lt;ref name=Lupfer /&gt;

==Who uses attribution==
People who attend church frequently, have knowledge in their faith, and people who hold importance of faith highly are more likely to be the type of person to rely more heavily on religious attribution then would people who find themselves lacking in those particular areas.  In simple terms the more conservatively religious or orthodox the home and family in which a person is reared, the greater the person's likelihood of using religious attributions later in life.&lt;ref name=McGuire&gt;{{cite book|last=McGuire|first=Meredith B.|title=Religion, the social context|year=2002|publisher=Wadsworth Thomson Learning|location=Belmont (CA)|isbn=0534541267|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some research that claims that [[Protestants]] will turn to internal or religious attribution more often than will the more orthodox Catholics on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Yexin Jessica|author2=Johnson, Kathryn A. |author3=Cohen, Adam B. |author4=Williams, Melissa J. |author5=Knowles, Eric D. |author6=Chen, Zhansheng |title=Fundamental(ist) attribution error: Protestants are dispositionally focused.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2012|volume=102|issue=2|pages=281–290|doi=10.1037/a0026294 |pmid=22082060}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition children who learn at an early age to attribute things to God are more likely to maintain that characteristic throughout their lifetime.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Self-esteem and locus of control===
Something interesting that most people do not associate with religion that often is the relationship it has with self-esteem and locus of control.  In general people with high self-esteem relate more positive and loving images to God, where as people with low self-esteem may not do this because they feel God has been unloving and cold to them.&lt;ref name=Lupfer /&gt;   When explaining locus of control there are two different modes.  The first is the deferring mode, where people believe that all power resides with God, which would be a low locus of control.  The second is the self-directive mode.  In this situation the person is active and God plays a more passive role in which they share power.  People that use the latter mode tend to draw stronger associations to God, then do people with low locus of control.&lt;ref name=Spilka2 /&gt;

'''Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences''' (Smolny College) of [[Saint Petersburg State University]] ({{lang-ru|Факультет свободных искусств и наук СПбГУ}}) is the first Department in [[Russia]] ([[St. Petersburg]]) to be founded upon the principles of [[liberal education]].

==History==
Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences emerged from Smolny College (officially the Program in "Arts and Humanities"), which was created in 1994 by St.Petersburg State University in close collaboration with [[Bard College]] (USA). Bard College’s interest in curricular  innovation  and the reform of international education coincided with the interests of a group of creatively-minded scholars from St.Petersburg State University.

In the fall of 1997 the Smolny Center announced a program of open courses to be attended by students from SPSU and other St.Petersburg universities. In view of the considerable number of students and professors who responded, showing great interest in liberal education, the Center was transformed into the Program "Arts and Humanities" (Smolny College of Liberal Arts and Sciences) in 1999. The Program accepted its first students in the 1999/2000 academic year.

On February 28, 2011, the Academic Council of St.Petersburg State University voted to create the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Today, there are approximately 600 students enrolled in the Faculty. Students who complete the four-year course receive a B.A. in liberal arts both from Bard College and from St.Petersburg State University. Students from Bard and other American colleges who attend Smolny earn Bard College credit, and Bard students attending Smolny pay Bard tuition.

'''Sociology of language''' is the study of the relations between [[language]] and [[society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman |first=Joshua A. |year=1972 |title=The sociology of language: An interdisciplinary social science approach to language in society |publisher=Newbury House |isbn=978-0-912066-16-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the field of [[sociolinguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mesthrie |first=Rajend |year=2007 |chapter=Sociolinguistics and sociology of language |editor1=Bernard Spolsky |editor2=Francis M. Hult |title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics |isbn=9781405154109 |doi= 10.1111/b.9781405154109.2007.00007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the effect of society on language. One of its longest and most prolific proponents was [[Joshua Fishman]], who among other major contributions, was founding editor of the ''[[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]]''. Sociology of language studies society in relation to language whereas Sociolinguistics studies language in relation to society. For the former, society is the object of study, whereas, for the latter, language is the object of study. The basic idea is that language reflects, among several other things, attitudes that speakers want to exchange or that just get reflected through language use. These attitudes of the speakers is the sociologist's information.

A sociology of language would seek to understand the way that social dynamics are affected by individual and group language use. According to Su-Chiao Chen language is considered to be a social value within this field, which researches social groups for phenomena like [[multilingualism]] and Lingual conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Su-Chiao|editor=Nancy Hornberger and David Corson|title=Encyclopedia of Language and Education: Research Methods in Language and Education|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-011-4535-0|pages=1–14|chapter=Sociology of Language}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have to do with who is 'authorized' to use what language, with whom and under what conditions. It would have to do with how an individual or group identity is established by the language that they have available for them to use. It would seek to understand individual expression, one's (libidinal) investment in the linguistic tools that one has access to in order to bring oneself to other people.

== History and origins ==
Sociology of language, particularly American sociolinguistics, was regarded to have been founded in the early 1960s, mainly by [[William Labov]], who developed much of the methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shuy|first=Roger W. |title=A Brief History of American Sociolinguistics 1949-1989 |journal=Historiographia Linguistica |volume=17 |issue=1-2 |year=1990|pages=183-209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil quality reflects how well a soil performs the functions of maintaining [[biodiversity]] and productivity, partitioning water and solute flow, filtering and buffering, [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]], and providing support for plants and other structures. [[Soil management]] has a major impact on soil quality. 

Soil quality in agricultural terms is measured on a scale of [[soil value]] (''Bodenwertzahl'') in [[Germany]].

Soil quality is related to soil function. Unlike water or air, for which established standards have been set, soil quality is difficult to define or quantify. Soil quality can be evaluated using the Soil Management Assessment Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherubin|first=Maurício Roberto|last2=Tormena|first2=Cássio Antônio|last3=Karlen|first3=Douglas L.|last4=Cherubin|first4=Maurício Roberto|last5=Tormena|first5=Cássio Antônio|last6=Karlen|first6=Douglas L.|date=00/2017|title=Soil Quality Evaluation Using the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) in Brazilian Oxisols with Contrasting Texture|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0100-06832017000100503&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ciência do Solo|volume=41|doi=10.1590/18069657rbcs20160148|issn=0100-0683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4386">A '''sustainable community energy system''' is an integrated approach to supplying a local community with its energy requirements from [[renewable energy]] or high-efficiency [[co-generation]] energy sources. The approach can be seen as a development of the [[distributed generation]] concept.

Such systems are based on a combination of [[district heating]], [[district cooling]], plus '[[electricity generation island]]s' that are interlinked via a private wire electricity system (largely bypassing the normal [[power grid]] to cut transmission losses and charges, as well as increasing the robustness of the system). The surplus from one generating island can therefore be used to make up the deficit at another.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] the first sustainable community energy system was pioneered by [[Woking]] [[Borough]] [[Municipality|Council]], starting in 1991. The system uses traditional and a [[Phosphoric-acid fuel cell|phosphoric acid fuel cell]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060911140743/http://www.woking.gov.uk/html/queensaward/W-19.pdf] co-generation plants, [[thermal store|thermal storage]], heat fired [[absorption cooling]] and [[photovoltaics]] (over 9% of the UK's small capacity), to supply both residential and non-residential customers, as well as the Council's own facilities. By end of 2005 there were over 60 generating islands in the Borough.

Despite the investment in the plant, the system delivers cheaper energy than can be supplied from the traditional 'brown energy' suppliers, helping to tackle [[fuel poverty]]. It is part of a plan to cut local [[carbon dioxide]] emissions by 80% by 2050. Their initiatives won the Council the [[Queen's Award for Enterprise]] in 2002 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070102051259/http://www.woking.gov.uk/news/archive?item=988025744].

The [[London Climate Change Agency]] is starting to construct a similar system in [[London]].

==Germany==
In 1997, people of [[Wildpoldsried]], in some cases acting as individuals, began a series of projects that produce renewable energy. The first efforts were [[wind turbine]]s and [[biomass]] digesters for [[cogeneration]] of heat and power.  In the time since, new work has included a number of [[energy conservation]] projects, more wind and biomass use, [[small hydro]] plants, [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic panels]] on private houses, and [[district heating]].  Tied to this are ecological [[flood control]] and [[wastewater]] systems.

Today, the effects of this are an unforeseen level of prosperity resulting in construction of nine new community buildings, including a school, gymnasium, and community hall, complete with solar panels.  There are three companies operating four biogas digesters with a fifth under construction.  There are seven windmills with two more on the way. One hundred and ninety private households are equipped with solar, which pays them dividends.  The district heating network has 42 connections.  There are three small hydro power plants. Wildpoldsried now produces 321 percent more energy than it needs and is generating 4.0 million Euro in annual revenue.  At the same time, there has been a 65% reduction in the town’s carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=German Village Achieves Energy Independence … And Then Some  |publisher=BioCycle |date=August 2011 |volume= 52, No. 8, p. 37 |url=http://www.biocycle.net/2011/08/german-village-achieves-energy-independence-and-then-some/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2223">'''The Group''' was an informal but highly influential [[Not-for-profit arts organization|art association]] formed in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]] in 1927. Initially begun by ex-students from [[Ilam School of Fine Arts|Canterbury College of Art]], its aim was to provide a freer, more experimental alternative to the academic salon painting exhibitions of the [[Canterbury Society of Arts]]. The Group exhibited annually for 50 years, from 1927 to 1977, and was continuously at the forefront of New Zealand art's [[avant-garde]] scene.

Many of the country's best-known artists were associated at some time with The Group, among them [[Colin McCahon]], [[Doris Lusk]], [[Toss Woollaston]], [[Rita Angus]], [[Olivia Spencer Bower]], [[Leo Bensemann]], [[Rata Lovell-Smith]], [[Philip Trusttum]], and [[Douglas MacDiarmid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 15.  – Canterbury region – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/canterbury-region/page-15|website = www.teara.govt.nz|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en|first = New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last = Taonga}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of The Group extended into other areas of New Zealand culture through the collaborations and friendship of members with the likes of writer and editor [[Charles Brasch]] and composer [[Douglas Lilburn]].&lt;ref name="Bensemann"&gt;http://www.nzportraitgallery.org.nz/whats-on/leo-bensemann-friends-portraiture-and-the-group&lt;/ref&gt; Its influence was such that it is occasionally referred to as "[[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] South".&lt;ref name="Bensemann"/&gt;

[[File:Piero della Francesca 042 Flagellation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.00|[[Piero della Francesca]], ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]''.]]
This article about '''the development of themes in Italian Renaissance painting''' is an extension to the article [[Italian Renaissance painting]], for which it provides additional pictures with commentary. The works encompassed are from [[Giotto]] in the early 14th century to [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgement]]'' of the 1530s.

The themes that preoccupied painters of the Italian Renaissance were those of both subject matter and execution- what was painted and the style in which it was painted. The artist had far more freedom of both subject and style than did a [[Medieval]] painter. Certain characteristic elements of [[Renaissance]] painting evolved a great deal during the period. These include perspective, both in terms of how it was achieved and the effect to which it was applied, and realism, particularly in the depiction of humanity, either as symbolic, portrait or narrative element.

==Themes==
The ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|Flagellation of Christ]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]] (above) demonstrates in a single small work many of the themes of Italian Renaissance painting, both in terms of compositional elements and subject matter. Immediately apparent is Piero's mastery of perspective and light. The architectural elements, including the tiled floor which becomes more complex around the central action, combine to create two spaces. The inner space is lit by an unseen light source to which Jesus looks. Its exact location can be pinpointed mathematically by an analysis of the diffusion and the angle of the shadows on the coffered ceiling. The three figures who are standing outside are lit from a different angle, from both daylight and light reflected from the pavement and buildings.

The religious theme is tied to the present. The ruler is a portrait of the visiting Emperor of [[Constantinople|Byzantium]].&lt;ref&gt;John VIII Palaeologus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flagellation]] is also called "scourging". The term "scourge" was applied to the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Outside stand three men representing those who buried the body of Christ. The two older, [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathaea]], are believed to be portraits of men who recently lost their sons, one of them to plague. The third man is the young disciple [[St. John the Evangelist|John]], and is perhaps a portrait of one of the sons, or else represents both of them in a single idealised figure, coinciding with the manner in which Piero painted angels.

==Elements of Renaissance painting==
Renaissance painting differed from the painting of the Late Medieval period in its emphasis upon the close observation of nature, particularly with regards to human anatomy, and the application of scientific principles to the use of perspective and light.
&lt;!---NOTE RE FORMAT: These galleries are carefully arranged in a 4 per row format. This has been done in order to facilitate comaparisons between adjacent paintings, both horizontally and vertically. In other words, they are laid out with the same care as the curator empoys in a realworld gallery exhibition. Please do not return them to the "single row" format, as it is counterproductive to this particular article.---&gt;

===Linear perspective===
The pictures in the gallery below show the development of linear perspective in buildings and cityscapes. 
* In [[Giotto]]'s fresco, the building is like a stage set with one side open to the viewer.
* In [[Paolo Uccello]]'s fresco, the townscape gives an impression of depth.
* [[Masaccio]]'s ''[[holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' was painted with carefully calculated mathematical proportions, in which he was probably assisted by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]].
* [[Fra Angelico]] uses the simple motif of a small [[loggia]] accurately drafted to create an intimate space.
* [[Gentile Bellini]] has painted a vast space, the [[Piazza San Marco]] in [[Venice]], in which the receding figures add to the sense of perspective.
* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] did detailed and measured drawings of the background Classical ruins preparatory to commencing the unfinished ''Adoration of the Magi''.
* [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] created an exceptionally complex and expansive setting on three levels, including a steeply descending ramp and a jutting wall. Elements of the landscape, such as the church on the right, are viewed partly through other structures.
* [[Raphael]]'s design for ''Fire in the Borgo'' shows buildings around a small square in which the background events are highlighted by the perspective.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Landscape===
The depiction of landscape was encouraged by the development of linear perspective and the inclusion of detailed landscapes in the background of many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s of the 15th century. Also through this influence came an awareness of [[atmospheric perspective]] and the observation of the way distant things are affected by light. 
* Giotto uses a few rocks to give the impression of a mountain setting.
* Paolo Uccello has created a detailed and surreal setting as a stage for many small scenes.
* In [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''Deposition of the Body of Christ'', the desolate rocky landscape echoes the tragedy of the scene.
* [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s landscape has a sculptural, three-dimensional quality that is suggestive of a real physical space. The details of the rocks, their strata and fractures, suggest that he studied the [[geology|geological]] formations of the red [[limestone]] prevalent in areas of Northern Italy.
* [[Antonello da Messina]] sets the grim scene of the ''[[Crucifixion (Antonello da Messina)|Crucifixion]]'' in contrast to the placid countryside which rolls into the far distance, becoming paler and bluer as it recedes.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]] has created a detailed landscape with a pastoral scene between the foreground and background mountains. There are numerous levels in this landscape, making it the equivalent of Ghirlandaio's complex cityscape (above).
* [[Perugino]] has set the ''Adoration of the Magi'' against the familiar hilly landscape of [[Umbria]].
* Leonardo da Vinci, displays a theatrical use of [[atmospheric perspective]] in his view of the precipitous mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] at the foothills of the [[Alps]] in Northern Italy.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Light===
Light and shade exist in a painting in two forms. Tone is simply the lightness and darkness of areas of a picture, graded from white to black. Tonal arrangement is a very significant feature of some paintings. [[Chiaroscuro]] is the modelling of apparent surfaces within a picture by the suggestion of light and shadow. While tone was an important feature of paintings of the Medieval period, chiaroscuro was not. It became increasingly important to painters of the 15th century, transforming the depiction of three-dimensional space.
* [[Taddeo Gaddi]]'s ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' is the first known large painting of a night scene. The internal light source of the picture is the angel.
* In [[Fra Angelico]]'s painting, daylight, which appears to come from the actual window of the friary cell which this fresco adorns, gently illuminates the figures and defines the architecture.
* In his [[Histories of the True Cross|''Emperor's Dream'']], [[Piero della Francesca]] takes up the theme of the night scene illuminated by an angel and applies his scientific knowledge of the diffusion of light. The tonal pattern thus created is a significant element in the composition of the painting.
* In his ''[[Agony in the Garden (Bellini)|Agony in the Garden]]'', [[Giovanni Bellini]] uses the fading sunset on a cloudy evening to create an atmosphere of tension and impending tragedy.
* In [[Domenico Veneziano]]'s formal portrait, the use of chiaroscuro to model the form is slight. However, the painting relies strongly on the tonal contrasts of the pale face, mid-tone background and dark garment with patterned bodice for effect.
* [[Botticelli]] uses chiaroscuro to model the face of the sitter and define the details of his simple garment. The light and shadow on the edge of the window define the angle of the light.
* The suggested authorship of this early-16th-century portrait {{Clarify |reason=Unclear which painting; refer to by name|date=October 2018}} includes [[Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio]], [[Mariotto Albertinelli]] and [[Giuliano Bugiardini]]. The painting combines many of the lighting effects of the other works in this gallery. The form is modelled by the light and shade, as if by a setting sun, which gives an element of drama, enhanced by the landscape. The tonal pattern created by the dark garment, the white linen and position of the hand is a compositional feature of the painting.
* In [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|John the Baptist]]'', elements of the painting, including the corners of the model's eyes and mouth, are disguised by shadow, creating an air of ambiguity and mystery.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Anatomy===
While remaining largely dependent upon topographic observation, the knowledge of anatomy was advanced by Leonardo da Vinci's meticulous dissection of 30 corpses. Leonardo, among others, impressed upon students the necessity of the close observation of life and made the drawing of live models an essential part of a student's formal study of the art of painting. 
* [[Cimabue]]'s ''[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Crucifixion]]'', extensively destroyed by flood in 1966, shows the formal arrangement, with curving body and drooping head that was prevalent in late Medieval art. The anatomy is strongly stylised to conform with traditional iconic formula.
* [[Giotto]] abandoned the traditional formula and painted from observation.
* [[Massacio]]'s figure of Christ is foreshortened as if viewed from below, and shows the upper torso strained as if with the effort of breathing.
* In [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''Deposition'' the artist, while not attempting to suggest the brutal realities of the crucifixion, has attempted to give the impression of death.
* In [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''Baptism'', the robust figure of Jesus is painted with a simplicity and lack of sharply defined muscularity that belies its naturalism.
* The figure of Jesus in this painting, which is the combined work of [[Verrocchio]] and the young Leonardo, has in all probability been drafted by Verrocchio. The contours retain the somewhat contorted linearity of Gothic art. Much of the torso, however, is thought to have been painted by Leonardo and reveals a strong knowledge of anatomical form.
* Leonardo's picture of St. Jerome shows the results of detailed study of the shoulder girdle, known from a page of drawings.
* [[Michelangelo]] used human anatomy to great expressive effect. He was renowned for his ability in the creation of expressive poses and was imitated by many other painters and sculptors.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Realism===
The observation of nature meant that set forms and symbolic gestures which in Medieval art, and particularly the Byzantine style prevalent in much of Italy, were used to convey meaning, were replaced by the representation of human emotion as displayed by a range of individuals. 
*In this ''Resurrection'', [[Giotto]] shows the sleeping soldiers with faces hidden by helmets or foreshortened to emphasise the relaxed posture.
*In contrast, [[Andrea Castagno]] has painted a life-sized image of the condotierre, Pippo Spano, alert and with his feet over the edge of the painted niche which frames him.
*[[Filippo Lippi]] in this early work shows a very naturalistic group of children crowding around the Virgin Mary, but looking with innocent curiosity at the viewer. One of the children has [[Down syndrome]].
* [[Masaccio]] depicts the grief resulting from loss of innocence as [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from the presence of God.
* [[Antonello da Messina]] painted several versions of ''[[Ecce Homo (Antonello da Messina)|Ecce Homo]]'', the tormented Christ as he was presented to the people by the Roman Governor. Such paintings usually show Christ in a tragic but heroic role, minimising the depiction of suffering. Antonello's depictions are starkly realistic.
* In his ''[[Dead Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation over the Dead christ]]'', [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] has here depicted the dead body of Jesus with daring foreshortening, as if the viewer were standing at the end of the slab.
* In this detail from a larger painting, Mantegna shows a little child, wearing a tummy-binder and holey slippers, turning away and chewing its fingers while the infant Christ is circumcised.
* [[Giorgione]] paints a natural and unglamorised portrait of an old woman, unusual in its depiction of her illkempt hair and open mouth with crooked teeth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Figure composition===
Among the preoccupations of artists commissioned to do large works with multiple figures were how to make the subject, usually narrative, easily read by the viewer, natural in appearance and well composed within the picture space. 
* [[Giotto]] combines three separate narrative elements into this dramatic scene set against the dehumanising helmets of the guards. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] betrays [[Jesus]] to the soldiers by kissing him. The High Priest signals to a guard to seize him. Peter slices the ear off the high priest's servant as he steps forward to lay hands on Jesus. Five figures dominate the foreground, surrounding Jesus so that only his head is visible. Yet by skillful arrangement of color and the gestures of the men, Giotto makes the face of Jesus the focal point of the painting.
* In ''The Death of Adam'', [[Piero della Francesca]] has set the dying patriarch so that he is cast into relief against the black garment worn by one of his family. His importance to the story is further emphasised by the arch of figures formed around him and the diagonals of the arms which all lead to his head. p
* ''The Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus'' is a remarkably cohesive whole, considering that it was begun by [[Masaccio]], left unfinished, vandalised, and eventually completed by [[Filippino Lippi]]. Masaccio painted the central section.
* [[Pollaiuolo]], in this highly systemised painting, has taken the [[cross-bow]] used by the archers in the foreground, as the compositional structure. Within this large triangular shape, divided vertically, he has alternated the figures between front and back views.
* [[Botticelli]]'s long, narrow painting of ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Mars and Venus]]'' is based on a W with the figures mirroring each other. The lovers, who shortly before were united, are now separated by sleep. The three small fawns who process across the painting hold the composition together.
* [[Michelangelo]]s mastery of complex figure composition, as in his ''[[Deposition (Michelangelo)|The Entombment]]'' was to inspire many artists for centuries. In this panel painting the figure of Christ, though vertical, is slumped and a dead weight at the centre of the picture, while those who try to carry the body lean outwards to support it.
* At first glance, [[Signorelli]]'s ''Fall of the Damned'' is an appalling and violent jumble of bodies, but by the skilful placement of the figures so that the lines, rather than intersecting, flow in an undulating course through the picture, the composition is both unified and resolved into a large number of separate actions. The colours of the devils also serve to divide the picture into the tormentors and the tormented.
* ''The Battle of Ostia'' was executed by [[Raphael]]'s assistants, probably to his design. The foreground of the painting is organised into two overlapping arched shapes, the larger showing captives being subdued, while to the left and slightly behind, they are forced to kneel before the Pope. While the Pope rises above the second group and dominates it, the first group is dominated by a soldier whose colour and splendid headdress acts like a visual stepping stone to the Pope. At the edges of this group two stooping figures mirror each other, creating a tension in which one pushes away from the edge of the painting and the other pulls upward at its centre.

==Major works==

===Altarpieces===
Through the Renaissance period, the large [[altarpiece]] had a unique status as a commission.  An altarpiece was destined to become a focal point, not only visually in the religious building it occupied, but also in the devotions of the worshippers. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''Madonna of the Rocks'', now in the [[National Gallery, London]] but previously in a chapel in [[Milan]], is one of many images that was used in the petitioning of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] against plague. The significance of these images to those who commissioned them, who worshipped in their location, and who created them is lost when they are viewed in an art gallery.

* The two ''Enthroned Madonnas'' by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] demonstrate the variations on a theme that was formalised and constrained by tradition. Although the positions of the Madonna and Child are very similar, the artists have treated most of the features differently. Cimabue's throne is front-on and uses perspective to suggest its solidity. The angels, their faces, wings and haloes, are arranged to form a rich pattern. The gold leaf detailing of the Madonna's garment picks out the folds in a delicate network. The Child sits regally, with his feet set at the same angle as his mother's.
* In Duccio's ''[[Rucellai Madonna]]'', the largest of its kind at 4.5 metres high, the throne is set diagonally and the Child, much more of a baby despite his gesture, sits diagonally opposed to his mother. While the positioning of the kneeling angels is quite simplistic, they have a naturalism in their repeated postures and are varied by the beautiful colour combinations of their robes. On the Madonna's robe the gold border makes a meandering line, defining the form and contours, and enlivening the whole composition with a single decorative detail.
* [[Giotto]]'s ''[[Ognissanti Madonna]]'' is now housed in the same room of the [[Uffizi]] as Cimabue's and Duccio's, where the advances that he made in both drawing from the observation of nature, and in his use of perspective can be easily compared with the earlier masters. While the painting conforms to the model of an altarpiece, the figures within it do not follow the traditional formula. The Madonna and Child are solidly three-dimensional. This quality is enhanced by the canopied throne which contributes the main decorative element, while gold borders are minimised. The angels, which mirror each other, each have quite individual drapery.
* A hundred years later, [[Masaccio]], still within the constraints of the formal altarpiece, confidently creates a three-dimensional figure draped in heavy robes, her chubby Christ Child sucking on his fingers. The lutes played by the little angels are both steeply foreshortened.
* In [[Fra Angelico]]'s painting the figures lack the emphasis on mass of Masaccio's. Angelico was renowned for his delicacy in depicting the Madonna. The appeal of such paintings is demonstrated in the way the adoring angels are clustered around. As in Masaccio's painting, the Madonna's halo is decorated with [[pseudo-kufic]] script, probably to suggest her [[Middle Eastern]] origin.
* In the hands of [[Piero della Francesca]] the formal gold frame is transformed into a classical niche, drawn in perfect linear perspective and defined by daylight. The assorted saints cluster round in a natural way, while the Madonna sits on a realistic throne on a small podium covered by an [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|oriental carpet]], while the donor [[Federico da Montefeltro]] kneels at her feet. A concession to tradition is that the Madonna is of a larger scale than the other figures.
* In [[Giovanni Bellini|Bellini]]'s painting, while on one hand, the figures and the setting give the effect of great realism, Bellini's interest in Byzantine icons is displayed in the hierarchical enthronement and demeanour of the Madonna.
* The [[Milan]]ese painter [[Bergognone]] has drawn on aspects of the work of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and Bellini to create this painting in which the red robe and golden hair of Catherine of Alexandria are effectively balanced by the contrasting black and white of Catherine of Siena, and framed by a rustic arch of broken bricks.
* In [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Madonna della Vittoria]]'', the Madonna may occupy the central position, framed in her garlanded gazebo, but the focus of attention is [[Francesco II Gonzaga]] whose achievements are acknowledged not only by the Madonna and Christ Child but by the heroic saints, Michael and George.
* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] abandoned any sort of formal canopy and surrounded the Madonna and Child with the grandeur of nature into which he set the figures in a carefully balanced yet seemingly informal trapezoid composition.
* The ''[[Sistine Madonna]]'' by [[Raphael]] uses the formula not of an altarpiece but the formal portrait, with a frame of green curtains through which a vision can be seen, witnessed by [[Pope Sixtus II]] for whom the work is named. The clouds around the Virgin are composed of cherubic faces, while the two iconic cherubs so beloved with the late 20th century fashion for angels, prop themselves on the sill. This work became the model for [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] and many other painters.
* [[Andrea del Sarto]], while using figures to a very natural and lifelike effect, abandons in the ''Madonna of the Harpies'' practical reality by setting the Madonna on a Classical plinth as if she were a statue. Every figure is in a state of instability, marked by the forward thrust of the Madonna's knee against which she balances a book. This painting is showing the trends that were to be developed in [[Mannerism|Mannerist painting]].

===Fresco cycles===
The largest, most time-consuming paid work that an artist could do was a scheme of [[fresco]]es for a church, private palace or commune building. Of these, the largest unified scheme in Italy which remains more-or-less intact is that created by a number of different artists at the end of the Medieval period at the [[Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi]]. It was followed by [[Giotto]]'s Proto-Renaissance scheme at Padua and many others ranging from [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]'s [[Magi Chapel]] for the [[Medici]] to [[Michelangelo]]'s supreme accomplishment for [[Pope Julius II]] at the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Sistine Chapel]]. 
* [[Giotto]] painted the large, free-standing [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] with the '' [[Life of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Life of Christ]]''. Breaking from medieval tradition, it set a standard of naturalism.
* The two large frescoes of ''Allegories of Good and Bad Government'' painted by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] for the Commune of Siena are completely secular and show detailed views of a townscape with citizens, emphasising the importance of civic order.
* By contrast, [[Andrea di Bonaiuto]], painting for the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s at the new church of [[Santa Maria Novella]], completed a huge fresco of ''the Triumph of the Church'', which shows the role of the church in the work of [[Salvation]], and in particular, the role of the Dominicans, who also appear symbolically as ''the Hounds of Heaven'', shepherding the people of God. The painting includes a view of [[Florence Cathedral]].
* [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]] collaborated on the [[Brancacci Chapel]] fresco cycle which is most famous for Masaccio's lifelike innovations, Masolino's more elegant style is seen in this townscape which skillfully combines two episodes of ''the Life of St. Peter''.
* [[Piero della Francesca]]'s fresco cycle in the church of [[San Francesco, Arezzo]], closely follows the Legend of the True Cross as written by [[Jacopo da Varagine]] in the '' [[Golden Legend]]''. The pictures reveal his studies of light and perspective, and the figures have an almost monolithic solidity.
* [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]'s [[Magi Chapel|fresco cycle for the private chapel]] of the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Medici Palace]] is a late work in the [[International Gothic]] style, a fanciful and richly ornamental depiction of the Medici with their entourage as the [[Three Wise Men]].
* The elaborate cycle for the [[House of Este]]'s [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] at Ferrara, executed in part by [[Francesco del Cossa]], was also fanciful in its depictions of Classical deities and Zodial signs which are combined with scenes of the life of the family.
* [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s paintings for the Gonzaga also show family life but have a preponderance of highly realistic elements and skillfully utilise the real architecture of the room they decorate, the mantelpiece forming a plinth for the figures and the real ceiling pendentives being apparently supported on painted pilasters.
* While in the Brancacci Chapel, historians seek to identify the faces of Masaccio, Masolino and perhaps Donatello among the apostles, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] at the [[Sassetti Chapel]] makes no attempt to disguise his models. Each fresco in this religious cycle has two sets of figures: those who tell the story and those who are witness to it. In this scene of ''the Birth of the Virgin Mary'', a number of the noble women of Florence have come in, as if to congratulate the new mother.
* ''[[The Punishment of the Sons of Korah]]'' by [[Botticelli]] is one of episodes the ''Life of Moses'' series, which, together with ''The Life of Christ'', was commissioned in the 1480s as decoration to the [[Sistine Chapel]]. The artists [[Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]] all worked on the carefully designed and harmonious scheme.
* [[Michelangelo]]'s painting of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which he executed alone over a period of five years, with narratives from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], prophetic figures and the Ancestors of Christ, was destined to become one of the most famous artworks in the world.
* Simultaneously, [[Raphael]] and a number of his assistants painted the papal chambers known as ''[[Raphael Rooms]]''. In ''[[The School of Athens]]'' Raphael depicts famous people of his day, including Leonardo, Michelangelo, Bramante and himself, as philosophers of ancient Athens.

==Subjects==
Devotional images of the ''[[Madonna and Child]]'' were produced in very large numbers, often for private clients. Scenes of ''the Life of Christ'', the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'',  or ''Lives of the Saints'' were also made in large numbers for churches, particularly scenes associated with the ''[[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]]'' and ''the Passion of Christ''. ''The Last Supper'' was commonly depicted in religious refectories.

During the Renaissance an increasing number of patrons had their likeness committed to posterity in paint. For this reason there exists a great number of Renaissance portraits for whom the name of the sitter is unknown. Wealthy private patrons commissioned artworks as decoration for their homes, of increasingly secular subject matter.

===Devotional paintings===

====The Madonna====
These small intimate pictures, which are now nearly all in museums, were most often done for private ownership, but might occasionally grace a small altar in a chapel.

* ''The Madonna adoring the Christ Child with two Angels'' has always been particularly popular on account of the expressive little boy angel supporting the Christ Child. Paintings of [[Filippo Lippi]]'s such as this were to particularly influence [[Botticelli]].
* [[Verrocchio]] separates the Madonna and Christ Child from the viewer by a stone sill, also used in many portraits. The rose and the cherries represent spiritual love and sacrificial love.
* [[Antonello da Messina]]'s ''Madonna and Child'' is superficially very like that of Verrocchio, but it is much less formal and both the mother and the child appear to be moving rather than posing for the painter. The foreshortened elbow of the Child as he reaches for his mother's breast occurs in Raphael's work and can be seen in a different form in Michelangelo's ''Doni Tondo''.
* The figures placed at opposing diagonals seen in this early ''Madonna and Child'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was a compositional theme that was to recur in many of his works and be imitated by his pupils and by Raphael.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]] was influenced by [[Greek Orthodox]] [[icon]]s. The gold cloth in this painting takes the place of the gold leaf background. The arrangement is formal, yet the gestures, and in particular the mother's adoring gaze, give a human warmth to this picture.
* [[Vittore Carpaccio]]'s ''Madonna and Child'' is very unusual in showing the Christ Child as a toddler fully dressed in contemporary clothing. The meticulous detail and domesticity are suggestive of [[Early Netherlandish painting]].
* [[Michelangelo]]'s Doni Tondo is the largest of these works, but was a private commission. The highly unusual composition, the contorted form of the Madonna, the three heads all near the top of the painting and the radical foreshortening were all very challenging features, and Agnolo Doni was not sure that he wished to pay for it.
* [[Raphael]] has skillfully set opposing forces into play, and united the Madonna and Child with a loving gaze.

===Secular paintings===

====Portraits====
During the latter half of the 15th century, there was a proliferation of portraits. Although the subjects of some of them were later remembered for their achievements or their noble lineage, the identities of many have been lost and that of even the most famous portrait of all time, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', is open to speculation and controversy.

* The advantage of a profile portrait such as [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''[[Portrait of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]'' is that it identifies the subject like a facial signature. The proportions of the face, the respective angles of the forehead, nose and brow, the position and shape of the eye and the set of the jaw remain recognisable through life. Moreover, once a profile likeness has been taken, it can be used to cast a medal or sculpt an image in relief.
* [[Pollaiuolo]] has conformed to the formula, emphasising this young woman's profile with a fine line which also defines the delicate shape of her nostrils and the corners of her mouth. But he has added a three-dimensional quality by the subtle use of [[chiaroscuro]] and the treatment of the rich Florentine brocade of her sleeve.
* [[Alesso Baldovinetti]], on the other hand, has used the profile of this strong-featured girl to create a striking pattern of a highlighted contour against the darker background. The background is a lively shape adding to the compositional structure of the painting. The little black fillet on her forehead responds to the dynamic pattern of the embroidered sleeve.
* [[Botticelli]]'s portrait, although turned to three-quarter view with strong tonal modelling, has much to do with Baldovinetti's painting in its striking arrangement of shapes in the red garment, the hat and the dark hair and the pattern that they form against the background.
* [[Antonello da Messina]]'s portrait, some years earlier than Botticelli's, bears it a passing similarity. But this painting does not rely heavily on the skilful arrangement of clearly contoured shapes. Antonello has used the advantages of oil paint, as against Botticelli's [[tempera]], to achieve a subtle and detailed likeness in which the bushy eyebrows, the imperfections of the skin and the shadow of the beard have been rendered with photographic precision.
* [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]]'s tempera portrait of [[An Old Man and his Grandson|an old man with his grandson]] combines the meticulous depiction of the old man's enlarged nose and parchment-like skin with a tenderness usually reserved for portrayals of ''The Madonna and Child''. Ghirlandaio takes this analogy further by setting the scene against a window and landscape.
* [[Pintoricchio]]'s portrait of a boy sets him high in the picture frame, reducing his scale in proportion to the area in contrast to the usual way of showing adults. The painting is set against a landscape such as used by Leonardo and Bellini. Pinturicchio's main fame lay in his skillfully characterised portraits like this.
* In the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' Leonardo employed the technique of ''sfumato'', delicately graded chiaroscuro that models the surface contours, while allowing details to disappear in the shadows. The technique gives an air of mystery to this painting which has brought it lasting fame. The beautiful hands become almost a decorative element.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s portrait of the elected Duke of Venice has an official air and could hardly be more formal. Yet the face is characterised with what one might hope for in the Doge, wisdom, humour and decisiveness. Although a more elaborate painting, it has much in common with Baldovinetti's sense of design.
* The subject of [[Titian]]'s portrait is unknown, and its considerable fame rests solely on its beauty and unusual composition in which the face is supported and balanced by the large blue sleeve of quilted satin. The sleeve is almost the same colour as the background; its rich tonality gives it form. The white linen of the shirt enlivens the composition, while the man's eyes pick up the colour of the sleeve with penetrating luminosity.
* Superficially, [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s portrait has many of the same elements as Titian's. But it is handled very differently, being much broader in treatment, and less compelling in subject. The painting has achieved an imediacy, as if the sitter has paused for a moment and is about to return to what he is doing.
* [[Raphael]], in this much-copied portrait of [[Pope Julius II]], set a standard for the painting of future popes. Unlike the contemporary portraits here by Bellini, Titian and del Sarto, Raphael has abandoned the placement of the figure behind a shelf or barrier and has shown the Pope as if seated in his own apartment. Against the green cloth decorated with the keys of [[St. Peter]], the red velvet papal garments make a rich contrast, the white beard being offset by the pleated white linen. On the uprights of the chair, the acorn finials are the symbol of the Pope's family, the ''[[della Rovere]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====The nude====
These four famous paintings demonstrate the advent and acceptance of the nude as a subject for the artist in its own right. 
* In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'', the nude figure, although central to the painting, is not of itself the subject. The subject of the painting is a story from [[Classical mythology]]. The fact that the Goddess Venus rose naked from the sea provides justification for the nude study that dominates the centre of the work.
* Painted thirty years later, the exact meaning of [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s picture is unclear. Had the subject been painted by an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter, it would be quite unnecessary to ascribe a meaning. But in this Renaissance work, there is the presence of a mirror, an object that is usually symbolic and which suggests an allegory. The young lady's nakedness is a sign not so much of seduction, as innocence and vulnerability. However, she decks herself out in an extremely rich headdress, stitched with pearls, and having not one, but two mirrors, sees only herself reflected endlessly. The mirror, often a symbol of prophecy, here becomes an object of vanity, with the young woman in the role of [[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]].
* [[Giorgione]]'s painting possibly predates Bellini's by ten years. It has always been known as ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|The Sleeping Venus]]'' but there is nothing in the painting to confirm that it is, indeed, Venus. The painting is remarkable for its lack of symbolism and the emphasis on the body simply as an object of beauty. It is believed to have been completed by Titian.
* [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'', on the other hand, was painted for the pleasure of the Duke of Urbino, and as in Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'', painted for a member of the Medici family, the model looks directly at the viewer. The model may very well have been the mistress of the client. Venus of Urbino is not simply a body beautiful in its own right. She is an individual and highly seductive young woman, who is not in the nude state indicative of heavenly perfection, but is simply naked, having taken off her clothes but left on some of her jewellery.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Classical mythology====
Paintings of classical mythology were invariably done for the important salons in the houses of private patrons. Botticelli's most famous works are for the Medici, Raphael painted ''Galatea'' for Agostino Chigi and Bellini's ''[[Feast of the Gods (Bellini)|Feast of the Gods]]'' was, with several works by Titian, in the home of [[Alfonso I d'Este]]

* [[Pollaiuolo]]'s ''Hercules and the Hydra'' typifies many paintings of mythological subjects which lent themselves to interpretation that was both Humanist and Christian. In this work good overcomes evil, and courage is glorified. The figure of Hercules has resonances with the Biblical character of [[Samson]] who also was renowned for his strength and slew a lion.
* In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', Wisdom,&lt;!---don't delete this capital---&gt; personified by Athena, leads the cowering Centaur by the forelock, so learning and refinement are able to overcome brute instinct, which is the characteristic symbolised by the centaur.
* [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Galatea (Raphael)|Galatea]]'', though Classical in origin, has a specifically Christian resonance that would have been recognised by those who were familiar with the story. It is about the nature of love. While all around her aspire to earthly love and succumb to the arrows shot by the trio of cupids, Galatea has chosen spiritual love and turns her eyes to Heaven.
* Three large works remain that were painted for a single room for the Este by [[Filippo Bellini|Bellini]] and his successor [[Titian]]. Of these, Titian's ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' represents a moment in a narrative. The other two paintings are jolly drinking scenes with a number of narrative elements introduced in a minor way, in order that characters might be identifiable. This painting does not appear to have any higher allegorical sentiment attached to it. It appears to be simply a very naturalistic portrayal of a number of the ancient gods and their associates, eating, drinking and enjoying the party.

The [[chemical compound]] '''trichloroethylene''' is a [[halocarbon]] commonly used as an industrial [[solvent]]. It is a clear non-flammable liquid with a sweet smell. It should not be confused with the similar [[1,1,1-trichloroethane]], which is commonly known as ''chlorothene''.

The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] name is '''trichloroethene'''. Industrial abbreviations include '''TCE''', '''trichlor''', '''Trike''', '''Tricky''' and '''tri'''.  It has been sold under a variety of trade names. Under the trade names '''Trimar''' and '''Trilene''', trichloroethylene was used as a volatile [[anesthetic]] and as an inhaled obstetrical [[analgesic]] in millions of patients.

Groundwater and drinking water contamination from industrial discharge is a major concern for human health and has precipitated numerous incidents and lawsuits.

==History==
Pioneered by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] in Britain, its development was hailed as an anesthetic revolution. Originally thought to possess less [[hepatotoxicity]] than [[chloroform]], and without the unpleasant pungency and flammability of [[ether]], TCE use was nonetheless soon found to have several pitfalls. These included promotion of [[cardiac arrhythmias]], low volatility and high solubility preventing quick anesthetic induction, reactions with [[soda lime]] used in carbon dioxide absorbing systems, prolonged neurologic dysfunction when used with soda lime, and evidence of hepatotoxicity as had been found with chloroform.

The introduction of [[halothane]] in 1956 greatly diminished the use of TCE as a general anesthetic. TCE was still used as an inhalation analgesic in childbirth given by self-administration. Fetal toxicity and concerns for carcinogenic potential of TCE led to its abandonment in developed countries by the 1980s.

Due to concerns about its toxicity, the use of trichloroethylene in the food and pharmaceutical industries has been banned in much of the world since the 1970s. Legislation has forced the substitution of trichloroethylene in many processes in Europe as the chemical was classified as a carcinogen carrying an R45 [[List of R-phrases|risk phrase]], ''May cause cancer''. Many degreasing chemical alternatives are being promoted such as Ensolv and Leksol; however, each of these is based on [[n-Propyl bromide|''n''-propyl bromide]] which carries an R60 risk phrase of ''May impair fertility'', and they would not be a legally acceptable substitute.

[[Groundwater]] contamination by TCE has become an important environmental concern for [[#Human exposure|human exposure]].

In 2005 it was announced by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that the agency had completed its Final Health Assessment for Trichloroethylene and released a list of new TCE toxicity values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/IRIS/subst/0199.htm|title=Trichloroethylene (CASRN 79-01-6)|publisher=Epa.gov|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the study have formally characterized the chemical as a human carcinogen and a non-carcinogenic health hazard. A 2011 toxicological review performed by the EPA continues to list trichloroethylene as a known carcinogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=United States Environmental Protection Agency|journal=EPA|date=September 2011|volume=635|issue=R–09/011F|url=http://www.epa.gov/iris/toxreviews/0199tr/0199tr.pdf | title = Toxicological Review of Trichloroethylene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Prior to the early 1970s, most trichloroethylene was produced in a two-step process from [[acetylene]]. First, acetylene was treated with chlorine using a [[iron(III) chloride|ferric chloride]] [[catalyst]] at 90&amp;nbsp;°C to produce [[1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane]] according to the [[chemical equation]]

:[[acetylene|HC≡CH]] + 2 [[chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCHCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane is then dehydrochlorinated to give trichloroethylene. This can either be accomplished with an aqueous solution of [[calcium hydroxide]]

:2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCHCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[calcium hydroxide|Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 2 ClCH=CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[calcium chloride|CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

or in the vapor phase by heating it to 300-500&amp;nbsp;°C on a [[barium chloride]] or [[calcium chloride]] catalyst

:Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCHCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ClCH=CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]]

Today, however, most trichloroethylene is produced from [[ethylene]]. First, ethylene is chlorinated over a [[iron(III) chloride|ferric chloride]] catalyst to produce [[1,2-Dichloroethane|1,2-dichloroethane]].

:[[ethylene|CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[1,2-Dichloroethane|ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]]

When heated to around 400&amp;nbsp;°C with additional chlorine, 1,2-dichloroethane is converted to trichloroethylene

:[[1,2-Dichloroethane|ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]] + 2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ClCH=CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 HCl

This reaction can be catalyzed by a variety of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of [[potassium chloride]] and [[aluminium chloride|aluminum chloride]]. However, various forms of porous [[carbon]] can also be used. This reaction produces [[tetrachloroethylene]] as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are collected together and then separated by [[distillation]].

== Uses ==
Trichloroethylene is an effective [[solvent]] for a variety of [[organic chemistry|organic]] materials.

When it was first widely produced in the 1920s, trichloroethylene's major use was to extract [[vegetable oil]]s from plant materials such as [[soy]], [[coconut]], and [[palm tree|palm]]. Other uses in the food industry included [[coffee]] [[decaffeination]] and the preparation of flavoring extracts from [[hops]] and [[spice]]s. It has also been used for drying out the last bit of water for production of 100% ethanol.

From the 1930s through the 1970s, both in Europe and in North America, trichloroethylene was used as a volatile anesthetic almost invariably administered with nitrous oxide. Marketed in the UK by ICI under the trade name Trilene it was coloured blue (with a dye called waxoline blue) to avoid confusion with the similar smelling chloroform.  TCE replaced earlier anesthetics [[chloroform]] and [[diethyl ether|ether]] in the 1940s, but was itself replaced in the 1960s in developed countries with the introduction of [[halothane]], which allowed much faster induction and recovery times.  Trilene was also used as a potent inhaled analgesic, mainly during childbirth.  It was used with halothane in the Tri-service field anaesthetic apparatus used by the UK armed forces under field conditions. As of 2000, however, TCE was still in use as an anesthetic in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It has also been used as a [[dry cleaning]] solvent, although replaced in the 1950s by [[tetrachloroethylene]] (also known as perchloroethylene), except for spot cleaning where it was used until the year 2000.

Trichloroethylene was marketed as 'Ecco 1500 Anti-Static Film Cleaner and Conditioner' until 2009, for use in automatic movie film cleaning machines, and for manual cleaning with lint-free wipes.

Perhaps the greatest use of TCE has been as a degreaser for metal parts. The demand for TCE as a degreaser began to decline in the 1950s in favor of the less toxic [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|1,1,1-trichloroethane]].  However, 1,1,1-trichloroethane production has been phased out in most of the world under the terms of the [[Montreal Protocol]], and as a result trichloroethylene has experienced some resurgence in use as a degreaser.

TCE has also been used in the United States to clean kerosene-fueled rocket engines (TCE was not used to clean hydrogen-fueled engines such as the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]).  During static firing, the RP-1 fuel would leave hydrocarbon deposits and vapors in the engine.  These deposits had to be flushed from the engine to avoid the possibility of explosion during engine handling and future firing.  TCE was used to flush the engine's fuel system immediately before and after each test firing.  The flushing procedure involved pumping TCE through the engine's fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30–35 minutes, depending upon the engine.  For some engines, the engine's gas generator and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) dome were also flushed with TCE prior to test firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssfl.msfc.nasa.gov/public-involvement/docs/SSFL_TCE_Final_Fact_Sheet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Santa Susana Field Laboratory : The Use of Trichloroethylene at NASA's SSFL Sites |publisher=Ssfl.msfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=22 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114001621/http://ssfl.msfc.nasa.gov/public-involvement/docs/SSFL_TCE_Final_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ntrs.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?N=0&amp;Ntk=all&amp;Ntx=mode%20matchall&amp;Ntt=19750070175|title=F-1 Rocket Engine Operating Instructions|publisher=Ntrs.nasa.gov|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[F-1 rocket engine]] had its LOX dome, gas generator, and thrust chamber fuel jacket flushed with TCE during launch preparations.&lt;ref name="ntrs.nasa.gov"/&gt;

TCE is also used in the manufacture of a range of fluorocarbon refrigerants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nd.edu/~enviro/design/r134a.pdf |format=PDF |title=Production of R-134a |publisher=Nd.edu|accessdate=21 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711235310/http://www.nd.edu/~enviro/design/r134a.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane]] more commonly known as HFC 134a. TCE was also used in industrial refrigeration applications due to its high heat transfer capabilities and its low temperature specification. Many industrial refrigeration applications used TCE up to the 1990s in applications such as car testing facilities.

==Chemical instability==
Despite its widespread use as a metal degreaser, trichloroethylene itself is unstable in the presence of metal over prolonged exposure. As early as 1961 this phenomenon was recognized by the manufacturing industry, when stabilizing additives were added to the commercial formulation. Since the reactive instability is accentuated by higher temperatures, the search for stabilizing additives was conducted by heating trichloroethylene to its boiling point in a [[reflux condenser]] and observing decomposition. The first widely used stabilizing additive was [[dioxane]]; however, its use was patented by [[Dow Chemical Company]] and could not be used by other manufacturers. Considerable research took place in the 1960s to develop alternative stabilizers for trichloroethylene. Other chemical stabilizers include [[ketone]]s such as [[methyl ethyl ketone]].

==Physiological effects==
When inhaled, trichloroethylene produces [[central nervous system]] depression resulting in general [[anesthesia]]. These effects may be mediated by trichloroethylene acting as a [[positive allosteric modulator]] of inhibitory GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and glycine receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = M.

Higher concentrations result in [[tachypnea]].  Many types of cardiac [[arrhythmias]] can occur and are exacerbated by [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline).  It was noted in the 1940s that TCE reacted with carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) absorbing systems ([[soda lime]]) to produce dichloroacetylene and [[phosgene]].&lt;ref name=Orkin&gt;Orkin, F. K. (1986) Anesthesia Systems (Chapter 5). In R. D. Miller (Ed.), Anesthesia (second edition). New York, NY: Churchill Livingstone.{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cranial nerve]] dysfunction (especially the fifth cranial nerve) was common when TCE anesthesia was given using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbing systems.  These nerve deficits could last for months.  Occasionally facial numbness was permanent.  Muscle relaxation with TCE anesthesia sufficient for surgery was poor.  For these reasons as well as problems with [[hepatotoxicity]], TCE lost popularity in North America and Europe to more potent anesthestics such as [[halothane]] by the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;Stevens, W.C. and Kingston H. G. G. (1989) Inhalation Anesthesia (Chapter 11). In P. G. Barash et al. (Eds.) Clinical Anesthesia.  Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott.{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of acute non-medical exposure are similar to those of [[alcohol intoxication]], beginning with headache, dizziness, and confusion and progressing with increasing exposure to unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/hlthef/tri-ethy.html |title=Trichloroethylene &amp;#124; Technology Transfer Network Air Toxics Web site &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respiratory and circulatory depression can result in death.

Much of what is known about the human health effects of trichloroethylene is based on occupational exposures. Beyond the effects to the central nervous system, workplace exposure to trichloroethylene has been associated with toxic effects in the liver and kidney.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; Over time, occupational exposure limits on trichloroethylene have tightened, resulting in more stringent ventilation controls and personal protective equipment use by workers.

Research from Cancer bioassays performed by the [[National Cancer Institute]] (later the [[National Toxicology Program]]) showed that exposure to trichloroethylene is carcinogenic in animals, producing liver cancer in mice, and kidney cancer in rats.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/phs19.html |title=ATSDR - Redirect - Public Health Statement: Trichloroethylene |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Toxicology Program’s 11th Report on Carcinogens categorizes trichloroethylene as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen”, based on limited evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Trichloroethylene |chapterurl=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/profiles/Trichloroethylene.pdf |pages=420–3 |title=Report on Carcinogens |edition=12th |url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/roc12 |publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] |year=2011 |author=[[National Toxicology Program]] |isbn=978-1-4379-8736-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625114247/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/roc12 |archivedate=2011-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent review of the epidemiology of [[renal cell carcinoma|kidney cancer]] rated cigarette smoking and obesity as more important risk factors for kidney cancer than exposure to solvents such as trichloroethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.juro.2006.07.130 |title=The Epidemiology of Renal Cell Carcinoma |year=2006 |last1=Lipworth |first1=Loren |last2=Tarone |first2=Robert E. |last3=McLaughlin |first3=Joseph K. |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=176 |issue=6 |pages=2353–8 |pmid=17085101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the most recent overall assessment of human health risks associated with trichloroethylene states, "[t]here is concordance between animal and human studies, which supports the conclusion that trichloroethylene is a potential kidney carcinogen".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11707.html |title=Assessing the Human Health Risks of Trichloroethylene: Key Scientific Issues &amp;#124; The National Academies Press |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The evidence appears to be less certain at this time regarding the relationship between humans and liver cancer observed in mice, with the US [[National Academy of Science|NAS]] suggesting that low-level exposure might not represent a significant liver cancer risk in the general population.

The health risks of trichloroethylene have been studied extensively. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) sponsored a "state of the science" review of the health effects associated with exposure to trichloroethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.00108s2159 |title=Trichloroethylene Health Risks--State of the Science |year=2000 |last1=Scott |first1=Cheryl Siegel |last2=Cogliano |first2=V.

In Europe, the [[Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values]] (SCOEL) recommends for trichloroethylene an [[occupational exposure limit]]  (8 hour time-weighted average) of 10 ppm and a short-term exposure limit (15 min) of 30 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/social/keyDocuments.jsp?type=0&amp;policyArea=82&amp;subCategory=153&amp;country=0&amp;year=0&amp;advSearchKey=recommendation&amp;mode=advancedSubmit&amp;langId=en|title=SCOEL recommendations|date=2011-04-22|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human exposure ==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2010}}

Exposure to TCE occurs mainly through contaminated drinking water. With a specific gravity greater than 1, trichloroethylene can be present as a [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]] (DNAPL) if sufficient quantities are spilled in the environment. Another significant source of vapor exposure in [[Superfund]] sites that had contaminated groundwater, such as the [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant]], was by showering. TCE readily volatilizes out of hot water and into the air. Long, hot showers would then volatilize more TCE into the air. In a home closed tightly to conserve the cost of heating and cooling, these vapors would then recirculate.

The first known report of TCE in groundwater was given in 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE.&lt;ref&gt;Lyne FA, McLachlan T (1949).

In 1998, the [[View-Master factory supply well]] in [[Beaverton, Oregon]] was found to have been contaminated with high levels of TCE. It was estimated that 25,000 factory workers had been exposed to it from 1950–2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/pha/PHA.asp?docid=293&amp;pg=0 |title=ATSDR-PHA-HC-View-Master Factory Supply Well-p-toc |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2003-10-20 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[Lisle, Illinois]], releases of trichloroethylene (TCE) had allegedly occurred on the Lockformer property beginning in 1968 and continuing for an undetermined period. The company used TCE in the past as a degreaser to clean metal parts. Contamination at the Lockformer site is presently under investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Illinois EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.state.il.us/community-relations/fact-sheets/lisle-groundwater/lisle-groundwater1.html |title=Fact Sheet #1 - Lisle Groundwater Contamination Investigation |publisher=Epa.state.il.us |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Lockformer conducted soil sampling on their property and found TCE in the soil at levels as high as 680 parts per million (ppm). During the summer of 2000, a group of residents hired legal counsel, and on October 11, 2000, these residents had their private well water tested by a private environmental consultant. The group owned homes south of the Lockformer property in the suspected path of groundwater flow. The consultant collected a second round of well water samples on November 10, 2000, and TCE was detected in some of the wells sampled. Beginning in December 2000, Illinois EPA collected about 350 more private well water samples north and south of the Lockformer property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/pdf/LISLE%20RWs%20PHA%20FINAL%20Release.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050530143200/http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/pdf/LISLE%20RWs%20PHA%20FINAL%20Release.pdf|date=May 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over twenty years of operation, [[RCA Corporation]] had been pouring toxic wastewater into a well in its [[Taoyuan City]], [[Taiwan]] facility.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The pollution from the plant was not revealed until 1994, when former workers brought it to light. Investigation by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration confirmed that RCA had been dumping chlorinated organic solvents into a secret well and caused contamination to the soil and groundwater surrounding the plant site. High levels of TCE and [[tetrachloroethylene]] (PCE) can be found in groundwater drawn as far as two kilometers from the site. An organization of former RCA employees reports 1375 cancer cases, 216 cancer deaths, and 102 cases of various tumors among its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cphan.org/libr/poisonedworkers.pdf |format=PDF |title=Poisoned RCA Workers Demand Justice and Peace |publisher=Cphan.org |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K7iouBiOo3cC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=RCA%2BTaoyuan#PPA68,M1 |title=Outlooks: Readings for Environmental Literacy - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2015-02-21|isbn=9780763732806 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 film [[A Civil Action (film)|A Civil Action]] dramatizes the EPA lawsuit ''Anne Anderson, et al., v. Cryovac, Inc.'' concerning trichloroethylene contamination that occurred in [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] in the 1980s.

=== Existing regulation ===
Until recent years, the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) contended that trichloroethylene had little-to-no carcinogenic potential, and was probably a [[co-carcinogen]]—that is, it acted in concert with other substances to promote the formation of tumors.

State, federal, and international agencies classify trichloroethylene as a known or probable carcinogen. In 2014, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] updated its classification of trichloroethylene to Group 1, indicating that sufficient evidence exists that it causes cancer of the kidney in humans as well as some evidence of cancer of the liver and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol106/mono106-001.pdf |title=Trichloroethylene (IARC Summary &amp; Evaluation, Volume 106, 2014) |publisher=iarc.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; California EPA regulators consider it a known carcinogen and issued a risk assessment in 1999 that concluded that it was far more toxic than previous scientific studies had shown.

In the [[European Union]], the [[Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values]] (SCOEL) recommends an exposure limit for workers exposed to trichloroethylene of 10&amp;nbsp;ppm (54.7&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for 8-hour [[Permissible exposure limit|TWA]] and of 30&amp;nbsp;ppm (164.1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for [[Permissible exposure limit|STEL]] (15 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=6405&amp;langId=en |format= PDF |title= Recommendation from the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits for Trichloroethylene (SCOEL/SUM/142) |date= April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing EU legislation aimed at protection of workers against risks to their health (including Chemical Agents Directive 98/24/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1998:131:0011:0023:EN:PDF |format=PDF |title=Council Directive 98/24/EC |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carcinogens Directive 2004/37/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:229:0023:0034:EN:PDF |format=PDF |title=Directive 2004/37/EC |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) currently do not impose binding minimum requirements for controlling risks to workers health during the use phase or throughout the life cycle of trichloroethylene. However, in case the ongoing discussions under the Carcinogens Directive will result in setting of a binding Occupational Exposure Limit for trichloroethylene for protection of workers; this conclusion may be revisited.

The Solvents Emissions Directive 1999/13/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1999L0013:19990329:EN:PDF|title=LexUriServ.do|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:334:0017:0119:en:PDF |format=PDF |title=Directive 2010/75/EU |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; impose binding minimum requirements for emissions of trichloroethylene to the environment for certain activities, including surface cleaning. However, the activities with solvent consumption below a specified threshold are not covered by these minimum requirements.

According to European regulation, the use of trichloroethylene is prohibited for individuals at a concentration greater than 0.1%. In industry, trichloroethylene should be substituted before April 21, 2016 (unless an exemption is requested before October 21, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013R0348&amp;qid=1396362971420&amp;from=EN|title=L_2013108EN.01000101.xml|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by other products such as [[tetrachloroethylene]] ([[perchloroethylene]]), [[methylene chloride]] ([[dichloromethane]]), or other hydrocarbon derivatives ([[ketone]]s, [[alcohol]]s, ...)

=== Proposed U.S. federal regulation ===
In 2001, a draft report of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) laid the groundwork for tough new standards to limit public exposure to trichloroethylene. The assessment set off a fight between the EPA and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], and [[NASA]], who appealed directly to the White House. They argued that the EPA had produced junk science, its assumptions were badly flawed, and that evidence exonerating the chemical was ignored.

The DoD has about 1,400 military properties nationwide that are contaminated with trichloroethylene. Many of these sites are detailed and updated by www.cpeo.org and include a former ammunition plant in the Twin Cities area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cpeo.org/milit.html |title=Military |publisher=CPEO |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty three sites in the Energy Department's nuclear weapons complex — including [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in the San Francisco Bay area, and NASA centers, including the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[La Cañada Flintridge]] are reported to have TCE contamination.

Political appointees in the EPA sided with the Pentagon and agreed to pull back the risk assessment. In 2004, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] was given a $680,000 contract to study the matter, releasing its report in the summer of 2006. The report has raised more concerns about the health effects of TCE.

In response to the heightened awareness of environmental toxins such as TCE and the role they may be playing in childhood disease, in 2007, Senator Barack Obama proposed S1068, co-sponsored by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d110:19:./temp/~bdMMKn:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;] {{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation aimed to inform and protect communities that are threatened with environmental contamination. Senator Clinton's own bill, S1911, is known as the TCE Reduction Act.

=== Reduced production and remediation ===
In recent times, there has been a substantial reduction in the production output of trichloroethylene; alternatives for use in metal degreasing abound, chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons being phased out in a large majority of industries due to the potential for irreversible health effects and the legal liability that ensues as a result.

The U.S. military has virtually eliminated its use of the chemical, purchasing only 11 gallons in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Recent research has focused on the in-place remediation of trichloroethylene in soil and ground water instead of removal for off-site treatment and disposal. Naturally-occurring bacteria have been identified with the ability to degrade TCE. ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' sp. degrade trichloroethylene by reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' can co-metabolize TCE. Soil and ground water contamination by TCE has also been successfully remediated by chemical treatment and extraction. The bacteria ''[[Nitrosomonas europaea]]'' can degrade a variety of halogenated compounds including trichloroethylene.&lt;ref name="genome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.jgi-psf.org/finished_microbes/niteu/niteu.home.html |title=Home - Nitrosomonas europaea |publisher=Genome.jgi-psf.org |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toluene dioxygenase]] has been reported to be involved in TCE degradation by ''[[Pseudomonas putida]]''.&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oLNtgk_VKXsC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Bioremediation+of+gypsum#v=onepage&amp;q=Bioremediation%20of%20gypsum&amp;f=false|title=Bioremediation Technologies: Principles and Practice|author1=Robert L.

It is often combined with a related motif, in which nature is portrayed as a goddess with multiple breasts who represents Isis, [[Artemis]], or a combination of both.

The motif was based on a statue of Isis, or of the goddess [[Neith]] who was sometimes equated with her, in the [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] city of [[Sais]] mentioned by the Greco-Roman authors [[Plutarch]] and [[Proclus]]. They claimed the statue bore an inscription saying "I am all that has been and is and shall be; and no mortal has ever lifted my mantle." Illustrations of Isis with her veil being lifted were popular from the late 17th to the early 19th century, often as allegorical representations of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] science and philosophy uncovering nature's secrets. Authors at the end of the 18th century, foreshadowing the [[Romantic movement]], began using the lifting of Isis's veil as a metaphor for revealing awe-inspiring truth. [[Helena Blavatsky]], in ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' in 1877, used the metaphor for the spiritual truths that her [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] belief system hoped to discover, and modern [[ceremonial magic]] includes a ritual called the '''Rending of the Veil''' to bring the magician to a higher state of spiritual awareness.

==The statue and inscription at Sais==
The first mention of the veil of Isis appears in ''On Isis and Osiris'', a philosophical interpretation of [[ancient Egyptian religion]] by [[Plutarch]], a Greek writer in the late first and early second centuries CE. He wrote of a seated statue of a goddess in the Egyptian city of [[Sais]] that bore the inscription "I am all that has been and is and shall be; and no mortal has ever lifted my garment."&lt;ref name="Griffiths 131"&gt;Griffiths 1970, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch called the garment a ''[[peplos]]''; the word is translated in English as "mantle" or "veil".&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch identified the goddess as "Athena, whom [the Egyptians] consider to be Isis."&lt;ref name="Griffiths 131"/&gt; Sais was the cult center of the goddess [[Neith]], whom the Greeks [[interpretatio graeca|compared]] to their goddess [[Athena]] and was thus the goddess that Plutarch spoke of. In Plutarch's time [[Isis]] was the preeminent goddess in Egyptian religion and was frequently [[ancient Egyptian deities#Manifestations and combinations|syncretized]] with Neith, which is why Plutarch equated the two.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 1970, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; More than 300 years after Plutarch, the [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Proclus]] wrote of the same statue in Book I of his ''Commentaries on Plato's "Timaeus"''. In this version, the garment is a ''[[chiton (costume)|chiton]]'', "no mortal" is replaced by "no one", and a third statement is added: "The fruit of my womb was the sun".&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"/&gt;

Proclus said the statue was in the ''[[adyton]]'' of a [[Egyptian temple|temple]] at Sais, but the inner areas of Egyptian temples were not accessible to anyone but priests, and it is unlikely that a statue of a deity would have been permanently veiled; priests saw the [[cult image]] of the god every day when performing temple rites. However, a statue in a temple's courtyards or halls could have borne an inscription similar to the one Plutarch and Proclus related.&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"/&gt; The first part of the inscription—"I am all that has been and is and shall be"—means the goddess encompasses everything. This claim was commonly made of [[creator god]]s such as [[Ra]] or [[Amun]] in Egyptian religion; if the same was said about Isis, it reflected her increased status in Greco-Roman times, in which she was often said to be the creator of the world. The second part—"no one has ever lifted my mantle"—implies that the goddess was [[virgin]]al, a claim that was occasionally made of Isis in Greco-Roman times but conflicted with the long-standing belief that she and her husband [[Osiris]] conceived their son [[Horus]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 1970, pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; Proclus's version suggests that the goddess conceived and gave birth to the sun without the participation of a male deity, which would reflect Egyptian myths about Neith as the mother of the sun god Ra. Another possible explanation, suggested by the Egyptologist [[Jan Assmann]], is that the latter part of the Egyptian inscription said "There is nobody except me", proclaiming that the all-encompassing goddess was unique, and was mistranslated into Greek as "there is nobody who opened [or: uncovered] my face."&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"/&gt;

==Isis and Artemis as nature==
[[File:Anatome Animalium frontispiece.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Science unveiling Nature in the frontispiece to ''Anatome Animalum'', 1681]]
Several other sources influenced the motif of the veiled Isis. One was a tradition that linked Isis with [[nature]] and the goddess [[Artemis]]. [[European art]] has a long tradition of personifying nature as a [[Mother Nature|motherly figure]]. Starting in the 16th century, this motif was influenced by the iconography of the goddess [[Temple of Artemis#Ephesian Artemis|Artemis of Ephesus]] (also known under the name of her [[Roman gods|Roman]] equivalent, [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]). The Ephesian Artemis was depicted with round protuberances on her chest that may originally have been jewelry but came to be interpreted as breasts. Isis was sometimes compared with Artemis, and the Roman writer [[Macrobius]], in the fourth century CE, wrote, "Isis is the earth or nature that is under the sun. That is why the goddess's entire body bristles with a multitude of breasts placed close to one another [as in the case of Artemis of Ephesus], because all things are nourished by earth or by nature." Thus, the 16th-century artists represented nature as Isis-Artemis with multiple breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 233–238&lt;/ref&gt;

A second influence was a tradition that nature is mysterious. It goes back to an aphorism by the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]] in the late sixth or early fifth century BCE, which is traditionally translated as "Nature loves to hide." [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' in the 1590s personified nature as a woman with a veil, though without a direct connection to Isis,&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; although Isis appears elsewhere in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin 2012, pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; Several illustrators in the 17th century used the anonymous woman with a veil in the same way. In the 1650s, [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' explicitly explained Isis's veil as an emblem of the secrets of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 237, 240–242&lt;/ref&gt;

The frontispiece to [[Gerhard Blasius]]'s 1681 book ''Anatome Animalum'', engraved by [[Jan Luyken]], was the first depiction of a many-breasted Isis-Artemis figure with her veil being removed. It shows a personification of science removing the veil, as an allegory for the way science uncovers nature's secrets. This metaphor was reused in the frontispieces of many of [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]'s works, and then in illustrations to other scientific works throughout the 18th century. In some cases the veiled figure is a statue, reminiscent of the original statue of Artemis at Ephesus, while in others it is a living woman. The motif was sometimes elaborated with other metaphors, so that, for example, in the frontispiece to ''The Philosophy of Nature'' by [[Jean-Baptiste-Claude Delisle de Sales]], Nature unveils herself to a philosopher as he overthrows Despotism and Superstition. The unveiling of the Isis-figure thus expressed the hope, prevalent during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], that philosophy and science would triumph over unreason to uncover nature's deepest truths. This motif continued beyond the Enlightenment into the 19th century. An example is [[Louis-Ernest Barrias]]'s 1899 sculpture ''[[Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science]]'', in which the multiple breasts are omitted and the Isis-figure wears a [[scarab (artifact)|scarab]] on her gown that hints at her Egyptian background.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 1, 237–243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isis as a mystery==
[[File:Frontispiece to The Temple of Nature.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The unveiling of a statue of Isis as a personification of nature, depicted as the climactic moment of an Isiac initiation, in an 1803 engraving by [[Henry Fuseli]]&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another interpretation of Isis's veil emerged in the late 18th century, in keeping with the [[Romantic movement]] that was developing at the time, in which nature constitutes an awe-inspiring mystery rather than prosaic knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 318–319&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation was influenced by the ancient [[mysteries of Isis|mystery initiations dedicated to Isis]] that were performed in the Greco-Roman world.&lt;ref name="Assmann 126"&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 126–134&lt;/ref&gt; Although these rites were developed in [[Hellenistic]] or Roman times, under the influence of earlier [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greco-Roman mystery rites]],&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer 2014, pp. 110–114&lt;/ref&gt; both classical authors and 18th-century scholars assumed them to have been age-old features of ancient Egyptian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson 2004, pp. 241–245&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Freemasons]], members of a European [[fraternal organization]] that attained its modern form in the early 18th century, adopted Egyptian motifs and came to believe their rituals could be traced back to the mysteries of Isis.&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson 2004, pp. 245–248&lt;/ref&gt; One Freemason in the 1780s, [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]], tried to reconcile [[Masonic ritual and symbolism#Symbols in ritual|Freemasonry's traditional origin story]], which traces Freemasonry back to ancient Israel, with its enthusiasm for Egyptian themes. To do so, he interpreted the first statement on the statue at Sais, "I am all that has been and is and shall be," as a declaration of [[pantheism]], in which nature and divinity are identical. Reinhold claimed the public face of Egyptian religion was [[polytheistic]], but the Egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal the deeper, pantheistic truth to elite initiates. He also said the statement "[[I am that I am]]", spoken by the [[God in Judaism|Jewish God]] in the [[Book of Exodus]], meant the same as the Saite inscription and indicated that [[Judaism]] was a descendant of the ancient Egyptian belief system.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 115–125&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of Reinhold's interpretation, other Freemasons came to see the veiled Isis as a symbol of an impenetrable enigma, representing [[truth]] and [[being]] as well as nature,&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2004, pp. 267–269&lt;/ref&gt; a deity that, as Assmann puts it, was regarded as "too all-encompassing to have a name."&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 1997, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] connected the motif of Isis's veil with his concept of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], saying, "Perhaps no one has said anything more sublime, or expressed a thought more sublimely, than in that inscription on the temple of Isis (Mother Nature)." According to Kant, the sublime evoked both wonder and terror, and these emotions appeared frequently in the works of late 18th and early 19th-century authors using the motif of the veil. The ecstatic nature of ancient mystery rites themselves contributed to the focus on emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2004, pp. 269–283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Schiller]], for instance, wrote an essay on Egyptian and Jewish religion that mostly copied Reinhold's work but put a new emphasis on the emotional buildup that surrounded the mysteries. He said it prepared the initiate to confront the awe-inspiring power of nature at the climax of the rite. Similarly, a frontispiece by [[Henry Fuseli]], made for [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s poem ''The Temple of Nature'' in 1803, explicitly shows the unveiling of a statue of Isis as the climax of the initiation.&lt;ref name="Assmann 126"/&gt;

[[Helena Blavatsky]]'s 1877 book ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', one of the foundational texts for the [[Western esoteric tradition|esoteric]] belief system of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], used the metaphor of the veil as its title. Isis is not prominent in the book, but in it Blavatsky said that philosophers try to lift the veil of Isis, or nature, but see only her physical forms. She added, "The soul within escapes their view; and the Divine Mother has no answer for them," implying that theosophy will reveal truths about nature that science and philosophy cannot.&lt;ref&gt;Ziolkowski 2008, pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parting of the Veil==
The "Parting of the Veil", "Piercing of the Veil", "Rending of the Veil" or "Lifting of the Veil" refers, in the [[Western mystery tradition]] and [[contemporary witchcraft]], to opening the "veil" of matter, thus gaining entry to a state of spiritual awareness in which the mysteries of nature are revealed. In [[ceremonial magic]], the Sign of the Rending of the Veil is a symbolic gesture performed by the magician with the intention of creating such an opening. It is performed starting with the arms extended forwards and hands flat against each other (either palm to palm or back to back), then spreading the hands apart with a rending motion until the arms point out to both sides and the body is in a T shape. After the working is complete, the magician will typically perform the corresponding Sign of the Closing of the Veil, which has the same movements in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Greer 1997, pp. 51–53, 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?''''' &lt;ref&gt;William G. Dever, Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, MI, US/Cambridge, UK, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; is a book by biblical scholar and archaeologist [[William G. Dever]] detailing his response to the claims of [[biblical minimalism|minimalists]] to the historicity and value of the [[Hebrew Bible]].

== Summary ==

Dever's book is a response to recent trends in biblical scholarship and [[biblical archaeology]] which question whether the bible can be used as a reliable tool for interpreting history.

The book begins with Dever's explanation of the "minimalist" position, which holds that the bible is a product of the [[Yehud Medinata|Persian]] or even [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic periods]], composed at the very earliest after c. 500 BC, and therefore unreliable as a record of earlier periods. The minimalists do not deny that the biblical books are based on genuinely old material, but they view the task of extracting that material from layers of revision and accretion is virtually unachievable. At the other extreme are the "maximalists" who take the bible at, or almost entirely at, face value. In his first two chapters Dever reviews and rejects both minimalism and maximalism. Dever nevertheless evidently regards the minimalist position as more dangerous than the maximalist, because it tends to eliminate altogether any study of [[First Temple (Judaism)|ancient Israel prior to the Persian period]].

Dever then turns to Syrio-Palestinian archaeology, as the former discipline of [[biblical archaeology]] is now known, and reviews material discoveries to demonstrate that they can in fact be linked to the biblical narrative. The central chapters therefore offer a detailed discussion of the major archaeological discoveries of the twentieth century and relate them to the [[Deuteronomistic History]] (Joshua-2 Kings), "correlat[ing] text and artifact to demonstrate that significant material in the narrative plausibly derives from [[Iron Age]] II (ca. 1000-600 BCE) and not from later periods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[Review |author=John Barclay Brown |journal=[[Biblical Theology Bulletin]]|date=May 2002 |volume=32 |pages=107–108 |doi=10.1177/014610790203200210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dever makes clear that he positions himself in the middle ground between minimalists such as [[Thomas L. Thompson]] (with whom Dever has had a long running and acrimonious public dispute) on the one hand, and maximalists on the other. "While the Hebrew Bible in its present, heavily edited form cannot be taken at face value as history in the modern sense, it nevertheless ''contains'' much history." For Dever, this historical core is concentrated in the period from [[David]] onwards; the [[Torah]] and the period of the [[conquest of Canaan]] he regards as essentially mythical. The final chapter sums up the argument of the book, stating that there was an [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|ancient Israel]], that the bible was written from a genuine historical core, and that archaeology can identify this core and prevent Israel from being "written out of history".&lt;ref name="Dever2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=William G. Dever|title=What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?: What Archeology Can Tell Us About the Reality of Ancient Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-VxwC5rQtwC&amp;pg=PA298|date=10 May 2001|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2126-3|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and reviews ==

The book received mixed reviews. Conservative scholars commended Dever for his critique on minimalism but were disappointed by his failure to defend the historicity of the bible prior to the age of [[David]] and [[Solomon]]. Others chided his inability to distance himself from his obsessions: 
{{quote|"[Dever's] agendas are that (a) a coordinated team of 'minimalists'/'revisionist' biblical historians are conspiring to deny the existence of ancient Israel (and even of historical 'facts' at all!); (b) Dever has been, and remains, the guardian of truth in matters archaeological; and (c) archaeology can confirm the reliability of Biblical history. The first two of these issues obscure the central thesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0882-8539| volume = 21| issue = 1| pages = 158–160| last = Davies| first = Philip R.| title = What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?

{{quote|"If Dever’s attempts to link narrative biblical history and archaeology represent mainstream thinking (as he claims), then the field is indeed in deep trouble. It is the kind of blind acceptance of traditional (unsubstantiated) 'synchronisms' espoused by Dever that has provided the very fuel for the minimalists’ criticisms. In short, Dever may prove to be his own worst enemy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centuries.co.uk/dever-review.pdf Review by Peter James, ''Palestine Exploration Quarterly'', 134, 2 (2002)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Women in the workforce''' earning wages or  salary are part of a modern phenomenon, one that developed at the same time as the growth of paid employment for men, but women have been challenged by [[Gender inequality|inequality]] in the workforce. Until modern times, legal and cultural practices, combined with the inertia of longstanding religious and educational conventions, restricted women's entry and participation in the [[workforce]]. Economic dependency upon men, and consequently the poor [[socio-economic status]] of women, have had the same impact, particularly as occupations have become [[professionalization|professionalized]] over the 19th and 20th centuries.

Women's lack of access to [[higher education]] had effectively excluded them from the practice of well-paid and high status occupations. Entry of women into the higher professions like [[law]] and [[medicine]] was delayed in most countries due to women being denied entry to universities and qualification for degrees; for example, [[Cambridge University]] only fully validated degrees for women late in 1947, and even then only after much opposition and acrimonious debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107063131/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html|date=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were largely limited to low-paid and poor status occupations for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, or earned less pay than men for doing the same work. However, through the 20th century, public perceptions of paid work shifted {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} as the workforce increasingly moved to office jobs that do not require heavy labor, and women increasingly acquired the higher education that led to better-compensated, longer-term [[career]]s rather than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs.

The increasing rates of women contributing in the work force has led to a more equal disbursement of [[working hours|hours worked]] across the regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2007$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=rOXvRa2ZC2oXqBn7gz62IMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=rdCufG2vozTpKw7TBGbyoWw;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=7.8;dataMax=86$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=26;dataMax=56$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=|title=Graph|publisher=[[Gapminder World]] |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in western European countries the nature of women's employment participation remains markedly different from that of men.

Although access to paying occupations (the "workforce") has been and remains unequal in many occupations and places around the world, scholars sometimes distinguish between "work" and "paying work", including in their analysis a broader spectrum of labor such as uncompensated [[household work]], childcare, [[eldercare]], and family [[subsistence farming]].

==Areas of study==
{{Women in society sidebar}}
As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] raged in the U.S., [[Virginia Penny]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] was finishing up her research project and publish the ground-breaking book, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/how-women-can-make-money-married-or-single-in-all-branches-of-the-arts-and-sciences-professions-trades-agricultural-and-mechanical-pursuits/oclc/15690614 ''How women can make money married or single, in all branches of the arts and sciences, professions, trades, agricultural and mechanical pursuits'' (Philadelphia, 1862)]. Hoping to offer hard facts about what women in the workforce would encounter, Penny had interviewed thousands of employers, using both a survey via the postal mail and in person – when she would also interview workers. Much of her site visits were conducted in Philadelphia, New York and Boston. She distilled her research to list over 500 jobs that were open to women as well as the information about the jobs and potential availability for women. She also indicated when employers offered their reasons for wage differentials based on gender. She dedicated her book "to worthy and industrious women in the United States, striving to earn a livelihood," and the book garnered much attention by reviewers and scholars across the country. She sold her rights to the book to another publisher who put it out instead as an encyclopedia, ''The Employments of Women: A Cyclopaedia of Woman's Work'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xR0EAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Employments of Women: A Cyclopaedia of Woman's Work'']&lt;/ref&gt; in 1863.

In the twentieth century, [[division of labor]] by [[gender]] has been studied most systematically in [[women's studies]] (especially [[women's history]], which has frequently examined the history and biography of women's participation in particular fields) and [[gender studies]] more broadly. Occupational studies, such as the [[history of medicine]] or studies of [[professionalization]], also examine questions of gender, and the roles of women in the history of particular fields. Women dominate as accountants, auditors, and psychologists.&lt;ref name="Witz-1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anne Witz | title = Patriarchy and Professions: The Gendered Politics of Occupational Closure | journal = Sociology | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | date = 1990 | pages = 675–690 | url = http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/24/4/675 | doi = 10.1177/0038038590024004007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavanagh-2003"&gt;{{cite web|author=S.

In addition, modern [[civil right]]s law has frequently examined gender restrictions of access to a field of occupation; [[gender discrimination]] within a field; and gender harassment in particular workplaces. This body of law is called [[employment discrimination|employment discrimination law]], and gender and race discrimination are the largest sub-sections within the area. Laws specifically aimed at preventing discrimination against women have been passed in many countries; see, e.g., the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] in the United States.

==Paid employment globally==
[[File:Changes in percentages of professionals by gender.png|thumbnail|This chart depicts the change in the percentage of women in three professional occupations (dentist, physician, lawyer), from 1970 to 2007.]]
Women still contribute to their communities in many regions mainly through agricultural work. In Southern Asia, Western Asia, and Africa, only 20% of women work at paid non-agricultural jobs. Worldwide, women's rate of paid employment outside of agriculture grew to 41% by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main forms of paid employment for women worldwide is actually a traditional one, that of the market "hawker". Women have worked outside the home as vendors at markets since ancient times in many parts of the world, such as Central America, South Asia, and Africa.

During the 20th century, the most significant global shift in women's paid employment came from the spread of global travel and the development of a large migrant workforce of women [[domestic workers]] seeking jobs outside of their native country. The [[Philippines]] is a major source of female domestic workers. Before the 1990s, the majority of Filipinos working outside the Philippines were male, but by 2012, an estimated 63% of Filipinos working overseas were female.&lt;ref name="Tubeza"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tubeza|first=Philip C.|title=Overseas deployment of Filipino domestic workers continues to rise|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|publisher=Inquirer Global Nation|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/32067/overseas-deployment-of-filipino-domestic-workers-continues-to-rise|date=April 7, 2012|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of Filipino women working overseas are in the millions. Over 138,000 new domestic workers gained permission to work overseas in 2012, a number that grew 12% from the previous year.&lt;ref name="Tubeza"/&gt; Overseas employment often results in the women leaving their own children behind in the Philippines to be cared for by relatives. Domestic employees from the Philippines and other countries have also been subject to exploitation and sex and money extreme abuse, for example in several countries in the Middle East, where they are often employed. It is estimated that [[remittances]] from overseas workers (both male and female) bring $1 billion (USD) per month to the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An atlas of migration|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=0-520-26151-8|pages=78–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workforce participation by sector===
[[File:Computer industry entrepreneur workshop.jpg|thumb|Attendees at a computer business networking event for potential entrepreneurs, United State.]]
[[File:Woodstock press photographer.jpg|thumb|A woman press photographer covers a music fest, Poland, 2008.]]

Women and men often participate in economic sectors in sharply different proportions, a result of gender clustering in occupations. Reasons for this may include a traditional association of certain types of work with a particular gender. There is a wide range of other possible economic, social and cultural variables that impact the gender distribution in different occupations, including within a region or country. An averaging of statistics gathered by the United Nations for 2004 through 2007 reflects these differences (totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding):

'''Sectoral distribution of employed persons, by sector and sex (2004 through 2007)'''&lt;ref name="The World's Women 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Women 2010|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/Worldswomen/WW_full%20report_color.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=May 15, 2012|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|'''Region'''||'''Agriculture'''||'''Industry'''||'''Services'''
|-
|Africa||43% women / 42% men||11% women / 20% men||46% women / 39% men 
|-
|Asia (excluding China)||32% women / 26% men||12% women / 25% men||56% women / 49% men 
|-
|Latin America and the Caribbean||7% women / 22% men||13% women / 27% men||80% women / 51% men 
|-
|Europe and other more developed regions||6% women / 8% men||15% women / 36% men||79% women / 55% men 
|}

More detailed statistics show large differences even within these regions. For example, 11% of employed women in East Asia are employed in agriculture, a number that rises to 55% in South Asia; 70% of women in Southern Africa are employed in the service sector, while in Eastern, Middle, and Western Africa this number is 26%.&lt;ref name="The World's Women 2010"/&gt;

===Occupational dissimilarity index===
Choice of occupation is considered to be one of the key factors contributing to the male-female wage differential. In other words, careers with a majority of female employees tend to pay less than careers that employ a majority of males. This is different from direct wage discrimination within occupations, as males in the female dominated professions will also make lower than average wages and the women in the male dominated occupations usually make higher than average wages. The occupational [[index of dissimilarity|dissimilarity index]] is a measure from 0 to 100; it measures the percent of laborers that would need to be rearranged into a job typically done by the opposite sex in order for the wage differential to disappear. In 1960, the dissimilarity index for the United States was measured at 62. It has dropped since then, but at 47 in 2000, is still one of the highest of any developed nation.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hong Li J | year = | title = Gender Differences in Class Mobility: A Comparative Study of the United States, Sweden, and West Germany | url = | journal = Acta Sociologica | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 315–333 | doi=10.1177/000169939804100402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations formed by women for rights==
In the nineteenth century women became involved in organizations dedicated to social reform.&lt;ref&gt;Visions of America A History of the United States, books a La Carte Edition. Pearson College Div, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 The National Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) is established to advocate for improved wages and working conditions for women. In 1920 The Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor was formed to create equal rights and a safe workplace for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/womenstimeline2.html#ixzz3Vlm8PLZb Women's Rights Movement in the U.S.: Timeline of Events (1921-1979).]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 a group called Financial Women's Association (FWA), was formed. It is an organization established by a group of Wall Street women. The goal was: to advance professionalism in finance and in the financial services industry with special emphasis on the role and development of women, to attain greater recognition for women's achievements in business, and to encourage women to seek career opportunities in finance and business.&lt;ref name=DiversityBestPractices&gt;[http://www.diversitybestpractices.com/news-articles/20-womens-organizations-you-need-know "20 Women's Organizations You Need to Know"], Diversity Best Practices, February 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded by a group of feminists including Betty Friedan. The largest women's rights group in the U.S., NOW seeks to end sexual discrimination, especially in the workplace, by means of legislative lobbying, litigation, and public demonstrations. NOW has 500,000 contributing members and 550 chapters in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Nancy. "The American Women's Movement, 1945-2000: A Brief History with Documents." Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1972, the National Association of Female Executives (NAFE) provides education, networking and public advocacy to empower its members to achieve career success and financial security. Members are women executives, business owners, entrepreneurs and others who are committed to NAFE's mission: the advancement of women in the workplace.&lt;ref name=DiversityBestPractices /&gt; Many of these organizations led to legal action and protecting women's rights as workers and empowered women in the workplace.

==Laws protecting women's rights as workers==

International laws protecting women's rights as workers exist through the efforts of various international bodies.  On June 16, 2011, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) passed C189 [[Convention on Domestic Workers|Domestic Workers Convention, 2011]], binding signatories to regulations intended to end abuses of migrant domestic workers. It was anticipated that the Convention would put pressure on non-ratifying countries to support changes to their own laws to meet the change in international standards protecting domestic workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Switzerland – A step forward for domestic workers|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/world/europe/17briefs-Switzerland.html?gwh=9875484B408842FDAE59E701E668F0EF|date=June 16, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, Hong Kong's High Court struck down a law preventing domestic workers from having residency rights granted to other foreign workers, a move that affected an estimated 100,000 domestic workers in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeParle|first=Jason|title=Domestic workers convention may be landmark|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/world/domestic-workers-convention-may-be-landmark.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=world|date=October 9, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ILO has previously ratified the [[Equal Remuneration Convention]] in 1951, which came into force in 1953, the [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention]], which went into force in 1960 and the [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000]], which went into force in 2002. In 1966, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], which went into force in 1976. [[UNESCO]] also adopted the [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] in 1960, which came into force in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=178–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]], adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, went into force in 2003. The [[Home Work Convention]], adopted by the ILO, went into force in 2000;the Convention protects the rights of persons doing paid work out of their home, which is frequently women workers. It offers equal protection regarding working conditions, safety, remuneration, social security protection, access to training, minimum age of employment, and maternity protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human trafficking]] often targets young women who are abducted and sent outside their own country to work as domestic workers, often in conditions of extreme exploitation. A number of international laws have been ratified to address human trafficking of women and children.

Maternity protection measures are put in place to insure that women will not be discriminated against in the workplace once they return from having a child. They should also not be exposed to any health hazards while they are pregnant and at work. They are allowed time off for maternity leave as well, which allows them to bond with their child; this aspect of development is crucial for infants to gain proper attachment skills. Employers are expected to hold to these policies. Yet many women on maternity leave receive very small amounts of time off to allow for their health along with their babies' health. The amount of time allowed for maternity leave as well as the pay for maternity leave varies by country, with Sweden having the longest amount off with 68 weeks and the United States being one of the worst, with the typical period being 12 weeks without pay.&lt;ref&gt;Burn, S.

==Women in workforce leadership==
[[File:Deli womens entre network.jpg|thumb|An information technology networking social for potential entrepreneurs. New Delhi, India]]

Female decision-makers from around Europe are organized in several national and European wide networks. The networks aim to promote women in decision-making positions in politics and the economy across Europe. These networks were founded in the 1980s and are often very different from the "service clubs" founded in the early days of the century, like Soroptimist and Zontas.

"Women in Management" is about women in business in usually male-dominated areas. Their motivation, their ideas and leadership styles and their ability to enter into leadership positions is the subject of most of the different networks.

As of 2009, women represented 20.9% of parliament in Europe (both houses) and 18.4% world average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm|publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union|title=Women in National Parliaments|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, 90 women serve in the U.S. Congress: 18 women serve in the Senate, and 73 women serve in the House Women hold about three percent of executive positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm |publisher=Center for American Women and Politics|title=Facts on Women Officeholders, Candidates and Voters|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the private sector, men still represent 9 out of 10 board members in European blue-chip companies, The discrepancy is widest at the very top: only 3% of these companies have a woman presiding over the highest decision-making body.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

List of members of the [[European Network of Women in Decision-making in Politics and the Economy]]:

*Committee of Women Elected Representatives of Local and Regional Authorities (Council of European Municipalities and Regions)
*BPW Europe, Business and Professional Women – Europe
*[[Association of Organisations of Mediterranean Businesswomen]]
*[[Eurochambres]] Women's Network
*[[European Platform of Women Scientists]]
*Network of Parliamentary Committees for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union
*[[European Network to Promote Women's Entrepreneurship]]
*[[European Women's Lobby]]
*[[European Women's Lawyers Association]]

*[[European Women's Management Development International Network]], EWMD
*[[Femanet – Eurocadres]]
*[[European Professional Women's Network]], EPWN
*[[Women's Forum for the Economy and the Society]]

The European Union Commission has created a platform for all these networks. It also funded the [[Women to the Top]] program in 2003–2005 to bring more women into top management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/nyheter/artikel_1043415.svd|title=Gemensamt krafttag för ett mer jämställt Europa|last=Danielsson|first=Anna|date=2005-01-25|work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations have been created to promote the presence of women in top responsibilities, in politics and business. One example is EWMD European Women's Management Development (cited above), a European and international network of individual and corporate members, drawn from professional organisations. Members are from all areas of business, education, politics and culture.

Women who are born into the upper class rather than the middle or lower class have a much better chance at holding higher positions of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in the work force if they choose to enter it.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} According to a study published 2015, of the women who held C-suite jobs in the U.S., 94% played [[competitive sports]], 52% at a university level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ey.com/gl/en/newsroom/news-releases/news-sport-is-a-critical-lever-in-advancing-women-at-all-levels-according-to-new-ey-espnw-report|title=Sport is a critical lever in advancing women at all levels, according to new EY/espnW report|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers to equal participation==
As [[gender role]]s have followed the formation of agricultural and then industrial societies, newly developed [[profession]]s and fields of occupation have been frequently inflected by gender. Some of the ways in which gender affects a field include:

*Prohibitions or restrictions on members of a particular gender entering a field or studying a field
*[[Discrimination]] within a field, including wage, management, and prestige hierarchies
*Expectation that mothers, rather than fathers, should be the primary childcare providers

Note that these gender restrictions may not be universal in time and place, and that they operate to restrict both men and women. However, in practice, norms and laws have historically restricted women's access to particular occupations;civil rights laws and cases have thus primarily focused on equal access to and participation by ''women'' in the workforce. These barriers may also be manifested in hidden bias and by means of many [[microinequities]].

Many women face issues with sexual abuse while working in agriculture fields as well. Many of the women who work in these fields are undocumented and so supervisors or other male workers may take advantage of that. These women may suffer sexual abuse in order to keep their jobs and they cannot report the incident to the police because the fact that they are documented will be brought up and may be deported.

===Access to education and training===
[[File:Maasai women at USAID literacy event (6595762621).jpg|thumb|[[Maasai people|Maasai]] women at [[USAID]] literacy event]]
A number of occupations became "[[professionalization|professionalized]]" through the 19th and 20th centuries, gaining regulatory bodies, and passing laws or regulations requiring particular [[higher education]]al requirements. As women's access to higher education was often limited, this effectively restricted women's participation in these professionalizing occupations. For instance, women were completely forbidden access to [[Cambridge University]] until 1868, and were encumbered with a variety of restrictions until 1987 when the university adopted an equal opportunity policy.&lt;ref&gt;University of Cambridge, [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html "Fact Sheet: Women at Cambridge"].&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other institutions in the United States and Western Europe began opening their doors to women over the same period of time, but access to higher education remains a significant barrier to women's full participation in the workforce in developing countries. Even where access to higher education is formally available, women's access to the full range of occupational choices is significantly limited where access to primary education is limited through social custom.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-2007"&gt;[[UNICEF]], ''[http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/ State of the World's Children (2007)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to capital===
[[File:Women's business conference bahia brazil.jpg|thumb|Governor of Bahia, Brazil, attending the first state women's business conference]]
Women's access to occupations requiring capital outlays is also hindered by their unequal access (statistically) to capital;this affects occupations such as entrepreneur and small business owner, farm ownership, and investor.&lt;ref&gt;"DEVELOPMENT: Gender Equality Equals Growth", ''World News'', June 2, 2004, available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20040208105312/http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/may00/23_11_078.html archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous [[microloan]] programs attempt to redress this imbalance, targeting women for loans or grants to establish start-up businesses or farms, having determined that aid targeted to women can disproportionately benefit a nation's economy.&lt;ref name="Northoff-2004"&gt;United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) statistics. See Erwin Northoff, "FOOD: Women Farmers are Invisible Actors in Hunger Drama", ''World News'', 2004 February 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  While research has shown that women cultivate more than half the world's food — in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, women are responsible for up to 80% of food production — most such work is family subsistence labor, and often the family property is legally owned by the men in the family.&lt;ref name="Northoff-2004" /&gt;

===Discrimination within occupations===
[[File:SHG women running a cabinet manufacturing business (5103677355).jpg|thumb|Women operating a cabinet manufacturing business, India]]
{{See also|Gender pay gap|Glass ceiling|Sexual harassment}}
The idea that men and women are naturally suited for different occupations is known as horizontal segregation.&lt;ref name="Massey"&gt;Massey, D. S. Categorically Unequal. New York: Russel Sage Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistical discrimination (economics)|Statistical discrimination]] in the workplace is unintentional discrimination based on the presumed probability that a worker will or will not remain with the company for a long period of time. Specific to women, since employers believe that women are more likely to drop out of the labor force to have kids, or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for upward mobility to begin with based on these same stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, E.F. Opting out and opting in: understanding the complexities of women's career transitions. Career Development International. 12, 218 – 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continue to earn less money than men, despite establishing equal pay laws.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[UNICEF]], ''[http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/ State of the World's Children (2007)]'', p.&amp;nbsp;41 (Figure 3.3 "Estimated earnings for women are substantially lower than for men");p.&amp;nbsp;36 (chapter 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the textbook ''Race, Class, and Gender: An Anthology'', women are at a higher risk of financial disadvantage in modern-day society than men. Statistical findings suggest that  women are under paid for similar jobs men complete despite having the same qualifications. The statistical data collected by the U.S. Department of Labor suggests that women are discriminated against in the workforce based on gender. The textbook reads, “Women’s wages are also more volatile than men’s wages, and women face a much higher risk of seeing large drops in income than do men” (Kennedy 2008). Anderson clearly demonstrates a significant difference between men and women in the workforce in regards to pay. Women are left more exposed to financial devastation and unemployment. The textbook also mentions that women are often give public positions versus private or leadership positions despite having appropriate work experience, higher education, or necessary skills to qualify. According to the Joint Economic Committee, “Among women heading families, the unemployment rate has grown and is higher than the national unemployment rate and twice as high as that for either married men or married women” (Joint Economic Committee, 2009). In other words, unmarried women who are the head of household are more vulnerable to financial disadvantage than married men or women. The unemployment rate of women compared to men suggests that single women are discriminated against based on gender. Anderson writes, “All women are disproportionately at risk in the current foreclosure crisis, since women are 32% more likely than men to have subprime mortgages (One-third of women, compared to one-fourth of men, have subprime mortgages; and, the disparity between women and men increases in higher income brackets)” (Anderson 265). The statistical information illustrates the dramatic difference between men and women in regards to finances. It can be inferred that men are favored in the workforce over women. Women are discriminated against based on their gender and thus are more likely to struggle financially because of discriminatory employers.

===Actions and inactions of women themselves===
Through a process known as "employee clustering", employees tend to be grouped throughout the workplace both spatially and socially with those of a similar status job. Women are no exception and tend to be grouped with other women making comparable amounts of money. They compare wages with the women around them and believe their salaries are fair because they are average. Some women are content with their lack of wage equality with men in the same positions because they are unaware of just how vast the inequality is.

Furthermore, women as a whole tend to be less assertive and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the simple fact that men tend to ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so.&lt;ref name="women's media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmedia.com|title=Index of /|publisher=Womensmedia.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, and men, are socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings that we see in adults in the workplace. Boys are more likely to be pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.&lt;ref&gt;Spade, Joan Z.

An additional issue that contributes to income inequality by gender is that women are much more likely than men to take "breaks" in their careers to have children, often remaining out of the workforce for extended periods of time, while men in the same role or occupation (or other women who do not leave the workforce) most likely are continuing to earn promotions and/or merit-based salary increases. When a woman in this scenario re-enters the workforce, she may be offered a smaller salary or a lower position than she might have merited had she remained in the workforce alongside her colleagues (both male and female) who have not interrupted their careers.

In the last 50 years there have been great changes toward gender equality in industrialised nations such as the United States of America. With the [[feminist movement]] of the 1960s, women began to enter the workforce in great numbers. Women also had high labor market participation during World War II as so many male soldiers were away, women had to take up jobs to support their family and keep their local economy on track. Many of these women dropped right back out of the labor force when the men returned home from war to raise children born in the generation of the [[baby boomer]]s. In the late 1960s when women began entering the labor force in record numbers, they were entering in addition to all of the men, as opposed to substituting for men during the war. This dynamic shift from the one-earner household to the two-earner household dramatically changed the socioeconomic class system of industrialised nations in the post-war period.

===Effects on the middle and upper classes===
The addition of women into the workforce was one of the key factors that has increased [[social mobility]] over the last 50 years, although this has stalled in recent decades for both genders. Female children of the middle and upper classes had increased access to higher education, and thanks to job equality, were able to attain higher-paying and higher-prestige jobs than ever before. Due to the dramatic increase in availability of [[birth control]], these high status women were able to delay marriage and child-bearing until they had completed their education and advanced their careers to their desired positions. In 2001, the survey on sexual harassment at workplace conducted by women's nonprofit organisation Sakshi among 2,410 respondents in government and non-government sectors, in five states{{clarification needed|date=December 2018|reason=United States?}}{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} recorded 53 percent saying that both sexes don't get equal opportunities, 50 percent of women are treated unfairly by employers and co-workers, 59 per cent have heard sexist remarks or jokes, and 32 percent have been exposed to pornography or literature degrading women.

In comparison with other sectors, IT organisations may be offering equal salaries to women, and the density of women in technology companies may be relatively high, but this does not necessarily ensure a level playing field. For example, Microsoft (US) was sued because of the conduct of one of its supervisors over e-mail. The supervisor allegedly made sexually offensive comments via e-mail, such as referring to himself as "president of the amateur gynecology club." He also allegedly referred to the plaintiff as the "Spandex Queen. E-harassment is not the sole form of harassment. In 1999, Juno Online faced two separate suits from former employees who alleged that they were told that they would be fired if they broke off their ongoing relationships with senior executives. Pseudo Programs, a Manhattan-based Internet TV network, was sued in January 2000 after male employees referred to female employees as "bimbos" and forced them to look at sexually explicit material on the Internet. In India, HR managers admit that women are discriminated against for senior Board positions and pregnant women are rarely given jobs but only in private. In addition to this, it has been suggested that there are fewer women in the IT sector due to existing stereotypes that depict the sector as male-orientated. In a recent book, ''Own It: Leadership Lessons From Women Who Do'', author [[Aparna Jain]] interviewed 200 women in senior management and leadership positions in India about the problems they face at the workplace and noted that 86% of the women she spoke to experienced harassment in one form or the other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/towards-fostering-a-gender-neutral-workplace/story-32TrlU2iOhQfWGGWStcSYL.html&lt;/ref&gt; Among the issues she notes are bias, bullying, sexual harassment and the impact of motherhood on women's career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstpost.com/living/book-review-aparna-jains-own-it-brings-out-of-unarticulated-darkness-the-indescribable-things-that-happen-to-women-at-the-workplace-2614092.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a sexual harassment suit against a senior member shocked the Indian IT sector, as was the sexual harassment case against the [[Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces]]' (Taj Group) CEO, Rakesh Sarna .&lt;ref&gt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/sexual-harassment-case-against-ihcl-boss-rakesh-sarna-may-have-added-to-cyrus-mistry-woes/articleshow/55361051.cms&lt;/ref&gt; A startling example of institutional mechanisms that allow for an unfettered environment for sexual harassment to fester is the [[Rajendra K. Pachauri]] scandal at [[The Energy and Resources Institute]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/hostile-climate-rk-pachauri-reign-teri&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in the education system could be the key to encouraging women to take up roles in this sector.

Recognizing the invisible nature of power structures that marginalize women at the workplace, the Supreme Court in the landmark case ''Vaishaka versus High Court of Rajasthan'' (1997) identified sexual harassment as violative of the women's right to equality in the workplace and enlarged the ambit of its definition. The judgment equates a [[hostile work environment]] on the same plane as a direct request for sexual favors. To quote: "Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as: physical contact and advances; a demand or request for sexual favours; sexually coloured remarks; showing pornography; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature". The judgement mandates appropriate work conditions should be provided for work, leisure, health, and hygiene to further ensure that there is no hostile environment towards women at the workplace and no woman employee should have reasonable grounds to believe that she is disadvantaged in connection with her employment.

This law thus squarely shifts the onus onto the employer to ensure employee safety but most mid-sized Indian service technology companies are yet to enact sexual harassment policies. Admits K Chandan, an advocate from Chandan Associates, "I have a few IT clients. When I point to the need for a sexual harassment policy, most tend to overlook or ignore it. It's not high on the agenda." An HR Manager of India's premier technology companies rues: "I am going to use the recent case to push the policy through. Earlier the draft proposal was rejected by the company." Yet another HR manager from a flagship company of India's leading business house, oblivious to the irony of her statement, admitted that the company had a grievance redressal mechanism but no sexual harassment policy in place. The lax attitudes transgress the Supreme Court judgment wherein the Court not only defined sexual harassment, but also laid down a code of conduct for workplaces to prevent and punish it, "Employers or other responsible authorities in public or private sectors must comply with the following guidelines: Express prohibition of sexual harassment should be notified and circulated;private employers should include prohibition of sexual harassment in the standing orders under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946." As for the complaint procedure, not less than half of its members should be women. The complaint committee should include an NGO or other organization that is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. When the offense amounts to misconduct under service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated. When such conduct amounts to an offense under the Indian Penal Code, the employer shall initiate action by making a complaint with the appropriate authority. However, the survey by Sakshi revealed 58 per cent of women were not aware of the Supreme Court guidelines on the subject. A random survey by AssureConsulting.com among hundred employees working in the IT industry revealed startling results: Less than 10 per cent were familiar with the law or the company's sexual harassment policy. Surprisingly, certain HR managers were also ignorant of the Supreme Court guidelines or the Draft Bill by the National Commission of Women against sexual harassment at the workplace.

Not surprisingly many cases go unreported. However, given the complexities involved, company policy is the first step and cannot wish away the problem. Says Savita HR Manager at Icelerate Technologies, "We have a sexual harassment policy that is circulated among employees. Also the company will not tolerate any case that comes to its notice. But the man at home is no different from the person at the office," thus implying the social mindset that discriminates against women is responsible for the problem. Considering sexual censorship and conservative social attitudes emphasizing "woman's purity," the victim dare not draw attention for fear of being branded a woman with "loose morals". Women would rather brush away the problem or leave jobs quietly rather than speak up, even in organizations that have a zero tolerance policy. Says Chandan, "I do not have exact statistics but from my experience as an advocate one in 1,500 cases are reported." The problem cannot be resolved till more women speak up but the social set-up browbeats women into silence. The social stigma against the victim and the prolonged litigation process for justice thwarts most women from raising their voice. Purports K Chandan "It may take between three and five years to settle a case, and in a situation where the harassment is covert, evidence is hard to gather and there is no guarantee that the ruling would be in favour of the victim. In one of the rare cases I handled a Country Manager was accused and the plaintiff opted for an out of court settlement."

===Effects on the working class===
Women in lower wage jobs are more likely to be subject to wage discrimination. They are more likely to bring home far less than their male counterparts with equal job status, and get far less help with housework from their husbands than the high-earning women. Women with low educational attainment entering the workforce in mass quantity lowered earnings for some men, as the women brought about a lot more job competition. The lowered relative earnings of the men and increase in birth control made marriage prospects harder for lower income women.&lt;ref&gt;Edin, K. and Kefalas, M. (2005). ''Promises I Can Keep: Why poor women put motherhood before marriage. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in the history of this country,{{which|date=January 2014}} there were distinctive socioeconomic stratification among women as there has been among men for centuries. This deepened the inequality between the upper/middle and lower/working classes. Prior to the feminist movement, the socioeconomic status of a family was based almost solely on the husband/father's occupation. Women who were now attaining high status jobs were attractive partners to men with high status jobs, so the high earners married the high earners and the low earners married the low earners. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor stayed the same, and have had increased difficulty competing in the economy.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;

==Impact issues of female participation in the workforce==
A 2008 study published in the [[British Medical Journal]] found that women were 46% more likely to call in sick for short time periods than men and a third more likely than men to take short term sick leave.  At 60 days or more, men and women were equal in terms of sick leave.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Science Daily]]'', "[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080204212846.htm Women Take Almost 50 Percent More Short-term Sick Leave Than Men]", ''[[BMJ]]'', 5 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Women in the workforce have tripled and as their numbers increase it has been hard for both mothers and fathers to be able to take care of their own newborn child or a sick family member. The [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] has allowed for workers to have up to 12 weeks a year to leave work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Scharlach A. E. |author2=Grosswald B. | year = 1997 | title = The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 | url = | journal = Social Service Review | volume = 71 | issue = 3| pages = 335–359 | doi=10.1086/604261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertility===
Increased participation of women in the workforce is associated with decreased fertility. A cross-country panel study found this [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]] effect to be strongest among women aged 20–39, but with a less strong but persistent effect among older women as well.&lt;ref name=bloom2007&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Bloom |first2=David |last2=Canning |first3=Günther |last3=Fink |first4=Jocelyn |last4=Finlay |year=2009 |title=Fertility, female labor force participation, and the demographic dividend |journal=[[Journal of Economic Growth]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=79–101 |doi=10.1007/s10887-009-9039-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International [[United Nation]]s data suggests that women who work because of economic necessity have higher fertility than those who work because they want to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/completingfertility/RevisedLIMpaper.PDF|title=Female Labour-Force Participation|author=Lin Lean Lim|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}, part of {{cite book|title=Completing the Fertility Transition|year=2009|publisher=[[United Nations]] Publications|isbn=9789211513707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for countries in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] area, increased female labor participation has been associated with an increased fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Note on the Changing Relationship between Fertility and Female Employment Rates in Developed Countries|author1=Namkee Ahn  |author2=Pedro Mira |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Population Economics|volume=15|issue=4|year=2002|pages=667–682|jstor=20007839 |doi=10.1007/s001480100078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causality analyses indicate that fertility rate influences female labor participation and not as much the other way around.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt;

Regarding types of jobs, women who work in nurturing professions such as teaching and health generally have children at an earlier age.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt; It is theorized that women often self-select themselves into jobs with a favorable [[work–life balance]] in order to combine motherhood and employment.&lt;ref name=balbo2013&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10680-012-9277-y|author1=Nicoletta Balbo |author2=Francesco C.

==History==

===19th century===
Women have worked at agricultural tasks since ancient times, and continue to do so around the world. The [[Industrial Revolution]] of the late 18th and early 19th centuries changed the nature of work in Europe and other countries of the Western world. Working for a [[wage]], and eventually a [[salary]], became part of urban life. Initially, women were to be found doing even the hardest physical labor, including working as "hurriers" hauling heavy coal carts through mine shafts in Great Britain, a job that also employed many children. This ended after government intervention and the passing of the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842]], an early attempt at regulating the workplace.

During the 19th century, an increasing number of women in Western countries took jobs in factories, such as textile mills, or on assembly lines for machinery or other goods. Women also worked as "[[hawker (trade)|hawker]]s" of produce, flowers, and other market goods, and bred small animals in the working-class areas of [[London]]. [[Piecework]], which involved needlework (weaving, embroidery, winding wool or silk) that paid by the piece completed, was the most common employment for women in 19th century Great Britain. It was poorly paid, and involved long hours, up to 14 hours per day to earn enough wages to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class women were usually involved in some form of paid employment, as it provided some insurance against the possibility that their husband might become too ill or injured to support the family. During the era before [[workers' compensation]] for disability or illness, the loss of a husband's wages could result in the entire family being sent to a Victorian [[workhouse]] to pay debts.

Inequality in wages was to be expected for women. In 1906, the government found that the average weekly factory wage for a woman ranged from 11s 3d to 18s 8d, whereas a man's average weekly wage was around 25s 9d. Employers stated they preferred to hire women, because they could be "more easily induced to undergo severe bodily fatigue than men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childminding was another necessary expense for many women working in factories. Pregnant women worked up until the day they gave birth and returned to work as soon as they were physically able. In 1891, a law was passed requiring women to take four weeks away from factory work after giving birth, but many women could not afford this unpaid leave, and the law was unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=192–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1870 US Census]] was the first United States Census to count "females engaged in each occupation" and provides an intriguing snapshot of women's history. It reveals that, contrary to popular belief, not all American women of the 19th century were either idle in their middle-class homes or working in [[sweatshop]]s. Women were 15% of the total work force (1.8 million out of 12.5). They made up one-third of factory “operatives,” but [[teaching]] and the occupations of [[dressmaking]], [[Hatmaking|millinery]], and [[tailoring]] played a larger role. Two-thirds of [[teacher]]s were women. Women could also be found in such unexpected places as iron and steel works (495), mines (46), sawmills (35), oil wells and refineries (40), gas works (4), and charcoal kilns (5) and held such surprising jobs as ship rigger (16), teamster (196), turpentine laborer (185), brass founder/worker (102), shingle and lathe maker (84), stock-herder (45), gun and locksmith (33), and hunter and trapper (2).

===20th century===
[[File:We Can Do It!.jpg|thumb|right|upright "[[We Can Do It!]]" by [[J. Howard Miller]].|In the United States, the "[[Rosie the Riveter]]" image, as it has become known, is an iconic representation of the US government's efforts to exhort women to work during World War II, and has been adapted numerous times to represent working women or, more broadly, women overcoming adversity and other [[proto-feminist]] messages.]]

In the beginning of the 20th century, women were regarded as society's guardians of morality; they were seen as possessing a finer nature than men and were expected to act as such.&lt;ref name="Davis, R.L p.10"&gt;Davis, R. L: "The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s", p.10. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1972,&lt;/ref&gt; Their role was not defined as workers or money makers. Women were expected to hold on to their innocence until the right man came along so that they can start a family and inculcate that morality they were in charge of preserving. The role of men was to support the family financially.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, R. L: "The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s", p. 9. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet at the turn of the 20th century, social attitudes towards educating young women were changing. Women in North America and Western Europe were now becoming more and more educated, in no small part because of the efforts of pioneering women to further their own education, defying opposition by male educators. By 1900, four out of five colleges accepted women and a whole coed concept was becoming more and more accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, R. H: "Life in the Age of Enterprise", pp. 120-121. Capricorn Books, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[World War I]] made space for women in the workforce, among other economical and social influences. Due to the rise in demand for production from Europe during the raging war, more women found themselves working outside the home.

In the first quarter of the century, women mostly occupied jobs in factory work or as domestic servants, but as the war came to an end they were able to move on to such jobs as: salespeople in department stores as well as clerical, secretarial and other, what were called, "lace-collar" jobs.&lt;ref name="Green-57"&gt;Green, E: "The Uncertainty of Everyday Life, 1915–1945", pp. 57-58. HarperCollins, 1992,&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1920, [[The New York Times]] ran a head line that read: "the American Woman ... has lifted her skirts far beyond any modest limitation"&lt;ref name="Davis, R.L p.10" /&gt; which could apply to more than just fashion; women were now rolling up their sleeves and skirts and making their way into the workforce.

[[World War II]] created millions of jobs for women. Thousands of American women actually joined the military:
140,000 in the [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)]] WAC;
100,000 in the Navy (WAVE);
23,000 in the Marines;
14,000 in the [[Navy Nurse Corps]] and,
13,000 in the Coast Guard.
Although almost none saw combat, they replaced men in noncombat positions and got the same pay as the men would have on the same job. At the same time over 16 million men left their jobs to join the war in Europe and elsewhere, opening even more opportunities and places for women to take over in the job force.&lt;ref name="Green-57"/&gt; Although two million women lost their jobs after the war ended, female participation in the workforce was still higher than it had ever been.&lt;ref name=Moody1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Kim|authorlink=Kim Moody|title=An injury to all : the decline of American Unionism|year=1988|publisher=Verso|location=London|page=22|isbn=0860919293|quote=The rate of participation of women in the labor force rose from about 28% in 1940 to 37% in 1945 and then fell to 30% in 1947.

Newspapers and magazines directed at women encouraged them to keep a tidy home while their husbands were away at work. These articles presented the home as a woman's proper domain, which she was expected to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/05/22/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Sunday May 22, 1949|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era|last=May|first=Elaine Tyler|publisher=Basic Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=10–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, jobs were still available to women.

===The Quiet Revolution===

The increase of women in the labor force of Western countries gained momentum in the late 19th century. At this point women married early on and were defined by their marriages. If they entered the workforce, it was only out of necessity.

The first phase encompasses the time between the late 19th century to the 1930s. This era gave birth to the "independent female worker." From 1890 to 1930, women in the workforce were typically young and unmarried. They had little or no learning on the job and typically held clerical and teaching positions. Many women also worked in textile manufacturing or as domestics. Women promptly exited the work force when they were married, unless the family needed two incomes. Towards the end of the 1920s, as we enter into the second phase, married women begin to exit the work force less and less. Labor force productivity for married women 35–44 years of age increase by 15.5 percentage points from 10% to 25%. There was a greater demand for clerical positions and as the number of women graduating high school increased they began to hold more "respectable", steady jobs. This phase has been appropriately labeled as the Transition Era referring to the time period between 1930 and 1950. During this time the discriminatory institution of [[marriage bars]], which forced women out of the work force after marriage, were eliminated, allowing more participation in the work force of single and married women. Additionally, women's labor force participation increased because there was an increase in demand for office workers and women participated in the high school movement. However, still women's work was contingent upon their husband's income. Women did not normally work to fulfill a personal need to define ones career and social worth; they worked out of necessity.

In the third phase, labeled the "roots of the revolution" encompassing the time from 1950– mid-to-late 1970s, the movement began to approach the warning signs of a revolution. Women's expectations of future employment changed. Women began to see themselves going on to college and working through their marriages and even attending graduate school. Many however still had brief and intermittent work force participation, without necessarily having expectations for a "career". To illustrate, most women were secondary earners, and worked in "pink-collar jobs" as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians. The [[sexual harassment]] experienced by these [[Pink-collar worker|pink collar]] workers is depicted in the film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]''. Although more women attended college, it was often expected that they attended to find a spouse—the so-called "M.R.S. degree". Nevertheless, Labor force participation by women still grew significantly.

The fourth phase, known as the "Quiet Revolution", began in the late 1970s and continues on today. Beginning in the 1970s women began to flood colleges and grad schools. They began to enter profession like [[women in medicine|medicine]], law, dental and business. More women were going to college and expected to be employed at the age of 35, as opposed to past generations that only worked intermittently due to marriage and childbirth. This increase in expectations of long-term gainful employment is reflected in the change of majors adopted by women from the 1970s on. The percentage of women majoring in education declined beginning in the 1970s;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} education was once a popular major for women since it allowed them to step into and out of the labor force when they had children and when their children grew up to a reasonable age at which their mothers did not have to serve primarily as caretakers. Instead, majors such as business and management were on the rise in the 1970s, as women ventured into other fields that were once predominated by men.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} They experienced an expansion of their horizons and an alteration of what it meant to define their own identity. Women worked before they got married, and since women were marrying later in life{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} they were able to define themselves prior to a serious relationship. Research indicates that from 1965 to 2002, the increase in women's labor force participation more than offset the decline for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2003/wp2003-22.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|title=''Do Women’s and Men’s Labor Market Outcomes Differentially Affect Real Wage Growth and Inflation?''|date=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for this big jump in the 1970s has been attributed by some scholars to widespread access to the [[birth control pill]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} While "the pill" was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'', 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the [[age of majority]] had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely as a consequence of the [[Vietnam War]]; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women had the luxury of thinking about other things, like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate to school or work. Due to the multiplier effect, even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example of the other women entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a "big bang" revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldin, Claudia | title = The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women's Employment, Education and Family | journal = The American Economic Review | volume = 96 | issue = 2 | date = 2006 | pages = 1–21 | doi=10.1257/000282806777212350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupational safety and health ==
Women tend to have different occupational hazards and health issues than men in the workplace. Women get [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], [[tendonitis]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[stress (psychological)|stress]], respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases due to their work at higher rates than men. The reasons for these differences may be differences in biology or in the work that women are performing. Women's higher rates of job-related stress may be due to the fact that women are often [[caregiver]]s at home and do [[contingent work]] and [[contract work]] at a much higher rate than men. Another significant occupational hazard for women is [[homicide]], which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women.&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/ |title = Women’s Health at Work |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |date = 13 May 2013 |first1 = Naomi |last1 = Swanson |first2 = Julie |last2 = Tisdale-Pardi |first3 = Leslie |last3 = MacDonald |first4 = Hope M. |last4 = Tiesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/women/#2|title = Women's Safety and Health Issues at Work|date = June 19, 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = NIOSH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrant women are at higher risk for occupational injury than native-born women in the United States, due to higher rates of employment in dangerous industries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women are at lower risk for work-related death than men. However, [[personal protective equipment]] is usually designed for typical male proportions, which can create hazards for women who have ill-fitting equipment.&lt;ref name=NIOSH/&gt; Women are less likely to report an occupational injury than men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research is ongoing into occupational hazards that may be specific to women. Of particular interest are potential [[Toxic substance|environmental causes]] of [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name=NIOSH/&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] is an occupational hazard for many women, and can cause serious negative symptoms including [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[nausea]], [[headache]], [[insomnia]], and feelings of low self-esteem and alienation. Women are also at higher risk for [[occupational stress]], which can be caused by balancing roles as a parent or caregiver with work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
