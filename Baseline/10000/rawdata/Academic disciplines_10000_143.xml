[[File:AHHAA.jpg|thumb|AHHAA]]
'''Science Centre AHHAA''' is the biggest [[science centre]] in [[Estonia]] and the [[Baltic states]], located in [[Tartu]]. The main purpose of AHHAA is promoting [[science]], [[technology]] and the scientific approach to solve common disadvantages.

Since 7 May 2011, Science Centre AHHAA has been located in a building in the centre of Tartu.

==History==
AHHAA was established as a project of the [[University of Tartu]] on 1 September 1997 and by 2004 it had developed into a [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] constituted by the city of Tartu and the University of Tartu.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahhaa.ee/about-us&lt;/ref&gt; From the very beginning, the head of Science Centre AHHAA was [[Tiiu Sild]]. In 2008, the AHHAA [[4D film|4D Adventure Cinema]] was opened in the Lõunakeskus [[shopping centre]] in Tartu. In 2009, a [[branch office]] of Science Centre AHHAA was opened in [[Tallinn]] at the [[Freedom Square, Tallinn|Freedom Square]] (the Tallinn branch was closed at the end of 2013). On 7 May 2011 Science Centre AHHAA in Tartu opened the doors of its new, 11,156 m² building engineered by [[architects]] [[Vilen Künnapu]] and [[Ain Padrik]] in the heart of the city.

The activities of the Science Centre AHHAA Foundation are coordinated by a [[committee]] composed of Hannes Astok, Anneli Saro, Jaanus Karv, Mart Laidmets, Reno Laidre and Vallo Mulk.

Additionally, the practical aspects of the activities of the foundation are appraised by a science committee composed of experts.

==Planetarium==
Science Centre AHHAA offers a view of the starry skies in a fully spherical hybrid planetarium (which means that there is a possibility to show the skies with both [[optical]] and [[Digital cinema|digital projection]], which can be displayed either separately or together).

===Constructional and technical side===
The uniqueness of AHHAA's planetarium lies in the fact that in addition to the ordinary view on the ceiling and the walls, the image of the skies in the planetarium of the centre also extends under the floor, which is the reason why the [[glass floor|floor of the planetarium is made of glass]].&lt;ref name=Aru&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aru|first1=Margus|title=Under One Dome: AHHAA Science Centre Planetarium|journal=Planetarian: Journal of the International Planetarium Society|date=March–June 2012|volume=41|issue=2|page=57|url=http://issuu.com/planetarian/docs/june2012smaller|accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General===
*9 meters in diameter
*20+5 seats
*The first planetarium in Europe to use the MEGASTAR projector
*Currently the first and the only hybrid-planetarium (multiple projector system) in the Baltic states

The AHHAA Planetarium belongs to two organisations:
*The Nordic Planetarium Association
*The International Planetarium Society

==4D Adventure Cinema==
Science Centre AHHAA had a 4D Adventure Cinema, located in the Lõunakeskus shopping centre on the southern edge of Tartu. The cinema was open from 18.07.2008 to 31.12.2017&lt;ref&gt;https://en.astri.ee/lounakeskus/ahhaa-4d-elamuskino/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mullitorn.jpg|thumb]]

==Events==
The Science Centre AHHAA Foundation regularly organizes special events. Some of the most reputable events are listed below:

*The annual Researchers' Night [[Science festival|Festival]] – organized all over Estonia in the end of September and consisting of different events promoting a scientific approach to matters (such as Science Cafés, science theatre shows, tours in laboratories, workshops etc.).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teadlasteoo.ee/en&lt;/ref&gt;

==International representation==
The Science Centre AHHAA Foundation participates in science festivals and fairs both in Estonia and abroad, its main “trade tricks” being the science theatre shows and various workshops. During the past few years [[Festival della Scienza]] and Perugia Science Fest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perugiasciencefest.eu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126121115/http://www.perugiasciencefest.eu/ |archivedate=2012-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Italy]], Korea Science Festival&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kofac.re.kr/en/index.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; in [[South Korea]], Moscow Science Festival&lt;ref&gt;http://www.festivalnauki.ru/&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Russia]], [[Science Picnic]] in [[Poland]] and Science Festival Belgrade&lt;ref&gt;http://www.festivalnauke.org/index-en.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Serbia]] have been among the few places where Science Centre AHHAA has been represented.

His family had previously had members in the legal and medical professions; one of the earliest of whom any special records exist having been John Dickson of [[Kilbucho]] and Hartree, a lawyer, who in 1649 was appointed a [[Senator of the College of Justice]], taking the title of [[Lord Hartree]].

==Early life==
[[File:6 Fettes Row, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|Dickson's house at 6 Fettes Row, Edinburgh]]
He was born at 6 Fettes Row&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1834-5: D Dickson advocate&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Edinburgh]] on 21 February 1836 the son of David Dickson of Hartree, an advocate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickson received his early education at home. In 1855, he entered the [[University of Edinburgh]] as a student of medicine; and soon engaged with enthusiasm in those preliminary scientific studies which have so frequently been the occasion of the first awakenings of latent scientific impulses. In him they appear to have served this purpose. He became an enthusiastic biologist; and a warm admirer and disciple of Goodsir, in whose philosophical tendencies he found, like many of his friends, the inspiring direction that soon became so marked and characteristic a feature of his scientific work and aims. Engrossed in natural science, he took, it would seem, comparatively little interest in the purely professional or technical departments of the medical curriculum. He, however, appreciated differentiation as a means of promoting advancement in the art as well as in the science of medicine. In his inaugural address, delivered in 1859, as a President of the [[Royal Medical Society]], he supposes the questions,

:"Of what use is it for a student of medicine to know that the cranium is composed of vertebral elements—that such and such bones of the face correspond to costal arches; and that certain bones and muscles of the upper extremities correspond to other bones and muscles in the lower?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why should" his "memory be burdened with apophysis and epiphysis, when" there is "so much else to be learned of more direct importance ?" And he goes on, —" To such objections it may be answered, that although morphological anatomy in its present state may be of little practical importance to the medical man, yet this is no reason why he should not study it. It must be at once apparent that, from the nature of homological anatomy, one of the great ends which it is destined to accomplish is a simplified teaching of descriptive anatomy, by a logical and intelligible arrangement and generalisation of the enormous mass of facts with which the anatomical student has to contend ; and this can only be attained to by the development and perfecting of homological anatomy, by which alone a philosophical classification of anatomical details can be rendered possible. Such being the case, all doubt as to the utility of homological anatomy must be thrown aside. Its study must surely be of importance, if it enables anyone to assist, however slightly, in promoting so good an end. The medical man, while he performs his duties to his suffering fellow-creatures, ought never to forget at the same time what he owes to medical science and to posterity."

Dickson graduated as doctor of medicine in August 1860, having previously, in accordance with his biological proclivities, studied under [[Albert von Kölliker]] in [[Würzburg]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]] in Berlin. His career as a teacher of botany began in the summer of 1862, when he conducted the class of botany in the [[University of Aberdeen]] for Professor [[George Dickie (botanist)|George Dickie]], who was at the time incapacitated by bad health. He thus found an opportunity for displaying his merits as a teacher; and his success proved of much value in securing for him in 1866 the chair of Botany in the [[University of Dublin]]. Two years afterwards he was appointed Professor of Botany in the [[University of Glasgow]], where he confirmed his early reputation as a clear and painstaking teacher and an enthusiastic worker in structural and morphological botany.

==Career as botanist==
Dr Dickson remained in Glasgow from 1866 till 1879. In the latter year, the professorship of botany in the University of Edinburgh became vacant, on the resignation, caused by failing health, of the renowned and veteran Professor [[John Hutton Balfour]]; and to this great botanical position, Dr Dickson was promoted by the Curators. In the following year, he received from the Crown also the appointment of Regius Professor of Botany to the University of Edinburgh, as well as that of the 8th [[Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden]], a position he held until 1887. During this time he lived at 11 Royal Circus in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1881-2: Alexander Dickson of Hartree&lt;/ref&gt;

It is with his work as a professor in Edinburgh that the members of this Society are most familiar. The recollection of that work is still so vividly present among us, that, but for the requirement of a historical record, it would be needless to dwell on it. We find him entering on his duties imbued with the same conception of the far-reaching affinities between science and art or practice as was recognised in the early developments of his biological career. In his inaugural address he adopted for his subject the consideration of some remarkable parallels between the animal and vegetable kingdoms as regards specialisation of form for the performance of different functions. For this purpose he compared a flowering plant with a zoophyte, and showed how unity of organisation is manifest throughout nature. The same lesson was indicated as, twenty years before, he had taught in his inaugural address to the Royal Medical Society, that the cultivation of every department of biological science increases the knowledge'of that human anatomy which is the foundation of the art of medicine and surgery.

His relations with the students of the university soon became of the most cordial description. His painstaking earnestness as a teacher, his obvious desire to further their botanical studies, the knowledge that soon spread of the hours spent in preparation for his class, and especially in the preparation of the wonderfully skilful and instructive illustrations that from day to day appeared on the blackboard, and the numberless evidences of his courteous and generous disposition, gained for him, not only respect, but also warm and grateful affection.

Professor Dickson's first botanical paper was published in 1857, while he was yet a student of medicine. During the following twenty-nine years his activity as a worker was shown by the publication of upwards of fifty papers. Many of them rank as masterpieces of accurate and elaborate description, and of philosophical conceptions of structure. A glance over the appended list shows his great partiality for subjects bearing on development and morphology, in which departments of botany he acquired the position of an eminent authority. In confirmation of these statements, it is sufficient to cite his graduation thesis, for which he was bestowed a [[gold medal]], " On the Development of the Flower, and especially the Pistil, in the [[Caryophyllocece]]," and his papers on the Morphology of the Reproductive Organs of the Ooniferce, on the Embryo and its Appendages in Tropceolum, on the Embryology and Development of the Flower of Pinguicula, on the Spiral Arrangements of the Cones of Pinus pinaster, and on the Morphology and Structure of the Pitchers in Cephalotus and Nepenthes.

On account of his eminence as a botanist and teacher, he was made honorary M.D. of the University of Dublin, LL.D. of the University of Glasgow, [[Fellow of the Linnaean Society]], and President of the [[Botanical Society of Edinburgh]].

Dickson took much interest in matters outside of his immediate professorial duties and scientific pursuits. He was a Conservative in State and Church politics. On various occasions he actively supported candidates for parliamentary representation. A consistent [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Churchman]], he remained true to the original position of that Church, and opposed publicly the policy which an influential majority had adopted, of reversing its traditions on the question of a State-recognised and supported Church. He strenuously opposed the legislative attempts, which fortunately proved abortive, to modify the special characters of medical education and graduation in the [[Scottish universities]], for the mere sake of bringing them into harmony with the systems prevailing in the southern division of the United Kingdom. He looked with much distrust on the schemes, embodied in the various Bills introduced into Parliament during the last seven years, for effecting fundamental changes in the constitution and character of the Scottish universities; considering them prompted more by political, social, and selfish aims, than by a real and disinterested desire for educational reform. If it were possible for one so charitable and generous to entertain any feeling of resentment, that feeling was approached in the indignation with which he regarded many of the statements of the extreme section of agitators for university legislation. Even when he found himself in a hopeless minority,—as occasionally happened in the discussions on this question,—few men could be more courageous in maintaining or expressing the views he had deliberately adopted.

Polemical discussion, however, was not congenial to his fair and candid disposition. When not engaged in teaching or in the botanical investigations to which he was so ardently attached, his occupations as proprietor of Hartree and Kilbucho, and social intercourse with his friends, were more in accordance with his tastes.

It has been well said that, as a country laird, "his one aim in life was to make others happy." And the same characteristics made him also a general favourite in society; where he used to delight his friends by the exquisite taste and feeling with which he played on the piano the works of Beethoven and Bach, and the national airs of Scotland.

==Death==
He was aware that he was suffering from an illness, but concealed all knowledge of the existence of this "thorn in the flesh," to avoid causing anxiety and pain to those around. He succeeded in his purpose; and when, on 30 December 1887, he suddenly expired on the [[curling]] pond, at Thriepland Pond, Hartree, Peeblesshire, no forebodings or anxieties had occurred to increase the bitter grief of his departure.

He was warmly he was attached to the [[Botanical Society of Edinburgh]]. He constantly attended its meetings, served it as President and in some of its other offices, and communicated to it the greater number of his botanical papers.

Automation of [[London Underground rolling stock]] has been partially implemented since the introduction of automatic train operation on the Hainault to Woodford section of the Central line in 1964. It is currently in use on four lines. Transport for London plans to extend this to other lines by 2022.

==Historical projects==
[[Automatic train operation|Partially automated]] trains using [[Automatic Train Operation]] (ATO) have been used on passenger services on the [[Victoria line (London Underground)|Victoria line]] since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Driverless metros poised to expand |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//driverless-metros-poised-to-expand.html |work=[[Railway Gazette International]] |date=1 March 2000 |accessdate=25 October 2007 |quote=These trials matured into 'attended ATO'. London's Victoria line was the first into revenue service on 1 September 1968, with Philadelphia's Lindenwold line close behind in January 1969. |archivedate=23 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023234730/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/driverless-metros-poised-to-expand.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The side doors to the driver's cab were sealed, so that access was normally through the passenger saloon. Since the trains were to be operated by one person, the door controls were moved from the rear end of the motor car into the cab. The train control equipment was fitted beneath the centre seats, and consisted of a "black box", which interpreted signals received from the running rails. These were picked up by sensing coils mounted on the leading bogie. One rail supplied safety information, which was received continuously. Any failure to obtain this data resulted in a trip-valve operating, which stopped the train. The second rail supplied signal commands, which included speed signals and instructions to start and stop the train. This information was only provided when it was needed. The driver was renamed a train operator, and was responsible for opening and closing the doors at stations, and initiating a start from the stations, by pressing two buttons simultaneously. All other operation, including stopping at signals and restarting when safe to proceed was automatic. The automatic control equipment was temporarily mounted in the passenger saloon, between the cab and the first set of doors, to enable engineers to monitor and adjust it as experience was gained.&lt;!-- no such reference named "Bruce 1998" &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Bruce |1998 |pp=96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Current status==
Partially-automated trains are currently used on four lines ([[Jubilee line|Jubilee]], [[Central line (London Underground)|Central]], [[Victoria line|Victoria]] and [[Northern line|Northern]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tctt.me.uk/2013/02/automatic-on-the-northern/ |title=LU Northern line goes CBTC |date=17 February 2013 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These trains still require operators to open and close doors, and to assist in case of emergency. This method of working will be extended to the other lines by 2022 and will also be used on [[Thameslink and Great Northern|Thameslink]] and [[Crossrail]].

There are already driverless trains in operation on London second rapid transit system, the [[Docklands Light Railway]] (DLR), although this is a relatively newly built system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/ |title=Docklands Light Railway Capacity Upgrading}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boris Johnson promised in 2012 that there would be driverless Tube trains within 10 years. During his campaign to be re-elected as London Mayor, he said "TfL (Transport for London) will rapidly establish a timetable for introducing the first driverless trains to become operational on the London Underground network within a decade". That was cheered by [[Brian Paddick]] ([[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Lib Dems]]), but [[Ken Livingstone]] ([[Labour party (UK)|Labour]]) said it was a 'vanity project', and [[Jenny Jones (Green politician)|Jenny Jones]] ([[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]]) said that she had concerns over the safety of driverless trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17510918| title=Boris Johnson promises driverless Tube trains within 10 years| website=BBC News| date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The then deputy cabinet member for sports, leisure and customer services at [[City of Westminster|Westminster City Council]], Richard Holloway, launched a petition in August 2015 demanding the introduction of driverless trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2015-08-24/petition-for-driverless-tube-trains-gaining-support/ |title=Petition for driverless Tube trains gaining support |date=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and drawbacks==
===Possible benefits===
*This would remove the possibility of [[London Underground strikes|strikes by drivers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cityam.com/222879/tube-strike-driverless-trains-would-break-militant-unions-forever |title=Driverless trains would break the militant unions forever |date=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have caused widespread disruption, as well as the possibility of a driver being ill or otherwise unable to work at short notice. It would also save the cost of drivers' salaries and benefits.
*In [[Paris Métro|Paris]], automated metros have enabled trains to run every 85 seconds and this increase in services could be replicated on the Tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20985642| title=Could Paris Metro inspire driverless Tube trains?| first=Tom| last=Edwards| website=BBC News| date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=citylab042015/&gt;
*It would enable easier running of the [[Night Tube]], as drivers would not have to work anti-social hours and have to concentrate at times when they might be tired.
*Trains would not have to have a driver's compartment, reducing weight and the cost of building trains&lt;ref name=citylab042015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/tech/2015/04/the-case-for-driverless-trains-by-the-numbers/390408/ |title=The Case for Driverless Trains, By the Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
*There has been criticism from unions over safety and cost, as well as the accompanying reductions in staffing levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rmt.org.uk/about/policies/political-circulars-and-submissions/london-underground-driverless-trains/?preview=true| title=London Underground Driverless Trains| website=RMT| first=Bob| last=Crow}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It is more difficult to introduce driverless trains on existing lines (as opposed to new lines such as the [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]]) as there are issues with signalling when there are both trains with drivers and without running at the same time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} 
*[[Christian Wolmar]] has written that, as Tube lines were not built with escape routes for passengers, in an emergency the passengers must be led away from the train by staff; he argues that this means there must still be a "train captain" on board, negating some of the benefits of driverless trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.christianwolmar.co.uk/2011/01/boris-driverless-nonsense/ |title= Boris driverless nonsense |website=Christian Wolmar |date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Tube for London programme==
{{Main|New Tube for London}}
The New Tube for London programme will include driverless tube trains. However these will initially have a driver on board until old stock has been fully replaced (i.e. [[Automatic train operation#Types of train automation|Grade of Automation]] level 2, currently used on ATO-equipped lines). Even then, they will still have "train captains" on board in case of emergency (i.e. Grade of Automation level 3, as used by the DLR), due to driver union opposition of fully automated, unattended trains (i.e. Grade of Automation level 4, as used by some lines of the [[Paris Métro]]).

'''Bibliophobia''' is the fear or hatred of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/18647 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such fear often arises from fear of the effect books can have on society or culture.&lt;ref name=Holbrook&gt;{{citation |title=The Fear of Books |first=Holbrook |last=Jackson |authorlink=Holbrook Jackson |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1932 |isbn=9780252070402}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Bibliophobia is a common cause of [[censorship]] and [[book burning]].

In his 1999 Matthews lecture at [[Birkbeck College]], [[Tom Shippey]] discussed bibliophobia in the [[Middle Ages]].  This arose when the literate professions, such as the clergy and [[beadle]]s, would exploit and terrify the [[illiterate]] masses by their command of texts such as religious and legal documents.  He illustrated this with examples from Anglo-Saxon literature such as ''[[The Pardoner's Tale]]''.&lt;ref name=TS&gt;{{citation |title=Bibliophobia: hatred of the book in the Middle Ages |first=Tom |last=Shippey |authorlink=Tom Shippey |publisher=Birkbeck College |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bone resorption''' is [[wikt:resorption#Noun|resorption]] of [[bone tissue]], that is, the process by which [[osteoclast]]s break down the tissue in [[bone]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Bone+Resorption}}&lt;/ref&gt; and release the [[mineral]]s, resulting in a transfer of [[calcium]] from bone tissue to the [[blood]].&lt;ref name="Teitelbaum SL."&gt;{{cite journal |author=Teitelbaum SL. |title=Bone resorption by osteoclasts. |journal=Science |volume=289 |year=2000 |pages= 1504–8|pmid=10968780 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5484.1504 |issue=5484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The osteoclasts are multi-nucleated [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that contain numerous [[mitochondria]] and [[lysosome]]s.  These are the cells responsible for the resorption of bone. Osteoclasts are generally present on the outer layer of bone, just beneath the [[periosteum]]. Attachment of the osteoclast to the [[osteon]] begins the process. The osteoclast then induces an infolding of its cell membrane and secretes [[collagenase]] and other enzymes important in the resorption process. High levels of calcium, [[magnesium]], [[phosphate]] and products of [[collagen]] will be released into the extracellular fluid as the osteoclasts tunnel into the mineralized bone. Osteoclasts are prominent in the tissue destruction found in [[psoriatic arthritis]] and rheumatological disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Altered Bone Remodeling in Psoriatic Arthritis|journal = Current Rheumatology Reports|date = 2008-08-01|issn = 1523-3774|pmc = 2656567|pmid = 18662512|pages = 311–317|volume = 10|issue = 4|first = Kofi A.|last = Mensah|first2 = Edward M.|last2 = Schwarz|first3 = Christopher T.|last3 = Ritchlin|doi=10.1007/s11926-008-0050-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions that result in a decrease in bone mass can either be caused by an increase in resorption or by a decrease in ossification. During childhood, bone formation exceeds resorption. As the aging process occurs, resorption exceeds formation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Bone resorption rates are much higher in post-menopausal older women due to estrogen deficiency related with menopause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Disorders of Bone Remodeling|journal = Annual Review of Pathology|date = 2011-01-01|issn = 1553-4006|pmc = 3571087|pmid = 20936937|pages = 121–145|volume = 6|doi = 10.1146/annurev-pathol-011110-130203|first = Xu|last = Feng|first2 = Jay M.|last2 = McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common treatments include drugs that increase bone mineral density.

==Regulation==
Bone resorption is highly stimulated or inhibited by signals from other parts of the body, depending on the demand for calcium.

Calcium-sensing membrane receptors in the [[parathyroid gland]] monitor calcium levels in the extracellular fluid. Low levels of calcium stimulates the release of [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) from [[Parathyroid chief cell|chief cells]] of the [[parathyroid gland]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In addition to its effects on kidney and intestine, PTH increases the number and activity of osteoclasts. The increase in activity of already existing osteoclasts is the initial effect of PTH, and begins in minutes and increases over a few hours.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Continued elevation of PTH levels increases the abundance of osteoclasts.  This leads to a greater resorption of calcium and phosphate ions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

High levels of calcium in the blood, on the other hand, leads to decreased PTH release from the parathyroid gland, decreasing the number and activity of osteoclasts, resulting in less bone resorption.  [[Vitamin D]] increases absorption of calcium and phosphate in the intestinal tract, leading to elevated levels of plasma calcium,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and thus lower bone resorption.

[[Calcitriol]] (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) is the active form of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine (US) Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D and Calcium; Ross AC, Taylor CL, Yaktine AL, et al., editors.

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56061/&lt;/ref&gt; It has numerous functions involved in blood calcium levels.  Recent research indicates that calcitriol leads to a reduction in osteoclast formation, and bone resorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kikuta J, Kawamura S, Okiji F, Shirazaki M, Sakai S, Saito H, Ishii M | date = Apr 2013 | title = Sphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated osteoclast precursor monocyte migration is a critical point of control in antibone-resorptive action of active vitamin D. | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 17| pages = 7009–13 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1218799110 | pmid = 23569273 | pmc = 3637769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamamoto Y, Yoshizawa T, Fukuda T, Shirode-Fukuda Y, Yu T, Sekine K, Sato T, Kawano H, Aihara K, Nakamichi Y, Watanabe T, Shindo M, Inoue K, Inoue E, Tsuji N, Hoshino M, Karsenty G, Metzger D, Chambon P, Kato S, Imai Y | date = Mar 2013 | title = Vitamin D receptor in osteoblasts is a negative regulator of bone mass control | url = | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 154 | issue = 3| pages = 1008–20 | doi = 10.1210/en.2012-1542 | pmid = 23389957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It follows that an increase in vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intake should lead to a decrease in bone resorption — it has been shown that oral administration of vitamin D does not linearly correlate to increased serum levels of [[calcifediol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 69059 | volume=1 | issue=8026 | title=Comparison of oral 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, vitamin D, and ultraviolet light as determinants of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D. | date=Jun 1977 | journal=The Lancet | pages=1341–3 |vauthors=Stamp TC, Haddad JG, Twigg CA | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(77)92553-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the precursor to calcitriol.

[[Calcitonin]] is a hormone secreted by the [[thyroid]] in humans. Calcitonin decreases osteoclast activity, and decreases the formation of new osteoclasts, resulting in decreased resorption.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Calcitonin has a greater effect in young children than in adults, and plays a smaller role in bone remodeling than PTH.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In some cases where bone resorption outpaces ossification, the bone is broken down much faster than it can be renewed. The bone becomes more porous and fragile, exposing people to the risk of fractures. Depending on where in the body bone resorption occurs, additional problems like tooth loss can arise. This can be caused by conditions such as [[hypoparathyroidism]] and [[hypovitaminosis D]] or even decreased hormonal production in the elderly.  Some diseases with symptoms of decreased bone density are [[osteoporosis]], and [[rickets]].

Some people who experience increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation are [[astronauts]]. Due to the condition of being in a [[zero-gravity]] environment, astronauts do not need to work their musculoskeletal system as hard as when on [[earth]]. Ossification decreases due to a lack of stress, while resorption  increases, leading to a net decrease in bone density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Iwamoto J, Takeda T, Sato Y | date = Jun 2005 | title = Interventions to prevent bone loss in astronauts during space flight | url = | journal = The Keio Journal of Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 55–9 | pmid = 16077253 | doi=10.2302/kjm.54.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alcoholism ==
The effects of alcohol on [[bone mineral density]] (BMD) are well-known and well-studied in animal and human populations. Through direct and indirect pathways, prolonged ethanol exposure increases fracture risk by decreasing bone mineral density and promoting osteoporosis. Indirect effects of alcohol abuse occur via growth hormone, sex steroids, and oxidative stress.

Growth hormone is an important regulator of bone growth and remodeling in adults, and it acts via insulin-like growth factor I ([[IGF1]]) to stimulate osteoblastic differentiation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Alcohol alters whole body composition, inhibits bone formation, and increases bone marrow adiposity in rats|journal = Osteoporosis International |date = 2009-09-01|issn = 1433-2965|pmid = 19238309|pages = 1529–1538|volume = 20|issue = 9|doi = 10.1007/s00198-009-0836-y|first = G.

T.|last7 = Iwaniec}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic alcoholism decreases the levels of IGF1, which suppresses the ability of GH to increase bone mineral density.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Increasing alcohol consumption is linked with decreasing testosterone and serum estradiol levels, which in turn lead to the activation of [[RANK]] (a TNF receptor) protein that promote osteoclast formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Alcohol-induced disruption of endocrine signaling|journal = Alcoholism, Clinical and Experimental Research|date = 2007-08-01|issn = 0145-6008|pmid = 17559547|pages = 1269–1285|volume = 31|issue = 8|doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2007.00436.x|first = Martin J.

J.|last5 = Ronis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct effects of chronic alcoholism are apparent in osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes. Ethanol suppresses the activity and differentiation of osteoblasts.

At the same time, it has a direct effect on osteoclast activity. This results in an increased bone resorption rate and a decreased bone mineral density due to increased pit numbers and pit areas in the bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The amazing osteocyte|journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Research|date = 2011-02-01|issn = 1523-4681|pmc = 3179345|pmid = 21254230|pages = 229–238|volume = 26|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/jbmr.320|first = Lynda F.|last = Bonewald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spatial distribution of Bax and Bcl-2 in osteocytes after bone fatigue: complementary roles in bone remodeling regulation?|journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Research|date = 2002-05-01|issn = 0884-0431|pmid = 12009022|pages = 907–914|volume = 17|issue = 5|doi = 10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.5.907|first = Olivier|last = Verborgt|first2 = Nadine A.|last2 = Tatton|first3 = Robert J.|last3 = Majeska|first4 = Mitchell B.|last4 = Schaffler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that viable osteocytes (another type of bone cell) may prevent osteoclastogenesis, whereas apoptotic osteocytes tend to induce osteoclast stimulation.

The inspection's purpose is to establish that a particular vessel is safe to work aboard, will not place anybody working on or around the vessel in danger and will not cause any harm to the environment.  The inspection also ensures that all mandatory certification for the vessel and its operations are up to date.

The inspection contains 17 sections including:
* Vessel Particulars
* Index of Certificates
* HSE (Health, Safety &amp; Environment)
* Crew Management
* Pollution Prevention

The CMID is currently on Issue 8, with Issue 9 expected later in 2013.  With the release of issue 7 in 2009, an online database, which allows the electronic completion of CMID reports and manages storage and access of these inspections was released by IMCA.

In April 2013, IMCA reworked the Marine Inspection Checklist for Small Workboats ([https://www.imca-int.com/publications/258/marine-inspection-for-small-workboats-common-marine-inspection-document-for-small-workboats/ IMCA M 189]) renaming it as the Marine inspection for Small Workboats (Common Marine Inspection Document for Small Workboats) and changing the formatting of sections of the document, to make it compatible with the [http://www.imcacmid.com/ IMCA eCMID Database]

In [[evolution|evolutionary theory]], the '''court-jester hypothesis''' contrasts the [[Red Queen hypothesis]]. [[University of California, Berkeley]] professor Anthony D. Barnosky coined the term in 1999 in reference to the idea that [[abiotic]] forces (including [[climate]]), rather than [[wikt:biotic|biotic]] competition between [[species]], function as a major driving force behind the processes in [[evolution]] which produce [[speciation]].

== History ==

The "Red Queen hypothesis" is a term coined by [[Leigh Van Valen]], in 1973,&lt;ref name="autogenerated728"&gt;Michael J. Benton, "The Red Queen and the Court Jester: Species Diversity and the Role of Biotic and Abiotic Factors Through Time", Science February 6, 2009: Vol. 323 no. 5915 pp. 728–732 {{doi|10.1126/science.1157719}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a reference to the [[Lewis Carroll]] book ''[[Through the Looking Glass]]''. It refers in evolution theory to the arms race of evolutionary developments and counter-developments that cause co-evolving species to mutually drive each other to adapt.  There is dispute over how strongly evolution at the scale of speciation is driven by these competitions between [[species]], and how much it is driven instead by abiotic factors like [[meteor]] strikes and climate change, but there was not an artful metaphor to capture this alternative until one was coined by Anthony Barnosky. The term "Court Jester hypothesis" was coined by Anthony Barnosky in 1999 in allusion to the Red Queen hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Barnosky, "Does evolution dance to the Red Queen or the Court Jester?", 3 Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology USA (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a 2001 paper on the subject,&lt;ref name="berkeley2001"&gt;Anthony Barnosky, "Distinguishing The Effects Of The Red Queen And Court Jester On Miocene Mammal Evolution In The Northern Rocky Mountains" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 21(1):172–185, March 2001 http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/miomap/RESULTS-MIOMAP/barnoskyjvp2001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Barnosky uses the term without citation, suggesting that he is the one who coined it. Westfall and Millar attribute the term to him (citing the 2001 paper) in a paper of their own from 2004.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Robert D. Westfall and Constance I. Millar, "Genetic consequences of forest population dynamics influenced
by historic climatic variability in the western USA" Forest Ecology and Management 197 (2004) 159–170. http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/westfall/Westfall%20&amp;%20Millar%2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Benton also credits Barnosky with coining the phrase.&lt;ref name="autogenerated728"/&gt;

Since 2001, many researchers in evolution (such as Tracy Aze,&lt;ref name="macroevolutionary349"&gt;Thomas H. G. Ezard, Tracy Aze, Paul N. Pearson, and Andy Purvis, "Interplay Between Changing Climate and Species’ Ecology Drives Macroevolutionary Dynamics", Science April 15, 2011: Vol. 332 no. 6027 pp. 349–351 {{doi|10.1126/science.1203060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Barnosky, Michael J. Benton,&lt;ref name="autogenerated728"/&gt; Douglas Erwin,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Jeremy B.C. Jackson and Douglas H. Erwin, "What can we learn about ecology and evolution from the fossil record?" Trends in Ecology and Evolution)&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Ezard,&lt;ref name="macroevolutionary349"/&gt; Sergey Gravilets,&lt;ref&gt;Sergey Gavrilets, et al., "Adaptive Radiation: Contrasting Theory with Data",Science February 6, 2009: 732–737. {{doi|10.1126/science.1157966}}&lt;/ref&gt; J.B.C. Jackson,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Paul N. Pearson,&lt;ref name="macroevolutionary349"/&gt; Andy Purvis,&lt;ref name="macroevolutionary349"/&gt; Robert D. Westfall,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; and Constance I. Millar&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;) have started to use the term "Court Jester hypothesis" to describe the view that evolution at a macro scale is driven by abiotic factors more than the biotic competition called the Red Queen hypothesis.

The court jester hypothesis builds upon the [[punctuated equilibrium]] theory of [[Stephen Jay Gould|Stephen Gould]] (1972)&lt;ref&gt;Eldredge, Niles and S. J. Gould (1972).

A class of alternative ideas, here termed Court Jester hypotheses, share the basic tenet that changes in the physical environment rather than biotic interactions themselves are the initiators of major changes in organisms and ecosystems. . . . Court Jester hypotheses imply that events random in respect to the biota occasionally change the rules on the biotic playing field. Accelerated biotic response (relative to background rates) is the result."

The Red Queen hypothesis (focusing on evolution by biotic interactions) and Court Jester hypothesis (focusing on evolution by abiotic factors such as stochastic environmental perturbations) both influence coevolutionary switching in host-parasite interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501548|last=Rabajante|first=J|title=Host-parasite Red Queen dynamics with phase-locked rare genotypes|journal=[[Science Advances]]|year=2016|volume=2|issue=3|pages=e1501548|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/3/e1501548|issn=2375-2548|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnosky acknowledges in the 2001 paper&lt;ref name="berkeley2001"/&gt; that the Court Jester hypothesis is not necessarily inconsistent with the Red Queen hypothesis: 

:"Indeed, as Ned Johnson remarked (after listening to a lecture expressing these ideas), ‘‘Maybe it is time for the Court Jester to marry the Red Queen.’’ That is, perhaps the dichotomy between the two hypotheses is really a dichotomy of scale, and that as we look for ways to travel across biological levels, we will find ways to resolve the dichotomies."

The '''Dirac large numbers hypothesis''' ('''LNH''') is an observation made by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1937 relating ratios of size scales in the [[Universe]] to that of force scales. The ratios constitute very large, dimensionless numbers: some [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1039|40 orders of magnitude]] in the present cosmological epoch. According to Dirac's hypothesis, the apparent similarity of these ratios might not be a mere coincidence but instead could imply a [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] with these unusual features:
*The strength of gravity, as represented by the [[gravitational constant]], is inversely proportional to the [[age of the universe]]: &lt;math&gt;G \propto 1/t\,&lt;/math&gt;
*The mass of the universe is proportional to the square of the universe's age: &lt;math&gt;M \propto t^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Neither of these two features has gained wide acceptance in mainstream physics.

== Background ==

LNH was Dirac's personal response to a set of large number 'coincidences' that had intrigued other theorists of his time. The 'coincidences' began with [[Hermann Weyl]] (1919),&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who speculated that the observed radius of the universe, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;, might also be the hypothetical radius of a particle whose rest energy is equal to the gravitational self-energy of the electron:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {R_U}{r_e}\approx \frac{r_H}{r_e} \approx 10^{42} ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_e = \frac {e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 m_e c^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_H = \frac {e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 m_H c^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_H c^2 = \frac {Gm_e^2}{r_e}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[classical electron radius]], ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the electron, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the mass of the hypothetical particle, and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is its electrostatic radius.

The coincidence was further developed by [[Arthur Eddington]] (1931)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=A. Eddington
 |year=1931
 |title=Preliminary Note on the Masses of the Electron, the Proton, and the Universe

 |bibcode=1931PCPS...27...15E
 |doi=10.1017/S0305004100009269
}}&lt;/ref&gt; who related the above ratios to '''N''', the estimated number of charged particles in the universe:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 Gm_e^2} \approx \sqrt {N} \approx 10^{42}.&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to the examples of Weyl and Eddington, Dirac was also influenced by the [[primeval-atom hypothesis]] of [[Georges Lemaître]], who lectured on the topic in Cambridge in 1933. The notion of a varying-G cosmology first appears in the work of [[Edward Arthur Milne]] a few years before Dirac formulated LNH. Milne was inspired not by large number coincidences but by a dislike of Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Milne, space was not a structured object but simply a system of reference in which relations such as this could accommodate Einstein's conclusions:
:&lt;math&gt;G = \left(\frac{c^3}{M_U}\right)t,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''M''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the universe and ''t'' is the age of the universe in seconds. According to this relation, ''G'' increases over time.

== Dirac's interpretation of the large number coincidences==

The Weyl and Eddington ratios above can be rephrased in a variety of ways, as for instance in the context of time:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {ct}{r_e} \approx 10^{40},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the age of the universe, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the classical electron radius. Hence, in units where ''c''=1 and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the age of the universe is about 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; units of time. This is the same [[order of magnitude]] as the ratio of the [[electromagnetic force|electrical]] to the [[gravitational]] [[force]]s between a [[proton]] and an [[electron]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 G m_p m_e} \approx 10^{40}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, interpreting the [[electric charge|charge]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; of the [[electron]], the [[mass]] &lt;math&gt;m_p&lt;/math&gt;/&lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; of the proton/electron, and the permittivity factor &lt;math&gt; 4 \pi \epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; in atomic units (equal to 1), the value of the [[gravitational constant]] is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−40&lt;/sup&gt;. Dirac interpreted this to mean that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; varies with time as &lt;math&gt;G \approx 1/t\,&lt;/math&gt;. Although [[George Gamow]] noted that such a temporal variation does not necessarily follow from Dirac's assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 |title=Dirac: A Scientific Biography
 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]

 |isbn=978-0-521-38089-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt; a corresponding change of G has not been found.&lt;ref&gt;

 |bibcode=2003RvMP...75..403U
 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.75.403
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to general relativity, however, G is constant, otherwise the law of conserved energy is violated. Dirac met this difficulty by introducing into the [[Einstein field equations]] a gauge function {{lang|grc|β}} that describes the structure of spacetime in terms of a ratio of gravitational and electromagnetic units. He also provided alternative scenarios for the continuous creation of matter, one of the other significant issues in LNH:
*'additive' creation (new matter is created uniformly throughout space) and
*'multiplicative' creation (new matter is created where there are already concentrations of mass).

== Later developments and interpretations ==

Dirac's theory has inspired and continues to inspire a significant body of scientific literature in a variety of disciplines. In the context of [[geophysics]], for instance, [[Edward Teller]] seemed to raise a serious objection to LNH in 1948&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=E. Teller
 |year=1948
 |title=On the change of physical constants
 |journal=[[Physical Review]]
 |volume=73 |issue=7 |pages=801–802
 |bibcode=1948PhRv...73..801T
 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.73.801
}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he argued that variations in the strength of gravity are not consistent with [[paleontology|paleontological]] data. However, [[George Gamow]] demonstrated in 1962&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |author=G. Gamow
 |year=1962
 |title=Gravity
 |pages=138–141
 |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]
 |lccn=62008840
}}&lt;/ref&gt; how a simple revision of the parameters (in this case, the age of the Solar System) can invalidate Teller's conclusions. The debate is further complicated by the choice of LNH [[Cosmology|cosmologies]]: In 1978, G. Blake&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=G. Blake
 |year=1978
 |title=The Large Numbers Hypothesis and the rotation of the Earth
 |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]
 |volume=185 |issue=2
 |pages=399–408
 |bibcode=1978MNRAS.185..399B
 |doi=10.1093/mnras/185.2.399
}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that paleontological data is consistent with the 'multiplicative' scenario but not the 'additive' scenario. Arguments both for and against LNH are also made from astrophysical considerations. For example, D. Falik&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=D. Falik
 |year=1979
 |title=Primordial Nucleosynthesis and Dirac's Large Numbers Hypothesis
 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]
 |volume=231 |page=L1
 |bibcode=1979ApJ...231L...1F
 |doi=10.1086/182993
}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that LNH is inconsistent with experimental results for [[microwave background radiation]] whereas Canuto and Hsieh&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |bibcode=1980ApJ...239L..91C
 |doi=10.1086/183299
}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that it ''is'' consistent. One argument that has created significant controversy was put forward by [[Robert Dicke]] in 1961. Known as the [[anthropic coincidence]] or [[fine-tuned universe]], it simply states that the large numbers in LNH are a necessary coincidence for intelligent beings since they parametrize [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] in [[star]]s and hence carbon-based [[life]] would not arise otherwise.

Various authors have introduced new sets of numbers into the original 'coincidence' considered by Dirac and his contemporaries, thus broadening or even departing from Dirac's own conclusions. Jordan (1947)&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the mass ratio for a typical star and an electron approximates to 10&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;, an interesting variation on the 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; that are typically associated with Dirac and Eddington respectively.

Several authors have recently identified and pondered the significance of yet another large number, approximately [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#Larger than 10100|120 orders of magnitude]]. This is for example the ratio of the theoretical and observational estimates of the [[Vacuum energy|energy density of the vacuum]], which Nottale (1993)&lt;ref&gt;

[[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] identified 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; with the ratio of the universe's volume to the volume of a typical nucleon bounded by its Compton wavelength, and he identified this ratio with the sum of elementary events or [[bit]]s of [[information]] in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File: European Glass Experience (logo).jpg|thumb|European Glass Experience Logo]]
'''European Glass Experience''' is a project coordinated by the City of [[Venice]] in collaboration with Consorzio Promovetro Murano and the [[Murano Glass Museum]]. It represents an international celebration of contemporary glass art and, most of all, of its makers.

==The project==
EGE was officially launched on September 11, 2013 during a press conference at [[Ca' Farsetti]] in [[Venice]], and its aim is to valorise the glass art on a European level, and to promote the works of local and international young artists. European Glass Experience was established to reinforce glass production and to improve the artistic heritage of traditional glass working experience. The project has among its partners The Finnish Glass Museum, [[Riihimaki]], [[Finland]], and the Fundación Centro Nacional del Vidrio, La Granja de San Idelfonso, [[Segovia]], [[Spain]]. Associated partners are the Glass Factory in Boda Glasbruk, [[Sweden]], the Muzeum Witrazu (Stained Glass Museum) in [[Krakow]], the International Festival of Glass in [[Stourbridge]], [[England]] and the Glass Museum of Marinha Grande (Portugal). European Glass Experience project is co-financed by a prestigious two-year grant from the Culture Program 2007 – 2013 of the [[European Union]]. The project will last two years, and it is composed by an exhibition which will take place in three different museums, divided into two sections: 40 unreleased glass artworks and 20 sketches which will become artworks, realised by Promovetro’s Murano glass masters.

==The exhibition==

The exhibition began at The Finnish Glass Museum, Riihimaki, Finland, in March 2014, curated by Uta Laurén, and then continued to the Fundación Centro Nacional del Vidrio, Spain, under the directorship of Paloma Pastor. The final venue will be the Murano Glass Museum, directed by Chiara Squarcina in March 2015. Further additional venues, among the associated partners, will possibly follow. European Glass Experience team panel, made of museum directors, curators, and glass experts, selected nearly 80 sketches and artworks, coming from young artists of different cultures. Murano Glass masters associated with Promovetro are going to realize a selection of the most peculiar sketches in glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egeglass.eu/|title=EGE - European Glass Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expectation confirmation theory''' (alternatively '''ECT''' or '''expectation disconfirmation theory''') is a [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive theory]] which seeks to explain post-purchase or post-adoption [[Contentment|satisfaction]] as a function of expectations, perceived performance, and disconfirmation of beliefs. The structure of the theory was developed in a series of two papers written by Richard L. Oliver in 1977&lt;ref&gt;Oliver R. L, 1977, "Effect of Expectation and Disconfirmation on Postexposure Product Evaluations - an Alternative Interpretation," Journal of Applied Psychology, 62(4), p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver R. L, 1980, "A Cognitive Model of the Antecedents and Consequences of Satisfaction Decisions," Journal of Marketing Research, 17(4), p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the theory originally appeared in the [[psychology]] and [[marketing]] literatures, it has since been adopted in several other scientific fields, notably including [[consumer research]] and [[information systems]], among others.

==Theoretical constructs==
Expectation confirmation theory involves four primary constructs: expectations, perceived performance, disconfirmation of beliefs, and satisfaction.

===Expectations===
''Expectations'' refer to the attributes or characteristics that a person anticipates or predicts will be associated with an entity such as a product, service, or technology artifact. Expectations are posited to directly influence both perceptions of performance and disconfirmation of beliefs, and are posited to indirectly influence post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction by way of a [[Mediation (statistics)|mediational relationship]] through the disconfirmation construct. Pre-purchase or pre-adoption expectations form the basis of comparison against which the product, service, or technology artifact is ultimately judged.

=== Perceived performance===
''Perceived performance'' refers to a person’s perceptions of the actual performance of a product, service, or technology artifact. According to expectation confirmation theory, perceptions of performance are directly influenced by pre-purchase or pre-adoption expectations, and in turn directly influence disconfirmation of beliefs and post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction. Perceived performance is also posited to indirectly influence post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction by way of a mediational relationship through the disconfirmation construct.

=== Disconfirmation of beliefs===
''Disconfirmation of beliefs'' refers to the judgments or evaluations that a person makes with respect to a product, service, or technology artifact. These evaluations or judgments are made in comparison to the person’s original expectations. When a product, service, or technology artifact outperforms the person’s original expectations, the disconfirmation is positive, which is posited to increase post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction. When a product, service, or technology artifact underperforms the person’s original expectations, the disconfirmation is negative, which is posited to decrease post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction (i.e., to increase dissatisfaction).

===Satisfaction===
Post-purchase or post-adoption ''satisfaction'' refers to the extent to which a person is pleased or contented with a product, service, or technology artifact after having gained direct experience with the product, service, or artifact. Expectation confirmation theory posits that satisfaction is directly influenced by disconfirmation of beliefs and perceived performance, and is indirectly influenced by both expectations and perceived performance by means of a mediational relationship which passes through the disconfirmation construct.

'''Felching''' is a [[Human sexual activity|sexual practice]] involving the act of orally sucking [[semen]] out of the [[Human anus|anus]] of one's partner. The act of sucking semen out of a [[vagina]] is known as [[Creampie (sexual act)|creampie eating]].

==Earliest appearance of the term==

According to the 2003 draft entry for "felch" in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the earliest occurrence of the word in print appears to have been in ''The Argot of the Homosexual Subculture'' by Ronald A. Farrell in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | first = Ronald A.

{{cquote|FELTCH {{sic}} (v.): To use one's mouth or tongue on the anus of his partner; analingus or male cunnilingus (syn. RIM).}}

The word was subsequently featured in a 1975 [[underground comic]]: ''Felch Cumics'', published by [[Keith Green (art)|Keith Green]]. Contributors to ''Felch'' included ''[[Zap Comix]]'' cartoonists [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Robert Crumb]], and [[Spain Rodriguez]]. Members of the ''Zap'' collective had previously published two sexually themed comic books, ''Snatch'' and ''Jiz'', and decided to continue pushing the envelope by publishing ''Felch''. According to Williams:

{{cquote|OK, since we didn’t get in any trouble with ''Snatch'' and ''Jiz'', and a couple of these other comics, I was partying one night with Crumb, Wilson and these other guys. And Wilson mentioned to me, he says, "I was talking to Ken Weaver and he had this real interesting word." I said what, "What is it?" "A word called 'felch.'" I said, "What does that mean?" He said, "It is a real old term and it means orally withdrawing semen from someone’s lower digestive tract after having anal sex." I said, "There’s a word for something like that?" That’s incredible that not only is there a word like that, but it has a provenance. Hell yeah, we’re going to do a felch comic. So I talked to Crumb, "Yeah, we’re going to do a felch comic."}}

Crumb's contribution was a parody of an [[editorial cartoon]] featuring [[John Q. Public]] felching "[[Mother Nature]]/[[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]]" after she has had anal sex with a ''[[Pravda]]''-style cartoon capitalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=R. |authorlink=Robert Crumb |title=The Complete Crumb Comics, Volume 10: Crumb Advocates Violent Overthrow |publisher=Fantagraphics Books |date=March 1994 |isbn=1-56097-137-1 |at=p. 64, reproduction of cartoon from ''Felch Cumix'' 1975 |editor1-last=Thompson |editor1-first=Mark |editor2-last=Groth |editor2-first=Gary |edition=1st |location=Seattle, Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams' contribution to the comics was titled "The Nectar of Satan."&lt;ref name="englishdotufldotedu-imagetext-archive-williams"&gt;

It was also used in 1979 by [[Larry Kramer]] in his novel [[Faggots (novel)|''Faggots'']], where he defined it as sucking the ejaculate from the anus after intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, L. (1979) ''Faggots''. New York: Grove Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ginger Finger for Figging.jpg|thumb|Pared finger of [[ginger]] root]]

'''Figging''' is the practice of inserting a piece of skinned [[ginger]] root into the human [[Human anus|anus]] or the [[vagina]] in order to generate an acute burning sensation. Historically this was a method of punishment, but has since been adopted as a practice of [[BDSM]]. The term "figging" comes from the 19th-century word "[[Gingering|feaguing]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feague (Grose 1811 Dictionary)|url=http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Grose-VulgarTongue/f/feague.html|website=www.fromoldbooks.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{slavery}}
This method of physical [[punishment]] was first used as a form of [[discipline]] on female slaves in [[Ancient Greece]], and during the [[Victorian era]] it was unofficially used by the [[Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire]] as a method of [[discipline|disciplinary]] action or [[corporal punishment]] for female prisoners.&lt;ref name=Torture&gt;''Torture and Democracy'' by Darius Rejali. p. 213f.&lt;/ref&gt; The detainee was [[physical restraint|restrained]] to varying degrees in order to restrict mobility while the sensation grew from uncomfortable to extreme.&lt;ref name="trist"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taormino|first=Tristan|authorlink=Tristan Taormino|title=The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bG8XqRO6rRQC|year=2006|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-57344-522-1|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Figging, die Kunst des Ingwerwurzel-Spiels"&gt;www.studio-arcades.com: ''[http://www.studio-arcades.com/cms/index.php/behandlungen/92-figging-die-kunst-des-ingwerwurzel-spiels.html].'' 10. June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
The ginger, which is skinned and often carved into the shape of a [[butt plug]], causes an intense burning sensation, and often intolerable discomfort to the subject. The effect reaches climax within two to five minutes after insertion, and persists for around thirty minutes before gradually easing. The ginger, after use, can be further skinned, and used to extend the experience; each fresh application of [[ginger]] root refreshes the duration of the sensations in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

If the person being figged tightens the muscles of the anus, the sensation becomes more intense.&lt;ref name="trist"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason it is often used in [[caning]] to prevent clenching of the buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scony.com/articles/figging/ |title=Figging}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Forensic science|all}}
'''Forensic science''' is the application of [[science]] to [[Criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil laws]], mainly—on the criminal side—during [[criminal investigation]], as governed by the legal standards of [[admissible evidence]] and [[criminal procedure]].

Forensic scientists collect, preserve, and analyze scientific [[evidence]] during the course of an investigation. While some forensic scientists travel to the scene of the crime to collect the evidence themselves, others occupy a laboratory role, performing analysis on objects brought to them by other individuals.&lt;ref name="job desc"&gt;{{cite web | title=Job Description for Forensic Laboratory Scientists | website=Crime Scene Investigator EDU | accessdate=28 August 2015 | url=http://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-scientist-job-description/ | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906092342/http://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-scientist-job-description/ | archivedate=6 September 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their laboratory role, forensic scientists testify as [[expert witness]]es in both criminal and civil cases and can work for either the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] or the defense. While any field could technically be ''forensic'', certain sections have developed over time to encompass the majority of forensically related cases.&lt;ref name="aafs sections"&gt;{{cite web | title=Sections | website=American Academy of Forensic Sciences | date=27 August 2015 | accessdate=28 August 2015 | url=http://www.aafs.org/about-aafs/sections/ | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830013131/http://www.aafs.org/about-aafs/sections/ | archivedate=30 August 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Forensic science is the combination of two different Latin words: forensis and science. The former, forensic, relates to a discussion or examination performed in public. Because trials in the ancient world were typically held in public, it carries a strong judicial connotation. The second is science, which is derived from the Latin word for knowledge and is today closely tied to the scientific method, a systematic way of acquiring knowledge. Taken together, then, forensic science can be seen as the use of the scientific methods and processes in crime solving.

==Etymology==
The word ''forensic'' comes from the Latin term ''forensis'', meaning "of or before the forum".&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the term originates from Roman times, during which a criminal charge meant presenting the case before a group of public individuals in the [[Roman Forum|forum]]. Both the person accused of the crime and the accuser would give speeches based on their sides of the story. The case would be decided in favor of the individual with the best argument and delivery. This origin is the source of the two modern usages of the word ''forensic'' – as a form of legal evidence and as a category of public presentation. In modern use, the term ''forensics'' in the place of ''forensic science'' can be considered correct, as the term ''forensic'' is effectively a [[synonym]] for ''legal'' or ''related to courts''. However, the term is now so closely associated with the scientific field that many dictionaries include the meaning that equates the word ''forensics'' with ''forensic science''.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}

===Origins of forensic science and early methods===
{{main|Forensics in antiquity}}
The [[Ancient history|ancient world]] lacked standardized forensic practices, which aided criminals in escaping punishment. Criminal investigations and trials heavily relied on forced [[Confession (law)|confession]]s and witness [[testimony]]. However, ancient sources do contain several accounts of techniques that foreshadow concepts in forensic science that were developed centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schafer|first=Elizabeth D.|title=Forensic Science|chapter=Ancient science and forensics|editor=Ayn Embar-seddon, Allan D. Pass (eds.)|publisher=Salem Press|year=2008|page=40|isbn=978-1-58765-423-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first written account of using [[medicine]] and [[entomology]] to solve criminal cases is attributed to the book of [[Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified|''Xi Yuan Lu'']] (translated as ''Washing Away of Wrongs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/forensics/timeline.html |title=Forensics Timeline |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629040006/http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/forensics/timeline.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vizproto.prism.asu.edu/classes/sp05/todd_c/forensic_site/intro.html A Brief Background of Forensic Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216092646/http://vizproto.prism.asu.edu/classes/sp05/todd_c/forensic_site/intro.html |date=16 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), written in China by [[Song Ci]] (宋慈, 1186–1249) in 1248, who was a director of justice, jail and supervision,&lt;ref&gt;Song, Ci, and Brian E. McKnight. ''The washing away of wrongs: forensic medicine in thirteenth-century China''. Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, U of Michigan, 1981. Print. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Song dynasty]].

''The washing away of wrongs: forensic medicine in thirteenth-century China''. Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, U of Michigan, 1981. Print. pp. 79–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of Song Ci's accounts (''Washing Away of Wrongs''), the case of a person murdered with a sickle was solved by an investigator who instructed everyone to bring his sickle to one location. (He realized it was a sickle by testing various blades on an animal carcass and comparing the wound.) Flies, attracted by the smell of blood, eventually gathered on a single sickle. In light of this, the murderer confessed. For example, the book also described how to distinguish between a [[drowning]] (water in the [[lungs]]) and [[strangulation]] (broken neck [[cartilage]]), along with other evidence from examining corpses on determining if a death was caused by murder, suicide or an accident.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Methods from around the world involved saliva and examination of the mouth and tongue to determine innocence or guilt, as a precursor to the [[Polygraph test]]. In ancient [[India]],&lt;ref name=EDodD&gt;{{cite book|last=Parmeshwaranand|first=Swami|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the Dharmaśāstra, Volume 1|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|location=[[New Delhi]]|isbn=8176253650|page=499|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDQVereyvj4C&amp;pg=PA499#v=onepage&amp;q=rice&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; some suspects were made to fill their mouths with dried rice and spit it back out. Similarly, in ancient [[China]], those accused of a crime would have rice powder placed in their mouths.&lt;ref&gt;McCrie, Robert D. "General Managerial Fundamentals and Competencies". ''Security Operations Management''. 1st ed. Amsterdam: Butterworth-Heinemann/Elsevier, 2007. 93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient [[Middle-East|middle-eastern]] cultures, the accused were made to lick hot metal rods briefly. It is thought that these tests had some validity{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} since a guilty person would produce less saliva and thus have a drier mouth; the accused would be considered guilty if rice was sticking to their mouths in abundance or if their tongues were severely burned due to lack of shielding from saliva.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Development of forensic science===
[[File:Ambroise Paré.jpg|thumb|[[Ambroise Paré]]'s surgical work laid the groundwork for the development of forensic techniques in the following centuries.]]
In 16th-century Europe, medical practitioners in army and university settings began to gather information on the cause and [[manner of death]]. [[Ambroise Paré]], a French army [[surgery|surgeon]], systematically studied the effects of violent death on internal organs.&lt;ref name=GAB&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive ...|publisher=Basic Books|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0465037186|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xfs8tC8Ow0C&amp;pg=PA79|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723015656/https://books.google.com/books?id=8xfs8tC8Ow0C&amp;pg=PA79|archivedate=23 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Roy|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science|page=805|author2=Lorraine Daston|author3=Katharine Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Italian people|Italian]] surgeons, Fortunato Fidelis and Paolo Zacchia, laid the foundation of modern [[pathology]] by studying changes that occurred in the structure of the body as the result of disease.&lt;ref name=THSC&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suter|first1=Patricia|title=The Hanging of Susanna Cox: The True Story of Pennsylvania's Most Notorious Infanticide and the Legend that Kept it Alive|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=Mechanicsberg|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frLETA3uU08C&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Fortunato+Fidelis+and+Paolo+Zacchia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H-RoU-ytJIi5uATgrIGQCg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Fortunato%20Fidelis%20and%20Paolo%20Zacchia&amp;f=false|author2=Russell D. Earnest|author3=Corinne P. Earnest}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 18th century, writings on these topics began to appear.

As the rational values of the [[Enlightenment era]] increasingly permeated society in the 18th century, criminal investigation became a more evidence-based, rational procedure − the use of torture to force confessions was curtailed, and belief in witchcraft and other powers of the [[occult]] largely ceased to influence the court's decisions. Two examples of English forensic science in individual legal proceedings demonstrate the increasing use of [[logic]] and [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] in criminal investigations at the time. In 1784, in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], John Toms was tried and convicted for murdering Edward Culshaw with a [[pistol]]. When the dead body of Culshaw was examined, a pistol wad (crushed paper used to secure powder and balls in the muzzle) found in his head wound matched perfectly with a torn newspaper found in Toms's pocket, leading to the conviction.&lt;ref name=SW&gt;{{cite book|last=McCrery|first=Nigel|title=Silent Witnesses|publisher=Random House Books|location=London|isbn=9781847946836|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dynVJYcteEkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513220434/https://books.google.com/books?id=dynVJYcteEkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=13 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Warwick]] 1816, a farm laborer was tried and convicted of the murder of a young maidservant. She had been drowned in a shallow pool and bore the marks of violent assault. The police found footprints and an impression from corduroy cloth with a sewn patch in the damp earth near the pool. There were also scattered grains of [[wheat]] and chaff. The breeches of a farm labourer who had been threshing wheat nearby were examined and corresponded exactly to the impression in the earth near the pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science Against Crime|vauthors=Kind S, Overman M |publisher=Doubleday|location=New York City|year=1972|isbn=0-385-09249-0|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxicology and ballistics===
A method for detecting arsenious oxide, simple [[arsenic]], in corpses was devised in 1773 by the Swedish chemist, [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]].&lt;ref name=DPaC&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Suzanne|title=Drugs, Poisons, and Chemistry|publisher=Facts on File|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0816055106|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lq8IvpohnCwC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427082830/https://books.google.com/books?id=lq8IvpohnCwC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=27 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was expanded, in 1806, by German chemist Valentin Ross, who learned to detect the poison in the walls of a victim's stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic Analysis and DNA in Criminal Investigations: INCLUDING COLD CASES SOLVED|last=Parker|first=RJ|publisher=RJ Parker Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781514348369|location=|pages=66|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Marsh test apparatus.jpg|thumb|left|Apparatus for the arsenic test, devised by [[James Marsh (chemist)|James Marsh]].]]
[[James Marsh (chemist)|James Marsh]] was the first to apply this new science to the art of forensics. He was called by the prosecution in a murder trial to give evidence as a chemist in 1832. The defendant, John Bodle, was accused of poisoning his grandfather with arsenic-laced coffee. Marsh performed the standard test by mixing a suspected sample with [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]. While he was able to detect arsenic as yellow [[arsenic trisulfide]], when it was shown to the jury it had deteriorated, allowing the suspect to be acquitted due to reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/technologies/marsh.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007131101/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/technologies/marsh.html |archivedate=7 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annoyed by that, Marsh developed a much better test. He combined a sample containing arsenic with [[sulfuric acid]] and arsenic-free [[zinc]], resulting in [[arsine]] gas. The gas was ignited, and it decomposed to pure metallic arsenic, which, when passed to a cold surface, would appear as a silvery-black deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McMuigan|first=Hugh|title=An Introduction to Chemical Pharmacology|publisher=P.

He first described this test in ''The Edinburgh Philosophical Journal'' in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Account of a method of separating small quantities of arsenic from substances with which it may be mixed|journal=Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal|volume=21|year=1836|pages=229–236|author=James Marsh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FR4AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q=%22detecting%20the%20presence%22&amp;f=false|publisher=A. and C.

Henry Goddard at [[Scotland Yard]] pioneered the use of bullet comparison in 1835. He noticed a flaw in the bullet that killed the victim and was able to trace this back to the mold that was used in the manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.bryant.edu/~ehu/h453proj/forensic1/Ballistics.htm|title=Ballistics|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017052224/http://web.bryant.edu/~ehu/h453proj/forensic1/Ballistics.htm|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropometry===
[[Image:Bertillon - Signalement Anthropometrique.png|right|thumb|150px|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] from [[Alphonse Bertillon|Bertillon's]] ''Identification anthropométrique'' (1893), demonstrating the measurements needed for his anthropometric identification system.]]
The French police officer [[Alphonse Bertillon]] was the first to apply the anthropological technique of [[anthropometry]] to law enforcement, thereby creating an identification system based on physical measurements. Before that time, criminals could only be identified by name or photograph.&lt;ref&gt;As reported in, "A Fingerprint Fable: The Will and William West Case". {{cite web |url=http://www.scafo.org/library/110105.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110105229/http://www.scafo.org/library/110105.html |archivedate=10 November 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirsten Moana Thompson 2007"&gt;Kirsten Moana Thompson, ''Crime Films: Investigating the Scene''. London: Wallflower Press (2007): 10&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with the ''ad hoc'' methods used to identify captured criminals in France in the 1870s, he began his work on developing a reliable system of anthropometrics for human classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|authorlink=Carlo Ginzburg|year=1984|chapter=Morelli, Freud, and Sherlock Holmes: Clues and Scientific Method|page=105|editor1-last=Eco|editor1-first=Umberto|editor1-link=Umberto Eco|editor2-last=Sebeok|editor2-first=Thomas|editor2-link=Thomas Sebeok|title=The Sign of Three: Dupin, Holmes, Peirce|location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=''History Workshop'', Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35235-4|lccn=82049207|oclc=9412985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertillon created many other [[forensics]] techniques, including [[forensic document examination]], the use of [[galvanoplastic]] compounds to preserve [[footprint]]s, [[ballistics]], and the [[dynamometer]], used to determine the degree of force used in [[burglary|breaking and entering]]. Although his central methods were soon to be supplanted by [[fingerprinting]], "his other contributions like the [[mug shot]] and the systematization of crime-scene photography remain in place to this day."&lt;ref name="Kirsten Moana Thompson 2007"/&gt;

===Fingerprints===
Sir [[Sir William Herschel, 2nd Baronet|William Herschel]] was one of the first to advocate the use of fingerprinting in the identification of criminal suspects. While working for the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]], he began to use thumbprints on documents as a security measure to prevent the then-rampant repudiation of signatures in 1858.&lt;ref name="Herschel1916"&gt;{{Cite book|first=William J|last=Herschel|title=The Origin of Finger-Printing|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1916|isbn=978-1-104-66225-7|url=http://galton.org/fingerprints/books/herschel/herschel-1916-origins-1up.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725022215/http://galton.org/fingerprints/books/herschel/herschel-1916-origins-1up.pdf|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fingerprints taken by William James Herschel 1859-1860.jpg|thumb|left|Fingerprints taken by [[William Herschel]] 1859/60.]]
In 1877 at Hooghly (near Kolkata), Herschel instituted the use of fingerprints on contracts and deeds, and he registered government pensioners' fingerprints to prevent the collection of money by relatives after a pensioner's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=William James|last=Herschel|title=Skin furrows of the hand|journal=Nature|volume=23|issue=578|page=76|date=25 November 1880|bibcode=1880Natur..23...76H|doi=10.1038/023076b0|url=http://galton.org/fingerprints/herschel-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615200727/http://galton.org/fingerprints/herschel-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|archivedate=15 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Dr. [[Henry Faulds]], a Scottish surgeon in a [[Tokyo]] hospital, published his first paper on the subject in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', discussing the usefulness of fingerprints for identification and proposing a method to record them with printing ink. He established their first classification and was also the first to identify fingerprints left on a vial.&lt;ref name=faulds1&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.galton.org/fingerprints/faulds-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|last=Faulds|first=Henry|title=On the skin-furrows of the hand|journal=Nature|volume=22|issue=574|page=605|date=28 October 1880|doi=10.1038/022605a0|bibcode=1880Natur..22..605F|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912031154/http://www.galton.org/fingerprints/faulds-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the UK in 1886, he offered the concept to the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London, but it was dismissed at that time.&lt;ref name=reid1&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Donald L.|year=2003|title=Dr. Henry Faulds – Beith Commemorative Society|journal=Journal of Forensic Identification|volume=53|issue=2}} See also this on-line article on Henry Faulds: {{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/fingerprints/faulds.htm#herschel1880|title=Henry Faulds: the Invention of a Fingerprinter|first=Gavan|last=Tredoux|date=December 2003|publisher=galton.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602152655/http://galton.org/fingerprints/faulds.htm#herschel1880|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulds wrote to [[Charles Darwin]] with a description of his method, but, too old and ill to work on it, Darwin gave the information to his cousin, [[Francis Galton]], who was interested in anthropology. Having been thus inspired to study fingerprints for ten years, Galton published a detailed statistical model of fingerprint analysis and identification and encouraged its use in forensic science in his book ''Finger Prints''. He had calculated that the chance of a "false positive" (two different individuals having the same fingerprints) was about 1 in 64 billion.&lt;ref name=galtonfps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clpex.com/Information/Pioneers/galton-1892-fingerprints-lowres.pdf|last=Galton|first=Francis|year=1892|title=Finger Prints|location=London|publisher=MacMillan and Co|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012152917/http://www.clpex.com/Information/Pioneers/galton-1892-fingerprints-lowres.pdf|archivedate=12 October 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fingerprinting 1928.jpg|thumb|Women clerical employees of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LA Police Department]] getting [[fingerprint]]ed and photographed in 1928.]]
[[Juan Vucetich]], an Argentine chief police officer, created the first method of recording the fingerprints of individuals on file. In 1892, after studying Galton's pattern types, Vucetich set up the world's first fingerprint bureau. In that same year, Francisca Rojas of [[Necochea]] was found in a house with neck injuries whilst her two sons were found dead with their throats cut. Rojas accused a neighbour, but despite brutal interrogation, this neighbour would not confess to the crimes. Inspector Alvarez, a colleague of Vucetich, went to the scene and found a bloody thumb mark on a door. When it was compared with Rojas' prints, it was found to be identical with her right thumb. She then confessed to the murder of her sons.

A Fingerprint Bureau was established in Calcutta ([[Kolkata]]), India, in 1897, after the Council of the Governor General approved a committee report that fingerprints should be used for the classification of criminal records. Working in the Calcutta Anthropometric Bureau, before it became the Fingerprint Bureau, were [[Azizul Haque (police officer)|Azizul Haque]] and [[Hem Chandra Bose]]. Haque and Bose were Indian fingerprint experts who have been credited with the primary development of a fingerprint classification system eventually named after their supervisor, [[Edward Henry|Sir Edward Richard Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tewari|first1=RK|last2=Ravikumar|first2=KV|title=History and development of forensic science in India|journal=J Postgrad Med|year=2000|issue=46|pages=303–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jan102005/185.pdf|first1=J.S.|last1=Sodhi|first2=asjeed|last2=Kaur|title=The forgotten Indian pioneers of finger print science|journal=Current Science|year=2005|volume=88|issue=1|pages=185–191|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208112115/http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jan102005/185.pdf|archivedate=8 February 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Henry Classification System]], co-devised by Haque and Bose, was accepted in England and Wales when the first United Kingdom Fingerprint Bureau was founded in [[Scotland Yard]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] headquarters, London, in 1901. Sir Edward Richard Henry subsequently achieved improvements in dactyloscopy.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the United States, Dr. Henry P. DeForrest used fingerprinting in the [[New York Police Department|New York Civil Service]] in 1902, and by December 1905, [[New York City Police Department]] Deputy Commissioner Joseph A. Faurot, an expert in the [[Alphonse Bertillon|Bertillon]] system and a fingerprint advocate at Police Headquarters, introduced the fingerprinting of criminals to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to U.S. 23 Dec 1905 New York – The City Record Volume 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uhlenhuth test===
The [[Uhlenhuth test]], or the antigen–antibody [[precipitin]] test for species, was invented by [[Paul Uhlenhuth]] in 1901 and could distinguish human [[blood]] from animal blood, based on the discovery that the blood of different species had one or more characteristic proteins. The test represented a major breakthrough and came to have tremendous importance in forensic science.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurland, ''Irrefutable Evidence: A History of Forensic Science'' (p. 200), Dee, 2009, {{ISBN|9781461662396}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test was further refined for forensic use by the Swiss chemist Maurice Müller in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Inman, Norah Rudin, ''Principles and Practice of Criminalistics: The Profession of Forensic Science'' (p. 32), CRC Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA===
Forensic [[DNA profiling|DNA analysis]] was first used in 1984. It was developed by Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]], who realized that variation in the genetic code could be used to identify individuals and to tell individuals apart from one another. The first application of DNA profiles was used by Jefferys in a double murder mystery in the small English town of [[Narborough, Leicestershire]] in 1985. A 15-year-old school girl by the name of Lynda Mann was raped and murdered in Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital. The police did not find a suspect but were able to obtain a semen sample.

In 1986, Dawn Ashworth, 15 years old, was also raped and strangled in a nearby village of [[Enderby, Leicestershire|Enderby]]. Forensic evidence showed that both killers had the same blood type. Richard Buckland became the suspect because he worked at Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital, had been spotted near Dawn Ashworth's murder scene and knew unreleased details about the body. He later confessed to Dawn's murder but not Lynda's.  Jefferys was brought into the case to analyze the semen samples. He concluded that there was no match between the samples and Buckland, who became the first person to be exonerated using DNA. Jefferys confirmed that the DNA profiles were identical for the two murder semen samples. To find the perpetrator, DNA samples from the entire male population, more than 4,000 aged from 17 to 34, of the town were collected. They all were compared to semen samples from the crime.  A friend of [[Colin Pitchfork]] was heard saying that he had given his sample to the police claiming to be Colin. Colin Pitchfork was arrested in 1987 and it was found that his DNA profile matched the semen samples from the murder.

Because of this case, DNA databases were developed. There is the national (FBI) and international databases as well as the European countries (ENFSI : European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). These searchable databases are used to match crime scene DNA profiles to those already in a database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploreforensics.co.uk/forensic-cases-colin-pitchfork-first-exoneration-through-dna.html|title=Forensic Cases: Colin Pitchfork, First Exoneration Through DNA|website=www.exploreforensics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maturation===
[[File:JacktheRipperPuck.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cartoon of a man holding a bloody knife looking contemptuously at a display of half-a-dozen supposed and dissimilar likenesses|Police brought to bear the latest techniques of forensic science in their attempts to identify and capture the serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]].]]
By the turn of the 20th century, the science of forensics had become largely established in the sphere of criminal investigation. Scientific and surgical investigation was widely employed by the [[Metropolitan Police]] during their pursuit of the mysterious [[Jack the Ripper]], who had killed a number of [[prostitute]]s in the 1880s. This case is a watershed in the application of forensic science. Large teams of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries throughout Whitechapel. Forensic material was collected and examined. Suspects were identified, traced and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry. Police work follows the same pattern today.&lt;ref name=canter12&gt;[[David Canter|Canter, David]] (1994), ''Criminal Shadows: Inside the Mind of the Serial Killer'', London: HarperCollins, pp. 12–13, {{ISBN|0-00-255215-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2000 people were interviewed, "upwards of 300" people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.&lt;ref&gt;Inspector [[Donald Swanson]]'s report to the Home Office, {{Nowrap|19 October}} 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 205; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 113; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation was initially conducted by the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID), headed by Detective Inspector [[Edmund Reid]]. Later, Detective Inspectors [[Frederick Abberline]], [[Henry Moore (police officer)|Henry Moore]], and [[Walter Simon Andrews|Walter Andrews]] were sent from Central Office at [[Scotland Yard]] to assist. Initially, butchers, surgeons and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations. The alibis of local butchers and slaughterers were investigated, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Inspector Donald Swanson's report to the [[Home Office]], {{Nowrap|19 October}} 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 206 and Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary figures thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the [[London Docks]],&lt;ref&gt;Marriott, John, "The Imaginative Geography of the Whitechapel murders", in Werner, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, p. 93; ''Daily Telegraph'', {{Nowrap|10 November}} 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; The cattle boats were examined, but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements, and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Anderson to Home Office, {{Nowrap|10 January}} 1889, 144/221/A49301C ff. 235–6, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October, Robert Anderson asked police surgeon [[Thomas Bond (British physician)|Thomas Bond]] to give his opinion on the extent of the murderer's surgical skill and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 186–187; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 359–360&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion offered by Bond on the character of the "Whitechapel murderer" is the earliest surviving [[Offender profiling|offender profile]].&lt;ref name=canter5&gt;Canter, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; Bond's assessment was based on his own examination of the most extensively mutilated victim and the [[Autopsy|post mortem]] notes from the four previous canonical murders.&lt;ref name=bond&gt;Letter from Thomas Bond to Robert Anderson, {{Nowrap|10 November}} 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 360–362 and Rumbelow, pp. 145–147&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to "periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic [[mania]]", with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating "[[satyriasis]]".&lt;ref name=bond/&gt; Bond also stated that "the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease but I do not think either hypothesis is likely".&lt;ref name=bond/&gt;

[[File:Abbe-03.jpg|thumb|left|The popular fictional character [[Sherlock Holmes]] was in many ways ahead of his time in his use of forensic analysis.]]
''Handbook for Coroners, police officials, military policemen'' was written by the [[Austrians|Austrian]] criminal jurist [[Hans Gross]] in 1893, and is generally acknowledged as the birth of the field of criminalistics. The work combined in one system fields of knowledge that had not been previously integrated, such as psychology and physical science, and which could be successfully used against crime. Gross adapted some fields to the needs of criminal investigation, such as [[crime scene photography]]. He went on to found the Institute of Criminalistics in 1912, as part of the University of Graz' Law School. This Institute was followed by many similar institutes all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Martin|title=Otto Gross, Freudian Psychoanalyst, 1877–1920|publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press]]|year=1999|location=Lampeter,|isbn=0-7734-8164-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Archibald Reiss]] founded the ''Institut de police scientifique'' of the [[University of Lausanne|University of Lausanne (UNIL)]], the first school of forensic science in the world. Dr. [[Edmond Locard]], became known as the "[[Sherlock Holmes]] of [[France]]". He formulated the basic principle of forensic science: "Every contact leaves a trace", which became known as [[Locard's exchange principle]]. In 1910, he founded what may have been the first criminal laboratory in the world, after persuading the Police Department of [[Lyon]] (France) to give him two attic rooms and two assistants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3210/3210lect02.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206090107/http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3210/3210lect02.htm|date=6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic of the new found prestige of forensics and the use of reasoning in detective work was the popularity of the fictional character [[Sherlock Holmes]], written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in the late 19th century. He remains a great inspiration for forensic science, especially for the way his acute study of a crime scene yielded small clues as to the precise sequence of events. He made great use of [[trace evidence]] such as shoe and tire impressions, as well as fingerprints, [[ballistics]] and handwriting analysis, now known as [[questioned document examination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yMDWLq2FdrIC|title=Oxford studies in epistemology|editors=Tamar Szabo Gendler and John Hawthorne|author=Alexander Bird |chapter=Abductive Knowledge and Holmesian Inference |page=11 |isbn=978-0-19-928590-7 |date=27 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such evidence is used to test theories conceived by the police, for example, or by the investigator himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia Sherlockiana |author=Matthew Bunson |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aSgfAQAAIAAJ |page=50 |isbn=978-0-671-79826-0 |date=19 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the techniques advocated by Holmes later became reality, but were generally in their infancy at the time Conan Doyle was writing. In many of his reported cases, Holmes frequently complains of the way the crime scene has been contaminated by others, especially by the police, emphasising the critical importance of maintaining its integrity, a now well-known feature of crime scene examination. He used [[analytical chemistry]] for [[blood residue]] analysis as well as [[toxicology]] examination and determination for poisons. He used [[ballistics]] by measuring bullet [[caliber|calibres]] and matching them with a suspected murder weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fact and feeling: Baconian science and the nineteenth-Century literary imagination |page=214 |author=Jonathan Smith |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hFn1Zx_desIC |isbn=978-0-299-14354-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late 19th – early 20th centuries figures===
Hans Gross applied scientific methods to crime scenes and was responsible for the birth of criminalistics.

Edmund Locard expanded on Gross' work with Locard's Exchange Principle which stated "whenever two objects come into contact with one another, materials are exchanged between them". This means that every contact by a criminal leaves a trace. Locard was also known as the "Sherlock Holmes of France".

Alexander Lacassagne, who taught Locard, produced autopsy standards on actual forensic cases.

Alphonse Bertillon was a French criminologist and founder of Anthropometry (scientific study of measurements and proportions of the human body). He used anthropometry for identification, saying each individual is unique and by measuring aspect of physical difference, there could be a personal identification system. He created the Bertillon System around 1879, which was a way to identify criminals and citizens by measuring 20 parts of the body. In 1884, there was over 240 repeat offenders caught through the Bertillon system. Fingerprinting became more reliable than the Bertillon system.

Frances Glessner Lee, known as "the mother of forensic science,"&lt;ref&gt;https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/nutshells&lt;/ref&gt; was instrumental in the development of forensic science in the US. She lobbied to have coroners replaced by medical professionals, endowed the Harvard Associates in Police Science, and conducted many seminars to educate homicide investigators. She also created the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, intricate crime scene dioramas used to train investigators. They are still in use today.

===20th century===
[[File:Alec Jeffreys -2008.jpg|thumb|[[Alec Jeffreys]] invented the [[DNA profiling]] technique in 1984.]]
Later in the 20th century several British pathologists, [[Mikey Rochman]], [[Francis Camps]], [[Sydney Smith (forensic expert)|Sydney Smith]] and [[Keith Simpson (professor)|Keith Simpson]] pioneered new forensic science methods. [[Alec Jeffreys]] pioneered the use of [[DNA profiling]] in forensic science in 1984. He realized the scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the [[genetic code]] to identify individuals. The method has since become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes.&lt;ref name="welcome 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |title=Discovering DNA fingerprinting:  Sir Alec Jeffreys describes its development |publisher=[[Wellcome Trust]] |date=4 February 2004 |first=Giles |last=Newton |accessdate=23 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFbTpIUx?url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |archivedate=15 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA fingerprinting was first used as a police forensic test to identify the rapist and killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who were both murdered in [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1983 and 1986 respectively. [[Colin Pitchfork]] was identified and convicted of murder after samples taken from him matched [[semen]] samples taken from the two dead girls.

Forensic science has been fostered by a number of national forensic science learned bodies including the [[Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csofs.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609094436/http://www.csofs.org/|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 1959), then known as the Forensic Science Society, publisher of ''[[Science &amp; Justice]]'';.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csofs.org/publications |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615161534/http://www.csofs.org/Publications |archivedate=15 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Academy of Forensic Sciences]] (founded 1948), publishers of the ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafs.org/journal-forensic-sciences ''Journal of Forensic Sciences''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123140138/http://www.aafs.org/journal-forensic-sciences |date=23 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Canadian Society of Forensic Science]] (founded 1953), publishers of the ''[[Journal of the Canadian Society of Forensic Science]]''; the British Academy of Forensic Sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/|title=The British Academy of Forensic Sciences|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627092734/http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/|archivedate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 1960), publishers of ''[[Medicine, Science and the Law]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/journal|title=Medicine, Science and the Law|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627111139/http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/journal|archivedate=27 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences]] (founded 1967), publishers of the ''Australian Journal of Forensic Sciences''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''[http://www.isasi.org/Documents/Hawkins%20-%20Using%20a%20drone%20and%20photogrammetry%20software%20V4%20(PAPER).pdf Using a Drone and Photogrammetry Software to Create Orthomosaic Images and 3D Models of Aircraft Accident Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113120441/http://www.isasi.org/Documents/Hawkins%20-%20Using%20a%20drone%20and%20photogrammetry%20software%20V4%20(PAPER).pdf |date=13 January 2017 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===
In the past decade, documenting forensics scenes has become more efficient. People started using laser scanners, drones and photogrammetry to obtain 3D point clouds of accidents or crime scenes. Reconstruction of an accident scene on a highway using drones involves data acquisition time of only 10–20 minutes and can be performed without shutting down traffic.The results are not just accurate, in centimeters, for measurement to be presented  in court but also easy to digitally preserve in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.isasi.org/Documents/Hawkins%20-%20Using%20a%20drone%20and%20photogrammetry%20software%20V4%20(PAPER).pdf|title=Using a Drone and Photogrammetry Software to Create Orthomosaic Images and 3D Models of Aircraft Accident Sites|last=Hawkins|first=Stuart|date=November 2016|work=UK AAIB|access-date=4 February 2017|via=International Society of Air Safety Investigators|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113120441/http://www.isasi.org/Documents/Hawkins%20-%20Using%20a%20drone%20and%20photogrammetry%20software%20V4%20(PAPER).pdf|archivedate=13 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Questionable techniques ==
Some forensic techniques, believed to be scientifically sound at the time they were used, have turned out later to have much less scientific merit or none.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Annual Review of Law and Social Science |volume=4 |pages=149–171 |doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172303 |first1=Michael J. |last1=Saks |first2=David L. |last2=Faigman |year=2008 |title= Failed forensics: how forensic science lost its way and how it might yet find it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some such techniques include:
* [[Comparative bullet-lead analysis]] was used by the FBI for over four decades, starting with the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] in 1963.  The theory was that each batch of [[ammunition]] possessed a chemical makeup so distinct that a bullet could be traced back to a particular batch or even a specific box.  Internal studies and an outside study by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] found that the technique was unreliable due to improper interpretation, and the FBI abandoned the test in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/17/AR2007111701681.html|title= FBI's Forensic Test Full of Holes|first= John|last= Solomon|work= [[The Washington Post]]|page= A1|date= 18 November 2007|accessdate= 2008-03-05|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080725232846/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/17/AR2007111701681.html|archivedate= 25 July 2008|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, research has suggested that public misperceptions about criminal forensics can create, in the mind of a [[juror]], unrealistic expectations of forensic evidence—which they expect to see before convicting—implicitly biasing the juror towards the defendant.

Questions about certain areas of forensic science, such as fingerprint evidence and the assumptions behind these disciplines have been brought to light in some publications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=18 February 2009| title='Badly Fragmented' Forensic Science System Needs Overhaul| publisher=The National Academies| url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12589| accessdate=2009-03-09| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826234749/http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12589| archivedate=26 August 2009| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=18 February 2009| title=National Academy of Sciences Finds 'Serious Deficiencies' in Nation's Crime Labs| publisher=National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers| url=http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/newsreleases/2009mn06?OpenDocument| accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the ''New York Post''.&lt;ref name=ForensicChallenge&gt;{{cite web| date=6 March 2009| title=CSI: Without a clue; A new report forces Police and Judges to rethink forensic science| author=Katherine Ramsland| work=[[The New York Post]], PostScript| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03072009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/csi__without_a_clue_158464.htm| accessdate=2009-03-07| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310062628/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03072009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/csi__without_a_clue_158464.htm| archivedate=10 March 2009| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that "No one has proved even the basic assumption: That everyone's fingerprint is unique."&lt;ref name=ForensicChallenge /&gt; The article also stated that "Now such assumptions are being questioned – and with it may come a radical change in how forensic science is used by police departments and prosecutors."&lt;ref name=ForensicChallenge /&gt; Law professor Jessica Gabel said on NOVA that forensic science "lacks the rigors, the standards, the quality controls and procedures that we find, usually, in science."&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Gabel, lawyer and lecturer from NOVA [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/forensics-on-trial.html "Forensics on Trial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627214550/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/forensics-on-trial.html |date=27 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, on 25 June 2009, the Supreme Court issued a 5-to-4 decision in ''[[Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts]]'' stating that crime laboratory reports may not be used against criminal defendants at trial unless the analysts responsible for creating them give testimony and subject themselves to cross-examination.  The Supreme Court cited the National Academies report ''Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12589 |title=Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527111020/http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12589 |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their decision. Writing for the majority, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] referred to the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report in his assertion that "Forensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation."

In 2009, scientists indicated that it is possible to fabricate DNA evidence, therefore suggesting it is possible to falsely accuse or acquit a person or persons using forged evidence.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt;

In America, another area of forensic science that has come under question in recent years is the lack of laws requiring the accreditation of forensic labs.  Some states require accreditation, but some states do not.  Because of this, many labs have been caught performing very poor work resulting in false convictions or acquittals.  For example, it was discovered after an audit of the Houston Police Department in 2002 that the lab had fabricated evidence which led George Rodriguez being convicted of raping a fourteen-year-old girl.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/us/new-doubt-cast-on-testing-in-houston-police-crime-lab.html|title = New Doubt Cast on Testing in Houston Police Crime Lab|date = 5 August 2004|accessdate = 24 October 2014|website = |publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031000519/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/us/new-doubt-cast-on-testing-in-houston-police-crime-lab.html|archivedate = 31 October 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former director of the lab, when asked, said that the total number of cases that could have been contaminated by improper work could be in the range of 5,000 to 10,000.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;  This could have been avoided if the lab had been accredited by organizations such as ASCLD/Lab, which require crime labs to undergo rigorous assessments to show that they are able to perform multiple tests accurately.  Once they become accredited, they are periodically re-evaluated to ensure that the lab is still functioning at its best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ascld-lab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Why-become-an-acredited-lab.pdf|title = Why become an Accredited Laboratory?|date = |accessdate = 20 October 2014|website = American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors / Laboratory Accreditation Board|publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141025053645/http://www.ascld-lab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Why-become-an-acredited-lab.pdf|archivedate = 25 October 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Periodic evaluations of a lab's performance by an independent organization will help to prevent scandals from occurring in forensic science laboratories.

Although forensic science has greatly enhanced the investigator's ability to solve crimes, it has limitations and must be scrutinized in and out of the courtroom to avoid the occurrence of wrongful convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=21 August 2012| title=How body parts evidence gets from crime scene to courtroom| author=Fabiola Carletti| publisher=[[CBC News]], PostScript| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/08/20/f-body-parts-investigation-breakdown.html| accessdate=2012-08-21| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821205039/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/08/20/f-body-parts-investigation-breakdown.html| archivedate=21 August 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have discovered a difference in rape related injury reporting based on race, with white victims reporting a higher frequency of injuries than black victims.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baker RB, Fargo JD, Shambley-Ebron D, Sommers MS. A source of healthcare disparity: Race, skin color, and injuries after rape among adolescents and young adults. Journal of Forensic Nursing, 2010; 6: 144-150&lt;/ref&gt; However, since current forensic examination techniques may not be sensitive to all injuries across a range of skin colors, more research needs to be conducted to understand if this trend is due to skin confounding healthcare providers when examining injuries or if darker skin extends a protective element.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In clinical practice, for patients with darker skin, one study recommends that attention must be paid to the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette and fossa navicularis, so that no rape related injuries are missed upon close examination.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Forensic science and humanitarian work ==
The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) uses forensic science for humanitarian purposes to clarify the fate of missing persons after armed conflict, disasters or migration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/what-we-do/forensic/index.jsp |title=Forensic science and humanitarian action |publisher=ICRC |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707145212/http://www.icrc.org/eng/what-we-do/forensic/index.jsp |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the services related to [[Restoring Family Links]] and Missing Persons. Knowing what has happened to a missing relative can often make it easier to proceed with the grieving process and move on with life for families of missing persons.

Forensic science is used by various other organizations to clarify the fate and whereabouts of persons who have gone missing. Examples include the NGO [[Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team]], working to clarify the fate of people who disappeared during the period of the 1976–1983 military dictatorship. The [[International Commission on Missing Persons]] (ICMP) uses forensic science to find missing persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Forensic archeology and anthropology |url=http://www.ic-mp.org/activities/technical-assistance/?page_id=539 |title=Forensic archeology and anthropology |publisher=Ic-mp.org |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624073824/http://www.ic-mp.org/activities/technical-assistance/?page_id=539 |archivedate=24 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example after the conflicts in the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic-mp.org/icmp-worldwide/southeast-europe/ |title=Southeast Europe |publisher=Ic-mp.org |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813081559/http://www.ic-mp.org/icmp-worldwide/southeast-europe/ |archivedate=13 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognising the role of forensic science for humanitarian purposes, as well as the importance of forensic investigations in fulfilling the state's responsibilities to investigate human rights violations, a group of experts in the late-1980's devised a UN Manual on the Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, which became known as the [[Minnesota Protocol]]. This document was revised and re-published by the [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Executions/MinnesotaProtocolInvestigationPotentiallyUnlawfulDeath2016.pdf |title=Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016) |accessdate=2017-06-30 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer graphics]], a '''fragment''' is the data necessary to generate a single [[pixel]]'s worth of a drawing primitive in the [[frame buffer]].  

This data may include, but is not limited to:
* [[Raster graphics|raster position]]
* [[Z-buffering|depth]]
* interpolated attributes (color, [[Texture mapping|texture coordinates]], etc.)
* [[Stencil buffer|stencil]]
* [[Alpha compositing|alpha]]
* window ID

As a scene is drawn, drawing primitives (the basic elements of graphics output, such as points, lines, circles, text etc. &lt;ref&gt;[http://baikalweb.jinr.ru/doc/cern_doc/asdoc/gks_html3/node28.html The Drawing Primitives by Janne Saarela ]&lt;/ref&gt; ) are [[Rasterisation|rasterized]] into fragments which are textured and combined with the existing frame buffer. How a fragment is combined with the data already in the frame buffer depends on various settings. In a typical case, a fragment may be discarded if it is farther away than the pixel that is already at that location (according to the [[depth buffer]]). If it is nearer than the existing pixel, it may replace what is already there, or, if [[alpha blending]] is in use, the pixel's color may be replaced with a mixture of the fragment's color and the pixel's existing color, as in the case of drawing a translucent object.

In general, a fragment can be thought of as the data needed to [[Shader|shade]] the pixel, plus the data needed to test whether the fragment survives to become a pixel (depth, alpha, stencil, scissor, window ID, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9304">The '''Graphics Interface''' (GI) conference is the oldest continuously scheduled conference devoted to [[computer graphics]], and [[human–computer interaction]]. GI was held biannually between 1969 and 1981, and has been held annually since then. Prior to 1982, the conference was called Canadian Man-Computer Communications Conference (CMCCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Graphics Interface Conferences | url=http://www.graphicsinterface.org/| publisher=[[Canadian Human-Computer Communications Society]] | year=2012 | accessdate=9 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Microsoft Academic Search on Graphics Interface Conference | url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Conference/1032/gi-graphics-interface| publisher=[[Microsoft]] | year=2012 | accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conference is sponsored by the Canadian Human–Computer Communications Society.  The conference has a tradition of being co-located with the [[Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence]] (AI), and the Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV), which was formerly known as Vision Interface (VI).

== Awards ==

The Canadian Human–Computer Communications Society honours the memory of Michael A. J. Sweeney through an annual award to the best student paper presented at each year's Graphics Interface conference. 

[[Alain Fournier]] &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Alain Fournier Ph.D. Dissertation Award| url=http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~poulin/fournier/memorial.fund.html| year=2012 | accessdate=9 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill Buxton]] &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Bill Buxton PhD Dissertation Award | url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~ksbooth/gi/archive/HCIaward.html| year=2012 | accessdate=9 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ph.D. Dissertation Annual Awards are given to best dissertations in Computer Graphics and Human-Computer Interaction defended in a Canadian University, and are announced officially during the Graphics Interface conference.

'''Information Communications Technology''' is usually included in the Home Economics and Livelihood Education program in grade school and taught through the Technology and Home Economics program&lt;ref name="intro1"&gt;Cajilig 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; in high school.
 
The recent status of ICT education in the Philippines, along with other Southeast Asian countries, was surveyed by the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) in 2011. Using the UNESCO model of ICT Development in Education, the countries were ranked as Emerging, Applying, Infusing or Transforming. The Philippines (with Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam) were ranked at the Infusing stage of integrating ICT in education, indicating that the country has integrated ICT into existing teaching, learning and administrative practices and policies. This includes components such as a national vision of ICT in education, national ICT plans and policies, complementary national ICT and education policies, professional development for teachers and school leaders, community or partnership and teaching and learning pedagogies.&lt;ref name="intro2"&gt;Maftuh 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study reported that public high schools in Metro Manila had a computer to student ratio of 1:63. While 88 percent of schools have internet connections, half of the students claimed not to be using it.&lt;ref name="intro3"&gt;Manaligod 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==
=== Early modernization efforts ===
In 1996, the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] initialized a 10-year modernization program, which included a computerization project and the School of the Future project. The modernization project aimed to implement information technology in the improvement of teaching and learning processes, as well as in educational management and operations. This project was supported by numerous other government agencies and private sectors.&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;Perez 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Three-fourths of its budget of [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 375 million was used on hardware and software procurement, while the remaining quarter on staff training on [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]. The modernization program also established a Center of Education and Technology (CET) whose main purpose was the development and production of multimedia instruction materials, hardware, software and training of DECS personnel. An additional of [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 300 million was allocated in 1997 to computerize 97 state universities and colleges and another [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 210 million was allocated in 1999 to equip 325 schools with computers and train 4000 teachers.&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;Rodrigo 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project Cares ===
In March 2001, The Senate of Committee on Education launched ''Project Cares,'' designed to improve upon the current public elementary and secondary school educational systems through the use and application of ICT. It provided public and district school offices with computer-based management and operation support tools that aimed to make the school more efficient and productive with their work.&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;
 
To improve upon the number and quality of skill of ICT professionals, both the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] contemplated laws to make public and private institutions incorporate ICT into their curriculum at all levels of education.&lt;ref name="history3"&gt;Wallet 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those plans proposed to improve ICT in the Philippines were tax incentives to encourage private companies to donate computer equipment to schools or research institutions and a bill that would have mandated the installation of computer equipment on all public schools.

=== Other non-government efforts ===
Other non-government organizations such as Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP) have expressed the need for ICT education as well. The group formulated a portfolio of project proposals to build schools that would be focused on ICT personnel training and software development. Companies would review the portfolio and select the projects that they would want to fund. One of the projects, entitled "Computer Laboratories Program for Secondary Schools", sought to provide computer laboratories in at least 50 public and private high schools. This initiative produced numerous ICT experts from various schools and equipped institutions with the proper equipment.&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;

=== Recent development ===
In 2011, the Department of Education implemented the ''Enhanced Basic Education Information System'', an online facility for encoding, storage and report generation of all school information such as enrolment, resource inventories and special programs.&lt;ref name="history4"&gt;"DepEd capitalizes on ICT programs for education stakeholder," 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It was to create an online and automated system of gathering data to provide the department with more relevant and accurate information for decision making and planning. With this improved system, it aims to improve budget allocations in the Philippines, providing more schools with more equipment. 

=== ICT on K-12 Program ===
In 2012, The Department of Education and the United States Agency for International Development undertook a review on the computer accessibility in public schools as well as the past and ongoing ICT projects being implemented there. They aimed to improve upon those projects with regard to the new educational curriculum. The DepEd Computerization program has been implemented which deployed computer packages to 5409 public elementary and high schools to support the teaching and learning process.&lt;ref name="history5"&gt;Ronda, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the K-12 Program, ICT is a strand subsumed under the Technology and Livelihood Education (TLE) and Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL), which is one of the four tracks under the Senior High School Specialized Subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spideylab.com/senior-high-school-tle-tvl-curriculum-guides-2017/|title=K to 12: Senior High School TLE and TVL Track Curriculum Guides 2017|date=2017-05-18|work=SpideyLab|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This track also includes Agri-Fishery Arts, Home Economics, Industrial Arts, and TVL Maritime professional strands. A senior high school student can specialize in ICT or any of these strands and will receive a certificate that could be used for employment or a basis for further college education upon completion.

The ICT strand allows students to learn writing computer programs, digital illustration, and website design/development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edukasyon.ph/courses/senior-high-tracks/tvl/ict-information-and-communications-technology-strand|title=Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Strand - Senior High School {{!}} Edukasyon PH|website=www.edukasyon.ph|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students also take up technical drafting, animation, and Java programming, which are expected to equip students with the skills necessary to succeed in the creative technological field. Other subjects in the strand include medical transcription and telecom installation, which could be useful to students planning to work for the telecommunications industry or further study a bachelor's degree related to it.

== Curricula ==
=== NSEC (1989–2002) ===
As of 1989, the New Secondary Education Curriculum (NSEC) was implemented under the 1989 Secondary Education Development Program (SEDP). Though its aim is to make it a technology-oriented curriculum, no basic computer technology courses are part of the general education yet. However, there were already technical schools, college and universities offering vocational and technical courses in computer technology -- ranging from 5 months to 3 years.&lt;ref name="curriculum2 267"&gt;Camarao 1991, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Secondary education ====
Some of the common courses related to ICT include the following (as of 1991):&lt;ref name="curriculum2 268-274"&gt;Camarao 1991, pp.268-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Three-Year Computer Technology course

A course for computer technicians, its curriculum discusses technology education in trades and industries. This course is designed to train graduates in the construction and operation of computers, electronic circuits, computer circuit analysis, troubleshooting and servicing of computer hardware, facility in computer language for scientific problem solving, data processing and other application. This course includes two summers of on-the-job training such that the student can be immersed in the computer industry. Completion of the course yields a diploma in Computer Technology.

* Three-Year Computer Engineering Technology course

A relatively new program in computer education during its time, this course was designed to produce computer engineering technicians proficient in computer hardware and software technologies, similar to the three-year computer technology course. After completing this course, graduates are awarded a diploma in Computer Engineering Technology. This three-year program gives the graduate two options: to either complete a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering or seek employment as a computer technician.

==== Undergraduate degree programs ====
* Bachelor of Technology (Major in Computer Technology)
Designed to train computer technologists who are proficient in the assembly, maintenance and servicing of computer hardware, and in computer software; this program expects to help supply the computer industry with proficient upper-level technical and management workers in computer production and maintenance services. Students admitted to this program are graduates of the three-year Industrial Technology/Technician course, major in computer technology and who have at least a minimum of two years work experience in the computer industry.

* Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS)
This degree program aims to create highly proficient computer professionals. This curriculum consists of a balance between general education and technical courses in computers designed to provide professional training in the languages of the computers and in designing systems. The graduates are expected to be able to use each of the computer languages and software in solving problems that need to be computerized. Graduates are trained and required to be able to develop their own software.

* Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Science (BSCIS)

* Trainers Training Program (Computer Software)
Taking from one to six weeks, this course is designed for computer teachers or for computer professionals who are already teaching. This course includes basic computer fundamentals, teaching principles, techniques, and practicum in the design of training materials, machine problems, and exercises. 

* Bachelor of Technician Teacher Education
This program provides teaching competence. Considering the necessity to integrate computer education in all levels of the educational system, a teaching training program in computer education should be considered.

=== BEC (2002–2010) ===
The premise of the new curriculum was an attempt to improve upon the existing curriculum (which was NSEC). Like the previous curriculum, it included Filipino, English, math and science; BEC includes the [[Makabayan]]. There were numerous rationales behind the revision of the curriculum to include the M''akabayan''. One of the notable rationales with respect to the addition of computer technology is as follows: “... to increase each individual’s ability to cope in the fast-changing world. Likewise, to increase the time allotted for science, math, engineering, and to connect these subjects to the related areas.”&lt;ref name="curriculum1 151"&gt;Valisno 2012, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the primary level, technology was not yet part of the curriculum. However, BEC includes the technology and livelihood education (TLE) at the secondary level, with 6 hours and 40 minutes devoted to the subject every week.&lt;ref name="curriculum1 153-154"&gt;Valisno 2012, pp. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== K-12 (2012–present) ===
Similar to BEC’s implementation of the TLE, it is available after primary education (TLE starts at Grade 7). Exploratory Subjects are at 40 hours per quarter during Grades 7-8, while specializations are taken from Grades 9-12.

A sample list of courses for specializations in Information and Communications Technology is provided as follows:
* Animation - 320 hours
* Computer Programming (.NET Technology) - 320 hours
* Computer Programming (Java) - 320 hours
* Computer Programming (Oracle Database) - 320 hours 
* Computer Systems Servicing - 640 hours
* Contact Center Services - 320 hours
* Illustration - 320 hours
* Medical Transcription - 320 hours
* Technical Drafting - 320 hours
* Broadband Installation (Fixed Wireless Systems) - 160 hours (Prerequisite: Computer Systems Servicing)
* Telecom OSP and Subscriber Line Installation (Copper Cable/POTS and DSL) - 320 hours (Prerequisite: Computer Systems Servicing)
* Telecom OSP Installation (Fiber Optic Cable) - 160 hours (Prerequisite: Computer Systems Servicing)

== Policies and government projects ==

The Philippine government especially the Department of Education and Department of Science and Technology has forwarded ICT educations through policies and projects. The Restructured Basic Education Curriculum which aimed to implement an interactive curriculum was launched in 2002. It aimed to integrate technology in instruction and in education, with great emphasis on computer literacy. To engage the private sector, The Act of 1998 (R.A. 8525) was passed to generate participation of companies. This was done in order to upgrade and modernize public schools, especially in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]]. The program led to 110 public high schools receiving computers in 1996 under the DOST Engineering Science Education Project (ESEP). An additional 68 public high schools were recipients under the DOST Computer Literacy Program. Annually, DOST continues to allocate [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 20,000,000 (US$ 400,000) to support buying computers in school. In 2002 and 2003, 125 public high schools were to be provided with 10 to 15 computers along with the corresponding teacher training programs.&lt;ref name="policies1"&gt;Bonifacio 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology centres in each [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]] were set up as centres of excellence in information technology, crossing traditional boundaries, were established in order to focus on the needs of a greater number of learners. The centres were provided with computer laboratories fully equipped with printers, peripherals, projectors and air-conditioning units. Teacher training was also a component that was focused on. Funds were provided by the Philippine government for the first year of operation, while local government units were expected to continue the funding and maintenance.&lt;ref name="policies1"/&gt;

Furthermore, the Department of Education has come up with programs to improve ICT education through streamline data collection. The department has also laid down rules and procedures that schools may follow to enhance ICT Education in the country. Schools are required to go through certain steps to acquire these.

The Learners' Information Systems (LIS) and Enhanced Basic Education Information Systems (EBEIS) are programs created by the Department of Education to help in the data gathering for current enrollees and available facilities in schools respectively. The Learning Resources Management and Development System (LRDMS) was implemented in order to support increased distribution and access to learning and teaching resources. The DepEd Computerization Program (DCP) was implemented to help schools participate in ICT-related programs.

=== Learners' Information System ===
The LIS is an online facility implemented by DepEd that records all registered students in public schools. This program was able to optimize the collecting data of registered public students and reduced the data collection time from 10 months to 3 months.&lt;ref name="deped1"&gt;"DepEd LIS".&lt;/ref&gt;

For public school personnel, the school principal and ICT coordinator shall be in charge of distributing user accounts to advisers to their appropriate sections. The homeroom adviser shall enrol all their registered students in their section. Incoming students for kindergarten and grade 1 students shall be issued new Learners Registration Number (LRN) by the system. For transferees from private schools, and other pupils enrolled but do not have LRN after checking the database shall be enrolled by the adviser into the LIS and submit their supporting documents to the Division Planning Unit (DPU). The DPU shall approve the issuance of a new LRN to a learner after documents have been checked and the learner does not have an existing LRN. Homeroom advisers shall update all learners’ data at the beginning of every school year.&lt;ref name="deped2"&gt;"DO26."&lt;/ref&gt;

Private school personnel is to use a separate form and link for submission. The DepEd Central Office shall build up the initial registry of all private school learners in the LIS but all succeeding updates of the master list will be done online through LIS online facility. The DepEd Central Office shall build up the initial registry of all private school learners in the LIS but all succeeding updates of the master list will be done online through the LIS online facility.&lt;ref name="deped2"/&gt;

=== Enhanced Basic Education Information System ===
EBEIS is the data gathering program implemented by the DepEd that records the school’s profile, and list of official enrollments from LIS.

For Government Elementary School Profile and Government Secondary School Profile (GESP/GSSP), they get:&lt;ref name="deped3"&gt;"DO24."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pupil Data and Student Data:
This includes the number of late enrollees, pupils enrolled into the school after the cut-off date of July 31 and the number of continuing pupils and students who were enrolled in the Alternative Delivery Mode (ADM) and who have not yet completed the requirements for the grade/year level.
* Existing Number of Instructional Rooms in the School by Status:
Standard Rooms are rooms deemed to be safe and usable and having the standard dimensions as defined in the instructional rooms. This includes partially incomplete classroom constructions. Non-Standard or Makeshift Rooms are safe and usable rooms which are considered temporary structures to be used in classroom shortages and/or temporary shelter during emergencies. 
* Number of Teachers by Teaching Assignment and by Year Level (GSSP only).
This indicates the number of nationally-funded teachers by gender.

The school principals shall update all required school data for each incoming school years. After ensuring all required data have been accurately updated, they shall submit the profile into the system and the school will be able to download its GESP, GSSP, Private School Profile (PSP), or SUCs Laboratory School Profile which contains its official enrollment from LIS and school data from the EBEIS.&lt;ref name="deped2"/&gt;

=== Learning Resources Management and Development System ===
The LRMDS is an online library created by international education partners and teachers. It is a web-based catalogue and online repository of learning, teaching, and professional development resources. It includes the following: information on quantity, quality, and location of textbooks and supplementary materials, and other teaching-learning resources; access to learning, teaching, and professional development resources in digital format; and standards, specifications, and guidelines for four subsystems: (1) Assessment and Evaluation; (2) Development, Acquisition, and Production; (3) Storage and Maintenance; and (4) Publication and Delivery.&lt;ref name="deped4"&gt;"DO 76."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DepEd Computerization Program ===
The DepEd Computerization Program was implemented to help supply the schools to be ready for training its students in basic ICT programs. This program contains two packages which contain models for a computer lab and an e-classroom. These models will be used in training the students in basic ICT programs in school. For schools with large enrollments, the following criteria will be followed: a minimum of 150 terminals for 9,000 enrollees, 50-100 terminals for 5000-8999 enrollees, and 50 terminals for 2000-4999 enrollees.&lt;ref name="deped5"&gt;"DO 78."&lt;/ref&gt;

To be recipients of the DCP, public schools must have a stable and continuous supply of electricity preferably with telephone facilities; at least one teacher assigned to handle Computer Education classes, to manage the computer laboratory and willing to be trained on lab management; at least one teacher of each English, Science, and Math who are willing to be trained on pedagogy-technology to echo training to their colleagues; capacity to mobilize counterpart support from other stakeholders in the community for needed structures or facilities; never been recipient of computer from other similar government programs unless the equipment is due for replacement and augmentation; and strong partnership with other stakeholders to ensure sustainability of the program.&lt;ref name="deped5"/&gt;

The Computer Lab Model shall include the following: 11 desktop PCs, 1 wireless broadband router,11 uninterruptible power supply (UPS), 1 3-in-1 inkjet printer, and a set of face to face lecture and hands-on training basic software and hardware installation.

The E-Classroom Model shall include the following: 1 host PC, 6 - 17 inch LCD monitor, 6 keyboards and mouse, 2 desktop virtualization kit using shared computing technology, 1 UPS, 1 interactive whiteboard, 1 3-in-1 inkjet printer, 1 LCD projector, and a set of face to face lecture and hands-on training for all equipment mentioned.

=== DepEd Partnership Programs ===
Some notable external efforts also supported by DepEd are the PCs for Public Schools Project, Partners in Learning (PIL) IT Academy Laboratories, and Discounted PCs for Public School Teachers.&lt;ref name="deped6"&gt;Abad 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCs for Public Schools Project is a [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 600 million yearly grant from the Japanese Government through DTI consisting of a package of 20 stand-alone computers per recipient school. The computer package shall be used solely for instructional purposes. The funds for maintenance, operating needs and other budgetary costs shall be ensured by recipient schools with local government units (LGUs), non-government organizations (NGOs), and/or the private sector.&lt;ref name="deped7"&gt;"DO 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Partners in Learning (PIL) IT Academy Laboratories is a DepEd project in partnership with Microsoft Philippines. It is Microsoft's global initiative for education to improve student performance through the integration of ICT in teaching and learning process. Grants have been provided to teachers in order to support ICT pilot projects. This program focuses on educating the teachers who will be introducing ICT to the current curriculum.&lt;ref name="deped6"/&gt;

Data and information available show that the Philippines has eagerly embraced ICT in education. With facilitation by the Department of Education and collaboration with the private sector, several initiatives have successfully equipped a number of schools with ICT facilities. Nevertheless, the initiatives have not insured that teachers fully use the facilities for teaching purposes.&lt;ref name="policies2"&gt;Belawati 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors that affect ICT implementation ==
Numerous factors contribute to the integration of ICT in Philippine education. Some of whom are policymakers and educators. The government’s role in ICT education is to create a framework and exercise decision making with regards to all aspects of implementing programs. As for educators, their task is to implement the educational policies and programs in ICT education. Teachers have a vital role of effectively and appropriately using technology in educational institutions.&lt;ref name="intro4"&gt;Miao 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure that success factors in the frameworks are all satisfied DepEd implemented systems and programs that would aid in improving competency, provision of equipment and ease of access to online material, the following factors are the e-learning success factors used as frameworks for ICT implementations in developing countries:&lt;ref name="factors1"&gt;Wannasiri et al, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Instructors’ Characteristics
Instructors play an important role in teaching the students and must be well trained in order to achieve effectiveness in ICT programs. The use of technology and/or implementation of ICT impacts educational learning outcomes. The general characteristics of the instructor’s teaching methods also fall under this factor.

* E-learning Environment
This pertains to the students’ access to online resources, online systems for access to curriculum and communication, tutoring and assessment. A positive e-learning environment encourages students to interact with their instructors to achieve the maximum benefit from e-learning outcomes.

* Institution and Service Quality
Providing support, equipment, and training are the key qualities of this success criteria. Administrative concerns such as management, funding, maintenance, and the delivery of resources also fall under service quality.

* Infrastructure and System Quality

System quality concerns itself with facilitating interactions, organization and collection of data. Factors that are relevant for infrastructure and system quality include Internet quality, facilitating conditions, reliability, ease of use, system functionality, system interactivity, system response, and equipment accessibility.

* Course and Information Quality
Course quality focuses on well-designed courses, curriculum, and learning materials facilitate meaningful educational experiences. Information quality is about the data’s accuracy, relevance, consistency and timeliness.

{{for|the film|Intermedio (film)}}

The '''intermedio''' {{IPA-it|interˈmɛːdjo|}} (also '''intromessa''', '''introdutto''', '''tramessa''', '''tramezzo''', '''intermezzo'''), in the [[Italian Renaissance]], was a theatrical  performance or spectacle with [[Renaissance music|music]] and often dance which was performed between the acts of a play to celebrate special occasions in Italian [[noble court|courts]].  It was one of the important predecessors to [[opera]], and an influence on other forms like the English court [[masque]].  Weddings in ruling families and similar state occasions were the usual occasion for the most lavish intermedi, in cities such as [[Florence]] and [[Ferrara]].  Some of the best documentation of intermedi comes from weddings in the [[Medici]] family, in particular the 1589 Medici wedding (between [[Christina, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Christina of Lorraine]] and [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]]), which featured what was undoubtedly both the most spectacular set of intermedi, and the best known, thanks to no fewer than 18 contemporary published festival books and sets of [[old master print|prints]] that were financed by the Grand Duke.&lt;ref&gt;Reed &amp; Wallace:205-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermedi were written and performed from the late 15th century through the 17th century, although the peak of development of the genre was in the late 16th century.  After 1600 the form merged with opera, for the most part, though intermedi continued to be used in non-musical plays in certain settings (for example in academies), and also continued to be performed between the acts of operas.

==Development==
The first intermedii were  not in Florence but in [[Ferrara]] at the end of the 15th century between the five acts of plays by the classical authors [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. Writing of the "intermezzi" at the wedding of [[Lucrezia Borgia]] in 1502, [[Isabella d'Este]] said that they were more interesting than the boring ''commedia'', "a remark destined to be often repeated".&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferrara intermezzi at this period were short and without a unifying theme; they included choruses, recitations and ''[[moresca]]'' dances.  But by 1513 there was a unifying [[allegory]], explained at the end.  It was for Florentine public celebrations that Intermedii came into their own; several were organised by [[Machiavelli]] when he was part of the government of the [[Republic of Florence]] in the early 16th century, and the returning Medici adopted a policy of keeping the aristocracy occupied by involving them in productions.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

As the intermedio developed in the 16th century, it grew more and more elaborate, often becoming a "play within a play"; for example during a five-act play, an intermedio would consist of four parts, which might be presented as a four-part metaphor of time passing in the play.  This stage begins with ''Il commodo'', from the Medici wedding in [[Florence]] of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]] and [[Eleanor of Toledo]] in 1539,&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0189 Festival Book online]&lt;/ref&gt; where the four parts were morning, noon, afternoon, and night, represented with an elaborate mechanical artificial sun, with singing and dancing appropriate to each time.  Some critics of the time noted that the intermedi had become so elaborate that the play had begun to serve as intermedi to the intermedi.

==Mature intermedio==
Originally intermedi had used the sets already on the stage from the main play, typically fairly simple ones for a comedy, with a few extra pieces, but later they had their own sets, which a mythological subject required to be more elaborate.  [[Vasari]]'s production for yet another Medici wedding in 1565 "embodied stupendous advances in engineering technique" with all the elaborate movements of scenery done without a curtain in full view of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Strong:134-6&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Roy Strong]]: "the designs for the 1589 intermezzi are crucial, for they are the earliest mass-disseminated illustrations of what became a norm throughout Europe for theatrical visual experience for the next three hundred years, the [[proscenium arch]] behind which receded ranks of side wings, the vista closed by a back-shutter."&lt;ref&gt;Strong:140&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the form acquired a tradition and cohesiveness that allowed it to stand on its own, and it was thus a logical development to combine the existing features with sung, acted parts, and be absorbed into the new artform of opera, which also drew from the traditions of [[monody]] and [[madrigal comedy]]. [[Jacopo Peri]], the composer of [[Dafne]], the first opera, was one of the composers, and almost certainly performers, in the 1589 Medici intermezzi, and the librettist for both, [[Ottavio Rinuccini]], seems to have recycled in ''Dafne'' some of the material from the 1589 Delos scene (illustrated at top).
[[Image:La pellegrina 1589 - Intermedio 6 - La discesa d’Apollo e Bacco col Ritmo e l’Armonia.jpg|left|thumb|Another of the 1589 intermedi; 6th intermedio: Apollo and Bacchus descend, accompanied by Harmony, Rhythm, the [[Charites|Three Graces]], Flora and others.]]
"Festival books", produced as souvenirs of lavish festivities, contain detailed descriptions of many important intermedi, such as those for the Medici wedding of 1589,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ursusbooks.com/item110358.html Album of engravings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717175205/http://www.ursusbooks.com/item110358.html |date=2011-07-17 }}, showing several of the sets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0205 British Library festival book online text]&lt;/ref&gt; for which 286 costumes were made.  Although music written specially for this occasion survives (see discography below), this is usually not the case, and music written for other occasions, for example [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s and instrumental pieces, was often used in intermedi.  The subject matter of the intermedio was usually a [[mythology|mythological]] or [[pastoral]] story, which could be told in [[mime artist|mime]], by costumed singers or actors, or by [[dance]], or any combination of these.  There was invariably a political message, even if this was limited to general glorification of the ruling family; at times more specific messages were intended.  Some thematic connection with the main play might be made, though intermedii could be repeated with different plays from the one they were written for.  

Numerous drawings and engravings of the stage sets survive, as well as texts of the libretti and descriptions of the music and action; the 1589 Medici intermezzi were especially well recorded, and "were to be the fount of Italian [[baroque]] scenography as well as influencing the development of the stage north of the Alps, above all the Stuart court [[masque]]s designed by [[Inigo Jones]]".&lt;ref&gt;Strong:136&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual content in terms of staging, music, instrumentation, presence of singers, actors, dancers, or mime was highly variable throughout the period, and sometimes all of these features were present.  The 1589 intermedi were performed in the recently completed theatre in the [[Uffizi Palace]] before an audience of about three thousand, and three further performances were given some days after the end of the wedding festivities. 
Further significant sets of Medici intermedi were produced for the weddings in 1600 of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Marie de' Medici]], and then in 1608 of [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Cosimo II]] and a [[Habsburg]] princess, [[Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria|Maria Magdalena of Austria]]. However the 1600 celebrations also included a portent of things to come in the form of performances of [[Jacopo Peri]]'s opera ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'', the earliest surviving example of the form.

==Music of the Medici intermedi==
[[Image:La pellegrina 1589 - Intermedio 1 - L'armonia delle sfere.jpg|thumb|Another of the 1589 intermedi: number 1: Harmony descends to earth]]
Of the various intermedi that were performed, only the music to some parts of ''Il commodo''  (1539) and, through a 1591 printed edition by [[Cristofano Malvezzi]], an almost complete version of ''[[The Pilgrim Woman|La Pellegrina]]'' (1589) are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;liner noters to Sempé, "La Pellegrina", 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1539 most of the pieces are in four and five parts so much of this music is suitable for domestic playing. The 1589 music is very different being largely big set pieces for 6, 12, 18 or even 30 parts; 41 instrumentalists were required in all, some hidden around the stage as there was not room for them all in one place.&lt;ref&gt;Grout and Williams, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller scale pieces are often difficult florid [[monody]] of the [[Giulio Caccini|Caccini]] ''new music'' variety.

Of the surviving intermedi only two numbers were ''[[a cappella]]'', (not counting the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s which were sung at the banquet in 1539 which of course are not intermedi).  This means we have surviving descriptions of precise instrumentation.

Classical humanist dramatic theory says a play should have action taking place during one entire day.  These intermedi do not follow what were believed to be the classical instructions, having an overture item, ''Vattene almo riposo'', and a night time ending for tenor voice accompanied by four [[sackbut]]s and an extra [[coda (music)|coda]] the [[bacchanale]], ''Baccho, Baccho, E U O E''.

==Similar forms outside Italy==

The similar form which developed in France at the same time was called the [[intermède]]; it was more reliant on dance than the Italian version.  The French court under [[Catherine de' Medici]] was also staging [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivities of increasing lavishness]] – Catherine's granddaughter was the Medici bride in 1589.  The [[masque]] in England also had many similarities to the intermedio, although it did not originate as a "filler" between acts in a play in the same way.  The later 18th century [[intermezzo]] in opera showed a reversal of the Renaissance scheme; now a single short comic intermezzo was inserted between the acts of a heroic [[opera seria]].

She spent much of her adult life in [[Great Falls, Montana]], but traveled throughout France and the United States.

== Personal life ==
Josephine Hale was born in 1878 as Josephine Adeline Bruneau. The Bruneau family had eleven children, of which Hale was the youngest. Most of her siblings were born in Quebec however her family moved to the United States before Hale was born and settled near Sioux Point, South Dakota.  In 1896 Hale graduated from a high school in Sioux City, Iowa. Two years later, at the age of twenty, Hale moved to Great Falls, MT where three of her siblings already lived. She began teaching in Eden, ten miles away from Great Falls, after passing her teacher certification test. The Montana Museum of Art and Culture states that it is likely she taught at "Canyon Schoolhouse, in the Eden area."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/990066233|title=Intimate west : women artists in Montana : 1880-1944.|last=|first=|publisher=University of Montana Press and the Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture|others=Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture., University of Montana Press (Missoula, Mont.),, University of Montana Printing &amp; Graphic Services|year=|isbn=9780998343846|location=Missoula, Montana|pages=49–50|oclc=990066233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Great Falls, Josephine Hale met her husband, wealthy rancher Walter George Hale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1006511690|title=Over there! : Montanans in the great war.|last=Chacón|first=H. Rafael|publisher=Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture|others=Chacón, H. Rafael., Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture., University of Montana Press (Missoula, Mont.),, University of Montana Printing &amp; Graphic Services|year=|isbn=9780998343839|location=Missoula, Montana|pages=26–27|oclc=1006511690}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two married August 22, 1901 but the marriage lasted only three years. Walter Hale contracted and then died of tuberculosis. After her husband's death, Hale retained ownership of the ranch she had owned with him, and rented it to tenants as a source of income beginning in 1907. In 1910 Hale purchased a three-house lot in Great Falls which she used to board family members. She also created studio space in one of the attics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1917 Hale joined the Red Cross as a nurse to serve during WWI.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While living in France, Hale met George Hepburn Robertson and fell in love. George Hepburn Robertson served as the Director of Transportation for the American Red Cross, which is likely where they met. Although Hale never married Robertson it is likely that part of her reason for returning to France later in life was to continue the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She remained in France until 1926 when she returned to the US and began attending school for interior decoration. Hale returned to France less than a year later to continue her art education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1935 Hale moved back to Great Falls, MT where she lived during the Great Depression and WWII. During the ten years after her return from Europe she created a prolific amount of art work, she also continued nursing, a skill she had picked up in the Red Cross, for the rest of her life, including volunteering during WWII at Columbus Hospital.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Hale died in 1961 at the age of 83.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Red Cross ==
World War I began in 1914, and in 1917 Josephine Hale enlisted in the Red Cross. At the time the Red Cross had an age limit on enlistment, and the forty year old Hale lied about her age, stating she was thirty-five, in order to enlist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her ability to speak French was viewed as an asset and she paid for her own passage to Europe in order to ensure her acceptance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hale traveled from New York to London aboard a transport vessel named the Corinthia. For protection her ship was accompanied by a cruiser, U-boat destroyers, airplanes and hydroplanes. After she arrived in London, Hale took a train to Paris.

Hale's first assignment in France was in Paris at the Gara de l'Est canteen where she took medical classes and improved her language skills. After her training in Paris, Hale worked in canteens near the front, at Bordeaux. She would later open her own canteen in Marseilles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hale wrote in her diary about her experiences working with soldiers:&lt;blockquote&gt;"because of my knowledge of French I am assigned on the French and Belgian side. They are so different from our boys and so very polite but they are accustomed to being waited on so it is a bit harder on the waiter. They seem very much pleased to have an American to talk and joke with them and how they love to air every bit of English that they know. The Americans are all about the same age, but the others range from 55 to 18 -- grey haired men and fresh faced boys and everyone ready to smile back at you every chance they get. It seems they take this war as their work and it is here to do."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hale also recorded her experiences through at the front photography including images of damage caused by bombs at Fort de la Pompelle, a cathedral in ruins and the destruction of a forest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice]], Hale extended her visa in order to continue working in devastated areas. In October 1920 she received her nursing degree from the Societe Francaise de Secours in Paris and in 1924 she was awarded the ''[[Medal of French Gratitude|Médaille de la Reconnaissance française]]'' by the French government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Art ==
In early 1926 Hale moved to Boston and began attending courses at the New York School of Interior of Decoration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her professors recommended that she pursue painting as a degree program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By October 14, 1926 Hale returned to Paris in order to continue studying interior design but the next year she began attending the [[Académie Delécluse]], where she began her full-time study of painting and drawing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the academy she studied under Auguste Delécluse, Eugene Delécluse, De Courmon and Jean-Paul Laurens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Later, she would describe her time studying art in France as "the happiest years of my life."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following nine years improving her skills, Hale received accolades in the Salon of 1934 and was invited to galleries and arts organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hale produced paintings with a wide variety of subjects including still lifes, florals, landscapes, portraits and nudes. Stylistically she was influenced by her experience with interior design in her use of fabric and floral patterns, French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Fauves use of animated lines in landscapes, and the European tradition of plein air painting. She also consistently referenced the book ''The Art Spirit'' by Robert Henri in her sketchbooks. Hale built her body of work by travelling extensively including visits to French Brittany, Monaco, Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Morocco, the Sonoran Desert and Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1995 Vivian Ellis and Fran Walton gifted the Josephine Hale art collection to the [[Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture|Montana Museum of Art and Culture]], which is the primary repository of her work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; MMAC exhibit "Intimate West: Women Artists in Montana 1880-1944." The goal of the exhibit was to show a different interpretation of the American West than the traditional representations by artists like C.M. Russel and Edgar S. Paxson. Hale's works in the exhibit include studies and images of Glacier National Park that are described as "long, thoughtful studies of the natural world" by MMAC curator Jeremy Camwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://missoulian.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/intimate-west-surveys-pioneering-female-artists-take-on-region/article_64ef0242-3f12-591c-aeef-6317a10fe247.html|title='Intimate West' surveys pioneering female artists' take on region|last=Walsh|first=Cory|date=January 20, 2017|work=missoulian.com|access-date=2018-03-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Józef Tadeusz Milik''' (Seroczyn, [[Poland]], March 24, 1922 – [[Paris]], January 6, 2006) was a Polish [[biblical scholar]] and a Catholic priest, well-known researcher of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (DSS) through the deserts of Judea/Jordana, and translator and editor of Enoch book in Aramaic (fragments).&lt;ref&gt;Martinez/Tigchelaar (1999). [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7xcvitgyGmgU0sxOVV3SXVBZTQ/view?usp=sharing The Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was fluent in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[English language|English]] besides his native [[Polish language|Polish]], plus many ancient and dead languages including Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Aramaic, Syriac, old ''church'' Slavonic, Arabic, Georgian, Ugaritic, Akkadian, Sumerian, Egyptian, and Hittite.

==Biography==
He was born into a peasant family in a small village in central [[Poland]]. His father, despite being a farmer, was interested in science, educated himself and gathered a rich library. He influenced his son, who finished the gymnasium in [[Siedlce]] and later entered the theological college in [[Płock]] in 1939. When the college was closed by Germans after they invaded Poland, he moved to Warsaw. After the [[World War II]], he studied at [[Catholic University of Lublin]] and in 1946 was ordained a priest.

Józef Milik deciphered hundreds of the texts of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] as a member of the publication team. He started translating and publishing them in the early 1950s while a student at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-artifacts/dead-sea-scrolls/cast-of-characters/&lt;/ref&gt;

Then he joined [[Roland de Vaux]]’s team and helped to discover Cave 3, excavated and unearthed hundreds of fragments from Cave 4, and took part in the discovery and excavations of Caves 5 and 6. He later became one of the most essential participants of the translation and publication team.

'''Lichenin''', also known as '''lichenan''' or '''moss starch''', is a complex [[glucan]] occurring in certain species of [[lichen]]s. It can be extracted from ''Cetraria islandica'' ([[Iceland moss]]).&lt;ref name="PerlinSuzuki"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perlin |first1=A.

It is an important carbohydrate for [[reindeer]]s and [[northern flying squirrel]]s, which eat the lichen [[wila (lichen)|wila]].

It can be extracted by digesting Iceland moss in a cold, weak solution of [[sodium bicarbonate|carbonate of soda]] for some time, and then boiling. By this process the lichenin is dissolved and on cooling separates as a colorless jelly. [[Iodine]] imparts no color to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{NIE|wstitle=Lichenin|year=1905|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the name==
In his 1960 novel ''[[Trouble with Lichen]]'', [[John Wyndham]] gives the name ''Lichenin'' to a biochemical extract of lichen used to extend life expectancy beyond 300 years.

Within his reference theoretical framework, public]] [[communication]] is studied as applied [[organizational communication]], market communication, and [[societal]] [[communication]] as journalism, public relations, and other systems of persuasion and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]].

'''Montane grasslands and shrublands''' is a [[biome]] defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]]. The biome includes high altitude [[grassland]]s and [[shrubland]]s around the world. The term "montane" in the name of the biome refers to "high altitude", rather than the ecological term which denotes the region below treeline.

Montane grasslands and shrublands located above the [[tree line]] are commonly known as [[alpine tundra]], which occurs in mountain regions around the world. Below the tree line are subalpine and montane grasslands and shrublands. Stunted subalpine forests are known as [[krummholz]], and occur just below the tree line, where harsh, windy conditions and poor soils create dwarfed and twisted forests of slow-growing trees.

Montane grasslands and shrublands, particularly in [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] regions, often evolved as virtual islands, separated from other montane regions by warmer, lower elevation regions, and are frequently home to many distinctive and [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plants which evolved in response to the cool, wet [[climate]] and abundant tropical sunlight. Characteristic plants of these habitats display adaptations such as rosette structures, waxy surfaces, and hairy leaves.   A unique feature of many wet tropical montane regions is the presence of giant rosette plants from a variety of plant families, such as ''[[Lobelia]]'' ([[Afrotropic]]), ''[[Puya (genus)|Puya]]'' ([[Neotropic]]), ''[[Cyathea]]'' ([[New Guinea]]), and ''[[Argyroxiphium]]'' ([[Hawaii]]).

The most extensive montane grasslands and shrublands occur in the [[Neotropic]] [[Páramo]] of the [[Andes Mountains]]. This biome also occurs in the mountains of [[East Africa|east]] and [[central Africa]], [[Mount Kinabalu]] of [[Borneo]], highest elevations of the [[Western Ghats]] in [[South India]] and the Central Highlands of [[New Guinea]]. 

Where conditions are drier, one finds montane grasslands, savannas, and woodlands, like the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], and montane [[steppe]]s, like the steppes of the [[Tibetan Plateau]].

[[File:Saint Petersburg Conservatory.jpg|thumb|260px|Graduates of the [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] include [[Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Sergey Prokofiev]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], and [[George Balanchine]].]]
A '''music school''' is an educational [[institution]] specialized in the study, training, and research of music. Such an institution can also be known as a '''school of music''', '''music academy''', '''music faculty''', '''college of music''', '''music department''' (of a larger institution), '''conservatory''' or '''conservatoire'''. Instruction consists of training in the performance of [[musical instruments]], singing, [[musical composition]], conducting,  [[musicianship]], as well as academic and research fields such as [[musicology]], [[music history]] and [[music theory]].

[[Music instruction]] can be provided within the compulsory general education system, or within specialized children's music schools such as the [[Purcell School]]. Elementary-school children can access music instruction also in after-school institutions such as music academies or music schools. In Venezuela [[El Sistema]] of youth orchestras provides free after-school instrumental instruction through music schools called ''núcleos''.
The term “music school” can also be applied to institutions of higher education under names such as ''school of music'', such as the [[Jacobs School of Music]] of Indiana University; ''music academy'', like the [[Sibelius Academy]] or the [[Royal Academy of Music]], London; ''music faculty'' as the Don Wright Faculty of Music of the [[University of Western Ontario]]; ''college of music'', characterized by the [[Royal College of Music]]  and the [[Berklee College of Music]]; ''music department'', like the Department of Music at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]; or the term ''conservatory'', exemplified by the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. In other parts of Europe, the equivalents of ''higher school of music'' or ''university of music'' may be used, such as the [[Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln]] (Cologne University of Music).

==History==
[[File:NotreDameDeParis.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Based around the Notre Dame Cathedral, the [[Notre Dame School]] was an important centre of polyphonic music.]]
Although music and music education may have been in existence for thousands of years, the earliest history is speculative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vYQEakqM4I0C&amp;printsec=frontcover The origins of music Nils Lennart Wallin, Steven Brown, Björn Merker] {{ISBN|0-262-73143-6}} retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Even when history starts to be recorded, music is mentioned more frequently than music education. Within the biblical tradition, Hebrew litany was accompanied with rich music, but the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch was silent on the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. However, by [[Books of Samuel|I Samuel]] 10, Alfred Sendrey suggests that we find “a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.” This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel]] was the patriarch of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html Lee Krähenbühl: A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[schola cantorum (papal choir)]] in Rome may be the first recorded music school in history, when [[Gregory the Great]] (540–604) made permanent an existing guild dating from the 4th century (''schola'' originally referred more to a guild rather than school). The school consisted of monks, secular clergy, and boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Sistine_Choir Original ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': Sistine Choir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725232840/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Sistine_Choir |date=25 July 2011 }} retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wells Cathedral School]], England founded as a Cathedral School in 909 a.d. to educate choristers, continues today to educate choristers and teaches instrumentalists. However the school appears to have been refounded at least once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wellscathedralschool.org/wells/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=170&amp;Itemid=181&amp;ed=1 Wells Cathedral School] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Martial school]], 10th to 12th century, was an important school of composition at the [[Abbey of Saint Martial]], [[Limoges]]. It is known for the composition of [[trope (music)|trope]]s, [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]]s, and early [[organum]]. In this respect, it was an important precursor to the [[Notre Dame School]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TMdf1SioFk4C&amp;pg=PA748&amp;lpg=PA748&amp;dq=Saint+Martial+school+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1HwZru3T3e&amp;sig=OyZMEyDOXAnc-fTxwfjhFKfO-T4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1E7YTLGkMZOKhQfMwP32Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Saint%20Martial%20school%20music&amp;f=false Harvard Dictionary of Music: St Martial school] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Notre Dame school (late 12th and early 13th century) which was the earliest repertory of [[polyphonic]] (multipart) music to gain international prestige and circulation. The school was a group of composers and singers working under the patronage of the great Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|420777|Notre Dame School}}. retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  First records on [[Escolania de Montserrat]], boys' choir linked to a music school, back to 1307 and still continues the musical education.

The [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] (National Academy of St Cecilia) is one of the oldest musical institutions in the world, based in Italy.
It is based at the Auditorium [[Parco della Musica]] in [[Rome]], and was founded by the papal bull, Ratione congruit, issued by Sixtus V in 1585, which invoked two saints prominent in Western musical history: Gregory the Great, for whom the Gregorian chant is named, and Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music.
It was founded as a "congregation" or "confraternity" – a religious guild, so to speak – and over the centuries, has grown from a forum for local musicians and composers to an internationally acclaimed academy active in music scholarship (with 100 prominent music scholars forming the body of the Accademia) to music education (in its role as a conservatory) to performance (with an active choir and symphony orchestra).

The term ''conservatory'' has its origin in 16th-century [[Renaissance]] Italy, where orphanages (''[[wikt:conservatorio|conservatori]]'') were attached to hospitals. The orphans (''conservati'' ‘saved’) were given a musical education there, and the term gradually applied to music schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|133512|Conservatory}}. Retrieved 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|conservatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hospitals-conservatories were among the first secular institutions equipped for practical training in music. By the 18th century, Italian conservatories were already playing a major role in the training of artists and composers.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1979"&gt;''[[The Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city of [[Naples]], a ''conservatorio'' was strictly a secular place for teaching and learning specializing in music education. There were already four [[conservatories in Naples]] active in the 17th and 18th century: 
* ''I poveri di Gesù Cristo'' (‘The Paupers of Jesus Christ’), founded in 1599 by Marcello Fossataro, already included in their official record a ''magister musicæ'' and ''magister [[lyre|lyræ]]'' in 1633; 
* ''Santa Maria di Loreto'', where the composer [[Giovan Battista Pergolesi]] (1710–1736) studied; 
* ''La pietà dei turchini'' was founded in 1583 and the earliest findings suggest musical activity around the year 1615;
* ''Sant'Onofrio a porta Capuana'', where the composer [[Giovanni Paisiello]] (1740–1816) studied and then taught, started teaching music in the mid-1600 and in the following decades will give more priority to the [[opera buffa]];
* plus one only for girls called ''dell'Annunziata''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Della Corte, G. M. Gatti, ''Dizionario di musica'', Paravia, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is in these very institutions that the so-called [[Neapolitan School|''Scuola Musicale Napoletana'']] was developed, thanks to the work of musicians and educators like [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] (1660–1725) and [[Francesco Durante]] (1684–1755), who was also Pergolesi’s and Paisiello’s teacher.

It was the example set in Naples, where admission was by competitive examination and tuition was free, that was then copied, with modifications, in many European cities, including Paris (1795), Bologna (1804), Milan (1807), Florence and Prague (1811), Warsaw and Vienna (1821), London (1822), the Hague (1826), and Liege (1827). The second half of the 19th century saw the network expanding to the Americas, Rio de Janeiro (1847), Boston (1853), Baltimore and Chicago (1868), Havana (1885), and Buenos Aires (1893). Establishments for advanced training in music were organized in the 1940s in several Asian and African countries, including Iraq, Lebanon, and Kenya.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1979"/&gt;

To this extent, projects like [[El Sistema]] are more in line with the tradition set in Italy (where tuition at conservatories remains still free) than in an English-speaking country, where students have a very selective access to [[bursaries]] (see the [[Royal Academy of Music]] or the [[Royal College of Music]] in the UK).

==Primary and secondary education==

===Specialist music schools===
[[Image:Musikgymnasium Schloss Belvedere (Hauptansicht).jpg|thumb|260px|Musikgymnasium Schloss Belvedere is a specialist music school in Germany]]
Specialist music schools exist in many countries and whose purpose is to identify, and assist, children with exceptional potential, to benefit from world-class specialist training as part of a broad and balanced education, which will enable them, if they choose, to proceed towards self-sustaining careers in music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.areteacademy.org/ Arete Music Academy] retrieved Aug 29th 2018&lt;/ref&gt; These schools may be formally&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landesmusikgymnasium.de/ Sächsisches Landesgymnasium für Musik "Carl Maria von Weber] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or informally attached to a conservatory.  Entry is typically between the ages of ages 8 and 18 and admission is through competitive audition.
Schools may be public or independent; where schools are independent, pupils may be in receipt of governmental&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/mds/questions.shtml English Aided Pupil Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226141532/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/mds/questions.shtml |date=26 December 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or private scholarships. Typically as students progress through the school the time spent on music increases and on academic subjects decrease. These schools usually teach only instrumentalists but may also include choristers.

Some schools (like conservatories) are broader and may cover the [[performing arts]]: music, drama, dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laguardiahs.org/home.html Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710011008/http://laguardiahs.org/home.html |date=10 July 2012 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music schools within schools===
Many music schools are located within existing schools. The pattern is quite diverse and may include:

Specialist music units in Scotland, where students are drawn from an area wider than the host schools catchment. Students will receive specialist music tuition within the music school but are fully integrated within the host school for other lessons. Entry to the specialist music unit or school is by competitive audition, which also effectively gives entry to the host school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicplockton.org/ Sgoil Chiùil na Gàidhealtachd] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public or independent schools contain ''music departments'', some of which achieve high standards. These are sometimes referred to as Music schools. ''Music Colleges'' in England are schools that get additional private and governmental money to specialise in music. Entry is to the host school and musical ability is not an admission requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guildfordcounty.co.uk/music Guildford County School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904033911/http://www.guildfordcounty.co.uk/music |date=4 September 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Schools which perform highly may specialise in an additional area for example sports or technology.
[[Image:Royal College of Music - April 2007.jpg|thumb|260px|300 children attend the [[Royal College of Music]]'s Junior Department]]
Music schools also frequently operate from church facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cit web |URL=https://angelesacademyofmusic.com/ |title= |publisher=Angeles academy of music.com |accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-college divisions===
Many conservatories or other tertiary-level institutions have pre-college divisions or junior departments for children of school age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msmnyc.edu/precollege/ Manhattan School of  Music Pre-college Division] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the curriculum includes individual lesson(s), orchestra, [[chamber music]], [[music theory|theory]], [[musicianship]], [[Musical composition|composition]] and [[music technology]]. Classes are usually held on a Saturday and children attend normal schools during the week.

===Music schools outwith the general education system===
Non-governmental&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musikschule-froehlich.de/index.php/ Musik Fröhlich] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or private&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.yamaha.com/sp/music_education/music_school/ Yamaha Music Schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231210029/http://uk.yamaha.com/sp/music_education/music_school/ |date=31 December 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; schools of music offer music education outside the general education system for students aged 4 to 20+ years. In general, students attend these schools weekend or evening. These schools are typically provided by individuals, charitable or commercial organizations.

==Tertiary education==

===Conservatory===

[[File:JacobsSchoolofMusic.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Jacobs School of Music]], part of [[Indiana University]], has more than 1,600 students]]
A conservatory of music may also be known in English as ''conservatoire'' (chiefly in England&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|conservatoire}} ‘The French form of the word [...] is even sometimes assumed as the name of musical schools in England. In the U.S. the anglicized form ''conservatory'' is used.’&lt;/ref&gt;), ''conservatorium'' (in Australia&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition'': ‘''conservatorium'': (Austral.) the usual term for conservatoire’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster’s ''Third Unabridged Dictionary'': ‘Origin of ''conservatorium'': German ''Konservatorium''’&lt;/ref&gt;), ''academy'' or ''college''. Some schools or conservatories are exclusively focused on music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ram.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx Royal Academy of Music] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Others have a wider focus, for example covering music, drama and dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juilliard.edu/ Juilliard] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatories are suitable for students who wish to develop their performance, conducting, or composition to a professional standard. Typically, they offer a high percentage of practical training combined with academic study and professional development  for those considering a career in the creative arts. Individual teaching is the strength of most components.

Students have the opportunity to perform, conduct or have their music played on a regular basis, both informally and in public.
This may be solo or as part of an orchestra, ensemble or band. Typically, conservatories focus on Western classical music. However, some schools focus on traditional instruments for example [[Chinese instrument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccmusic.edu.cn/ywwz/index.htm China Conservatory] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Others may have departments for [[traditional music]] which includes both traditional and classical instruments, for example [[bagpipes]] alongside the [[fiddle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsamd.ac.uk/undergraduate/sm/ Royal Scottish Academy for Music and Drama] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120915045605/http://www.rsamd.ac.uk/undergraduate/sm/ |date=15 September 2012 }} retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, students can focus on [[jazz]], [[world music]] or pop music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahk.nl/en/conservatorium Conservatorium van Amsterdam] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The time required to complete music degrees is generally not much different from degrees in other fields, i.e. 3–4 years for a [[Bachelor of Music]] degree, 1–2 years for a [[Master of Music]] degree, and 3–5 years for a [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] or [[Doctor of Music]] Degree. A PhD degree can be gained for areas such as [[musicology]], [[music theory]], [[music composition]], [[music education]], or [[music therapy]].  Some schools may offer a non-academic degree that is solely performance based, such as the (United States) A.D. or Artist Diploma; this may be offered at the undergraduate and/or graduate level.

===University schools of music===

[[File:The Kohl Building.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music]] shares its campus with [[Oberlin College]].]]
University music departments originally placed more emphasis on academic study of music, rather than performance. However, today, the division may not be so rigid, with many often placing greater emphasis on performance now than they did in the past. The specific balance of vocational training and academic study varies from one institution to another, and from one country to another.
Some countries separately define their institutions between university status and [[vocational university]] status, whilst other countries do not define such a rigid division. In addition to offering degrees similar to those offered at conservatories, some universities offer non-professional music-related degrees such as a Bachelor of Arts in Music or a Bachelor of Arts in Music Education. A number of previously independent conservatories have become affiliated to universities

'''''Musica enchiriadis''''' is an [[Anonymity|anonymous]] musical [[treatise]] of the 9th century. It is the first surviving attempt to set up a system of rules for [[polyphony]] in western art music. The treatise was once attributed to [[Hucbald]], but this is no longer accepted.&lt;ref name=hoppin&gt;Hoppin, Richard H. ''Medieval Music''. Norton, 1978, pp.188-193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some historians once attributed it to [[Odo of Cluny]] (879-942).&lt;ref name=finney&gt;Finney, Theodore M.  A History of Music.  Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1935, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been attributed to Abbot [[Hoger (abbot)|Hoger]] (d. 906).&lt;ref name=wright&gt;Wright, Craig and Simms, Bryan.  Music in Western Civilization.  Schirmer Cengage Learning, 2010, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; 

This [[music theory]] treatise, along with its companion text, ''[[Scolica enchiriadis]]'', was widely circulated in medieval  [[manuscript]]s, often in association with [[Boethius]]' ''[[De Institutione Musica|De institutione musica]]''.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Erickson, Raymond. "Musica enchiriadis, Scholia enchiriadis". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians''. London: Macmillan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of nineteen chapters; the first nine are devoted to [[musical notation|notation]], [[mode (music)|mode]]s, and [[monophony|monophonic]] [[plainchant]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Chapters 10-18 deal with [[polyphonic music]]. The author here shows how [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant]] intervals should be used to compose or [[improvisation|improvise]] the type of early-medieval polyphonic music called &lt;ref name=grove/&gt; [[organum]], an early style of note-against-note polyphony several examples of which are included in the treatise.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; (''Scolica enchiriadis'' also observes that some melodies should be sung "more quickly" (''celerius''), others "more slowly" (''morosius'').) The last, nineteenth, chapter of ''Musica enchiriadis'' relates the legend of [[Orpheus]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

[[Image:DasiaNotation2.jpg|thumb|right|400px| The notation used in Musica enchiriadis. The scale comprises four tetrachords. The symbols indicating the notes are rotated and mirrored depending on the tetrachords. A modern transcription of the notes is below.]]

The [[scale (music)|scale]] used in the work, which is based on a system of [[tetrachord]]s, appears to have been created solely for use in the work itself, rather than taken from actual musical practice.&lt;ref name=hoppin/&gt; The treatise also uses a very rare system of notation, known as [[Daseian]] notation. This notation has a number of figures which are rotated ninety degrees to represent different pitches.

A critical edition of the treatises was published in 1981, and an English translation by Raymond Erickson in 1995.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Its purpose is to help recognize and inspire interested students to do more with their creative ability. It also motivates students to join the [[National Art Honor Society]] in high school.&lt;ref name="arteducators"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arteducators.org/community/national-art-honor-societies/learn-more|title=Learn about the National Art Honor Society programs|publisher=National Art Education Association|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of this honor society can submit their own artwork for the NAHS/NJAHS Juried Exhibition at the NAEA Studio &amp; Gallery and can also be published in ''NAHS News''. Students also gain leadership opportunities and overall growth, which can help them with preparation for other responsibilities later in life.&lt;ref name="arteducators2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arteducators.org/community/articles/151-national-art-honor-society-chapter-benefits|title=National Art Honor Society Chapter Benefits |publisher=National Art Education Association|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8117">In [[systems engineering]] and [[requirements engineering]], a '''non-functional requirement''' (NFR) is a [[requirement]] that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. They are contrasted with [[functional requirement]]s that define specific behavior or functions. The plan for implementing ''functional'' requirements is detailed in the [[Systems design|system ''design'']].  The plan for implementing ''non-functional'' requirements is detailed in the [[Systems architecture|system ''architecture'']], because they are usually [[architecturally significant requirements]].&lt;ref name="ASR_Chen"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1109/MS.2012.174|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6365165|title = Characterizing Architecturally Significant Requirements|journal = IEEE Software|volume = 30|issue = 2|pages = 38–45|year = 2013|last1 = Chen|first1 = Lianping|last2 = Ali Babar|first2 = Muhammad|last3 = Nuseibeh|first3 = Bashar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, functional requirements define what a system is supposed to ''do'' and non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to ''be''.  Functional requirements are usually in the form of "system shall do &lt;requirement&gt;", an individual action or part of the system, perhaps explicitly in the sense of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]], a [[black box]] description input, output, process and control [[functional model]] or [[IPO Model]]. In contrast, non-functional requirements are in the form of "system shall be &lt;requirement&gt;", an overall property of the system as a whole or of a particular aspect and not a specific function. The system's overall properties commonly mark the difference between whether the development project has succeeded or failed.

Non-functional requirements are often called "[[List of system quality attributes|quality attributes]]" of a system. Other terms for non-functional requirements are "qualities", "quality goals", "quality of service requirements", "constraints", "non-behavioral requirements",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stellman | first=Andrew | last2=Greene | first2=Jennifer | title=Applied Software Project Management | url=http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | page=113 | publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-596-00948-9 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209011617/http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | archivedate=2015-02-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "technical requirements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ambler |first1=Scott |title=Technical (Non-Functional) Requirements: An Agile Introduction |url=http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/technicalRequirement.htm |website=Agile Modelling |publisher=Ambysoft Inc. |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informally these are sometimes called the "[[wikt:ility|ilities]]", from attributes like stability and portability. Qualities—that is non-functional requirements—can be divided into two main categories:

# Execution qualities, such as safety, security and usability, which are observable during operation (at run time).
# Evolution qualities, such as [[software testability|testability]], maintainability, extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static structure of the system.&lt;ref name="Wiegers13"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiegers|first1=Karl|last2=Beatty|first2=Joy|title=Software Requirements, Third Edition|year=2013|publisher=Microsoft Press|isbn=978-0-7356-7966-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young01"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Ralph R. |title=Effective Requirements Practices |year=2001 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=978-0-201-70912-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A system may be required to present the user with a display of the number of records in a database. This is a functional requirement. How up-to-date [update] this number needs to be, is a non-functional requirement. If the number needs to be updated in real time, the system architects must ensure that the system is capable of updating the [displayed] record count within an acceptably short interval of the number of records changing.

Sufficient network bandwidth may be a non-functional requirement of a system. Other examples include:

The '''nutrition facts label''' (also known as the '''nutrition information panel''', and other slight variations) is a label required on most [[packaged food]] in many countries.  Most countries also release overall [[List of nutrition guides|nutrition guides]] for general educational purposes. In some cases, the guides are based on different dietary targets for various nutrients than the labels on specific foods.

Nutrition facts labels are only one of many types of [[food label]] required by regulation or applied by manufacturers.

==Australia and New Zealand==

Australia and New Zealand use a nutritional information panel of the following format:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ '''NUTRITION INFORMATION'''
|-
|colspan="3"|
Servings per package:

Serving size: g
|-
!
!Quantity per Serving
!Quantity per 100 g
|-

|-
| &amp;emsp; - saturated ||0|| g
|-
| Carbohydrate || g || g
|-
| &amp;emsp; - sugars || g || g
|-
| Sodium || mg || mg
|}

Other items are included as appropriate, and the units may be varied as appropriate (e.g. substituting ml for g, or mmol for mg in the 'Sodium' row).&lt;ref&gt;Food Standards Australia and New Zealand Standard 1.2.8 {{cite web |url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/ACF2A90.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514085734/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/ACF2A90.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013 the New Zealand government introduced rules around common claims made on food packaging, such as 'low in fat'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Greens-welcome-food-labelling-move/tabid/423/articleID/293423/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Greens welcome food labelling move| date=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==

[[File:NutritionFactsValeurNutritive.jpg|thumb|A Canadian Nutrition Label displaying information in both English and French.]]
In [[Canada]],  a standardized "Nutrition Facts" label was introduced as part of regulations passed in 2003, and became mandatory for most prepackaged food products on December 12, 2005.  (Smaller businesses were given until December 12, 2007 to make the information available.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/nutrition/index_e.html |title=Nutrition Labelling - Food and Nutrition - Health Canada |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-01-26|date=2004-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with food packaging laws in the country, all information, including the nutrition label, must be written in both English and French, the country's two official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/labelling/food-labelling-for-industry/bilingual/eng/1328121549968/1328121616816|title=Bilingual Labelling|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Food Labelling and Claims|last=Directorate|website=www.inspection.gc.ca|date=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian regulation tightly controls the manner in which the nutrition fact table (NFT) data are laid out. There is a wide variety of possible formats for use on a given food package. A selection hierarchy is used to select among the many formats (28 main formats, and 2-7 sub formats for each). This results in standard (vertical) formats being considered for use before horizontal and linear formats. The selection hierarchy also allows the NFT to occupy no more than 15% of the physical package's available display area (ADS), but never to be smaller than a format that would be &lt;=15% of ADS. In practice, determining the ADS of a package, and selecting the appropriate NFT format, can be a detailed calculation.

==China==
In 2011 the Chinese Ministry of Health released the National Food Safety Standard for Nutrition Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (GB 28050-2011). The core nutrients that must be on a label are: protein, fat, carbohydrate and sodium. Energy is noted in kJ. And all values must be per 100g/100ml.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/General%20Rules%20for%20Nutrition%20Labeling%20of%20Prepackaged%20Foods%20_Beijing_China%20-%20Peoples%20Republic%20of_1-9-2013.pdf | title=General Rules for Nutrition labeling of prepackaged foods | publisher=USDA Foreign Agriculture Service | accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsciq.gov.cn/www/ContentsDisp.asp?id=7715 | title=GB 28050-2011 (chinese) | publisher=www.gsciq.gov.cn | accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==

[[File:Nutrition-Information-UK-Label-Yoghurt.png|thumb|A UK nutrition information label, for low-fat yoghurt. A key difference from US labelling is that it always gives values for a set quantity (100 ml or - like here - 100 g), allowing easy comparison between products. Also, fibre is not considered a type of carbohydrate]]
[[File:Nutri info naranjas eu.jpg|thumb|A rare example of optional nutrition facts on a label for oranges (in the EU not mandatory for unprocessed fruits)]]
It was regulated by the Commission Directive 2008/100/EC of 28 October 2008 amending Council Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition labelling for [[foodstuff]]s as regards recommended daily allowances, [[energy conversion factor]]s and definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:285:0009:0012:EN:PDF |title=COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2008/100/EC of 28 October 2008 |publisher=EUR-Lex.europa.eu |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new regulation is now in force ([[Regulation 1169/2011]]).&lt;ref name="Reg1169"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:304:0018:0063:EN:PDF|title=REGULATION (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutritional labelling becomes mandatory for most pre-packaged foods as from December 2016.

In the European Union, along the "old" rules (Directive 90/496, amended), the information (usually in panel format) is most often labelled "Nutrition Information" (or equivalent in other EU languages). An example is shown on the right. The panel is optional, but if provided, the prescribed content and format must be followed. It will always give values for a set quantity&amp;nbsp;— {{convert|100|g|abbr=on}} or {{convert|100|ml|abbr=on}} of the product&amp;nbsp;— and often also for a defined "serving", as an option. First will come the energy values, in both [[calorie|kilocalories]] and [[kilojoule]]s.

Then will come a breakdown of constituent elements: usually most or all of protein, carbohydrate, starch, sugar, fat, fibre and sodium. The "fat" figure is likely to be further broken down into [[saturated fat|saturated]] and unsaturated fat, while the "carbohydrate" figure is likely to give a subtotal for sugars. With the "new" rules, the mandatory information is: energy, fat, saturates, carbohydrates, sugars, protein and salt, in that particular order, with options to extend this list to: mono-unsaturates, polyunsaturates, polyols, starch, fibre, and vitamins and minerals.&lt;ref name="Reg1169"/&gt;

With regards to health claims and nutrition (composition) claims, these are harmonised in the EU through Regulation 1924/2006, amended.&lt;ref name="Reg1924"/&gt; In November 2012, the European Commission published two new regulations: Regulation (EC) No. 1047/2012 and Regulation (EC) No.1048/2012.
Certain nutrition claim groups as of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 had to be changed. Moreover, the health claims associated to barley beta-gluten were amended (e.g. lowering  blood cholesterol).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:310:0036:0037:EN:PDF Commission Regulation (EU) No 1047/2012], European Commission, 8 November 2012, Retrieved 7 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:310:0038:0040:EN:PDF Commission Regulation (EU) No 1048/2012], European Commission, 8 November 2012, Retrieved 7 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hong Kong]] nutrition facts labels are regulated by the subsidiary legislation Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) (Amendment: Requirements for Nutrition Labelling and Nutrition Claim) Regulation 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutritionlabel.gov.hk/ |title=Hong Kong government |publisher=Nutritionlabel.gov.hk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had, on September 19, 2008, notified the [[Prevention of Food Adulteration]] (5th Amendment) Rules, 2008, mandating packaged food manufacturers to declare on their product labels nutritional information and a mark from the  F.P.O or [[Agmark]] (Companies that are responsible for checking food products) to enable consumers make informed choices while purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/PFA%20Rule%20Relating%20to%20Nutritional%20Labeling%20of%20Packaged%20Food%20Implemented_New%20Delhi_India_4-3-2009.pdf |title=PFA Rule Relating to Nutritional Labeling of Packaged Food Implemented |publisher=USDA Foreign Agricultural Service |accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this amendment, disclosure of nutritional information was largely voluntary though many large manufacturers tend to adopt the international practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=32031 |title=India: Packaged foods must list nutritional facts |publisher=Freshplaza.com |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==
Food products sold in [[Mexico]] use the NOM-051-SCFI-1994 "Información nutrimental" product labelling standard, very similar to "Nutrition Facts" in the US. The Official Mexican Standard, or NOM (''Norma Oficial Mexicana''), was developed by the Mexican Secretary of Commerce and Industrial Promotion (''Secretaría de Comercio y Fomento Industrial''), now a part of the Secretary of the Economy (SECOFI). It entered into effect on January 24, 1996&lt;ref&gt;http://cronos.cta.com.mx/cgi-bin/normas.sh/cgis/despresult.p?clave=NOM-051-SCFI-1994&lt;/ref&gt; and defines "General specifications for labelling foods and pre-bottled non-alcoholic beverages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicolaws.com/scfi/NOM-051-SCFI-1994.htm |title=mexicolaws.com |publisher=mexicolaws.com |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description===
In the [[United States]], the Nutritional Facts label lists the percentage supplied that is recommended to be met, or to be limited, in one day of human [[nutrient]]s based on a daily diet of 2,000 calories.

With certain exceptions, such as foods meant for babies, the following Daily Values are used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=ebf41b28ca63f43546dd9b6bf3f20330&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=21:2.0.1.1.2&amp;idno=21#21:2.0.1.1.2.1.1.6 101.9(c)8(iv)]&lt;/ref&gt; These are called [[Reference Daily Intake]] (RDI) values and were originally based on the highest 1968 [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDA) for each nutrient in order to assure that the needs of all age and sex combinations were met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnusa.org/about_recs4.html|title=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031115637/http://www.crnusa.org/about_recs4.html|archivedate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are older than the current [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s of the [[Dietary Reference Intake]]. For [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin D]], [[vitamin E]], [[vitamin K]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], and [[manganese]], the current highest RDAs are up to 50% higher than the older Daily Values used in labeling, whereas for other nutrients the recommended needs have gone down.

[[File:FDA Nutrition Facts Label 2006.jpg|thumb|The original FDA Nutrition Facts label, as of 2006]][[File:FDA Nutrition Facts Label 2016.png|thumb|The new Nutrition Facts label|alt=]]
The label was mandated for most food products under the provisions of the 1990 [[Nutrition Labeling and Education Act]] (NLEA), per the recommendations of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones in U.S. Food and Drug Law History|url=http://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/whatwedo/history/milestones/ucm128305.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dead link|date=October 2018}} It was one of several controversial actions taken during the tenure of FDA Commissioner [[David Aaron Kessler|Dr. David Kessler]]. The law required food companies to begin using the new food label on packaged foods beginning May 8, 1994. (Meat and poultry products were not covered by NLEA, though the U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed similar regulations for voluntary labeling of raw meat and poultry.&lt;ref&gt;Saltos E, Davis C, et al. (December 1994). [http://naldr.nal.usda.gov/NALWeb/Agricola_Link.asp?Accession=CAT10702513 "Using Food Labels To Follow the Dietary Guidelines for Americans: A Reference"]. Agriculture Information Bulletin Number 704. United States Department of Agriculture, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. Retrieved November 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;)  Foods labeled before that day could use the old label. This appeared on all products in 1995. The old label was titled "Nutrition Information Per Serving" or simply, "Nutrition Information".

The label begins with a standard [[serving size|serving]] measurement, [[calories]] are listed second, and then following is a breakdown of the constituent elements. Always listed are [[total fat]], [[sodium]], [[carbohydrates]] and [[protein]]; the other nutrients usually shown may be suppressed, if they are zero. Usually all 15 nutrients are shown: [[calories]], calories from fat, [[fat]], [[saturated fat]], [[trans fat]], [[cholesterol]], [[sodium]], [[carbohydrates]], [[dietary fiber]], [[sugars]], [[protein]], [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], [[calcium]], and [[iron]].

Products containing less than 5&amp;nbsp;g of fat show amounts rounded to the nearest 0.5&amp;nbsp;g. Amounts less than 0.5&amp;nbsp;g are rounded to 0&amp;nbsp;g. For example, if a product contains 0.45&amp;nbsp;g of trans fat per serving, and the package contains 18 servings, the label would show 0&amp;nbsp;g of trans fat, even though the product actually contains a total of 8.1&amp;nbsp;g of trans fat.

In addition to the nutrition label, products may display certain nutrition information or health claims on packaging. These health claims are only allowed by the FDA for "eight diet and health relationships based on proven scientific evidence", including: calcium and osteoporosis, fiber-containing grain products, fruits and vegetables and cancer, fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber—particularly soluble fiber—and the risk of coronary heart disease, fat and cancer, saturated fat and cholesterol and coronary heart disease, sodium and hypertension, and folate and neural tube defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Madelyn|author2=Marion Franz |author3=Joan Heins |author4=Rebecca Schafer |author5=Harold Holler |title=Food Labeling|journal=Diabetes Care|date=May 1994|volume=17|issue=5|page=482|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/17/5/480.full.pdf|accessdate=28 January 2014|doi=10.2337/diacare.17.5.480 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Medicine recommended these labels contain the most useful nutritional information for consumers: saturated fats, trans fats, sodium, calories, and serving size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Examination of Front-of-Package Nutrition Rating Systems and Symbols: Phase 1 Report | url = http://iom.edu/Reports/2010/Examination-of-Front-of-Package-Nutrition-Rating-Systems-and-Symbols-Phase-1-Report.aspx | publisher = [[Institute of Medicine]] | date = 2010-10-13 | accessdate = 2011-01-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110111172009/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2010/Examination-of-Front-of-Package-Nutrition-Rating-Systems-and-Symbols-Phase-1-Report.aspx | archivedate = 2011-01-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, food manufacturers and grocery stores announced plans to display some of this nutrition information on processed food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Food Makers Devise Own Label Plan | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/business/25label.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss | publisher = New York Times | date = 2010-01-25 | accessdate = 2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nutrition facts label currently appears on more than 6.5 billion food packages. President [[Bill Clinton]] issued an award of design excellence for the nutrition facts label in 1997 to [[Burkey Belser]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Briefs - The NIH Record | url = http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/04_07_2006/briefs.htm | publisher = [[National Institutes of Health]] | date = 2006-04-27 | accessdate = 2009-06-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090609073232/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/04_07_2006/briefs.htm | archivedate = 2009-06-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA does not require any specific typeface be used in the Nutrition Facts label, mandating only that the label "utilize a single easy-to-read type style",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title21-vol2/pdf/CFR-2012-title21-vol2-sec101-9.pdf|title=21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(ii)(A)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its example label uses [[Helvetica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Examples of Revised Nutrition Facts Panel Listing Trans Fat | url = http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/labtr.html | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition | date = 2003-07-09 | accessdate = 2007-11-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013040155/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/labtr.html |archivedate = October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as regulated by the FDA and the USDA, it is mandatory for certain information listed in the label to be written in English, including: name of the product, net quantity, serving size and number of servings per package, nutrition facts, ingredient list, and name of manufacturer or distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidson|first=Tish|title=Food Labeling|journal=The Gale Encyclopedia of Diets: A Guide to Health and Nutrition|year=2008|volume=1|pages=407–412|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2830000120&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=pcc&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=aadf9c6be7ccb502289438e9e6014d75|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest lettering should be at least 1/16th of an inch tall (1.5875 millimeters), based on the height of a lowercase "o".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2012-title21-vol2/CFR-2012-title21-vol2-sec101-2|title=21 CFR 101.2 - Information panel of package form food.|website=www.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, ''Trans'' fat was required to be listed under saturated fat. This was the first significant change to the Nutrition Facts panel since it was introduced in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23786&amp;page=2|title=Trans Fats  Added To Nutrition Labels|website=MedicineNet|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed several simultaneous improvements to nutrition labeling for the first time in over 20 years.&lt;ref name="fdanewlabel"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm|title = Proposed Changes to the Nutrition Facts Label|date = 1 August 2014|accessdate = 15 February 2015|website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/UCM395422.pdf|title = Nutrition Facts Label: Proposed Changes Aim to Better Inform Food Choices|date = February 2014|accessdate = 15 February 2015|website = Consumer Health Information|publisher = US Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed changes were based on trends of consumption of nutrients of public health importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm387164.htm|title=Proposed Nutrition Facts Label Changes Are Based on Science and Research|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies had shown that the majority of the U.S. population could not understand the information in the then current Nutrition Facts Label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Russell L.|last2=Housam|first2=Ryan|last3=Weiss|first3=Hilary|last4=Davis|first4=Dianne|last5=Gregory|first5=Rebecca|last6=Gebretsadik|first6=Tebeb|last7=Shintani|first7=Ayumi|last8=Elasy|first8=Tom A.|date=2006-11-01|title=Patient Understanding of Food Labels: The Role of Literacy and Numeracy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379706002819|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=31|issue=5|pages=391–398|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2006.07.025|pmid=17046410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition label numeracy is particularly low in older individuals, of black and Hispanic race/ethnicity, who are unemployed, born outside of the US, have lower English proficiency, lower education achievement, lower income, or live in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nogueira|first=Leticia M.|last2=Thai|first2=Chan L.|last3=Nelson|first3=Wendy|last4=Oh|first4=April|date=2016-07-01|title=Nutrition Label Numeracy: Disparities and Association with Health Behaviors|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/png/ajhb/2016/00000040/00000004/art00004?token=005212eec95a666f3a7b6c5340346f3b6b66213b786c49264f65263a3d4f58762f46b03491963582ab|journal=American Journal of Health Behavior|volume=40|issue=4|pages=427–436|doi=10.5993/AJHB.40.4.4|pmid=27338989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposed changes included a new design requiring serving sizes to more accurately reflect how many servings the average individual is actually consuming. The new recommendation also proposed removing “calories from fat”, and instead focusing on total calories and type of fats being consumed in a product. The proposed labels were to also list how much sugar is added (rather than inherent) to a product, as well as declaring the amount of Vitamin D and potassium in a product.&lt;ref name="fdanewlabel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA finalizes menu and vending machine calorie labeling rules|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm423952.htm|website=www.fda.gov|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=25 November 2014|ref=FDA Finalizes Calorie Labeling Rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these changes sparked a major debate between the food industry and public health agencies. The proposal to indicate sugar added during food production, in particular, was brought forward by the FDA as a measure to counter the increase in per capita sugar consumption in the US, which over the last decades exceeded the limits recommended by scientific institutions and governmental agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/06/25/how-the-sugar-lobby-helps-perpetuate-that-sweet-tooth-of-yours/|title = How the sugar lobby helps perpetuate that sweet tooth of yours|last = Ferdman|first = Roberto A.|date = 25 June 2014|work = The Washington Post|access-date = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/03/added-sugar-labels_n_6604728.html|title = Here's Why Nutrition Labels Should List Added Sugar|last = Weingus|first = Leigh|date = 3 February 2015|work = The Huffington Post|access-date = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major American food associations opposed the label change, indicating "lack of merit" and "no preponderance of evidence" to justify the inclusion of sugar added in the new label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/07/02/the-crucial-fda-nutrition-label-battle-you-probably-dont-know-about-but-should/|title = The crucial FDA nutrition label battle you probably don’t know about, but should|last = Ferdman|first = Roberto A.|date = 2 July 2014|work = The Washington Post|access-date = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/04/us-sugar-labels-idUSKBN0G40X020140804|title = Food fight builds as U.S. regulators weigh 'added sugar' label|last = Prentice|first = Chris|date = 4 August 2014|work = Reuters|access-date = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules for the new design were finalized on May 20, 2016.

As of 2012, the TTB does not require alcoholic beverage packaging to have a nutrition facts label. Since at least 2003, consumer groups have lobbied the TTB to require labelling disclosing Nutrition Facts information.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2011-01-23-alcohol-labels_N.htm |title=Alcohol industry grapples with nutrition labeling |date=2011-01-23 |accessdate=2013-01-20 |agency=USA Today |author=Michelle Locke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some marketing terms, such as "light" and "table wine", must follow TTB guidelines. Packaging must disclose alcohol content in some circumstances.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;{{which|date=June 2018}}

Mandatory information on the label varies by type of beverage, and includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ttb.gov/consumer/labeling_advertising.shtml|title=TTB - Advertising - Alcohol Beverage Labeling and Advertising|first=|last=ALFD|website=ttb.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ttb.gov/pdf/brochures/p51903.pdf|title=What You Should Know About Malt Beverage Labels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ttb.gov/pdf/brochures/p51902.pdf|title=What You Should Know About Distilled Spirit Labels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ttb.gov/pdf/brochures/p51901.pdf|title=What You Should Know About Grape Wine Labels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caffeine===
Health researchers have called for the mandatory labelling of food products with added [[caffeine]], which is a psychoactive nervous system stimulant.{{who|date=June 2018}}{{when|date=June 2018}} If over-consumed, caffine can cause seizures, kidney problems, liver problems, heart arrhythmia, and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=3777296 |title=Caffeine Content Labeling: A Missed Opportunity for Promoting Personal and Public Health |author1=Jon Kole1 |author2=Anne Barnhill |journal=Journal of Caffeine Research| year=2013 |issue=3 |volume=3 |pages=108–113 |doi=10.1089/jcr.2013.0017 |pmid=24761278}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Coca-Cola Company]] and [[PepsiCo]] began labelling caffeine content in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Labeling standards for caffeine |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/28/health/la-he-nutrition28-2009dec28 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 28, 2009 |author=Elena Conis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[R&amp;D management]] and [[systems development]], '''open coopetition'''  or '''open-coopetition''' is a [[neologism]] to describe cooperation among competitors in the open-source arena.The term was first coined by the scholars Jose Teixeira and Tingting Lin to describe how rival firms that, while competing with similar products in the same markets (e.g., [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Samsung]], [[Google]], [[Nokia]]), collaborate which each other in the development of open-source projects (e.g., [[Webkit]]).&lt;ref name="TeixeiraAndLin2014"&gt;{{cite conference| author1=Jose Teixeira|author2=Lin Tingting|title=Collaboration in the open-source arena: The WebKit case|conference=52nd ACM conference on Computers and people research|book-title=ACM SIGMIS CPR 2014|date=2014|location=Singapore|pages=121–129|doi=10.1145/2599990.2600009|arxiv=1401.5996|publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open-coopetition is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound-word]] term bridging [[coopetition]] and [[Open-source software|open-source]]. [[Coopetition]] refers to a paradoxical relationship between two or more actors simultaneously involved in cooperative and competitive interactions;&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Maria Bengtsson|author2=Sören Kock|title=Coopetition" in business Networks - to cooperate and compete simultaneously|journal=Industrial marketing management|date=2000|volume=29|issue=5|pages=411–426|doi=10.1016/S0019-8501(99)00067-X|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Maria Bengtsson|author2=Sören Kock|title=Coopetition—Quo vadis?

[[File:Integrating open-coopetition in practice.svg|Integrating open-coopetition in practice|thumb| alt= open-coopetition in practice maximizes transparency | upright=1.25| Situating open-coopetition in practice.]]

Such intertwined behavior of cooperation and competition in an [[Open-source software|open-source]] way, emphasizes [[Transparency (behavior)#Technology|transparency on the development of technological artifacts]] that become available to the public under an [[open-source license]]—allowing anyone to freely obtain, study, modify and redistribute them. Within open-coopetition, [[Transparency (behavior)#Technology|development transparency]] and [[sense of community]] are maximized; while the [[Control (management)|managerial control]] and [[Intellectual property|IP enforcement]] are minimized. Open-coopetitive relationships are paradoxical as the core managerial concepts of property, contract and price play an outlier role.

The [[Openness|openness characteristic]] of open-source projects also distinguishes open-coopetition from other forms of [[Strategic alliance|cooperative arrangements]] by its inclusiveness: Everybody can contribute.  Users or other contributors do not need to hold a supplier contract or sign a legal [[intellectual property]] arrangement to contribute. Moreover, neither to be a member of a particular firm or affiliated with a particular [[joint venture]] or [[consortia]] to be able to contribute. In the words of [[Massimo Banzi]], "You don't need anyone's permission to make something great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banzi|first1=Massimo|title=How Arduino is open-sourcing imagination @ TEDGlobal 2012|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/massimo_banzi_how_arduino_is_open_sourcing_imagination?language=en#t-1202|website=ted.com|publisher=TED|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===2008===

In a large-scale study involving multiple European-based software intensive firms, the scholars Pär Ågerfalk and Brian Fitzgerald revealed a shift from "[[Open-source software|open-source]]  as a community of individual developers to [[Open-source software|open-source]] as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small and medium-sized enterprises, operating as a symbiotic ecosystem in a spirit of [[coopetition]]".&lt;ref name="Agerfalk_and_Fitzgeral2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pär Ågerfalk|author2=Brian Fitzgerald| title=Outsourcing to an Unknown Workforce: Exploring Opensorcing as a Global Sourcing Strategy| journal=MIS Quarterly|date=2008|doi=10.2307/25148845 |publisher=Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota|volume=32|issue=2|pages=385–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even if they were exploring [[Open-sourcing|opensourcing]] as "a novel and unconventional approach to global sourcing and [[coopetition]]", they captured the following quote that highlights that competition in the open-source arena is not as in business as usual. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 "In a traditional market you don't call up your competitor and be like, oh, well tell me what your stuff
 does. But in open source you do." [Open Source Program Director, at [[IONA Technologies|IONA]]] &lt;ref name="Agerfalk_and_Fitzgeral2008"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===2012===

Also in the academic world, and after following an [[software company]] based in Norway for over five years, and while theorizing on the concept of [[software ecosystem]], the academic Geir K. Hanssen noted that the characteristic networks of an [[software ecosystem]], open-source or proprietary ones, can embed competing organizations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Software ecosystems have a networked character. CSoft and its external environment constitute a network of customers and
third party organizations. Even competitors may be considered a part of this network, although this aspect has not been studied
in particular here."&lt;ref name="Hanssen2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Geir K. Hanssen | title=A longitudinal case study of an emerging software ecosystem: Implications for practice and theory | journal= Journal of Systems and Software|date=2012|doi=10.1016/j.jss.2011.04.020|publisher=Elsevier|volume=85|issue=7|pages=1455–1466}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an opinion article entitled Open Source Coopetition Fueled by Linux Foundation Growth, the journalist and market analyst Jay Lyman highlights that "working with direct rivals may have been unthinkable 10 years ago, but  [[Linux]], [[Open Source Software|open-source]] and organizations such as [[Linux Foundation|the Linux Foundation]]  have highlighted how solving common problems and easing customer pain and friction in using and choosing different technologies can truly drive innovation and traction in the market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lyman|first1=Jay|title=Open Source Coopetition Fueled by LF Growth|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/74624.html|accessdate=18 March 2015|publisher=LinuxInsider @ ECT News Network|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "open source coopetition" was employed to highlight the role of the [[Linux Foundation]] as a mediator of collaboration among rival firms.

===2013===
At the OpenStack summit in [[Hong Kong]], the co-founder of [[Mirantis]]  Boris Renski talked about his job on figuring out how to co-opete in the crowded OpenStack open-source community. In a 43-minute broadcast video, Boris Renski shed some light on OpenStack coopetition politics and shared a subjective view on strategies of individual players within the OpenStack community (e.g., [[Rackspace]], [[Mirantis]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise|HP]] and [[Red Hat]] among others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Along with this lines, the pioneering scholarly work of Germonprez et al. (2013)&lt;ref name="Germonprez_et_al2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Matt Germonprez |author2=  J. Allen | author3= Jamie Hill| author4= Glenn McClements  |title=Open source communities of competitors|journal= interactions|date=2013|pages=54--49|doi=10.1145/2527191|publisher=ACM|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on how key business actors within the financial services industry that traditionally viewed [[Open-source software movement|open-source software]] with skepticism,  tied up an [[Open-source software movement|open-source]] ‘community of competitors’.  By taking the case of  [http://www.openmama.org/ OpenMAMA], a [[Middleware]]    Agnostic Messaging   [[API]] used by some of the world’s largest financial players,  they show that corporate market rivals (e.g., [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Bank of America]], [[IBM]] and [[BMC Software|BMC]]) can coexist in [[Open-source software movement|open-source communities]],   and intentionally coordinate activities or mutual benefits in precise, market focused,     and non-differentiating engagements.  Their work pointed out that high-competitive capital-oriented industries do not epitomize the traditional and grassroots idea that [[Open-source software movement|open-source software]] was originally born from. Furthermore, they argued that [[Open-source software movement|open-source communities]] can be deliberately designed to include competing vendors and customers under neutral institutional structures (e.g., foundations and steering committees).

=== 2014 ===
In an academic paper entitled "Collaboration in the open-source arena: The WebKit case", the scholars Jose Teixeira and Tingting Lin executed an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] informed [[social network analysis]] on the development of the [[WebKit]] [[Open Source Software|open-source]] [[Web navigation|web browsing]] technologies. Among a set of the reported findings, they pointed out that even if [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Samsung]] were involved in expensive patent wars in the courts at the time, they still collaborated in the open-source arena. As some of the research results did not confirm prior research in [[coopetition]],&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2014"/&gt; the authors proposed and coined the "open-coopetition" term while emphasizing the [[openness]] of collaborating with competitors in the [[Open-source software|open-source]] arena.&lt;ref name="TeixeiraAndLin2014"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Add https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/17/the-spirit-of-coopetition-is-alive-and-well-in-the-cloud/ and its cases --&gt;

=== 2015 ===

By turning to [[OpenStack]], the scholars Teixeira et al. (2015)&lt;ref name="teixeira_et_al2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Jose Teixeira |author2=  Gregorio Robles | author3= Jesús M. González-Barahona |title=Lessons learned from applying social network analysis on an industrial Free/Libre/Open Source Software ecosystem|journal= Journal of Internet Services and Applications|date=2015|doi=10.1186/s13174-015-0028-2|publisher=Springer|doi-access=free|arxiv=1507.04587}}&lt;/ref&gt;
went further and modeled and analyzed both collaborative and competitive networks from the [[OpenStack]] open-source project (a large and complex [[cloud computing]] infrastructure for [[big data]]).  Somewhat surprising results point out that competition for the same [[revenue model]] (i.e., operating conflicting business models) does not necessarily affect collaboration within the [[OpenStack|OpenStack ecosystem]]—in other words, competition among firms did not significantly influence collaboration among software developers affiliated with them. Furthermore, the expected social tendency of developers to work with developers from same firm (i.e., [[homophily]]) did not hold within the [[OpenStack|OpenStack ecosystem]]. The case of [[OpenStack]] revealed to be much about genuine collaboration in software development besides ubiquitous competition among the firms that produce and use the software.

A related study by Linåker et al. (2016)&lt;ref name="linaker_et_al2016"&gt;
{{cite conference | url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-30282-9_5| author1= Johan Linåker | author2= Patrick Rempel | author3= Björn Regnell | author4=Patrick Mäder |date=2016 |title=How Firms Adapt and Interact in Open Source Ecosystems: Analyzing Stakeholder Influence and Collaboration Patterns |book-title=  REFSQ 2016| conference=22nd International Working Conference on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality|pages= 63–81 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-30282-9_5|publisher=Springer| location=Göteborg, Sweden}} &lt;!-- volume=LNCS 9619 --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the [[Apache Hadoop]] ecosystem in a quantitative longitudinal case study to investigate changing stakeholder influence and collaboration patterns. They found that the collaborative network had a quite stable number of network components (i.e., number of [[Community structure|sub-communities]] within the community) with many unconnected stakeholders. Furthermore, such components were dominated by a core set of stakeholders that engaged in most of the collaborative relationships. As in [[OpenStack]], there was much cooperation among competing and non-competing actors within the [[Apache Hadoop]] ecosystem—or in other words, firms with competing [[business models]] collaborate as openly as non-rivaling firms. Finally, they also 
argued that the openness of software ecosystems decreases the distance to competitors within the same ecosystem, it becomes possible and important to track what the competitors do within. Knowing about their existing collaborations, contributions, and interests in specific features offer valuable information about the competitors’ strategies and tactics.

In a study addressing coopetition in the [[cloud computing]] industry, Teixeira et al.&lt;ref name="teixeira_et_al_icis2016"&gt;
{{cite conference |title=Cooperation among competitors in the open-source arena: The case of OpenStack | author1=Jose Teixeira | author2= Salman Mian | author3=Ulla Hytti |publisher= AIS |book-title= ICIS 2016 | location=Dublin, Ireland  |conference= 37th International Conference on Information Systems| arxiv=1612.09462|bibcode=2016arXiv161209462T}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed not only coopetition among individuals and organizations but also among [[business networks|cohesive inter-organizational networks]]. Relationships among individuals were modeled and visualized in 2D longitudinal visualizations and relationships among [[business networks|inter-organizational networks]] (e.g., alliances, consortium or ecosystem) were modeled and visualized in 3D longitudinal visualizations. The author added evidence to prior research&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2014"/&gt; suggesting that competition is a [[Multilevel model|multi-level phenomenon]] that is influenced by individual-level, organizational-level, and network-level factors.

By noting that many firms engaging into open-coopetition actively manage multiple portfolios of [[Strategic alliance|alliances]] in the software industry (i.e., many strategically contribute to multiple [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[software ecosystem]]s) and by analyzing the co-evolution of [[OpenStack]] and the [[CloudStack]] [[cloud computing]] platforms,  the same authors propose that development transparency and the weak intellectual property rights, two well-known characteristics of [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[Software ecosystem|ecosystems]], allow an easier transfer of information and resources from one [[Strategic alliance|alliance]] to another.  Even if openness enables a focal firm to transfer information and resources more easily between multiple [[Strategic alliance|alliancess]], such  'ease of transfer'  should not be seen as a source of [[competitive advantage]] as competitors can do the same.

=== 2017 ===

In a study explicitly addressing coopetition in [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[software ecosystem]]s, Nguyen Duc et al. (2017)&lt;ref name="duc_et_al2017"&gt;
{{cite conference |url=https://link.springer.com/conference/icsob |title=Coopetition of software firms in open source software ecosystems |author1= Anh Nguyen Duc|author2=Daniela Cruzes S.|author3=Geir Hanssen K.|author4=Pekka Abrahamsson| author5= Terje Snarby|date= 2017 |publisher= Springer |book-title=ICSOB 2017 |pages= |location= Essen, Germany |conference= 8th International Conference on Software Business}}
&lt;/ref&gt; identified a number of situations in which different actors within the [[software ecosystem]] deal with collaborative-competitive issues:

* Central actors that act as a bridge between the community and the companies contributing to it (e.g., a [[Lead programmer|lead developer]] or a [[Software maintainer|maintainer]]) need to act as gatekeepers (aka [[Boundary spanning|boundary spanners]]) for bugs reported against specific products sold by the participating firms. As the software is integrated [[Downstream (software development)|downstream]] into specific products often sold by competing firms, it matters to sort out what bugs are the responsibility of a specific firm or the community as a whole. In parallel, such 'bridging' actors also act as gatekeepers in flows of code and information  (e.g., what code should, or should not, be included in the official [[Release early, release often|community-releases]] and what information should circulate among the ecosystem participants).
* Contributors affiliated with firms need to balance the interests of their employers with the interests of the community as a whole. Therefore, their work encompasses the filtering of what is to be kept private (hidden and/or property of the firm)  or what is to be open (transparent and publicly-available under the open-source community terms). Such filtering is impacted by many factors that can range from technical, legal, bureaucratic, as well as organizational strategy issues. &lt;!-- control different policies is challenging as point out by jarben ppa and ann --&gt; .

Competitive behavior within [[Open-source software development|open-source software ecosystems]] frictions with the more purist view of [[free and open-source software]]. The same authors reported on some working practices that conflict with the more traditional values of [[free and open-source software]].
 
* Developers occasionally establish private communication channels. Some open-source purists would prefer that all communication remains transparent and publicly available to the overall community.
* Developers limit sensitive information to certain partners.  While purists would prefer all relevant information to remain available to all ecosystem participants, legal or security issues are often discussed in private and secure communication channels.

The same study also unfolded a number of benefits that organization can rip by actively contributing to [[Open-source software development|open-source software ecosystems]] that encompass both cooperative and competitive relationships: 
* '''Keeping the differences between their packaged software and the upstream software to a minimum'''. This allows firms to more easily benefit from the newest developments in the community. By implementing an [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] first policy,  organizations can more easily catch updates, fixes, and changes from [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]]. 
* '''Sharing maintenance responsibilities'''. Organizations working only [[Downstream (software development)|downstream]] (i.e., just taking the software without contributing back) become solely responsible for maintaining their solution without the benefit of the overall community. 
* '''Reducing maintenance costs by revealing their own developments'''. If organizations extensively modify the software and opt to close some parts (keep it private or obfuscated) they will need to maintain such closed parts by themselves in the future without the benefit of the overall community. &lt;!-- avoid duplication of efforts and get all the community working together on improving a single set of patches avoid later having to rework changes that are incompatible with the latest software version. --&gt; 
* '''Faster integration of new contributions'''. Active contributors will get their work integrated [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] more easily due to an improved social position within the community.
* '''Receiving help'''.  Active contributors with an improved social position within the community are more likely to benefit from the help from others members in the community.  Given the complex nature of software development, help from other members in the ecosystem can be very valuable.
* '''A sense of friendly competitiveness'''.  Besides being competitors, the ecosystem participants develop a [[sense of community]]. Developers employed by competing firms can perceive others as partners and/or friends rather than competitors.  In their work, developers often think of others as developers, partners or colleagues (individual persons) over the firms that they are representing.
* '''Mutual [[co-creation]] of value'''. Even if many of competing firms are competitors they are often also customers/suppliers of each other. Furthermore, they might be competing in different geographical areas or different business domains creating a heterogeneous and [[Heterophily|heterophilous]] environment for reciprocal learning and value [[co-creation]]. Given the complex nature of software development, value creation should benefit from the involvement of multiple and heterogeneous actors holding complementary skills and resources.

== Cases ==

Cases of [[open-coopetition]] are recurrent in the [[software industry]] in general. Furthermore, some cases exist also in the [[Consumer electronics|electronics]], [[Semiconductor industry|semiconductors]], [[automotive industry|automotive]], [[Financial services|financial]], [[Telecommunications industry|telecommunications]], [[retail]], [[education]], [[Healthcare industry|healthcare]], [[Arms industry|defense]], [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace]], and [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] industries. Cases of [[open-coopetition]] are often associated with high-tech corporations and startups based in the USA (predominantly on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]). Cases can be also recognized in Cuba, Brazil,  Europe (predominantly on [[Western Europe]]),  India, South-Korea,  China, Vietnam, Australia, and Japan.

Many of the software projects encompassing [[open-coopetition]] are legally governed by [http://flossfoundations.org/foundation-directory foundations] such as the [[Linux Foundation]], the [[Free Software Foundation]], the [[Apache Software Foundation]], the [[Eclipse Foundation]], the [[Cloud Native Computing Foundation]], and the [[X.Org Foundation]] among many others.  Most of the [[Linux Foundation]] [https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/ collaborative projects] are coopetitive in nature --- the [[Linux Foundation]] claims to be "a neutral home for collaborative development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/ |title= Projects - The Linux Foundation |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;  | website= Linux Foundation |publisher= |access-date=  11 Oct 2017|quote=...&amp;nbsp;hosting your project at The Linux Foundation, a neutral home for collaborative development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many coopetitive open-source projects dealing with both software and hardware (e.g., [[computer graphics]], [[Computer data storage|data storage]]) are bounded by [[Standards organization|standard organizations]] such as the [[Khronos Group]], [[W3C]] and the [[Open Compute Project]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] provides an overview of and topical guide to entertainment and the entertainment industry:

'''[[Entertainment]]''' is any activity which provides a diversion or permits people to [[amusement|amuse]] themselves in their [[leisure|leisure time]], and may also provide [[fun]], enjoyment, and laughter. People may create their own entertainment, such as when they spontaneously invent a  game; participate actively in an activity they find entertaining, such as when they play [[sport]] as a hobby; or consume an entertainment product passively, such as when they attend a performance.

The '''[[Show business|entertainment industry]]''' (informally known as '''show business''' or '''show biz''') is part of the [[tertiary sector of the economy]] and includes a large number of sub-industries devoted to [[entertainment]]. However, the term is often used in the [[mass media]] to describe the mass media companies that control the distribution and manufacture of mass media entertainment. In the popular parlance, the term ''show biz'' in particular connotes the commercially popular performing arts, especially [[musical theatre]], [[vaudeville]], [[comedy]], [[film]], and [[music]].  It applies to every aspect of entertainment including [[film|cinema]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[theatre]], and [[music]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6575">'''Peer-mediated instruction''' ('''PMI''') is an approach in [[special education]] where [[peer group|peers]] of the target students are trained to provide necessary tutoring in educational, behavioral, and/or social concerns.(Chan et al., 2009). In PMI, peers may mediate by [[Modelling (psychology)|modeling]] appropriate behavior themselves, using [[Response Prompting Procedures|prompting procedures]] to elicit appropriate behavior from the target students, and [[Reinforcement|reinforcing]] appropriate behavior when it occurs. The peer tutors are chosen from the target students' classrooms, trained to mediate and closely observed during mediation. Among the advantages noted to the technique, it takes advantage of the positive potential of [[Peer pressure#Benign peer pressure|peer pressure]] and may integrate target students more fully in their peer group. Conversely, it is time consuming to implement and presents challenges in making sure that the peers follow proper techniques. However, studies have suggested it may be an effective technique for a wide range of students, including those with [[autism spectrum]] disorders.

==Procedure==
A student or students will be chosen from the target student's classroom to serve as a peer tutor. Garrison-Harrell et al. (as cited in Chan et al., 2009) suggested a systematic way to choosing the peers to be involved in the treatment based on social status and teacher judgment. Students were asked to list three peers they would like to play with on the playground, three peers they would invite to a party, and three peers they consider to be good friends. Teachers reviewed the top candidates, and selected the tutors based on social skills, language skills, school attendance and classroom behavior.

The student or students chosen as peers must be properly coached before the peer relationship begins, both to understand the importance of the intervention and the methods which should be used. Instructors may model behaviors to the peer tutors and may role play with the peer tutors, allowing the peer tutors to experience both parts in the PMI relationship. Other methods for training could include visual aids, reinforcement for correct implementation, instruction manuals and video instructions. Once the PMI relationship begins, the teacher provides on-going feedback, watching the peer at all times while the intervention is being used. (Chan et al., 2009).

==Strengths and limitations==
There are advantages of using PMI as an intervention strategy. First, there is never a shortage of peers to use, especially when implementing an intervention in a school or classroom. Second, students are influenced through [[observational learning]] by what they see their peers doing. Third, students are often less intimidated by a peer than they are a teacher, which makes instruction and feedback from peers potentially more effective. Fourth, it may not only offer short-term intervention benefits, but can also strengthen the target student's social ties within the classroom. Finally, research has been done with many different types of learners, including students with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]], behavior disorders and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], which show that PMI may be effective for a wide range of students (Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2005; Flood, Wilder, Flood &amp; Masuda, 2002).  

In 2009, ''Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders'' published a paper by Chan ''et al.'' that concluded that PMI is a potentially effective intervention approach for students with Autism disorders.

==Application to General Education classroom settings==
Varying forms of peer-mediated instruction and interventions have been conducted in a great range of settings over the decades. Research has been conducted in educational and non-educational environments with positive outcomes in each. It is important to note that PMII strategies are not restricted or inclusive to education or special education, but have been found to be effective in each-as well as inclusive classroom settings. The following characteristics have been identified by Kulik &amp; Kulik (1992), as central for successful implementation of peer-mediated instruction.
      
*''Expectations for student learning''. Teachers should establish high expectation levels. No students are expected to fall below the level of learning needed to be successful at the next level of education.
*''Careful orientation to lessons''. Teachers must clearly describe the relationship of a current lesson to previous study. Students are reminded of key concepts or skills previously covered.
*''Clear and focused instructions to participants''.
*''Close teacher monitoring of student progress''. Frequently formal and informal monitoring of student learning by teachers. Teachers must require that students are accountable for their product and learning.
*''Re-teach''. If students show signs of confusion, misinterpretation or misunderstanding, the teacher must be responsible to teach again.
*''Use classtime for learning''. Students must pace themselves and should be monitored for task completion.
*''Positive and personal teacher and student interaction''. Cooperative Learning and Peer Tutoring Strategies are instruction methods of choice in many classrooms as they are noted for preventing and alleviating many social problems related to children, adolescents, and young adults.

[[File:Picoplancton fluorescence Pacific.jpg|thumb|Photosynthetic [[picoplankton]] from the Pacific Ocean (off the [[Marquesas Islands]] observed by [[epifluorescence]] microscopy (blue exciting light). Orange fluorescing dots correspond to ''[[Synechocococus]]'' [[cyanobacteria]], red fluorescing dots to picoeukaryotes. Larger cells (e.g. [[diatom]], upper right) can also be seen.]]
'''Picoeukaryotes''' are [[picoplankton]]ic [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms 3.0&amp;nbsp;µm or less in size.  They are distributed throughout the world’s [[marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[freshwater]] [[ecosystems]] and constitute a significant contribution to [[autotroph]]ic [[Community (ecology)|communities]]. Though the [[SI]] prefix [[pico-]] might imply an organism smaller than [[atomic size]], the term was likely used to avoid confusion with existing [[Plankton#Size groups|size classifications]] of [[plankton]].

== Characteristics ==
===Cell structure===
Picoeukaryotes can be either [[autotrophic]] and [[heterotrophic]], and usually contain a minimal number of [[organelle]]s.  For example, ''[[Ostreococcus|Ostreococcus tauri]]'', an autotrophic picoeukaryote belonging to the class [[Prasinophyceae]], contains only the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], one [[mitochondrion]] and one [[chloroplast]], tightly packed within a [[cell membrane]]. Members of a heterotrophic class, the [[Bicosoecida]], similarly contain only two mitochondria, one food [[vacuole]] and a nucleus.&lt;ref name = "Moreira"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Moreira|first= D.|author2=P.

===Distributions===
These organisms are found throughout the water columns. Autotrophic picoeukaryotes are restricted to the upper 100–200 m (the layer that receives light) and are often characterized by a sharp cell maximum near the [[Deep chlorophyll maximum|Deep Chlorophyll Maximum Layer]] (DCML)&lt;ref name= "Campbell"&gt;Campbell, Lisa and Daniel Vaulot.

Accessed April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Heterotrophic groups are found at greater depths and for example, in the [[Pacific Ocean]], they have been found in the vicinity of [[hydrothermal vents]] at depths up to 2000–2550 m. Some heterotrophic lineages are found, unstratified, at all depths from the surface down to 3000 m.&lt;ref name = "Moreira"/&gt; They show high phylogenetic diversity&lt;ref name = "Massana"&gt;Massana, R. et al.

===Diversity===
[[Autotrophic]] picoeukaryotes commonly found in nature are members of groups such as the [[Prasinophyceae]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Worden AZ| year = 2006 | title = Picoeukaryote diversity in coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean | journal = Aquatic Microbial Ecology | volume = 43 | pages = 165&amp;ndash;175 | doi=10.3354/ame043165| issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a kind of [[green algae]]) and the [[Haptophyceae]].&lt;ref name = "Massana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Cuvelier ML, etal | year = 2010 | title = Targeted metagenomics and ecology of globally important uncultured eukaryotic phytoplankton| journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 107 | pages = 14679&amp;ndash;84 | pmid = 20668244 | issue = 33 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1001665107 | pmc=2930470}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of their small size, these organisms have been found to contribute at least 10% of the total global aquatic net [[primary productivity]].&lt;ref name = "Fouilland"&gt;Fouilland, E. et al.

Accessed April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although much less abundant than cyanobacterial [[Photosynthetic picoplankton]] they have been shown to be as important in terms of biomass and primary production than picocyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Worden AZ, Nolan JK, Palenik B | year = 2004 | title = Assessing the dynamics and ecology of marine picophytoplankton: The importance of the eukaryotic component| journal = Limnology and Oceanography | volume = 49 | pages = 168&amp;ndash;179 | issue = 1 | doi=10.4319/lo.2004.49.1.0168| citeseerx = 10.1.1.527.5206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In more oligotrophic environments, such as [[Hawaii Ocean Time-series|Station ALOHA]], researchers believe that approximately 80% of the [[chlorophyll]] α [[biomass]] is due to cells in the [[Pico-|pico]]-size range.&lt;ref name= "Campbell"/&gt;  
Analysis of [[Ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] sequences indicate that heterotrophic oceanic picoeukaryotes belong to lineages such as the [[Alveolata]],  [[stramenopiles]], [[choanoflagellates]], and [[Acantharea]].&lt;ref name = "Moon"/&gt; In these lineages, many groups do not have cultured representatives yet.  Grazing experiments have demonstrated that novel stramenopile picoeukaryotes are bacterivorous.&lt;ref name = "Massana"/&gt;

== Ecology ==
Since the size of these organisms determines how they interact with their environment, it is no surprise that they are not known to form significant sinking organic aggregates.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, A.M. et al. [https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0024-3590(200001)45%3A1%3C87%3AMSOPEI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R&amp;cookieSet=1 Mass Sedimentation of Picoplankton embedded in Organic Aggregates.] Limnology and Oceanography. Vol 45, No. 1, 87-97 (2000). Accessed April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their contribution to [[carbon cycling]] is difficult to assess because they are difficult to separate by techniques such as filtration.&lt;ref name = "Worden"&gt;Worden, A. Z. ''et al.'' (2004). Assessing the dynamics and ecology of marine picophytoplankton: The importance of the eukaryotic component. ''Limnology and Oceanography'' '''49''': 168-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH) experiments have shown that picoeukaryotes are fairly abundant in the [[deep sea]].&lt;ref name = "Moreira"/&gt;  Increased resolution with the development of better FISH techniques indicates that study and detection should become easier.&lt;ref&gt;Biegala, I.C. et al. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=194996 Quantitative Assessment of Picoeukaryotes in the Natural Environment by Using Taxon-Specific Oligonucleotide Probes in Association with Tyramide Signal Amplification-Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization and Flow Cytometry.] Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 5519-5529 (2003). Accessed April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that picoeukaryotes have a strong correlation with chlorophyll concentrations in both meso-autotrophic reservoirs and hypereutrophic reservoirs.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Baoli et al. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/97238n1332020571/ The distributions of autumn picoplankton in relation to environmental factors in the reservoirs along the Wujiang River in Guizhou Province, SW China.] Hydrobiologia 598:35–45 (2008). Accessed April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, nitrogen enrichment experiments suggest that picoeukaryotes have an advantage over larger cells when it comes to acquiring nutrients because of their large surface area per unit volume.  They have exhibited more effectiveness in the uptake of photons and nutrient from low-resource environments.&lt;ref name = "Fouilland"/&gt;

==Biological characteristics==
Picoeukaryotes, much like other [[planktonic]] species, are exposed to light variations during the diel cycle and due to vertical displacement in the mixed layer of the water column.  They have specialized biological reactions to help them deal with excessive densities of light, such as the [[Xanthophyll cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, Celine. et al.

'''Public opinion''' consists of the desires, wants, and thinking of the majority of the people; it is the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem.

This [[concept]] came about through the process of [[urbanization]] and other political and social forces. For the first time, it became important what people thought, as forms of political contention changed.

==Etymology==
The term ''public opinion'' was derived from the French ''opinion publique'' which was first used in 1588 by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in the second edition of his ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (ch. XXII).&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Braatz, ''Friedrich Nietzsche: Eine Studie zur Theorie der Öffentlichen Meinung'', Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term also appears in the 1761 work ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''opinion publique'' appears in the chapter: "Lettre XXIV à Julie" of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Speier&gt;Hans Speier, "Historical Development of Public Opinion", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 55, No. 4 (Jan., 1950), pp. 376–388. {{doi|10.1086/220561}}. {{jstor|2772299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precursors of the phrase in English include [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]]'s "general opinion" (appearing in his 1672 work ''On the Original and Nature of Government'') and [[John Locke]]'s "law of opinion" (appearing in his 1689 work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'').&lt;ref name=Speier/&gt;

==History==
The emergence of public opinion as a significant force in the political realm can be dated to the late 17th century. However, opinion had been regarded as having singular importance since far earlier. Medieval ''fama publica'' or ''vox et fama communis'' had great legal and social importance from the 12th and 13th centuries onward.&lt;ref&gt;See {{fr}} [http://books.openedition.org/pur/15839?lang=fr Julien Théry, "''Fama'' : l'opinion publique comme preuve judiciaire. Aperçu sur la révolution médiévale de l'inquisitoire (XIIe-XIVe s.)", in B. Lemesle (ed.), ''La preuve en justice de l'Antiquité à nos jours'', Rennes, PUR, 2003, pp. 119–147, available online], and Daniel Smail, Thelma Fernster (ed), Fama. ''The Politics of Talk and Reputation'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[William Shakespeare]] called public opinion the 'mistress of success' and [[Blaise Pascal]] thought it was 'the queen of the world.'

[[John Locke]] in his treatise ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' considered that man was subject to three laws: the [[divine law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and most importantly in Locke's judgement, the law of [[opinion]] or [[reputation]]. He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and ''ill opinion'' force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms, however he didn't consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments.

[[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] in his essay of 1672, ''On the Original and Nature of Government'' gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion. He observed that "...when vast numbers of men submit their lives and fortunes absolutely to the will of one, it...must be force of custom, or opinion...which subjects power to authority."

Temple disagreed with the prevalent opinion that the basis of government lay in a [[social contract]] and thought that government was merely allowed to exist due to the favour of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical Development of Public Opinion|last=Speier|first=Hans|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|issn=1537-5390|volume=55|issue=4|year=1950|pages=376–88|jstor=2772299|registration=y|doi=10.1086/220561|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Analisi/article/download/15081/189532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prerequisites for the emergence of a public sphere were increasing levels of literacy which was spurred on by the [[Reformation]], which encouraged individuals to read the [[Bible]] in the vernacular, and the rapidly expanding printing presses. During the 18th century religious literature was replaced with secular literature, novels and pamphlets. In parallel to this was the growth in reading societies and clubs. At the turn of the century the first circulating library opened in London and the [[public library]] became widespread and available to the public.

===Coffee-houses===
[[File:17th century coffeehouse england 1-580x400.jpg|thumb|right|Coffeehouse in [[London]], 17th century]]
An institution of central importance in the development of public opinion, was the [[coffee-house]], which became widespread throughout Europe in the mid-17th century. Although [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] later tried to suppress the London coffeehouses as "places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers", the public flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration, the [[Wit]]s gathered round [[John Dryden]] at [[Will's Coffee House]], in Russell Street, Covent Garden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gk8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met%2C%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;pg=PA531#v=onepage&amp;q=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met,%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;f=false An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce, from the earliest accounts. : Containing an history of the great commercial interests of the British Empire. To which is prefixed an introduction, exhibiting a view of the ancient and modern state of Europe ; of the importance of our colonies ; and of the commerce, shipping, manufactures, fisheries, &amp;c., of Great-Britain and Ireland ; and their influence on the landed interest.

Author:	Adam Anderson; William Combe; John Walter; Logographic Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee houses were great social levellers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism.

More generally, coffee houses became meeting places where business could be carried on, news exchanged and ''[[The London Gazette]]'' (government announcements) read. [[Lloyd's of London]] had its origins in a coffeehouse run by [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London; each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]], wits and [[stockjobber]]s, merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the "cits" of the [[City of London|old city center]]. [[Joseph Addison]] wanted to have it said of him that he had "brought philosophy out of closets and libraries to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea tables and in coffee houses." According to one French visitor, [[Antoine François Prévost]], coffeehouses, "where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government," were the "seats of English liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Prévost, Abbé (1930) ''Adventures of a man of quality'' (translation of ''Séjour en Angleterre'', v. 5 of ''Mémoires et avantures d'un homme de qualité qui s'est retiré du monde'') G. Routledge &amp; Sons, London, {{OCLC|396693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentleman clubs===
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]
[[Gentlemen's club]]s proliferated in the 18th century, especially in the [[West End of London]]. Clubs took over the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th century London to some degree, and reached the height of their influence in the late 19th century – some notable names were [[White's]], [[Brooks's]], [[Arthur's]], and [[Boodle's]] which still exist today.

These social changes, in which a closed and largely illiterate public became an open and politicized one, was to become of tremendous political importance in the 19th century as the mass media was circulated ever more widely and literacy was steadily improved. Governments increasingly recognized the importance of [[propaganda|managing and directing public opinion]]. This trend is exemplified in the career of [[George Canning]] who restyled his political career from its aristocratic origins to one of popular consent when he contested and won the parliamentary seat in [[Liverpool]]; a city with a growing and affluent middle class, which he attributed to the growing influence of "public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Lee, "George Canning and Liberal Toryism, 1801–1827" Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Bentham]] was an impassioned advocate of the importance of public opinion in the shaping of constitutional governance. He thought it important that all government acts and decisions should be subject to the inspection of public opinion, because "to the pernicious exercise of the power of government it is the only check."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482436/public-opinion/258764/Public-opinion-and-government|title=public opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opined that public opinion had the power to ensure that rulers would rule for the greatest happiness of the greater number. He brought in [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] in order to define theories of public opinion.

==Concepts==

The German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], by using the conceptional tools of his theory of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]], argued (''Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung'', 1922), that 'public opinion' has the equivalent [[social function]] in societies (''Gesellschaften'') which [[religion]] has in communities (''Gemeinschaften'').&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Fechner/[[Lars Clausen]]/Arno Bammé (eds.): ''Öffentliche Meinung zwischen neuer Religion und neuer Wissenschaft. Ferdinand Tönnies' "Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung" in der internationalen Diskussion'', in: ''Tönnies im Gespräch'', tom. 3, Munich/Vienna: Profil 2005, {{ISBN|3-89019-590-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] contributed the idea of "[[Public sphere]]" to the discussion of public opinion. The Public Sphere, or bourgeois public, is according to Habermas, where "something approaching public opinion can be formed" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;351). Habermas claimed that the Public Sphere featured universal access, rational debate, and disregard for rank. However, he believes that these three features for how public opinion are best formed are no longer in place in western [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] countries. Public opinion, in western democracy, is highly susceptible to elite manipulation.

The American sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]] has proposed an altogether different conception of the "public". According to Blumer, public opinion is discussed as a form of [[collective behavior]] (another specialized term) which is made up of those who are discussing a given public issue at any one time. Given this definition, there are many publics; each of them comes into being when an issue arises and ceases to exist when the issue is resolved. Blumer claims that people participate in public in different capacities and to different degrees. So, public opinion polling cannot measure the public. An educated individual's participation is more important than that of a drunk. The "mass", in which people independently make decisions about, for example, which brand of toothpaste to buy, is a form of collective behavior different from the public.

Public opinion plays an important role in the political sphere. Cutting across all aspects of relationship between government and public opinion are studies of voting behavior. These have registered the distribution of opinions on a wide variety of issues, have explored the impact of special interest groups on election outcomes and have contributed to our knowledge about the effects of government propaganda and policy.

Contemporary, quantitative approaches to the study of public opinion may be divided into 4 categories:
# quantitative measurement of opinion distributions;
# investigation of the internal relationships among the individual opinions that make up public opinion on an issue;
# description or analysis of the public role of public opinion;
# study both of the communication media that disseminate the ideas on which opinions are based and of the uses that propagandists and other manipulators make of these media.

The rapid spread of public opinion measurement around the world is reflection of the number of uses to which it can be put. Public opinion can be accurately obtained through [[survey sampling]]. Both private firms and governments use [[opinion poll|surveys]] to inform public policies and public relations.

==Formation==
Numerous theories and substantial evidence exists to explain the formation and dynamics of individuals' opinions. Much of this research draws on psychological research on [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]]. In [[communications studies]] and [[political science]], [[mass media]] are often seen as influential forces on public opinion. Additionally, [[political socialization]] and [[behavioral genetics]] sometimes explain public opinion.

===Mass media effects===
The formation of public opinion starts with [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]] by major media outlets throughout the world. This agenda setting dictates what is newsworthy and how and when it will be reported. The media agenda is set by a variety of different environmental and newswork factors that determines which stories will be newsworthy.

Another key component in the formation of public opinion is [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]. Framing is when a story or piece of news is portrayed in a particular way and is meant to sway the consumers attitude one way or the other. Most political issues are heavily framed in order to persuade voters to vote for a particular candidate. For example, if Candidate X once voted on a bill that raised income taxes on the middle class, a framing headline would read "Candidate X Doesn't Care About the Middle Class". This puts Candidate X in a negative frame to the news reader.

[[Social desirability]] is another key component to the formation of public opinion. Social desirability is the idea that people in general will form their opinions based on what they believe is the prevalent opinion of the social group they identify with. Based on media agenda setting and media framing, most often a particular opinion gets repeated throughout various news mediums and [[social network]]ing sites, until it creates a false vision where the perceived truth can actually be very far away from the actual truth.

Public opinion can be influenced by [[public relations]] and the [[political media]]. Additionally, [[mass media]] utilizes a wide variety of [[advertising]] techniques to get their message out and change the minds of people. Since the 1950s, [[television]] has been the main [[mass media|medium]] for molding public opinion.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of influentials==
{{see also|Two-step flow of communication}}
There have been a variety of academic studies investigating whether or not public opinion is influenced by "[[Social influence|influentials]]," or persons that have a significant effect on influencing opinion of the general public regarding any relevant issues.  Many early studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elihu Katz and Paul Felix Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|year=1955|isbn=1-4128-0507-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld et al., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; have modeled the transfer of information from [[mass media]] sources to the general public as a "two-step" process.  In this process, information from mass media and other far-reaching sources of information influences influentials, and influentials then influence the general public as opposed to the mass media directly influencing the public.

While the "two-step" process regarding public opinion influence has motivated further research on the role of influential persons, a more recent study by Watts and Dodds (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watts, D.J. and P.S. Dodds|year=2007|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–458|url=https://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/research/papers/others/2007/watts2007a.pdf|doi=10.1086/518527}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that while influentials play some role in influencing public opinion, "non-influential" persons that make up the general public are also just as likely (if not more likely) to influence opinion provided that the general public is composed of persons that are easily influenced.  This is referred to in their work as the "Influential Hypothesis."  The authors discuss such results by using a model to quantify the number of people influenced by both the general public and influentials.  The model can be easily customized to represent a variety of ways that influencers interact with each other as well as the general public.  In their study, such a model diverges from the prior paradigm of the "two-step" process.  The Watts and Dodds model introduces a model of influence emphasizing lateral channels of influence between the influencers and general public categories.  This thus leads to a more complex flow of influence amongst the three parties involved in influencing public opinion (i.e., media, influencers and general public).

==Relationship with public policy==
The most pervasive issue dividing theories of the opinion-policy relation bears a striking resemblance to the problem of [[monism]]-[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the history of philosophy. The controversy deals with the question of whether the structure of [[socio-political]] action should be viewed as a more or less centralized process of acts and decisions by a class of key leaders, representing integrated hierarchies of influence in society or whether it is more accurately envisaged as several sets of relatively autonomous opinion and influence groups, interacting with representative [[decision maker]]s in an official structure of differentiated [[governmental authority]]. The former assumption interprets individual, group and official action as part of a single system and reduces politics and governmental policies to a derivative of three basic analytical terms: society, culture and [[personality]].

Despite philosophical arguments regarding public opinion, social scientists (those in [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[social psychology]]) present compelling theories to describe how public opinion shapes public policy and find myriad effects of opinion on policy using various empirical research methods. Moreover, researchers find that causal relationships likely run in both directions from opinion to policy and from policy to opinion. On the one hand, public opinion signals public preferences and potential voting behaviors to policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Coping with Permanent Austerity: Welfare State Restructuring in Affluent Democracies|journal=Revue Française de Sociologie|date=2002|volume=43|issue=2|pages=369–406|jstor=3322510|doi=10.2307/3322510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soroka|first1=Stuart|last2=Wlezien|first2=Christopher|title=Degrees of Democracy: Politics, Public Opinion and Policy|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impact should be greater under more stable democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papadakis|first1=Elim|title=Public Opinion, Public Policy and the Welfare State|journal=Political Studies|date=1992|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–37|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1992.tb01758.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be greatest in the realm of social policy because the public are highly motivated by potential goods and services they get from the state. On the other hand, social policy impacts public opinion. The goods and services the public gets via social policy builds normative expectations that shape public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mau|first1=Steffen|title=Welfare Regimes and the Norms of Social Exchange|journal=Current Sociology|date=2004|volume=52|issue=1|pages=53–74|doi=10.1177/0011392104039314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Oorschot|first1=Wim|title=Culture and Social Policy: A Developing Field of Study|journal=International Journal of Social Welfare|date=2007|volume=16|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2397.2006.00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plus, social policy constitutes the largest share of state spending budgets, making it an active and contentious political area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Expenditures Database|url=https://www.oecd.org/social/expenditure.htm|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these theories suggest that causal effects are part of a feedback loop between opinion and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Andrea Louise|title=Policy Makes Mass Politics|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=333–351|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|last2=Soroka|first2=Stuart|title=Relationships between Public Opinion and Policy|journal=Oxford Handbook of Political Behavior|date=2007|pages=799–817|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199270125-e-043?mediaType=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=2011|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using increasingly sophisticated methods, scholars are beginning to grasp and identify the feedback of opinion and policy and use this phenomenon to explain the path dependency of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breznau|first1=Nate|title=Positive Returns and Equilibrium: Simultaneous Feedback Between Public Opinion and Social Policy|journal=Policy Studies Journal|date=14 July 2016|doi=10.1111/psj.12171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|title=The Public as Thermostat: Dynamics of Preferences for Spending|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1995|volume=39|issue=4|pages=981–1000|jstor=2111666|doi=10.2307/2111666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Increasing Returns, Path Dependence, and the Study of Politics|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=2000|volume=94|issue=2|pages=251–267|jstor=2586011|doi=10.2307/2586011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with foreign policy==
As with public policy, public opinion also has a close relationship with [[foreign policy]]. There is much debate concerning what the relationship is, and the study of foreign policy's relationship with public opinion has evolved over time, with the Almond-Lippmann Consensus being one of the first attempt to define this relationship. Published before the Vietnam War, Almond and Lippmann argued that public opinion about foreign policy was unstructured, incoherent, and highly volatile, and that public opinion shouldn't influence foreign policy.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Holsti, Ole R. "Public Opinion and Foreign Policy: Challenges to the Almond-Lippmann Consensus Mershon Series: Research Programs and Debates." International Studies Quarterly, vol. 36, no. 4, 1992, pp. 439–466. {{jstor|2600734}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have rebuked the Almond-Lippmann Consensus, showing how people's opinions are generally stable, and that while individuals may not be entirely informed about every issue, they still act efficiently and rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A. Baum and Philip B. K. Potter, "The Relationships Between Mass Media, Public Opinion, and Foreign Policy: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis," ''Annual Review of Political Science'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

People’s judgments about issues are often based on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that allow rational decisions to be made quickly. [[Heuristics]] apply to public opinion about domestic as well as foreign policy. The deductive heuristic is one that relies on a person's core values and social groups. Delegative heuristics are influenced by figures of authority such as the media or president.&lt;ref&gt;Sniderman, Paul. Reasoning and Choice. ''Explorations in Political Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key theory about how people form their opinions on foreign policy issues is Hurwitz and Peffley's hierarchical attitudes model. They argue that it is structured, with core values providing the basis for postures which further influence the ultimate issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz, Jon, and Mark Peffley. "How Are Foreign Policy Attitudes Structured? A Hierarchical Model." The American Political Science Review, vol. 81, no. 4, 1987, pp. 1099–1120. {{jstor|1962580}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion about foreign policy is measured in the same way that all public opinion is measured. Through [[Opinion poll|polls]] and surveys, respondents are asked about their issue positions. Conclusions are drawn by researchers by applying the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/methods-101-random-sampling/ pewresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with U.S. Presidency==
According to Robert Shapiro, public opinion and policy-making are fundamental to a democracy, which is linked to electoral accountability, meaning that the leader who was elected "will not deviate far from voters’ opinion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A problem that arises when analyzing the data collected by researchers is how these issues that are "important" are selected when collecting the data about public opinion. It is hard to determine if there has been underdevelopment of certain issues. Another concern is how elites influence public opinion by persuasion and rhetoric, ultimately shaping policy-making. These two variables are ambiguous by nature and are hard to get to any conclusions, in most cases beyond the limits of research. Other variables to look at when analyzing the opinion-policy effect are the size of the majority public, election cycle time, degree of electoral competition, and the type of issue. For example, domestic affairs public opinion will be of greater importance than that of foreign affairs, because of the complexity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|date=2011|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/75/5/982/1826441|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since presidents have the ability to influence their political agenda, it is easier for them to respond to public opinion. Also, since they are not an institution (like Congress) they can "shift the standards by which the public evaluates their performance in office – away from policy concerns and towards more symbolic activities, image, and personality."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study by James N. Druckman and Lawrence R. Jacobs discusses how presidents collect their information for policymaking. They found that on one hand, they collect data about the public's preference on salient matters like crime and economy. This reflects a populist type of democracy where the government portrays respect toward the people's views and they are connected. On the other hand, government institutions and elites believe the general populations’ understanding of certain issued is limited, therefore they exercise autonomy when making these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Druckman|first1=J.N.|date=2009|title=Presidential Responsiveness to public opinion|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238859-e-8|journal=The Oxford Handbook of American Presidency|volume=|page=454|pages=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.003.0008|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Baum and Kernell have stated that a challenge that modern presidents face when trying to persuade public opinion is that there is so many different types of media, that getting people's attention is hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum and Kernell|first1=M.A., S|title=Has Cable Ended the Golden Age of Presidential Television?|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=93|pages=99–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media alternatives has also caused on effect on Presidential leadership as they now use them to be able to communicate younger generations, but targeting small groups of people.

The '''RealDoll''' is a life-size [[sex doll]] (also considered a [[mannequin]]) manufactured by Abyss Creations, LLC in [[San Marcos, California]], and sold worldwide.  It has a poseable [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] skeleton with steel joints and [[silicone]] flesh.

==Details and history==
The RealDolls are designed to recreate the appearance, texture, and weight of the human female and male form. Their primary function is to serve as [[sex partner]]s. This activity can be accompanied by certain preparations such as dressing them up in different types of clothing, changing wigs or makeup, and even adjusting body temperature by use of electric blankets or baths.

Early prototypes were made from solid [[latex]] with an [[Endoskeleton|interior]] [[Human skeleton|skeleton]], but construction of the outer material was later switched to [[silicone]]. In June 2009, Abyss Creations switched from tin cure silicone to platinum silicone, which resulted in dolls that are less prone to tears and compression marks than older RealDolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doll Street Journal |url=http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewnewsletter&amp;volume=200907 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804200602/http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewnewsletter&amp;volume=200907 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  

The current incarnation of the female RealDoll product was introduced in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official RealDoll website|url=http://www.realdoll.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Abyss introduced the "Face-X" system, allowing any face to be interchangeable with any body. Multiple faces can then be attached one at a time to a single doll by the owner.  As of 2011, there are nine female bodies and 16 female faces in the first product line. In 2009 the RealDoll&amp;nbsp;2 was introduced, which feature removable inserts for the [[Mouth#In humans|mouth]] and [[vagina]] and faces that attach by magnets instead of Velcro.  The line started with two female bodies and three female faces and as of 2013 offers ten faces and three bodies. Another female body is in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doll Forum Announcement|url=http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=89&amp;t=37588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Charlie", the first male RealDoll, was retired in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abyss News Page |url=http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewpage&amp;section=viewnewsarticle&amp;newsnumberentry=2008051602 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331041052/http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewpage&amp;section=viewnewsarticle&amp;newsnumberentry=2008051602 |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced with two body types and three head types. "[[Transgender]]" dolls may also be purchased from the company, although these must be custom ordered. Abyss also sells silicone toys such as female torso products and dildos among other offerings.

For a time, the company also offered customizations such as robotic hip actuators, finger skeletons (instead of the usual finger wires) and computer-controlled speech feedback, but these expensive options are no longer available.

{{Culture of Scotland}}
'''Scottish art''' is the body of [[visual art]] made in what is now Scotland, or about Scottish subjects, since prehistoric times. It forms a distinctive tradition within European art, but the political union with England has led its partial subsumation in [[British art]].

The earliest examples of art from what is now Scotland are highly decorated carved stone balls from the [[Neolithic]] period. From the [[Bronze Age]] there are examples of carvings, including the first representations of objects, and [[cup and ring marks]]. More extensive Scottish examples of patterned objects and gold work are found the [[Iron Age]]. Elaborately carved [[Pictish stone]]s and impressive metalwork emerged in Scotland the early Middle Ages. The development of a common style of [[Insular art]] across Great Britain and Ireland influenced elaborate jewellery and [[illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]]. Only isolated examples survive of native artwork from the late Middle Ages and of works created or strongly influenced by artists of Flemish origin. The influence of the [[Renaissance]] can be seen in stone carving and painting from the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century the crown began to employ Flemish court painters who have left a portrait record of royalty. [[Scottish Reformation|The Reformation]] removed a major source of patronage for art and limited the level of public display, but may have helped in the growth of secular domestic forms, particularly elaborate painting of roofs and walls. Although the loss of the court as a result of the [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed another major source of patronage, the seventeenth century saw the emergence of the first significant native artists for whom names are extant, with figures such as [[George Jamesone]] and [[John Michael Wright]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the eighteenth century Scotland began to produce artists that were significant internationally, all influenced by [[neoclassicism]], such as [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] and [[Alexander Runciman]], [[Jacob More]] and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]]. Towards the end of the century [[Romanticism]] began to influence artistic production, and can be seen in the portraits of artists such as [[Henry Raeburn]]. It also contributed to a tradition of Scottish landscape painting that focused on the [[Highlands]], formulated by figures including [[Alexander Nasmyth]]. The [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]] was created in 1826, and major portrait painters of this period included [[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]. [[William Dyce]] emerged as one of the most significant figures in art education in the United Kingdom. The beginnings of a [[Celtic Revival]] can be seen in the late nineteenth century and the art scene was dominated by the work of the [[Glasgow Boys]] and the Four, led [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who gained an international reputation for their combination of Celtic revival, [[Arts and Crafts movement|Art and Crafts]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. The early twentieth century was dominated by the [[Scottish Colourists]] and [[the Edinburgh School]]. [[Modernism]] enjoyed popularity during this period, with [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] helping to develop the concept of a [[Scottish Renaissance]]. In the post-war period, major artists, including [[John Bellany]] and Alexander Moffat, pursued a strand of "Scottish realism". Moffat's influence can be seen in the work of the "new Glasgow Boys" from the late twentieth century. In the twenty-first century Scotland has continued to produce successful and influential artists such as [[Douglas Gordon]] and [[Susan Philipsz]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Scotland possess significant collections of art, such as the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh and the [[Burrell Collection]] and [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] in Glasgow. Significant schools of art include the [[Edinburgh College of Art]] and the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. The major funding body with responsibility for the arts in Scotland is [[Creative Scotland]]. Support is also given by local councils and independent foundations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The oldest known examples of art to survive from Scotland are carved stone balls, or [[petrosphere]]s, that date from the late [[Neolithic]] era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire,&lt;ref name="Towie"&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/000-100-033-206-C "Carved stone ball found at Towie, Aberdeenshire"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but a handful of examples are known from [[Iona]], [[Skye]], [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]], [[Uist]], [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Hawick]], [[Wigtownshire]] and fifteen from [[Orkney]], five of which were found at the Neolithic village of [[Skara Brae]].&lt;ref name="Marshall63"&gt;D. N. Marshall, "Carved Stone Balls", ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland'', 108, (1976/77), pp. 62–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many functions have been suggested for these objects, most indicating that they were prestigious and powerful possessions.&lt;ref name=Towie/&gt; Their production may have continued into the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Bronze Age]] there are extensive examples of [[rock art]]. These include [[cup and ring mark]]s, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe and have been found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the [[Kilmartin]] district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and a boat pecked into [[Wemyss Bay|Wemyss Cave]], are believed to be the oldest known representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial [[cist]]s in [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Kincardine]].&lt;ref&gt;V. G. Childe, ''The Prehistory Of Scotland'' (London: Taylor and Francis, 1935), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Iron Age, Scotland had been penetrated by the wider [[La Tène]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Collingwood and J. N. L. Myres, ''Roman Britain and the English Settlements'' (New York, NY: Biblo &amp; Tannen, 2nd edn., 1936), {{ISBN|978-0-8196-1160-4}}, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]] are perhaps the most impressive of the relatively few finds of La Tène decoration from Scotland, and indicate links with Ireland and southern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History,'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd end., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stirling torcs]], found in 2009, are a group of four gold [[torc]]s in different styles, dating from 300 BC and 100 BC Two demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland, but the other two indicate workmanship from what is now southern France and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] worlds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nms.ac.uk/our_museums/national_museum/past_exhibitions/iron_age_gold.aspx "Iron Age Gold"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Middle Ages===
{{Main article|Art in Medieval Scotland}}
{{See also|Scotland in the Middle Ages}}
In the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]], four distinct linguistic and political groupings existed in what is now Scotland, each of which produced distinct material cultures. In the east were the [[Picts]], whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the [[River Forth]] to [[Shetland]]. In the west were the Gaelic ([[Goidelic]])-speaking people of [[Dál Riata]], who had close links with Ireland, from where they brought with them the name Scots. In the south were the British ([[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]]-speaking) descendants of the peoples of the Roman-influenced kingdoms of "[[Y Gogledd Hen|The Old North]]", the most powerful and longest surviving of which was the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. Finally, there were the English or "Angles", Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of [[Bernicia]] (later the northern part of [[Northumbria]]), which reached into what are now the Borders of Scotland in the south-east.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Maddicott and D. M. Palliser, eds, ''The Medieval State: Essays Presented to James Campbell'' (London: Continuum, 2000), {{ISBN|1-85285-195-3}}, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only fragments of artifacts survive from the Brythonic speaking kingdoms of southern Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;L. R. Laing, ''Later Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland'' (London: Osprey Publishing, 1987), {{ISBN|0852638744}}, pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictish art can be seen in the extensive survival of carved [[Pictish stones]], particularly in the north and east of the country. These display a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at [[Dunrobin Castle|Dunrobin]] ([[Sutherland]]) and [[Aberlemno]] ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]).&lt;ref name="Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8"&gt;J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0-7486-0641-6}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few survivals of Pictish silver, notably a number of massive neck-chains including the [[Whitecleuch Chain]], and also the unique silver plaques from the cairn at Norrie's Law.&lt;ref name="Youngs1989pp26-8"&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th–9th Centuries AD'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0-7141-0554-6}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] is much more difficult to identify, but may include items such as the [[Hunterston brooch]], which with other items such as the [[Monymusk Reliquary]], suggest that Dál Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the [[Insular art|Insular style]] developed.&lt;ref name="Lane2001"&gt;A. Lane, [http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba62/feat1.shtml "Citadel of the first Scots"], ''British Archaeology'', 62, December 2001. Retrieved 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art include metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone [[Franks Casket]], thought to have been produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reginald Dodwell|C. R. Dodwell]], ''Anglo-Saxon Art: A New Perspective'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1982), {{ISBN|071900926X}}, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Christian conversion of what is now Scotland in the seventh century, artistic styles in Northumbria interacted with those in Ireland and Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as insular or Hiberno-Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Karkov, ''The Art of Anglo-Saxon England'' (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2011), {{ISBN|1843836289}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Insular art]] is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland after the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles,&lt;ref&gt;H. Honour and J. Fleming, ''A World History of Art'' (London: Macmillan), {{ISBN|0-333-37185-2}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;244–7.&lt;/ref&gt; and which became highly influential in continental Europe, contributing to the development of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;G. Henderson, ''Early Medieval Art'' (London: Penguin, 1972), pp.&amp;nbsp;63–71.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be seen in elaborate [[penannular brooch]]es, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs,''The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork'', pp. 72–115, and 170–4 and D.

The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life by [[Viking invasions of Britain|Viking raids]] in the late eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Dodwell, ''The Pictorial Arts of the West, 800–1200'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1993), {{ISBN|0-300-06493-4}}, pp. 85 and 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Later elaborate metal work has survived in buried hoards such as the [[St Ninian's Isle]] Treasure and several finds from the [[Viking]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, ''Later Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]], Scotland adopted the Romanesque in the late twelfth century and retained and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;T.

[[File:Stirling Head King James V.jpg|thumb|right|One of the [[Stirling Heads]] showing [[James V of Scotland|James V]]]]
Beginning in the fifteenth century, a number of works were produced in Scotland by artists imported from the continent, particularly the [[Netherlands]], generally considered the centre of painting in the [[Northern Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; The products of these connections included a fine portrait of [[William Elphinstone]];&lt;ref name="Webster1997pp127-9"/&gt; the images of St Catherine and St John brought to [[Dunkeld]]; and [[Hugo van Der Goes]]'s altarpiece for the [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity College Church in Edinburgh]], commissioned by [[James III of Scotland|James III]] and the work after which the Flemish [[Master of James IV of Scotland]] is named.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, usually produced in the Low Countries and France for Scottish patrons, including the prayer book commissioned by [[Robert Blackadder]], [[Bishop of Glasgow]], between 1484 and 1492&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; and the Flemish illustrated [[book of hours]], known as the [[Hours of James IV of Scotland]], given by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to [[Margaret Tudor]] and described by D. H. Caldwell as "perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use".&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Caldwell, ed., ''Angels, Nobles and Unicorns: Art and Patronage in Medieval Scotland'' (Edinburgh: National Museum of Scotland, 1982), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Records also indicate that Scottish palaces were adorned by rich [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|tapestries]], such as those that depicted scenes from the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' set up for James IV at [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]].&lt;ref name="Glendinningetal1996p14"&gt;M.

At [[Stirling Castle]], stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of [[James V of Scotland|James V]] are taken from German patterns,&lt;ref&gt;C. McKean, ''The Scottish Chateau'' (Stroud: Sutton, 2nd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|0-7509-3527-8}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and like the surviving carved oak portrait [[Boss (architecture)|roundels]] from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the Stirling Heads, they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures.&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Reformation===
{{Main article|Art in early modern Scotland|Portrait painting in Scotland}}
{{See also|Scottish Reformation}}
During the sixteenth century, Scotland underwent a [[Protestant Reformation]] that created a predominantly Calvinist national [[Church of Scotland]] (kirk), which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 102–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Protestant [[iconoclasm]], with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.&lt;ref&gt;N. Prior, ''Museums and Modernity: Art Galleries and the Making of Modern Culture'' (Oxford: Berg, 2002), {{ISBN|1859735088}}, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A self-portrait by George Jamesone.jpeg|thumb|left|Self portrait of [[George Jamesone]] (1642)]]
The loss of ecclesiastical patronage created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings]] and walls, with large numbers of private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. These include the ceiling at [[Prestongrange]], undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at [[Pinkie House]], painted for [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Alexander Seaton]], Earl of Dunfermline in 1621. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century, but began to flourish after the Reformation. There were anonymous portraits of important individuals, including the Earl of Bothwell (1556) and George, fifth Earl of Seaton (c. 1570s).&lt;ref&gt;R. Tittler, "Portrait, politics and society", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4051-3740-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;455–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] employed two Flemish artists, [[Arnold Bronckorst]] in the early 1580s and [[Adrian Vanson]] from around 1584 to 1602, who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt;

The [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift "from crown to castle", as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p193"&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant native artist was [[George Jamesone]] of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and trained the Baroque artist [[John Michael Wright]] (1617–94).&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9&gt;A. Thomas, ''The Renaissance'', in Devine and Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;198–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing importance of royal art can be seen in the post created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included "drawing pictures of our [the Monarch's] person or of our successors or others of our royal family for the decorment of our houses and palaces". However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a [[sinecure]] held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability.&lt;ref&gt;''The Laws of Scotland: Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia'', vol. 7 "The Crown", para 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enlightenment period====
{{See also|Scottish Enlightenment}}
Many painters of the early part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans, such as the members of the Norie family, James (1684–1757) and his sons, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes.&lt;ref name=Baudino2011p153/&gt; The painters [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] (1713–84), [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1723–98), the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] (1744–68/9) and [[Alexander Runciman]] (1736–85), [[Jacob More]] (1740–93) and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96), mostly began in the tradition of the Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland, and were to varying degree influenced by forms of [[Neoclassicism]]. The influence of Italy was particularly significant, with over fifty Scottish artists and architects known to have travelled there in the period 1730–80.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wormald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mFt2S33o8G8C&amp;pg=PT376&amp;dq=scottish+artists+italy&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=KQipT-rINemP4gTboeyOCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=scottish%20artists%20italy&amp;f=false ''Scotland: A History''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-19-162243-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsay studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was [[Principal Painter in Ordinary]] to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work has been seen as anticipating the [[grand manner]] of [[Joshua Reynolds]], but many of his early portraits, particularly of women are less formal and more intimate studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490799/Allan-Ramsay "Allan Ramsey"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Gavin Hamilton studied at the [[University of Glasgow]] and in Rome, and after a brief stay in London, primarily painting portraits of the British aristocracy, he returned to Rome for the rest of his life. He emerged as a pioneering neo-classical painter of historical and mythical themes, including his depictions of scenes from Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', as well as acting as an early archaeologist and antiquarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253404/Gavin-Hamilton "Gavin Hamilton"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

John and Alexander Runciman both gained reputations as painters of mythological and historical themes. They travelled to Italy, where John died in 1768/9. Alexander returned home to gain a reputation as a landscape and portrait painter. His most widely known work, distributed in etchings, was mythological.&lt;ref name="Chilvers2009p554"&gt;I.

He produced historical and mythical scenes before moving to England, where he pursued portraiture. He then returned to Edinburgh in 1780, became director and master of the [[Academy of Arts]] in 1786. Here he produced his most famous work, with illustrations of themes from Scottish life, earning him the title of "the Scottish Hogarth".&lt;ref name="Houghton2003pp34-5"&gt;''The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography'' (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003), {{ISBN|0-618-25210-X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romanticism====
{{See also|Romanticism in Scotland|Scottish genre art}}
Scotland played a major part in the origins of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] through the publication of [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in [[German language|German]] literature, influencing [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Ossian became a common subject for Scottish artists, and works were undertaken by Alexander Runciman and David Allan among others.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p554/&gt;&lt;ref name=Houghton2003pp34-5/&gt; This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes in general, from viewing them as hostile, empty regions occupied by backwards and marginal people, to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature, occupied by rugged primitives, which were now depicted in a dramatic fashion.&lt;ref name="Withers2001pp151-3"&gt;C. W. J. Withers, ''Geography, Science and National Identity: Scotland Since 1520'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-521-64202-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;151–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Produced before his departure to Italy, Jacob More's series of four paintings "Falls of Clyde" (1771–73) have been described by art historian [[Duncan Macmillan (art historian)|Duncan Macmillan]] as treating the waterfalls as "a kind of natural national monument" and has been seen as an early work in developing a romantic sensibility to the Scottish landscape.&lt;ref name=Withers2001pp151-3/&gt; Alexander Runciman was probably the first artist to paint Scottish landscapes in watercolours in the more romantic style that was emerging towards the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), {{ISBN|0-300-05833-0}}, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nasmyth Alexander Highland Loch.jpg|thumb|right|''Highland Loch Landscape'' by [[Alexander Nasmyth]]]]
The effect of Romanticism can also be seen in the works of late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century artists including [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823), [[Alexander Nasmyth]] (1758–1840) and John Knox (1778–1845). Raeburn was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland, born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786. He is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers,&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3/&gt; adding elements of Romanticism to the tradition of Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Ochterbeck, ed., ''Michelin Green Guide: Great Britain Edition'' (London: Michelin, 5th edn., 2007), {{ISBN|1-906261-08-3}}, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a knight in 1822 and the King's [[painter and limner]] in 1823, marking a return to the post being associated with the production of art.&lt;ref name="Campbell2003pp142-3"&gt;D. Campbell, ''Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History'' (Oxford: Signal Books, 2003), {{ISBN|1-902669-73-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasmyth visited Italy and worked in London, but returned to his native Edinburgh for most of his career. He produced work in a large range of forms, including his portrait of Romantic poet Robert Burns, which depicts him against a dramatic Scottish background, but he is chiefly remembered for his landscapes and is described in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Art'' as "the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition".&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p433&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Knox continued the theme of landscape, directly linking it with the Romantic works of Scott&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Hill, ''Picturing Scotland Through the Waverley Novels: Walter Scott and the Origins of the Victorian Illustrated Novel'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7546-6806-1}}, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also among the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;D.

====Painting====
[[File:The Skating Minister.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[The Skating Minister|The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch]], traditionally attributed to [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823)]]
[[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] (1783–1844) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] (1785–1841) were among the most successful portrait painters, with Wilkie succeeding Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823. Geddes produced some landscapes, but also portraits of Scottish subjects, including Wilkie and Scott, before he finally moved to London in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Geddes, Andrew |volume=11 |pages=547–548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkie worked mainly in London, and was most famous for his anecdotal paintings of Scottish and English life, including ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'' in 1822 and for his flattering painting of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in [[Highland dress]] commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. After a tour of Europe he was more influenced by Renaissance and Baroque painting.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009pp678-9&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', pp.&amp;nbsp;678–9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) became known for his prolific series of detailed [[lithograph]] prints of Egypt and the Near East that he produced during the 1840s from sketches he made during long tours of the region.&lt;ref&gt;C.

Jones, eds, ''Arab and Islamic Studies'' (American Univ in Cairo Press, 1997), {{ISBN|9774244028}}, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as [[Horatio McCulloch]] (1806–67), [[Joseph Farquharson]] (1846–1935) and [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910).&lt;ref name="Szasz200p136"&gt;F.

This was helped by [[Queen Victoria]]'s declared affection for Scotland, signified by her adoption of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] as a royal retreat. In this period a Scottish "grand tour" developed with large number of English artists, including [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], flocking to the Highlands to paint and draw.&lt;ref name="Billcliffe2009p27"&gt;R.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture in Scotland}}
[[File:Alexander &amp; Bucephalus by John Steell.JPG|thumb|right|Alexander and Bucephalus by [[John Steell]] (1832)]]
In the early decades of the century, sculpture commissions in Scotland were often given to English artists. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790 – 1858) and [[Lawrence Macdonald]] (1799–1878) undertook work in Scotland, but worked for much of their careers in London and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 90–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was [[John Steell]] (1804–91). His first work to gain significant public attention was his ''Alexander and Bucephasus'' (1832). His 1832 design for a statue of [[Walter Scott]] was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as Patrick Park (1811–55), [[Alexander Handyside Ritchie]] (1804–70) and [[William Calder Marshall]] (1813–94). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including [[William Brodie]] (1815–81), Amelia Hill (1820–1904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842–1904). Stevenson contributed the statue of [[William Wallace]] to the exterior of the [[Wallace Monument]] and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside. Public sculpture was boosted by the anniversary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced a statue of the poet in [[Leith]]. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for [[Central Park]] in New York, versions of which were made for [[Dundee]], London and [[Dunedin]]. Statues of Burns and Scott were produced in areas of Scottish settlement, particularly in North America and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 125–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early photography====
{{Main article|Scottish photography}}
[[File:His Faither’s Breeks.jpg|left|thumb|upright|'His Faither's Breeks', by [[Hill &amp; Adamson]]]]
In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[David Brewster]] played a major part in the development of the techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] (1821–48) and artist [[David Octavius Hill]] (1821–48), who as [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 [[calotype]] images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography. Other pioneers included [[Thomas Annan]] (1829–87), who took portraits and landscapes, and whose photographs of the Glasgow slums were among the first to use the medium as a social record.&lt;ref name="Burn2011"&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[James Craig Annan]] (1864–1946) popularised the work of Hill &amp; Adamson in the US and worked with American photographic pioneer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864–1946).

====Influence of the Pre-Raphaelites====
{{See also|Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood}}
[[David Scott (painter)|David Scott]]'s (1806–49) most ambitious historical work was the [[triptych]] ''Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow'' (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Ancient Mariner]]'', [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[J. P. Nichol]]'s ''Architecture of the Heavens'' (1850). Because of this early death he was known to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood mainly through his brother [[William Bell Scott]] (1811–90), who became a close friend of founding member [[D. G. Rossetti]]. The London-based Pre-Raphaelites rejected the formalism of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painting after [[Raphael]]. Bell Scott was patronised by the Pre-Raphaelite collector James Leathart. His most famous work, ''Iron and Coal'' was one of the most popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460–1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 205–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Dyce 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[William Dyce]] [[Pegwell Bay, Kent – a Recollection of October 5th 1858]]'' (1858–60?)]]
The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref name="Macmillan, p. 348"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860), contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail, but puts the biblical subjects in a distinctly Scottish landscape, against the Pre-Raphaelite precept of truth in all things. His ''Pegwell Bay: a Recollection of October 5th 1858'' has been described as "the archetypal pre-Raphaelite landscape".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyce became head of the School of Design in Edinburgh, and was then invited to London, to head the newly established Government School of Design, later to become the [[Royal College of Art]], where his ideas formed the basis of the system of training and he was highly involved in the national organisation of art.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p209&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821–1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of [[John Everett Millais]] and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855).&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millias was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823–1904) and whose work included ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R.

====Arts and Crafts and the Celtic Revival====
{{See also|Arts and Crafts movement|Celtic Revival}}
The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]] (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lyons, ''Christopher Dresser: the People's Designer – 1834–1904'' (Woodbridge: Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), {{ISBN|1851494553}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reptilian Fabric.jpg|thumb|left|Textile pattern by [[Christopher Dresser]] (1887)]]
The formation of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a [[Celtic Revival]], similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom.&lt;ref name="Gardiner2005p170"&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer [[Patrick Geddes]] (1854–1932), the architect and designer [[Robert Lorimer]] (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist [[Douglas Strachan]] (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at [[Ramsay Garden]] on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p155-6&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 155–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the figures involved with the movement were [[Anna Traquair]] (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding. The most significant exponent was Dundee-born [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] (1866–1945), who was also influenced by [[Italian Renaissance art]] and French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects ''Tristan and Iseult'' (1912) and ''St Bride'' (1913). Other Dundee Symbolists included Stewart Carmichael (1879–1901) and George Dutch Davidson (1869–1950).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p155-6/&gt; Duncan was a major contributor to Geddes' magazine ''The Evergreen''. Other major contributors included the Japanese-influenced [[Robert Burns (artist)|Robert Burns]] (1860–1941), [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]] (1864–1933) and Duncan's student Helen Hay (fl. 1895–1953).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 156–7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

====Glasgow School====
{{Main article|Glasgow School}}
[[File:Frances Macdonald, Sleeping Princess.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Sleeping Princess'', by [[Frances Macdonald]] (1909)]]
For the late nineteenth century developments in Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The first and largest group, active from about 1880, were the [[Glasgow Boys]], including [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]] (1859–1930), [[Joseph Crawhall]] (1861–1913), [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] (1858–1943) and [[Edward Arthur Walton|E. A. Walton]] (1860–1922).&lt;ref name="Billcliffe2009"&gt;R. Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They reacted against the commercialism and sentimentality of earlier artists, particularly represented by the Royal Academy, were often influenced by French painting and incorporated elements of [[impressionism]] and [[Realism (art)|realism]], and have been credited with rejuvenating Scottish art, making Glasgow a major cultural centre.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly later grouping, active from about 1890 and known as "The Four" or the "Spook School", was composed of acclaimed architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868–1928), his wife the painter and [[Studio glass|glass artist]] [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]] (1865–1933), her sister the artist [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] (1873–1921), and her husband, the artist and teacher [[Herbert MacNair]] (1868–1955). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the Celtic Revival, the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental Europe and helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tschudi-Madsen, ''The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 2002), {{ISBN|0-486-41794-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;283–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Colourists====
{{Main article|Scottish Colourists}}
The next significant group of artists to emerge were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. The name was later given to four artists who knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form a cohesive group. All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; and all looked to Paris, particularly to the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]], such as [[Monet]], [[Matisse]] and [[Cézanne]], whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date= |title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Explore Art |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The%20Scottish%20Colourists&amp;SORT=sort_name |accessdate=12 November 2012 |authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[John Duncan Fergusson]] (1874–1961), [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]] (1883–1937), [[Samuel Peploe]] (1871–1935) and [[George Hunter (painter)|Leslie Hunter]] (1877–1931).&lt;ref name="visit"&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date=|title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Visit Scotland.com |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |accessdate=7 May 2010 |authorlink= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429020605/http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |archivedate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575/&gt;

====Edinburgh School====
{{Main article|The Edinburgh School}}
The group of artists connected with Edinburgh, most of whom had studied at Edinburgh College of Art during or soon after the First World War, became known as the Edinburgh School.&lt;ref name="EdinburghGalleriesEdinbrughSchool"&gt;[http://www.edinburghmuseums.org.uk/Venues/City-Art-Centre/Collections/Fine-Art/Scottish-Art-Movements/The-Edinburgh-School "The Edinburgh School"], Edinburgh Museums and Galleries, retrieved 10 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They were influenced by French painters and the [[St. Ives School]]&lt;ref name="Macmillan2011pp153-4"&gt;D.

====Modernism and the Scottish Renaissance====
{{See also|Modernism|Scottish Renaissance}}
[[File:Cursiter, The Regatta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stanley Cursiter]] ''The Regatta'' (1913)]]
Patrick Geddes coined the phrase Scottish Renaissance, arguing that technological development needed to paralleled in the arts. This ideas were taken up by a new generation, led by the poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] who argued for a synergy between science and art, the introduction of modernism into art and the creation of a distinctive national art. These ideas were expressed in art in the inter-war period by figures including J. D. Fergusson, [[Stanley Cursiter]] (1887–1976), [[William McCance]] (1894–1970) and [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] (1897–1981).&lt;ref name="Macmillan, p. 348"/&gt; Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings such as ''Damaged Destroyer'' (1918).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]], as can be seen in his ''Rain on Princess Street'' (1913) and ''Regatta'' (1913).&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt; McCance's early work was in a bold post-impressionist style, but after World War I it became increasingly abstract and influenced by vorticism, as can be seen in ''Women on an Elevator'' (1925) and ''The Engineer and his Wife'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 348–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone studied cubism, surrealism and new American art. He moved towards [[Abstract art|abstraction]], attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, ''A Point in Time'' (1929–38), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as "one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century".&lt;ref name="Gardiner2005p173"&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 351–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, [http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/review-painters-in-parallel-william-johnstone-william-gillies-1-2063707 "Review: Painters in Parallel: William Johnstone &amp; William Gillies"], ''Scotsman.com'', 19 January 2012, retrieved 8 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists strongly influenced by modernism included [[James McIntosh Patrick]] (1907–98) and [[Edward Baird (artist)|Edward Baird]] (1904–49).&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most of their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]]. Both were influenced by surrealism and the work of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]] and focused on landscape, as can be seen in McIntosh Patrick's ''Traquair House'' (1938) and more overtly in Baird's ''The Birth of Venus'' (1934). Before his success in painting McIntosh Patrick first gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included [[William Wilson (artist)|William Wilson]] (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 175–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Scottish Group====
{{Main article|New Scottish Group}}
[[File:JD Fergusson, People and Sails.jpg|thumb|left|[[J. D. Fergusson]], ''People and Sails'' (1910)]]
The longest surviving member of the Scottish Colourists, J. D. Fergusson, returned to Scotland from France in 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War, where he became a leading figure of a group of Glasgow artists. Members of Fergusson's group formed the New Art Club in 1940, in opposition to the established Glasgow Art Club. In 1942 they held the first exhibition of their own exhibiting society, the New Scottish Group, with Fergusson as its first president.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art in the 20th Century, 1890–2001'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2001), {{ISBN|1840184574}}, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group had no single style, but shared left-wing tendencies and included artists strongly influenced by trends in contemporary continental art. Painters involved included Donald Bain (1904–79), who was influenced by [[expressionism]]. William Crosbie (1915–99) was strongly influenced by surrealism. Marie de Banzie (1918–90), was influenced by expressionism and particularity [[post-expressionism|post-expressionist]] [[Gauguin]]. Isabel Babianska (born 1920), was influenced by expressionist [[Chaim Soutine]]. Expressionism can also be seen as an influence on the work of Millie Frood (1900–88), which included vivid colours and brushwork reminiscent of [[Van Gogh]]. Frood's urban scenes contain an element of social commentary and realism, influenced by Polish refugees [[Josef Herman]] (1911–2000), resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 370–1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jankel Adler]] (1895–1949) who was in Kirkudbright from 1941 to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Herman were husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914–85) and Bet Low (born 1924), who with painter William Senior (born 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art. Their work included industrial and urban landscapes such as MacDonald's ''Transport Depot'' (1944–45) and Bet Low's ''Blochairn Steelworks'' (c. 1946).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1/&gt;{{clear}}

Notable post-war artists included [[Robin Philipson]] (1916–92), who was influenced by the Colourists, but also [[Pop Art]] and [[neo-Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert MacBryde]] (1913–66), [[Robert Colquhoun]] (1914–64) and [[Joan Eardley]] (1921–63), were all graduates of the Glasgow School of Art. MacBryde and Colquhoun were influenced by neo-Romanticism and the Cubism of Adler. The English-born Eardley moved to Glasgow and explored the landscapes of Kincardineshire coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the highly influential St Ives School were [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]] (b. 1912–2004), [[Margaret Mellis]] (b. 1914–2009).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris continued to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with [[William Gear]] (1916–97) and [[Stephen Gilbert]] (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Also a visitor to Paris was [[Alan Davie]] (born 1920),&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; who was influenced by jazz and [[Zen Buddhism]] and moved further into [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]]'s (1925–2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially [[concrete poetry]]) and [[landscape architecture]].

===Scottish Realism and the Glasgow Pups===
[[File:"The Big Heids" - geograph.org.uk - 617712.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Mach]]'s ''Big Heids'', Lanarkshire, a tribute to the steel industry]]
[[John Bellany]] (1942–2013), mainly focusing on the coastal communities of his birth, and Alexander Moffat (born 1943), who concentrated on portraiture, both grouped under the description of "Scottish realism", were among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;C.

Their [[Figurative art|figurative]] work has a comic book-like quality and puts an emphasis on social commentary.&lt;ref&gt;D. Reid, ''The Rough Guide to Edinburgh'' (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|1-85828-887-8}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Wiszniewski's [[post-modernism|post-modern]] painting adopts a whimsical approach to history. Campbell often employs figures reminiscent characters from 1930s novels confronted by the disorder and confusion of the real world, as in his ''Young Men in Search of Simplicity'' (1989).&lt;ref name="Macmillan2011"&gt;D.

New sources of direct government arts funding encouraged greater experimentation among a new generation of sculptors that incorporated aspects of modernism, including Jake Harvey (born 1948), Doug Cocker (born 1945), Ainslie Yule (born 1941) and Gavin Scobie (1940–2012).&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011/&gt; In contrast [[Sandy Stoddart]] (born 1959) works primarily on "nationalist" figurative sculpture in clay within the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical tradition]].

In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough (1945–85) who founded the Stills Gallery for photography in Edinburgh in 1977 and Murray Johnston (1949–90), who was its director (1982–86).&lt;ref&gt;C.

===Contemporary artists===
Since the 1990s, the most commercially successful artist has been [[Jack Vettriano]] (born 1951), whose work usually consists of figure compositions, with his most famous painting ''[[The Singing Butler]]'' (1992), often cited as the best selling print in Britain. However, he has received little acclaim from critics.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p657&gt;Chilvers ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists emerging from Glasgow and Dundee include [[David Mach]] (born 1960), working in the medium of [[installation art]],&lt;ref&gt;P.

===Art schools and colleges===
{{See also|List of art schools in Europe#Scotland}}
[[File:Wfm glasgow school of art.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glasgow School of Art]], designed by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]]]
Scotland has had schools of art since the eighteenth century, many of which continue to exist in different forms today. [[Edinburgh College of Art]] developed from the Trustees Academy founded in the city in 1760 and was established in 1907. After a long independent history, in 2011 it became part of the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/8523596/Edinburgh-College-of-Art-guide.html ''Edinburgh College of Art guide''], ''The Telegraph'', 20 June 2011, retrieved 8 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glasgow School of Art]] grew from the city's School of Design, founded in 1845. [[Grays School of Art]] in Aberdeen was founded in 1885. [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]] was founded in Dundee in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold and D. P.

===Organisations===
[[Creative Scotland]] is the national agency for the development of the arts in Scotland. It superseded the [[Scottish Arts Council]], which was formed in 1994 following a restructuring of the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], but had existed as an [[autonomous]] body since a [[royal charter]] of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3243">'''Service-oriented Software Engineering''' (SOSE) is a [[software engineering methodology]] focused on the development of software systems by composition of reusable services ([[service-orientation]]) often provided by other service providers. Since it involves composition, it shares many characteristics of [[component-based software engineering]], the composition of software systems from reusable components, but it adds the ability to dynamically locate necessary services at run-time. These services may be provided by others as [[web services]], but the essential element is the dynamic nature of the connection between the service users and the service providers.&lt;ref name=Cervantes&gt;Cervantes, Humberto and Hall, Richard S., [https://www.igi-online.com/downloads/excerpts/01%20Stojanovic.pdf "Technical Concepts of Service Orientation."] Chapter 1, pp. 1-26 in Stojanović, Zoran and Dahanayake, Ajanthap.

Idea Group Inc. (IGI), 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-59140-428-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service-oriented interaction pattern==
There are three types of actors in a service-oriented interaction: service providers, service users and service registries. They participate in a dynamic collaboration which can vary from time to time. Service providers are software services that publish their capabilities and availability with service registries. Service users are software systems (which may be services themselves) that accomplish some task through the use of services provided by service providers. Service users use service registries to discover and locate the service providers they can use. This discovery and location occurs dynamically when the service user requests them from a service registry.&lt;ref name=Cervantes/&gt;

'''''Sexual Morality and the Law''''' is the transcription of a 1978 radio conversation in [[Paris]] between philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], playwright/actor/lawyer [[Jean Danet]], and novelist/gay activist [[Guy Hocquenghem]], debating the idea of [[age of consent reform|abolishing age of consent laws]] in France.

In 1977, the issue was brought to public attention in France by a [[French petitions against age of consent laws|petition against age of consent laws]] addressed to the Parliament, defending the decriminalization of all consented sexual relations between adults and [[minor (law)|minor]]s below the age of fifteen (the [[age of consent]] in France).&lt;ref name="petition" /&gt;  Foucault stated that the petition was signed by several philosophers including himself, [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Louis Althusser]], pediatrician and psychoanalyst [[Françoise Dolto]], and also by people he described as belonging to a wide range of political positions.&lt;ref name="petition"&gt;Foucault, Michel, edited by Lawrence D.

The dialogue was broadcast on April 4, 1978 by radio [[France Culture]].&lt;ref name="danger" /&gt; It was originally published in French as ''La loi de la pudeur'' [literally, "The law of decency"] and reprinted in English as ''The Danger of Child Sexuality''.&lt;ref name="danger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipce.info/ipceweb/Library/danger.htm|title=The Danger of Child Sexuality – an interview with Michel Foucault|accessdate=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text was later included under the title ''Sexual Morality and the Law'' in Foucault’s book ''Politics, Philosophy, Culture&amp;nbsp;– Interviews and other writings, 1977–1984''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Politics, Philosophy, Culture – Interviews and other writings 1977–1984]]|author=Michel Foucault, edited by Lawrence D. Kritzman|year=1988|isbn=0-415-90082-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Foucault and Hocquenghem focus, in the first place, on the penalization of the "sexual offences", at the time of the 19th century, and on the invention by the then incipient [[psychiatry]] of the category of the "[[perversion|perverts]]".

Foucault points out that the French Penal Code of 1810 comprises 485 articles defining crimes, offenses, and misdemeanors as well as the resulting punishments. It was promulgated on February 12, 1810, and did not regulate the sexual behaviors, "as if sexuality was not the business of the law". He explains that legislation on sexuality during the 19th century and specially in the 20th century, at the time of [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]] and of the "[[Sodomy law#France|Mirguet amendment]]" (1960). The [[Sodomy law#France|Mirguet amendment]] of July 18, 1960, increased the penalties for "public insult against decency" between same sex couples. It has changed article 38 of the 1958 French constitution.

Foucault, Hocquenghem and Danet denounce the increasing psychiatrization of society and the introduction of a [[social control]] over sexuality. Foucault had already outlined this analysis of what he calls the "device of sexuality" in his work ''[[The Will to Knowledge]]'' (1976). "All the legislation on sexuality", affirms Foucault, "introduced since the 19th century in France, is a set of laws on decency", which appears impossible to define, becoming thus a flexible tool politically used in several local tactics.  Foucault stressed that:
:''"What is emerging is a new penal system, a new legislative system whose function is not so much to punish offenses against these general laws concerning decency, as to protect populations and parts of populations regarded as particularly vulnerable"''  (for example children).  ''"Therefore, there would be on one side the fragile population, and on the other side the "dangerous population" "'' (the adult in general).

Danet affirms that "what takes place with the intervention of psychiatrists in court is a manipulation of the children's consent, a manipulation of their words".

Using among other things the example of the movement of protest, in Germany, at the end of the 19th century, against article 175 of the [[German Penal Code]] which criminalized any homosexual act, Danet considers that the psychiatrists "expected only one thing from the abolition of this law, namely, to be able to take over the 'perverts'" [as homosexuals were regarded at that time] "for themselves and to treat them with all the knowledge that they claimed to have acquired since around 1860" (Danet cites then [[Bénédict Morel|Morel]] and his ''Treaty of degenerescence'', published in 1857).

==Main ideas of the text==

===The fabrication of a crime===
Foucault observes that whereas the law formerly condemned the infringement, the act of breaking the law, we enter from now on in a disciplinary society which condemns the criminal himself&amp;nbsp;– called "[[wikt:delinquent|delinquent]]" or "[[pervert]]"&amp;nbsp;–  and instead of punishing the act, we criminalize a person or a category of the population.

Hocquenghem sustains that "a whole mixture of notions" is responsible for the fabrication of the idea of the crime against [[decency]], ranging from religious [[prohibition]]s concerning [[sodomy]] to the separation between the world of the [[child]] and the world of the [[adult]].

He observes that this was possible due to the creation of a category of people regarded as "perverts", "legal monsters" whose aim in life would be to practice sex with children. They would then really become intolerable perverts since the crime as such is recognized, and reinforced by a psychological and sociological arsenal.

Hahn&amp;nbsp;– who coordinated the debate&amp;nbsp;– remembers then that this idea leads us to the concept of the "born criminal", present in the work of Italian controversial criminologist [[Cesare Lombroso]]: "Indeed this idea that legislation, the legal system, the penal system, even medicine must concern themselves essentially with dangers, with dangerous individuals rather than acts, dates more or less from Lombroso and so it is not at all surprising if one finds Lombroso's ideas coming back into fashion", he said.

Hocquenghem considered the construction of this new type of criminal&amp;nbsp;– an individual perverse enough "to do a thing that hitherto had always been done without anybody thinking it right to stick his nose into it" – as "an extremely grave step from a political point of view":
:''"In the case of "attentat sans violence" [attack without violence], the offence in which the police have been unable to find anything, nothing at all, in that case, the criminal is simply a criminal because he is a criminal, because he has those tastes. It is what used to be called a [[crime of opinion]]. (...) The crime vanishes, nobody is concerned any longer to know whether in fact a crime was committed or not, whether someone has been hurt or not. No one is even concerned any more whether there actually was a victim."''

Hocquenghem concludes that the crime feeds upon itself in a man-hunt, by the identification and isolation of the category of individuals regarded as [[pedophile]]s, and the call for a [[lynching]] sent out by the "[[sensationalism|gutter press]]".

Jean Danet adds that this crime without violence can be used by the state for political reasons, against "inconvenient" individuals: "Incitement of a minor to commit an immoral act, for example, can be used against social workers and teachers. (...) In 1976 in Nantes, a teacher was tried for inciting minors to immoral acts, when in fact what he had done was to supply contraceptives to the boys and girls in his charge".

Danet predicted that a new form of social control would replace the legal one, had their proposal to reform the law been approved. "If it has been possible to believe for a time that there was to be a withdrawal of legislation, it was not because we thought that we were living in a liberal period but because we knew that more subtle forms of sexual supervision would be set up&amp;nbsp;– and perhaps the apparent freedom that camouflaged these more subtle, more diffuse social controls was going to extend beyond the field of the juridical and the penal".

===A society of dangers===
Foucault sees the emergence of a new [[penal system]], with the focus changing from criminal acts to the definition of [[sexual predator|dangerous individuals]]. He predicted that a society of dangers would come:
:''"We're going to have a society of dangers, with, on the one side, those who are in danger, and on the other, those who are dangerous. (...) [[human sexuality|Sexuality]] will become a threat in all [[social relations]], in all relations between members of different [[age group]]s, in all relations between individuals. And sexuality will no longer be a kind of [[behavior]] hedged in by precise prohibitions, but a kind of roaming danger, a sort of omnipresent phantom, a phantom that will be played out between men and women, children and adults, and possibly between adults themselves. It is on this shadow, this phantom, this fear that the authorities would try to get a grip through an apparently generous and, at least general, legislation and through a series of particular interventions that would probably be made by the legal institutions, with the support of the medical institutions."''

He identified the fear of others’ sexuality as the reason for this change:
:''"The [[legislator]] will not justify the measures that he is proposing by saying: the universal decency of mankind must be defended. What he will say is: there are people for whom others' sexuality may become a permanent danger".''

Foucault foresaw a new regime for the supervision of sexuality, with the intervention of legal institutions and the support of medical institutions. He completed: "I would say that the danger lay there". In his book ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975), he had already detailed his ideas against an increasing social control over the behavior of the individual.

===The establishment of a new medical power===
Foucault stressed that with this focus change to the individual, legislation appeals now to medical knowledge, giving the chance to [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]] to intervene twice: first to say that, indeed, children do have a sexuality, and second to establish that child sexuality is a territory with its own geography, that the adult must not enter.

Jean Danet added that some psychiatrists consider that sexual relations between children and adults "are always [[Psychological trauma|traumatizing]]", that the child "is marked forever", will become emotionally disturbed and if a child doesn't remember them, it's because they remain in his or her [[subconscious]].

He ponders that the intervention of psychiatrists in [[court]] is a manipulation of the children’s [[consent]], of their words.
Foucault remarks with [[irony]] the position of specialists:
:''"It could be that the child, with his own sexuality, may have desired that adult, he may even have consented, he may even have made the first moves. We may even agree that it was he who [[seduction|seduced]] the adult. But we specialists with our psychological knowledge know perfectly well that even the seducing child runs a risk, of being damaged and traumatized. (...) Consequently, the child must be 'protected from his own desires', even when his desires turn him towards an adult".''

He concludes that it is within this new legislative framework&amp;nbsp;– "basically intended to protect certain vulnerable sections of the population with the establishment of a new medical power"&amp;nbsp;– that a conception of sexuality and of the relations between child and adult sexuality will be based, and considers it as "extremely questionable".

===Guilt by association===
Hocquenghem observed that this 1977 French petition has been signed by a lot of people “who are suspect neither of being particularly pedophiles themselves nor even of entertaining [[extremism|extravagant political views]]”.

Danet pointed out that  [[lawyer]]s who choose to defend someone found [[Guilt (law)|guilt]]y of an indecent act with a [[Minor (law)|minor]] end up facing serious public backlash and are suspect of being favorable to such acts. Their experience is akin to that of lawyers defending [[terrorism|terrorists]] (as happened in the [[Klaus Croissant|Croissant affair]]),. Many, he said, avoid doing so, and prefer being appointed by the court. He said that "anyone who defends a pedophile may be suspected of having some sympathy for that cause. Even [[judge]]s think to themselves: if he defends them, it's because he isn't really as much against it himself".

He argued that “just because one is involved in a struggle against some authority, (...) this does not mean one is on the side of those who are subjected to it”. Two examples are given, dating back to the 19th and early 20th centuries: in [[France]], an open letter signed by [[Psychology|psychologists]], [[Sexology|sexologists]] and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]], asking for the decriminalization of immoral acts with minors between the ages of 15 and 18, and in [[Germany]] where a whole movement (made up of [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and members of the medical community) protested against a law that [[Criminalization|criminalized]] homosexual acts.

===Childhood and the notion of consent===
While today the very possibility of consent before puberty is [[polemic]]&amp;nbsp;– often raising emotional responses and leaving [[intellectual]]s in a defensive position, in 1977–1978 Foucault, Hocquenghem and Danet admitted openly and with naturalness the idea of a non-abusive pedophilia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The 1977 petition refers to all ages below the [[age of consent]] in France (fifteen), including the ages before [[puberty]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  The biological definition of pedophilia is recognized by the [[United Nations]] and accepted in the [[Francophone]] world.

Both Foucault and Hocquenghem agreed that consent is a contractual notion. 'This notion of consent is a trap, in any case. What is sure is that the legal form of an intersexual consent is nonsense. No one signs a contract before making love', said Hocquenghem.
:''"When we say that children are 'consenting' in these cases, all we intend to say is this: in any case, there was no violence, or organized manipulation in order to wrench out of them affective or erotic relations"'', he completed.

The journalist Pierre Hahn asks twice about how to determine an age for consent:  "Public opinion, including enlightened opinion such as that of the doctors of the Institute of Sexology ( L'Institut de Sexologie), asked at what age there can be said to be definite consent. It's a big problem. (...) If you were a legislator, you would fix no limit and you would leave it to the judges to decide whether or not an indecent act was committed with or without consent? Is that your position?". Foucault answers that "it is difficult to lay down barriers", and that this wouldn’t make any sense. He added that he discussed the subject with a judge who told him that there are eighteen-year-old girls who are practically forced to have sex with their fathers or stepfathers: "They may be eighteen, but it's an intolerable system of constraint", he said.

As for the legal aspect, the lawyer Jean Danet observed that [[conclusive presumption|violence is legally presumed]], even "in a case in which the charge used is that of indecent act without violence". This happens because the legislator believed that "it has to be said that this act without violence [defined as a crime] is the repressive, legal translation of consenting pleasure". Danet completed that "It's pretty clear how the system of proof is manipulated in opposite ways in the case of rape of women and in the case of indecent assault on a minor."

On the other side, Danet acknowledged that sometimes consent may not be present. "We are not, of course, saying that consent is always there".

He pointed out that they were very careful in the text of the petition, so as to separate [[rape]] from acts without violence:
:''"We took great care to speak exclusively of an indecent act not involving [[violence]] and incitement of a minor to commit an indecent act. We were extremely careful not to touch, in any way, on the problem of rape, which is totally different."''

He observed then that the problem of (violent) rape arouses reactions at the level of [[public opinion]], triggering off secondary effects of [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|man-hunting]], [[lynching]] and [[Moral panic|moral mobilization]].

===The credibility of children in court===
As for the [[credibility]] of children in court, Foucault begins pointing out that officially children are supposed to have a [[human sexuality|sexuality]] that can never be directed towards an adult, and are also supposed to not be capable of talking about themselves in a sufficiently lucid way. Secondly, he argues that the speech of the child is reliable in order to establish what happened, once there is sympathy enough. He said:
:''"After all, listening to a child, hearing him speak, hearing him explain what his relations actually were with someone, adult or not, provided one listens with enough [[sympathy]], must allow one to establish more or less what degree of violence, if any, was used or what degree of consent was given".''

He vehemently opposed any doubt on the child's ability to speak about the facts: "To assume that a child is incapable of explaining what happened and was incapable of giving his consent are two [[abuse]]s that are intolerable, quite unacceptable. (...) The child may be [[Trust (sociology)|trusted]] to say whether or not he was subjected to violence".

Hocquenghem observed that the [[trial]] ceremony constrains the child: "The public affirmation of consent to such acts is extremely difficult, as we know. Everybody&amp;nbsp;— judges, doctors, the defendant&amp;nbsp;– knows that the child was consenting&amp;nbsp;– but nobody says anything, because, apart from anything else, there's no way it can be introduced".

He stressed that it is impossible to express a complete [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] between an adult and a child, a relationship involving all kinds of [[affective]] contacts and going through all kinds of stages (which are not all exclusively sexual), solely in terms of consent, and that to express it in terms of legal consent is an absurdity:
:''"In any case, if one listens to what a child says and if he says 'I didn't mind', that doesn't have the legal value of 'I consent'."''

In computer science, a [[simulation]] is a computation of the execution of some appropriately modelled state-transition system. Typically this process models the complete state of the system at individual points in a discrete linear time frame, computing each state sequentially from its predecessor. Models for computer programs or VLSI logic designs can be very easily simulated, as they often have an [[operational semantics]] which can be used directly for simulation.

'''Symbolic simulation''' is a form of simulation where many possible executions of a system are considered simultaneously. This is typically achieved by augmenting the domain over which the simulation takes place. A symbolic [[Variable (programming)|variable]] can be used in the simulation state representation in order to index multiple executions of the system. For each possible valuation of these variables, there is a concrete system state that is being indirectly simulated.

Because symbolic simulation can cover many system executions in a single simulation, it can greatly reduce the size of verification problems. Techniques such as [[symbolic trajectory evaluation]] (STE) and [[generalized symbolic trajectory evaluation]] (GSTE) are based on this idea of symbolic simulation.

'''Teleconnection''' in [[atmospheric science]] refers to climate anomalies being related to each other at large distances (typically thousands of kilometers). The most emblematic teleconnection is that linking sea-level [[pressure]] at [[Tahiti]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Australia]], which defines the [[Southern Oscillation]].

== History ==
Teleconnections were first noted by the British meteorologist [[Sir Gilbert Walker]] in the late 19th century, through computation of the [[correlation]] between [[time series]] of [[atmospheric pressure]], temperature and rainfall. They served as a building block for the understanding of climate variability, by showing that the latter was not purely [[random]].

Indeed, the term [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) is an implicit acknowledgment that the phenomenon underlies variability in several locations at once. It was later noticed that associated teleconnections occurred all over North America, as embodied by the [[Pacific–North American teleconnection pattern]].

In the 1980s, improved observations allowed to detect teleconnections at larger distances throughout the [[troposphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1981)109&lt;0784:TITGHF&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=1981|volume=109|pages=784|title=Teleconnections in the Geopotential Height Field during the Northern Hemisphere Winter|last1=Wallace|first1=John M.|last2=Gutzler|first2=David S.|journal=Monthly Weather Review|issue=4|bibcode=1981MWRv..109..784W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concomitantly, the theory emerged that such patterns could be understood through the dispersion of [[Rossby waves]] due to the spherical geometry of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1981)038&lt;1179:TSLROA&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=1981|volume=38|pages=1179|title=The Steady Linear Response of a Spherical Atmosphere to Thermal and Orographic Forcing|last1=Hoskins|first1=Brian J.|last2=Karoly|first2=David J.|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|issue=6|bibcode=1981JAtS...38.1179H}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes called the "proto-model".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/97JC01444|title=Progress during TOGA in understanding and modeling global teleconnections associated with tropical sea surface temperatures|year=1998|last1=Trenberth|first1=Kevin E.|last2=Branstator|first2=Grant W.|last3=Karoly|first3=David|last4=Kumar|first4=Arun|last5=Lau|first5=Ngar-Cheung|last6=Ropelewski|first6=Chester|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=103|pages=14291|bibcode=1998JGR...10314291T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Teleconnections within the tropical Pacific began to be understood thanks to the idealized calculations of A.E. Gill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/qj.49710644905 |title=Some simple solutions for heat-induced tropical circulation |year=1980 |last1=Gill |first1=A. E. |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society |volume=106 |issue=449 |pages=447|bibcode = 1980QJRMS.106..447G }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later through more complex models.

Building upon the "proto-model", much of the early theory of teleconnections dealt with [[barotropic]], [[linear]]ized model of atmospheric flow about a constant mean state. However, the model was soon invalidated when it was discovered that actual teleconnection patterns were nearly insensitive to the location of the forcing, in direct contradiction with the predictions offered by this simple picture. 
Simmons and collaborators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1983)040&lt;1363:BWPAIA&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=1983 |volume=40 |pages=1363 |title=Barotropic Wave Propagation and Instability, and Atmospheric Teleconnection Patterns |last1=Simmons |first1=A. J. |last2=Wallace |first2=J. M. |last3=Branstator |first3=G. W. |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |issue=6|bibcode = 1983JAtS...40.1363S }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that if a more realistic background state was prescribed, it would become [[unstable]], leading to a similar pattern regardless of the location of the forcing, in accordance to observations. This "modal" property turned out to be an artifact of the barotropicity of the model, though it has appeared for more subtle reasons in more realistic models.

More recent work has shown that most teleconnections from the tropics to the extratropics can be understood to surprising accuracy by the propagation of linear, [[planetary waves]] upon a 3-dimensional seasonally-varying basic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/1520-0442(2002)015&lt;2125:NWSWTA&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=2002 |volume=15 |pages=2125 |title=Northern Winter Stationary Waves: Theory and Modeling |last1=Held |first1=Isaac M. |last2=Ting |first2=Mingfang |last3=Wang |first3=Hailan |journal=Journal of Climate |issue=16|bibcode = 2002JCli...15.2125H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the patterns are persistent over time and somewhat "locked" to geographical features such as mountain ranges, these waves are called ''[[standing wave|stationary]]''.

Another mechanism of teleconnection between tropical oceans and midlatitude regions is symmetric along latitude circles (i.e. "zonal") and between hemispheres, unlike the stationary wave mechanism. It relies on interactions between transient [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] and the mean atmospheric flow that are mutually reinforcing (i.e. [[non-linear]]). It has been shown to explain some aspects of ENSO teleconnections in temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016&lt;2960:MOHSCV&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=2003 |volume=16 |pages=2960 |title=Mechanisms of Hemispherically Symmetric Climate Variability* |last1=Seager |first1=Richard |last2=Harnik |first2=Nili |last3=Kushnir |first3=Yochanan |last4=Robinson |first4=Walter |last5=Miller |first5=Jennifer |journal=Journal of Climate |issue=18|bibcode = 2003JCli...16.2960S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1256/qj.04.96 |title=Mechanisms of ENSO-forcing of hemispherically symmetric precipitation variability |year=2005 |last1=Seager |first1=R. |last2=Harnik |first2=N. |last3=Robinson |first3=W. A. |last4=Kushnir |first4=Y. |last5=Ting |first5=M. |last6=Huang |first6=H.-P. |last7=Velez |first7=J. |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society |volume=131 |issue=608 |pages=1501|bibcode = 2005QJRMS.131.1501S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors suggested, as well, a correlation between many teleconnection patterns and local climate change factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00704-011-0554-1 |title=Inter-annual temperature and precipitation variations over the Litani Basin in response to atmospheric circulation patterns |year=2011 |last1=Ramadan |first1=H. H. |last2=Ramamurthy |first2=A. S. |last3=Beighley |first3=R. E. |journal=Theoretical and Applied Climatology |volume=108 |issue=3–4 |pages=563|bibcode = 2012ThApC.108..563R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Since tropical [[sea surface temperature]]s are predictable up to two years ahead of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature02439 |title=Predictability of El Niño over the past 148 years |year=2004 |last1=Chen |first1=Dake |last2=Cane |first2=Mark A. |last3=Kaplan |first3=Alexey |last4=Zebiak |first4=Stephen E. |last5=Huang |first5=Daji |journal=Nature |volume=428 |issue=6984 |pages=733–6 |pmid=15085127|bibcode = 2004Natur.428..733C }}&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge of teleconnection patterns gives some amount of predictability in remote locations with an outlook sometimes as long as a few seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080110043157/http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=944&amp;PageID=0&amp;cached=true&amp;mode=2&amp;userID=2 IRI Seasonal Climate Forecasts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
For instance, predicting [[El Niño]] enables prediction of North American rainfall, snowfall, droughts or temperature patterns with a few weeks to months lead time. In [[Sir Gilbert Walker]]'s time, A strong El Niño usually meant a weaker [[Monsoon#Global_monsoons|Indian monsoon]], but this [[anticorrelation]] has weakened in the 1980s and 1990s, for controversial reasons.{{fact|date=January 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">'''The Regenerative Medicine Institute''' (REMEDI), was established in 2003 as a Centre for Science, Technology &amp; Engineering in collaboration with [[National University of Ireland, Galway]].  It obtained an award of €14.9 million from [[Science Foundation Ireland]] over five years.

It conducts basic research and applied research in [[regenerative medicine]], an emerging field that combines the technologies of [[gene therapy]] and adult [[stem cell therapy]].  The goal is to use cells and genes to regenerate healthy tissues that can be used to repair or replace other tissues and organs in a minimally invasive approach.

Centres for Science, Engineering &amp; Technology help link scientists and engineers in partnerships across academia and industry to address crucial research questions, foster the development of new and existing Irish-based technology companies, attract industry that could make an important contribution to Ireland and its economy, and expand educational and career opportunities in Ireland in science and engineering. CSETs must exhibit outstanding research quality, intellectual breadth, active collaboration, flexibility in responding to new research opportunities, and integration of research and education in the fields that SFI supports.{{Unreferenced|date=March 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2768">"'''Unified Science'''" can refer to any of three related strands in contemporary thought.
* Belief in the [[unity of science]] was a central tenet of [[logical positivism]]. Different logical positivists construed this doctrine in several different ways, e.g. as a [[reductionism|reductionist]] thesis, that the objects investigated by the [[special sciences]] reduce to the objects of a common, putatively more basic domain of science, usually thought to be physics; as the thesis that all of the theories and results of the various sciences can or ought to be expressed in a common language or "universal slang"; or as the thesis that all the special sciences share a common [[scientific method|method]].
* The writings of [[Edward Haskell]] and a few associates, seeking to rework science into a single discipline employing a common artificial language. This work culminated in the 1972 publication of ''[[Full Circle (Haskell)|Full Circle: The Moral Force of Unified Science]]''.  The vast part of the work of Haskell and his contemporaries remains unpublished, however. Timothy Wilken and [[Anthony Judge]] have recently revived and extended the insights of Haskell and his coworkers.
* Unified Science has been a consistent thread since the 1940s in [[Howard T. Odum]]'s [[systems ecology]] and the associated [[Emergy Synthesis]], modeling the "[[ecosystem]]": the geochemical, biochemical, and thermodynamic processes of the [[lithosphere]] and [[biosphere]]. Modeling such earthly processes in this manner requires a science uniting geology, physics, biology, and chemistry (H.T.Odum 1995). With this in mind, Odum developed a [[Energy Systems Language | common language of science]] based on electronic schematics, with applications to ecology economic systems in mind (H.T.Odum 1994).

The '''United Nations University Institute for Sustainability and Peace''' (UNU-ISP) is an institute of the [[United Nations University|United Nations University (UNU)]], a think tank for the [[United Nations]] system which provides a bridge between the UN and the international academic and policy-making communities. UNU-ISP is based at UNU headquarters in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], with an Operating Unit located in [[Germany]] (UNU-ISP SCYCLE).

UNU-ISP seeks to achieve and promote a better understanding of three of the most pressing issues on the UN agenda: global change, peace and security, and development. With an innovative approach to sustainability, the work of the institute bridges these cross-cutting themes through research, educational and collaborative initiatives with the aim of solving current problems and anticipating future challenges.

== Overview ==
As an institute of the United Nations University, UNU-ISP is bound by the UNU Charter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://unu.edu/administration/charter |title=UNU Charter }}&lt;/ref&gt; and guidelines set out by the UNU Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unu.edu/council/ |title=UNU Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;
UNU-ISP works in collaboration with other UNU institutes and programmes, as well as through collaborative relationships with the global academic and policy-making communities.
Within the context of sustainability and peace, UNU-ISP:
* Conducts research; undertakes education, training and capacity development; and facilitates the dissemination of scientific knowledge and information to the United Nations and its agencies, to scholars and to the public.
* Provides opportunities for postgraduate students and professionals to obtain a wider understanding of relevant issues.
* Integrates the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities into a transdisciplinary approach that contributes to the development and strengthening of policy frameworks and management actions at all levels.
UNU-ISP offers a [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] programme, the Master of Science in Sustainability, Development, and Peace. This two-year programme addresses pressing global issues through an innovative interdisciplinary approach that integrates the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.

== History ==

UNU-ISP became operational on 1 January 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://update.unuhq.info/2009/01/18/unu-launches-new-research-and-educational-institute-in-tokyo/  |title=UNU launches new academic institute in Tokyo : A newsletter of the United Nations University }}&lt;/ref&gt; to give an institutional identity and profile to the integrated academic activities of two former UNU programmes: the Environment and Sustainable Development Programme, and the Peace and Governance Programme. The institute combines the strengths in natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities of these two former programmes, and creates trans-disciplinary synergies that can more effectively address pressing global problems of human survival, development and welfare.

'''Université Laval''' ({{lang-en|'''Laval University'''}}) is a [[French-language]], public [[research university]] in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The University was founded by [[royal charter]] issued by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1852, with roots in the founding of the [[Séminaire de Québec]] in 1663 by [[François de Laval|François de Montmorency-Laval]], making it the oldest centre of higher education in Canada and the first North American institution to offer higher education in French. The university, whose campus was erected from the 1950s onward in the suburban borough of [[Sainte-Foy–Sillery–Cap-Rouge]], is ranked among the top ten Canadian universities in terms of research funding&lt;ref&gt;Université Laval. [http://www.scom.ulaval.ca/Presentation/anglais/background.html "Université Laval at a Glance"]. (accessed 17 April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and holds four Canada Excellence Research Chairs.

==History==
[[File:François de Laval - Project Gutenberg eText 17174.jpg|thumb|left|200px|François de Laval]] 
[[File:Grand-Séminaire-Québec.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The Old Séminaire de Québec today]]
The university began as the [[Séminaire de Québec]], which was founded in 1663 by [[François de Laval|François de Montmorency-Laval]], a member of the [[House of Laval]] and the first [[Bishop of New France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/32699/32699-h/32699-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Makers of Canada: Index and Dictionary of Canadian History, Edited by Lawrence Johnstone Burpee and Arthur G. Doughty.|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the French Regime the institution mainly trained priests to serve in [[New France]]. After the [[Conquest of 1760]], the British expanded education in Canada to include the liberal arts. French Canadians had at the time no opportunity to pursue higher education, and [[Ignace Bourget|Bishop Bourget]] of Montreal suggested expanding the Séminaire de Québec into Université Laval. [[Louis-Jacques Casault|Louis Casault]], a priest who taught physics at the Séminaire de Québec, went to Europe to seek a royal charter and study the best university systems there.

The Séminaire de Québec was granted a royal charter on December 8, 1852, by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], at the request of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] (Governor-General of the Province of Canada), creating Université Laval with "the rights and privileges of a university".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0001990 Laval University/Université Laval&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816195903/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0001990 |date=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter was signed in 1852. [[Pope Benedict XV]] approved the plan and authorized the institution to establish chairs of theology and confer degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6466.mobile The Project Gutenberg EBook #6466 of 'The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People, A historical review' by John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, February 17th, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the university opened a second campus in [[Montreal]], which became the [[Université de Montréal]] on May 8, 1919, by a writ of [[Pope Benedict XV]]. In 1971, a second charter transferred all authority to the Université Laval council.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

By 1925, the university had outgrown its location. The Old City was very crowded, making it difficult to add new buildings to the campus. The university moved to [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]] in the 1950s, which at the time was a semi-rural community west of the Quebec city centre. The School of Architecture returned to the old building (now affectionately referred to as ''Le Vieux Séminaire'') in 1989.

Université Laval is governed by a board of governors and a faculty senate. This structure was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to serve as a link between the two bodies and lead the institution.&lt;ref name=langton1906&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DfNNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA306|title=The University of Toronto and its colleges, 1827-1906|last=Langton|first=Hugh Hornby|last2=Macallum|first2=Archibald Byron|publisher=The University Library, pub. by the librarian|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|306}}

In the early part of the 20th century, the need for higher education expanded beyond the classical fields of theology, law and medicine, and the university introduced science and social-science departments such as forestry and household science.&lt;ref name=langton1906 /&gt;{{rp|1904}} In addition, graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

"Laval", a waltz by French-Canadian ragtime composer, [[Wilfrid Beaudry]], was dedicated to the students at Laval University and the University of Montreal. The music for piano was published in Québec by J. Beaudry, circa 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2016-07-01T18%3A38%3A44Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;rft_dat=16182129&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fcollectionscanada.gc.ca%3Aamicus&amp;lang=eng |title= Laval |newspaper=Amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1906  |author=Wilfrid Beaudry |accessdate= July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university opened its department of social, political, and economic sciences in 1938, signalling a change of approach that continued into the 1960s, based on an idea of higher education as the key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and society.&lt;ref&gt;Behiels, Michael, "Le père Georges-Henri Lévesque et l'établissement des sciences sociales à Laval: 1938–1955", Revue de l'Université d'Ottawa 52, no. 3 (juil.-sept. 1982). Appears in English translation in "Youth, University, and Canadian Society", edited by Paul Axelrod and John G. Reid. Kingston and Montreal: McGill-Queen's University of Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The royal charter that founded Université Laval in 1852 was designated a National Historic Event in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=1378&amp;oqeName=Laval+University&amp;oqfName=Universit%E9+Laval National Historic Event] {{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings and features==
After it was granted a university charter, several buildings were built in Old Quebec, including the School of Chemistry (1923), the addition on Ste. Famille Street (1931), the Mining School (1938), and the cafeteria building (1945), all by architect Joseph Simeon Bergeron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1103|title=Bergeron, Joseph Simeon|publisher=|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the neighborhood was already crowded and activities later moved in nearby Sainte-Foy, which was more spacious. 

===Campus building===
Today's campus covers {{cvt|1.2|km2}} and has over 30 buildings (also called ''pavillons''), including many iconic exemplars of [[modern architecture]]. Its earliest buildings and landscapes were designed by [[Edouard Fiset]] ([[:fr:Édouard Fiset|fr]]) from the 1950s, and of its lands, 56 percent are wooded areas, grasslands, and sports fields{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} .

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Other infrastructures===
Pratically all buildings are linked by {{cvt|10|km}} of underground walkways, which are particularly useful in the winter and whose walls are mostly covered by murals painted by student associations and student visitors over the years, as well as graffiti. The campus is also home to the ''Roger-Van den Hende'' botanical garden ([[:fr:Jardin universitaire Roger-Van den Hende|fr]]) which contains some 67 species of deciduous and coniferous trees and 60 different species of birds. The Louis-Jacques-Casault building also hosts the regional branch of the [[Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec|National Archives of Quebec]]. The sport building is called [[PEPS]] and is said to be the largest sport complex in eastern Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.quebecoriginal.com/en-ca/listing/things-to-do/sports-and-nature/skating-rinks/pavillon-de-leducation-physique-et-des-sports-peps-universite-laval-230331533 |title=Pavillon de l'Éducation physique et des sports (PEPS) (Université Laval) |website=Québec Original |access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is adjacent to the covered TELUS stadium ([[:fr:Stade TELUS-Université Laval|fr]]).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Programs==
As of 2002, Université Laval offered over 350 programs to more than 38,000 students. The university also attracts more than 2,500 foreign students annually, and has almost 1,000 students drawn from Canadian provinces outside of Quebec. Many students come to the university for the ''Français pour non-francophones'' program that offers instruction in French as a second language to students from Canada and around the world. It is also the only university in Quebec which trains forestry engineers.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Since the mid-1980s, Université Laval has offered distance learning; over 30 programs and 400 courses are offered by distance learning, of which 80% are accessible from the internet.

While primarily dominated by men throughout history, women have been represented in the field of comedy since the mid 1700s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wsupress.wayne.edu/books/detail/laughing-feminism|title=Laughing Feminism Subversive Comedy in Frances Burney and Maria Edgeworth|date=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|last1=Bilger|first1=Audrey|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy|date=2002|publisher=Sarah Crichton Books|last1=Kohen|first1=Yael}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy]], or creative works with the intention of humor, is thought to have originated in ancient Greek theatre in 425 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&amp;pg=PR9|title=Lysistrata|last=Aristophanes|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Nick Hern Books|isbn=978-1-85459-325-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the first figures to enter the field, however, were faced with resistance and discrimination.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|work=MAKERS|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/01/hitchens200701|title=Why Women Aren't Funny|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of humor in women was previously thought to have meant the ability to laugh at a man's joke, rather than tell the joke herself.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When women did finally enter comedy (in its various forms), it was seen as niche, thus making bookings hard to come by.

Early acts were often based in the standard roles of women as a housewife and mother.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Comedy was tailored to what men would find to be both funny and non-threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As women gained slow acceptance to their presence in comedy, they were able to expand the topics that they covered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since then, women have made significant gains in the field, having found fame through stand-up, television, movies, and writing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women such as [[Amy Schumer]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Gina Barreca]] and many others have contributed to the world of comedy, spanning both time and medium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As comedic license has grown, comedy has become a tool within the scope of [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; By reclaiming a previously male-exclusive art form, female comedians are able to use patriarchal structure against itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Today, feminist comedy draws attention to female issues such as [[menstruation]], [[rape]], [[gender inequality]], beauty norms, and [[machismo]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As a readily acceptable and understandable medium of communication, comedy lends itself to the feminist movement, allowing women's issues to be more wide-spread in general society.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Comedic forms==

===Stand-up===
Stand-up comedy is a form of comedy in which performers act in front of a live audience, creating an interactive dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dz-hsuL3r_QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=stand%20up&amp;f=false|title=Look Who's Laughing: Gender and Comedy|last=Finney|first=Gail|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9782881246449|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes range from short one-liners to longer monologues. The comedic form requires a takeover the stage, in order for the comedian's material to "kill."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For women, the direct contact with the audience puts their womanhood on display. Many female comedians choose to wear loose-fitting clothing to take their femininity out of the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitchmedia.org/post/here-is-whats-scary-about-being-a-female-stand-up-comic|title=Here is What's Scary About Being a Female Stand-Up Comic. {{!}} Bitch Media|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late night television===
[[File:SamanthaBeeFeb2011.jpg|thumb|[[Samantha Bee]] at a [[Hudson Union Society]] event in February 2011]]
American late night television (''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' etc...) has been dominated by white men for almost its entire existence. With the exception of ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee|Full Frontal]]'' with [[Samantha Bee]], no woman has had a late night show on a major network of her own. The platform allows a variety of comedic  (monologues and shorts) and political (interviews and exposés) opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexandra-popken/why-its-time-for-a-woman-_b_6813704.html|title=Why It's Time for a Woman to Host a Late Night Talk Show|last=Popken|first=Alexandra|date=2015-03-06|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/137160/why-are-there-so-few-female-late-night-hosts#.migMKG8nY|title=Why Are There So Few Female Late-Night Hosts?|last=Mic|work=Mic|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Film in general, as well as comedic film, continues to show the gender imbalance of other forms of comedy. In 2014, a study found that there were 2.24 male characters for every one female character. Of the movies surveyed, only 30.9% of the speaking characters were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/20-mustknow-facts-about-g_b_5869564.html|title=20 Facts Everyone Should Know About Gender Bias in Movies|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|date=2014-09-24|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one of the major storylines in the film industry (the romantic comedy), consistently follows traditional female roles, relegating women to simply searching for a male partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/14/romantic-comedies-failing-women_n_7026302.html|title=How Romantic Comedies Are Failing Women (And How To Fix It)|last=Karlin|first=Lily|date=2015-04-14|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender imbalance==
The gender imbalance between men and women can be found all over, even on Wikipedia. The page: [[list of comedians]] show a much higher number of males than females.

===In pay===
In the [[United States]], there is a large gender gap between men and women in comedy with regards to both pay and number.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ozy.com/acumen/stand-ups-gender-gap/4661|title=It's Really No Joke|last=Humphries|first=Will|work=OZY|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, all ten of the top ten paid comedians were male, bringing in a total of $173 million.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2016, one female entered the list: [[Amy Schumer]], at number two.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etcanada.com/photos/170240/forbes-list-of-highest-paid-comedians-for-2016/#image-170249|title=Forbes’ List Of Highest-Paid Comedians For 2016|last=Crisp|first=Gavin|website=etcanada.com|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In appearances===
A study in 2017 found a large gender imbalance in UK comedic panel shows, with only 31% of the appearances. However, the same study also found marked improvement since 1989, when the statistic was 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://strudel.org.uk/panelshows/index.html|title=UK Panel Show Gender Breakdown|website=strudel.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the UK industry website Chortle lists 269 female comedian as compared to 1,279 male comedians.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Imbalance can also be seen at the level of the comedy club. For example, the prestigious New York comedy club [[Carolines on Broadway|Carolines]] featured 20% female performers to 80% male in 2014.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Within the writers room, gender imbalance persists. Women made up only 10 percent of writers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films of 2010 and 15 percent of writers and 18 percent of creators in prime-time television during the 2010–2011 season.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In South Korea, of 70 comedic variety shows, 13 had all male hosts and guests, and 23 with all male hosts, meaning that more than half of these shows lack female hosts.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Only two shows had all females hosts and guests.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Shows without hosts often try to model marriages by pairing up male and female celebrities.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; While this does achieve some sense of gender balance, it uses very traditional roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Gendering of humor==
The early female figures in stand up, such as [[Phyllis Diller]], were able to enter the mainstream through their willingness to self-deprecate and declare themselves ugly. Other early female comediennes, such as [[Mae West]] and [[Helen Kane]], used [[sex appeal]] to attract male audiences. In other words, they were able to enter, but on the terms of male comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queens of comedy: Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Joan Rivers, and the new generation of funny women|last=Horowitz|first=Susan|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modern female comedians cite a need to tailor their comedy to what men would find to be funny, with change in this mentality only coming very recently.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===In stand-up===
[[Stand-up comedy|Stand up comedy]], in particular, is described as a masculine art form.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=MAKERS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words that are used to describe success are often violent, such as ''killed'' or ''annihilated.''&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The performer must take charge of the stage, claiming it as their own via the phallic symbol of the microphone.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The structure of joke is often centered on an attack on another party. The aggression that such an art form necessitates is encouraged in males but discouraged in females.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karen|first=Stoddard|year=1977|title="WOMEN HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOR" AND OTHER MYTHS: A CONSIDERATION OF FEMALE STAND-UP COMICS, 1960–1976|journal=American Humor|volume=4|pages=|jstor=42594582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination against women==
In many societies around the world, a woman's role has affected her flexibility in comedy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caliskan|first=Sevda|date=1995-01-01|title=Is There Such a Thing as Women's Humor?|journal=American Studies International|volume=33|issue=2|pages=49–59|jstor=41279344}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries that historically view women as inferior to men, comedy is seen as a masculine discipline.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The common perception that women aren't funny pervades all aspects of comedy, including stand-up, television, and movies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The comedy establishment, influenced by patriarchal society, has relegated women to the "side of tears and loss." Systematic sexism can be found at the level of audience members, bookers, agents, and male comics.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2015/10/discrimination-female-comedians/|title=The unfunny things that happen to funny women|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a powerful social tool, comedy brings women outside of the traditional role that has been defined as theirs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Women have experience everything from [[Heckler|heckling]] audience members calling them gendered terms like bitches or sluts, to being invited to fake comedic festivals (so the organizer could have sex with the female comedian), to being introduced in roasts as the girl that "slept with one of the judges."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Feminist tool==
Humor has been used a tool of feminism both for its ability to point out patriarchy and the structures it creates as well as identify the common female experience.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bing|first=Janet|year=2004|title=Is Feminist Humor an Oxymoron?|url=http://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=english_fac_pubs|journal=Women and Language|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction must be made between female humor and feminist humor. Female humor is self-deprecatory, turning inwards to the performer herself.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor, by contrast, looks outwards at the societal structures that demean women. It is aggressive and pointed, using comedic language formerly reserved for men only as a tool of liberation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor is to be an agent of change for women by drawing attention to their lowered position in society.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knobloch|first=Susan|date=1996-01-01|title=Review of The Unruly Woman: Gender and the Genres of Laughter|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=50|issue=2|pages=58–60|doi=10.2307/1213431|jstor=1213431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Bing argues that for feminist humor to be most effective at its goal of change, it should be inclusive, rather than divisive.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Divisive humor, or jokes that focus on male structures or male-bashing, do not advance feminism, but rather continue to marginalize females.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Inclusive humor that riffs off of the shared experience of women, can be subversive without the negative effects of divisive humor.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Bing continues to say that when humor falls into this inclusive comedy it contributes to feminism by first, contradicting the age old stereotype that women cannot be funny, and second, by undermining the status quo.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Humor itself can be used to make strong structural changes in a society. Many times humor has been used to subvert hierarchical structures. For example, the [[Guerrilla Girls]] used humor to point out the patriarchal, unchanging nature of the Tony awards, which give the majority of their prizes to men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It also functions to establish an in-group (those making and understanding the joke) and an out-group (those on the receiving end).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Through this process, humor can create solidarity within a group, but can also make another feel excluded.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For women, this can serve to strengthen them as a community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Representation worldwide==

===Bangladesh===
Outside of the United States, women have been having similar experiences in their attempts to enter field of comedy, colored by their own cultural influences. One such women is [[Farhana Muna]], a Bangladeshi Muslim comic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Her material is focused on Bangladeshi life and culture, from parties to relatives commenting on weight loss. According to Muna, she often feels constrained by what is deemed appropriate or not for a Bangladeshi Muslim women. She must watch what she says and wears. Muna reemphasized the sentiment that there is a wider range of comedy acceptable for men. She has also faced criticism for her actions, including her choice to not wear the [[hijab]], with people calling her a bad Muslim. However, she continues her comedic work due to the community of women that she has met through it. Muna sees comedy as a collective platform of expression, a way to share her experiences in a relatable way.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anushay-hossain/becoming-munatic-how-a-ba_b_9283354.html|title=Becoming Munatic: How a Bangladeshi Woman is Changing the Rules of Comedy Online|last=Hossain|first=Anushay|date=2016-02-22|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Women have been on the rise in India's comedy as recently as 2016. In a country that has deeply entrenched patriarchal values, these female comedians face great amounts of cultural animosity.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Female-Stand-Up-Comedians-India/#.n0ztf1urd|title=These Female Comedians Are Taking The Stand-Up Industry By Storm, One Joke At A Time|last=ScoopWhoop|date=2016-04-22|work=ScoopWhoop|access-date=2017-04-07|language=En}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this discrimination women such as [[Aditi Mittal]] and [[Neeti Palta]] have found success in an industry that did not readily accept them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], female comedians do not encounter many comedic opportunities.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/asia/korean-tv-gender-imbalance-1202019919/|title=Korean TV’s Gender Imbalance No Laughing Matter|last=Kil|first=Sonia|date=2017-04-03|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two television programs are completely hosted by females, with the other major television opportunity being couples shows. South Korean TV shows only offer gender balance when women are in gendered roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Producers see men as more advantageous hires as the shows' audiences are majority women. Additionally, there was a worry that audiences would react badly to strong women in television.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; As the woman's movement grows in South Korea, so too do the opportunities for women. Rather than featuring beautiful women as prizes to be won by males contestants, new shows such as ''[[Sister's Slam Dunk|Sisters' Slam Dunk]]'' (which premiered in 2016) feature women working together to solve problems.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Figures==
=== Phyllis Diller ===
One of the most prominent early figures in American female comedy, [[Phyllis Diller]] made her comedic debut at the Purple Onion Comedy Club in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/phyllis-diller-9542308#breakthrough-role|title=Phyllis Diller|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stand-up routines focused on the problems of the suburban [[housewife]], a previous unaddressed area by male comics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By opening acknowledging her lack of physical attractiveness and by incorporating self-deprecation into her routines, Diller was able to enter comedy in a time when funny and attractive women were seen as threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, by confining her comedy to her inability to fulfill her traditional role, she reinforced female stereotypes rather than dismissing them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Joan Rivers===
[[Joan Rivers]] (active from 1959–2014) was one of the first female comedians to utilize the "talk/conversational" method, one that was suited to television talk shows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike [[Phyllis Diller]], who was quite unlike her comedic personality, the comedy of Joan Rivers more closely reflected her personality. She often drew on her own personal experiences as a self-proclaimed Jewish princess.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike her predecessors, Rivers did not downplay her attractiveness, but rather incorporated it into her riffs on life as a single woman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Still, her comedy was focused on the traditional problems of a women (trying to find a boyfriend and husband, being a good wife etc).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Jane Curtin===
[[Jane Curtin]] was a part of the inaugural class of [[Not Ready For Prime Time Players|Not Ready for Prime Time Players]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1975. On SNL, she was the anchor for Weekend Update and started in many well known skits including ''Coneheads''.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jane-curtin-222399|title=Jane Curtin|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Weekend Update, she served as the liberal counterpart to Dan Aykroyd’s conservative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/womens-blog/2015/feb/16/saturday-night-live-40-eight-feminist-milestones|title=Saturday Night Live at 40: Eight feminist milestones|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=2015-02-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, when asked about the environment at [[Saturday Night Live]], Curtin said that female writers faced an extremely difficult battle, especially when cast member like [[John Belushi]] were actively working against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/womens-blog/2015/feb/16/saturday-night-live-40-eight-feminist-milestones|title=Saturday Night Live at 40: Eight feminist milestones|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=2015-02-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; While fundamentally believing that women are not capable of humor, he also would sabotage pieces written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/04/jane_curtain_reveals_john_belu.html|title=Jane Curtin Says John Belushi Was a Total Sexist|date=2011-04-12|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this atmosphere, Jane Curtin had a very successful career at SNL and went on to work on sitcoms, Broadway, and various movies.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

===Tina Fey===
[[File:Amy Poehler and Tina Fey by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Female comedians [[Tina Fey]] (left) and [[Amy Poehler]] (right) at an event from the movie ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]'']]
Figures such as [[Tina Fey]] have paved the way in the modern era for large-scale growth in female comedy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauzen|first=Martha|date=2014-01-02|title=The Funny Business of Being Tina Fey: Constructing a (feminist) comedy |journal=Feminist Media Studies| volume=14|issue=1|pages=106–117|doi=10.1080/14680777.2012.740060|issn=1468-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her public appointment as the first female head writer of [[Saturday Night Live]] placed her in a position to serve as a feminist comedy icon.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Many of her sketches became iconic, particularly her satirical portrayal of Vice Presidential Candidate [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flowers|first=Arhlene A.|last2=Young|first2=Cory L.|date=2010-01-01|title=Parodying Palin: How Tina Fey’s Visual and Verbal Impersonations Revived a Comedy Show and Impacted the 2008 Election|journal=Journal of Visual Literacy|volume=29|issue=1|pages=47–67|doi=10.1080/23796529.2010.11674673|issn=1051-144X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her comedic writing ([[Mean Girls]], [[30 Rock]], [[Bossypants]], [[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]], Date Night etc...), in addition to achieving great public notice, was well received by critics.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Miranda Hart===
[[Miranda Hart]] is a female comedian from the UK. She is most well-known for her television series ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]].'' Her awkward and clumsy character in the show is a embodiment of all the society neuroses that women face in daily life.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/dec/01/miranda-hart-tv-queen-uncool|title=Miranda Hart – TV's queen of uncool|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|date=2010-12-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a style of comedy makes her into an everywoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Gd6_BwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=miranda+hart+comedy&amp;ots=V1My1fB1Yb&amp;sig=Fsgbg21vUl-k_8m6zx_oWUIfwr4#v=onepage&amp;q=miranda%20hart%20comedy&amp;f=false|title=Twenty-first Century Feminism: Forming and Performing Femininity|last=Nally|first=C.|last2=Smith|first2=A.|date=2015-02-27|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137492852|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart herself sees a divide in comedy, with some using comedy as a tool to increase their coolness (others) and some using comedy as a tool for clowning around (her).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; By staying within the clowning realm of comedy, she achieved a cult following.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
