'''''American Art''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scholarly journal]] dedicated to exploring all aspects of the [[Visual arts of the United States|American visual art]] from colonial to contemporary times. It seeks to promote sound scholarship and thought-provoking interpretation on topics in the [[fine art]]s, [[popular culture]], [[public art]], [[film]], [[electronics|electronic]] [[multimedia]], [[decorative art]]s, and [[handicrafts|handicraft]]. Through a broad interdisciplinary approach, the journal provides readers with a richer understanding not only of specific artists and objects, but also of the cultural factors that have shaped American visual culture over three centuries. ''American Art'' embraces all methods of investigation to explore the nation's rich and diverse artistic legacy. It is published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] and was known until 1991 as ''Smithsonian Studies in American Art''.

The '''Arts District''' is a neighborhood on the eastern edge of [[Downtown Los Angeles]], California, United States. The gritty area has given new life to old industrial buildings whose history often dates to the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="LAT 3-7/2015"/&gt; While much of the early creative art was done behind closed doors, the street scene has slowly been activated in the early years of the 21st century as more and more factories are creatively reused with some new construction interspersed.&lt;ref name="LAT 20130120"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/20/business/la-fi-commre-arts-district-20130120|title=Gaining Traction: Trendy shops, eateries and offices transform downtown L.A.'s arts district|date= January 20, 2013|first=Roger |last=Vincent|access-date=29 July 2017|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art galleries]] have opened and given recognition to the area amidst the entire downtown where [[Art museums]] and additional galleries can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/the-downtowners-of-distinction/article_1b311095-358e-5d39-ab5b-351f6dcb9c1a.html|title=The Downtowners of Distinction|first=Jon |last=Regardie|date= February 18, 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Downtown News]]|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city community planning boundaries are [[Alameda Street]] on the west which blends into [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]], [[First Street (Los Angeles)|First Street]] on the north, the [[Los Angeles River]] to the east, and Violet Street on the south.

==Early history==
Spanish Father Juan Crespi founded what is now known as the Arts District in 1796 during an expedition going to Alta California. During his journey he discovered a body of water that was surrounded by rich soil, this then inspired a passage into his observation journal that states: "Should a town be needed in this location, this site shall be called Our Lady Queen of the Angels." The small pueblo was declared a new territory for the Spanish and was officially founded on September 4, 1781.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdistrictla.org/arts-district-history/|title=Founding a city|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignes Street winds through the northeastern edge of the Arts District, parallel to and a couple of blocks west of the broad cement trench that memorializes the L.A. River. It is named for [[Jean-Louis Vignes]], an aging adventurer and vintner who arrived in Los Angeles in 1831 by way of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) and Bordeaux. He planted grapes on 104 acres where Cabernet and Sauvignon Blanc vines imported from the south of France thrived, and by 1849 El Aliso - what the Vignes vineyard was entitled, called so after the sacred local sycamore tree of the same name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lapl.org/collections-resources/blogs/lapl/forgotten-los-angeles-history-el-aliso-big-tree-los-angeles |title=Forgotten Los Angeles History: El Aliso, the Big Tree of Los Angeles &amp;#124; Los Angeles Public Library |publisher=Lapl.org |date=2018-04-27 |access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - was the largest producer of wine in California. The grapes are gone, but the San Antonio Winery just north of the community is a reminder of the area’s past.

By the late 19th century, oranges and grapefruit had replaced grapes as the principal agricultural products of the area and the property west of the riverbank was thick with citrus groves. The groves provided a location for filmmaker DW Griffith who filmed parts of Hollywood’s first feature film (''In Old California'') there in 1909. A single grapefruit tree remains, towering over the Japanese American Plaza off San Pedro Street and Azusa. Somewhere near Third Street and Alameda, a print shop became the area’s first commercial arts enterprise, employing artists from around the region designing labels for the boxes of citrus fruit shipped across the country.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The growing [[Santa Fe Freight Depot]] and warehouses created to serve the citrus industry’s shipping needs determined the area’s economic character for most of the next century and were responsible for the architectural flavor of the Arts District structures that have survived earthquakes, flood and fire. The single room hotels for rail workers to the northwest and the growth of Little Tokyo to the west and [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] to the north created a mix that was working class and cosmopolitan.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

By World War II, the citrus groves had been replaced by factories and the rail freight business was giving way to the trucking industry. The area had taken on an industrial character that was growing seedy around the edges.&lt;ref name="LAT 20130120"/&gt; Over the next twenty years, many of the independent small manufacturers had either been absorbed by larger competitors, grown too big for their quarters – or simply failed—and an increasing number of vacant warehouse and former factory spaces contributed to a dingy, decaying urban environment typical of many aging big American cities of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/17/local/la-me-ln-downtown-security-pullout-20130517|title=Private security patrols pull out of downtown Arts District|date= May 17, 2013|access-date=28 July 2017|first=Gale |last=Holland|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's many manufacturing companies fled oversees or were overtaken by larger manufacturing companies, resulting in vacant buildings and bringing property values down. Artists who were struggling to pay rent in the city started moving to the Arts District in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Before 1979 the Arts District buildings had been zoned for industrial use only. It wasn't until 1979 that the State of California passed a live/work legislation {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and in 1981 Los Angeles passed the bill Artist-In-Residence (AIR) . This new bill AIR would allow artists to live legally in the areas that could no longer be used for industrial use as long as they attained a business license. To make the living standards more comfortable the building code was lifted.New regulations had been created and the AIR legislation required the lofts to have a room to sleep, fire alarm, and other requirements for them to live legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Lindsey|date=2014|title="Isolation and authenticity in Los Angeles' arts district neighborhood"|url=|journal=Dissertations &amp; Theses Global: The Humanities and Social Sciences Collection|volume=|page=157|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art scene==
In 1969, [[Allen Ruppersberg]] presented ''Al's Cafe'' at 1913 West Sixth Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.christinewongyap.com/tag/als-cafe/|title=Al’s Cafe - R+D|website=blog.christinewongyap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the mid-'70s, a handful of artists, including Joel Bass, Dan Citron, Woods Davy, Marc Kreisel, [[Jon Peterson (artist)|Jon Peterson]], Stephen Seemayer, Maura Sheehan, [[Coleen Sterritt]], Sydney Littenberg, Peter Zecher, and others saw opportunity in the empty buildings and began colonizing the area, converting former industrial and commercial spaces into working studios, sometimes renting space for as little as a three cents a square foot and carving out living quarters. This resulted in a surge of artistic activity, culminating in the highly controversial "Downtown L.A. in Santa Barbara" exhibition, organized by Betty Klausner for the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum, which is now known as the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara. By the mid 1980s, the following artists were also living downtown: Linda Frye Burman, James Croak, [[Merion Estes]], Joe Fay, [[George Herms]], Mary Jones, Constance Mallinson, [[Paul McCarthy]], Margaret Nielson, Richard Newton, Margit Omar, [[Lari Pittman]], John Schroeder, Judy Simonian, [[Andy Wilf]], and Takako Yamaguchi.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Stephen Seemayer's film ''The Young Turks''(2012) documents the 1979–1981 years.

In 1979, Marc Kreisel opened [[Al's Bar (American Hotel)|Al's Bar]] opened in the American Hotel on Hewitt just off Traction. This legendary punk rock venue was the training ground for [[Sonic Youth]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Beck]], [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], [[the Residents]], introducing generations of Angelenos to dozens of emerging groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/16/news/cl-34651 |title=Raise a Glass for Al's Bar--It's Last Call |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Laurie |last=Pike |date=August 16, 2001 |access-date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular sound band "Party Boys" played the bars and art events.Also known as the downtown artists' central meeting place, Al's Bar occasionally hosted art exhibitions. Al's Bar, the west coast's oldest punk club,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} finally closed in 2001, and the American Hotel received a facelift in 2012 and was renamed the American Apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/upgrades-for-arts-district-projects/article_6d01e57a-6fb6-11e1-888b-001871e3ce6c.html|title=Upgrades for Arts District Projects|first=Richard|last=Guzmán|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LA Artcore, founded in 1976 by Lydia Takeshita with the purpose of exhibiting local artists, exists today in locations at [[the Brewery Art Colony]] and in [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]]. The Atomic Cafe on 1st Street at Alameda was an artists and musicians haunt in the late 1970s and early 1980s. [[Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions]] (LACE) created exhibitions at its gallery space, located in the late 70s on Broadway St before moving to Industrial Street in the 1980s. Several commercial art galleries, including Oranges and Sardines, Kirk DeGoyer Gallery, the Downtown Gallery, Vanguard Gallery, Exile, and Galleria by the Water opened in the late seventies, only to close in the early eighties. Cirrus Editions, the first gallery to open downtown, remains open.

Around 1980, [[Jon Peterson (artist)|Jon Peterson]] and Stephen Seemayer opened “DTLA," a club that had exactly one show before it closed, adjacent the Atomic Cafe. [[High Performance Magazine]] used DTLA as its performance space until its one-year lease was up. During that year, [[Paul McCarthy]] performed ''Monkey Man'' during the Public Spirit Performance Festival, Part 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://charlesrivacollection.com/images/artistsProfile/resume/PaulMcCarthy-2.pdf ]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name DTLA was later adopted by the neighboring coffee house where [[Beck]] got his start.

In 1981, the City of Los Angeles passed its "Artist in Residence" or "AIR" ordinance, which allowed residential use of formerly industrial and commercially zoned buildings; artists had long used such spaces as living quarters illegally, and the AIR law sought to bring this practice into legality and regulation.&lt;ref name=Gerber&gt;Gerber, Marisa (July 29, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-arts-district-20140730-story.html "Arts District's changing landscape is worrisome to longtime residents"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Retrieved 15 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Art galleries, cafes and performance venues opened as the live/work population grew. 
During the '80s, Bedlam, created by artist Jim Fittipaldi,  on 6th Street (and later, briefly, in the former premises of Al’s bar) was a salon with drawing workshops, art installations, theater, live music and a speakeasy. Dangerous Curve, on a dangerous curve of 4th Place between Mateo and Molino, put on exhibitions of artists whose work was often difficult to categorize. The Spanish Kitchen, a warehouse space on Third near Traction, was home to series of happenings, events, raves, installations and blowout parties. It now houses the 3rd Steakhouse and Lounge, an eatery that hosts community events and exhibitions of works by local artists. Cocola (later known as the 410 Boyd St. Bar and Grill), the legendary artists’ bar just west of the Arts District, lives on as Escondite.

In 1985, Fritz Frauchiger curated "Off the Street," a "one-time art exhibition" sponsored by the Cultural Affairs Department in the Old City Print Shop, which featured paintings, sculptures, photographs and installations by 48 Los Angeles artists, most of whom lived downtown.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Frauchiger. ''Off the Street''. City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the nonprofit group Downtown Arts Development Association (DADA) was formed as a spinoff of LARABA by several artist members of the LARABA board of directors in order to provide a platform for the burgeoning downtown art scene; DADA hosted exhibits of more than 400 downtown artists in 1994–1998. [[File:DADA 1994 Artists.jpg|thumb|DADA 1994 Artists]]After 1994, the heart of the Arts District was Bloom’s General Store, presided over by Joel Bloom, a veteran of Chicago’s Second City, who became an advocate for the community and who is remembered as The Arts District’s once and only unofficial mayor. Bloom died in 2007, but his memory is honored with a plaque from the city declaring the triangle around Third, Traction and Rose to be Joel Bloom Square.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Valerie J.

== Transportation ==
&lt;p&gt;The Arts District is strategically located near the center of Downtown LA making it easier accessible for alternate forms of transportation. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) Gold Line station is located along Alameda St. The cross section streets are along East First St. and East Temple St. The small neighborhood is also serviced by the Los Angeles Department of Transportations (LADOT) DASH bus making several stops on Hewitt St. Additionally, Metro offers a bike share program in many neighborhoods around the Arts District area. The following five stations currently available to pick up or leave a bike are listed below. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdistrictla.org/getting-around/|title=Getting Around|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;740 E 3rd St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;999 E 3rd St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1245 Factory Place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1301 Willow St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;720 E Temple St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;There are a total of sixteen parking lots scattered around the Arts District. As the area became a social hub for Angelinos, parking became an issue to the local resident. Public and private lots/ structures including on street parking offer a variety of parking options for visitors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1EJFA_enUS736US736&amp;tbm=lcl&amp;ei=8VvqWveZOcT2zgKQ6LOwCw&amp;q=arts+district+parking+lots&amp;oq=arts+district+parking+lots&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i22i29i30k1.1898.1898.0.2297.1.1.0.0.0.0.145.145.0j1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.140....0.Lb8Ex5FJAs0#rlfi=hd:;si:;mv:!1m3!1d7266.413948412242!2d-118.24054819999999!3d34.042684599999994!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i440!2i422!4f13.1;tbs:lrf:!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:3|title=Arts District Parking Lots|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gentrification==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}

The real estate history of the Arts District in Los Angeles doesn't fit the usual definition of "gentrification." In the 1970s there were millions of square feet of empty commercial and industrial space in downtown LA. Around 1970, artists began to colonize these spaces illegally and use them for live in studios. In 1980, in order to legalize these ad-hoc and unsafe residences, the City of Los Angeles created the "Artist in Residence" zoning variation ordinance. The ordinance necessarily included mandated upgrades to the artists spaces, many of which had fire/safety/health issues endangering the (artist) occupants. It also enabled developers who wished to rehab or create new or old studios that were now legal. These developments, with their increased building and safety requirements, raised the retail rental rates from 10–30 cents per square foot to about 65 cents per square foot in the early to mid-1980s.

In the late 1980s and through the 1990s several (about 20) large artist loft projects were developed from empty industrial buildings, including The Brewery, 900 East 1st St, Citizens Warehouse, 2101 E. 7th St., and Long Beach Ave Lofts, with rents ranging from 65 to 75 cents/ sq ft.

After 2000, developers started converting large office buildings in the area west of the arts district under a new "Live/Work" ordinance. These apartments were marketed as lofts, although they bore little resemblance to the much larger lofts in the industrial district east of Alameda St. Rents in these live/work spaces started in the early 2000s at about $1.10 / sq ft, and over the next 15 years climbed to about $2.50/sq ft, due mainly to the high demand for the apartments and the increasing purchase price for the undeveloped buildings.

The rapid "loft" development west of Alameda, in which hundreds of thousands of sq ft of heretofore unused commercial space has been converted to live/work apartments, has led to a renaissance in downtown Los Angeles, an area long considered uninhabitable by middle class Angelenos. The increased popularity for downtown residences has continued to put upward pressure on loft rent in the Arts District, pushing rents in some of the older, more authentic artists loft buildings upwards towards $1.50- $2.00/ sq ft., pushing many longtime artist/tenants out of their lofts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Carolina A. |last=Miranda |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-last-stand-artists-arts-district-20171027-htmlstory.html |title=Rent hikes and evictions — is it the last stand for artists in the Arts District? |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]  |date=October 27, 2017 |access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district continues to be a popular location for filming due to the historic vibe. In 2016, the head of the neighborhood’s business improvement district commented that “There’s not one day where there’s not shooting.” The popular TV sitcom [[New Girl]] takes place largely in their apartment loft located in the Arts District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The New Girl Apartment Building|url=http://www.iamnotastalker.com/2012/04/17/the-new-girl-apartment-building/|work=iamnotastalker.com|access-date=January 31, 2017|date=April 17, 2012 | author= Lindsay }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming has become complicated due to the development of the retail sector, coffee shops, and residents who will be disturbed by filming at night. Also many formerly empty lots and desolate streets are now under development where crews used the space to park trucks and trailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-vintage-hollywood-20161219-story.html |title='La La Land' looks beautiful, but gentrification makes it harder for old Hollywood to play itself |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=David |last=Ng |date= December 25, 2016 |access-date=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 developer Suncal will proposed a 2 billion 1.95 million sq. ft mixed use project which includes two 58 story buildings designed by Hezorg and de Meuron.

In April 11, 2017 the district received a 15 million award from the Active Transportation Program which will enhance the Arts District with new bike lanes, enhancement of sidewalks,and street lighting. The program will bring two signalized intersections, pedestrian lighting, four pedestrian crosswalks, and one mile of bike lanes. Little Tokyo and Arts District Regional Connector Station will have pedestrian and bicycle access with the new Sixth Street Bridge.

Some of the changes that will occur through the program are:

· Pedestrian Plaza at Merrick St. and 4th St.

· Controlled pedestrian crossing at 4th St./4th Place split.

· Bike lanes on Santa Fe Ave. and Mateo St. down to 7th St.

· Bike lanes on Traction Ave.

· Pedestrian walkway and plaza space on 6th St Bridge frontage road &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdistrictla.org|title=Arts District Awarded $15 Million in Multi-modal Transpo Funding|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1892, '''The Bibliographical Society''' is the senior [[learned society]] dealing with the study of the [[book]] and its [[History of books|history]] in the United Kingdom.

The Society holds a monthly lecture between October and May, usually on the third Tuesday of the month at [[University College London]].

The first fifty years of the Bibliographical Society were documented in the book ''The Bibliographical Society, 1892–1942: Studies in Retrospect''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bibliographical Society, 1892–1942: Studies in Retrospect'' (London, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Book Encompassed'', a volume of essays marking the Society's centenary was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davison, ed., ''The Book Encompassed: Studies in Twentieth-century Bibliography'' (Cambridge, 1992) {{ISBN|978-0-521-41878-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The objectives of the Society are:

* to promote and encourage study and research in the fields of:
**   historical, analytical, descriptive and textual [[bibliography]]
**   the [[history of printing]], [[publishing]], [[bookselling]], [[bookbinding]] and [[Book collecting|collecting]]
* to hold [[meetings]] at which papers are read and discussed
* to print and publish a [[Academic journal|journal]] (''The Library'') and books concerned with bibliography
* to maintain a bibliographical [[library]]
* from time to time to award a [[medal]] for services to bibliography
* to support bibliographical research by awarding [[Grant (money)|grants and bursaries]]

==Library and archives==
The Society's library was housed at [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Hall]] in the [[City of London]] but moved to [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] in January 2007 where it is now available alongside the resources of the [[Senate House Libraries]].

The Society's [[archive]] is housed at the [[Bodleian Library]] and may be used by scholars and members of the Society.

==Publications==
The Society has published a journal since 1893, originally entitled ''Transactions of the Bibliographical Society''. In 1920 it took over publication of ''The Library'' (issued since 1889) and adopted that as the main title of the ''Transactions''. (''The Library'' was founded in 1889 by [[John Young Walker MacAlister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=MacAlister, John Y. W.|journal=Who's Who|year=1916|pages= 1389|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3453981;view=1up;seq=1429}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The different series of the ''Transactions'' and ''The Library'' are:

*''Transactions of the Bibliographical Society'', vol. 1–15 (1893–1919)
*''The Library'', vol. 1–10 (1889–1898)
*''The Library'', Second/New series, vol. 1–10 (1900–1910)
*''The Library'', Third series, vol. 1–10 (1910–1919)
*''The Library'', Fourth series, vol. 1–26 (1920–1946)
*''The Library'', Fifth series, vol. 1–33 (1946–1978)
*''The Library'', Sixth series, vol. 1–21 (1979–1999)
*''The Library'', Seventh series, vol. 1– (2000– )

''The Library'' ({{ISSN|0024-2160}}; {{ISSN search link|1744-8581}}) is a quarterly journal and is issued free to members who also receive a copy of all books published by the Society.

==Gold medal==
The Society occasionally awards a [[gold]] medal for distinguished services to bibliography to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the development of the subject and the furtherance of the Society's aims.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1732">'''Bookbreaking''' is the longstanding practice of removing pages (especially those containing [[map]]s or [[illustration]]s) from [[book]]s, especially from rare books. Bookbreaking is most often motivated by a [[Market (economics)|market]] situation in which the maps or illustrations in a book will have more value sold separately than the value of the intact book. Often this happens because book collectors judge minor defects in an old book so harshly as to make them seemingly unsaleable.  This widespread practice probably peaked in the 1970s or 1980s, because the price for old [[engraving]]s and especially for old maps was outstripping that of rare books. However—in part because so many rare, illustrated books were "broken" in this manner—the price of the intact books has now risen the point where an old book is typically worth more intact. Book collectors have also become more sophisticated in understanding minor condition problems.

The term ''bookbreaking'' is not usually used to refer to outright theft, where the bookbreaker does not own the book in question. There have been many cases of theft of illustrations—again, especially maps—from rare books in [[library|libraries]].

The '''Cathedral Quarter''' in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], is a developing area of the city, roughly situated between Royal Avenue near where the Belfast Central Library building is, and the Dunbar Link in the [[Belfast City Centre|city centre]]. From one of its corners, the junction of [[Royal Avenue, Belfast|Royal Avenue]], Donegall Street and York Street, the Cathedral Quarter lies south and east. Part of the area, centred on Talbot Street behind the cathedral, was formerly called the Half Bap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/slums-brothels-and-seedy-divesjourney-into-the-dark-side-of-belfast-14499697.html Belfast Telegraph 18 September 2009 accessed 22 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The "Little Italy" area,was on the opposite side of Great Patrick Street centred on Little Patrick Street and Nelson Street &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/northern_ireland/ni_4/article_2.shtml BBC Legacies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cathedral Quarter extends out to the edge of what can be referred as the old merchant quarter of the city. Past where the merchant area meets the Cathedral Quarter is still mostly merchant trade and services orientated and undeveloped for visitor services.

The Cathedral Quarter is so called because [[St Anne’s Cathedral, Belfast|St Anne's Cathedral]] lies at its heart. St. Anne's or Belfast Cathedral is a [[Church of Ireland]] cathedral.

&lt;ref name=Davenport2006 &gt;{{citation |last1=Davenport |first1=Fionn |year=2006 |title=Ireland |first2=Charlotte |last2=Beech |first3=Tom |last3=Downs |first4=Des |last4=Hannigan |edition=7 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-1-74059-968-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKDE6knNUSQC |page=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Traditionally, the Cathedral Quarter was the centre of Belfast's trade and warehousing district, which sprung up directly from the prosperous linen and shipbuilding industries. The quarter still retains some of Belfast's oldest buildings and thoroughfares, including Waring Street and Hill Street.

The area fell into decline in the last century, but more recently it has re-emerged as a dedicated 'cultural quarter' of Belfast. Areas such as North Street are still in a state of dilapidation, but are likely to be redeveloped along with the rest of the quarter.

==Cultural quarter==
[[File:Commercial Court, Belfast.jpg|thumb|250px|Commercial Court]]
[[File:Statue, Custom House Square, Belfast (2) - geograph.org.uk - 412529.jpg|thumb|250px|Custom House Square]]

The definition of the area as a cultural quarter mostly came about because of the recent significant growth in arts- and culture-based organisations that are located there. As is the case with London's [[Covent Garden]] and Dublin's [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] in the years before they became as renowned as they are, low rent and a central city location attracted to the area a wide variety of tenants. Some examples include Northern Visions TV (a.k.a. Belfast Community Television), The Safehouse Arts Gallery (and its parent organisation Community Visual Images), Belfast Print Workshop and Belfast's small Zen Meditation community, which has its headquarters at Black Mountain Zen Centre (a.k.a. Belfast Meditation Centre) in rooms in Cathedral Buildings, opposite St. Anne's. Dilapidated infrastructure, however, prevented any sort of mass repopulation of the area until recently. Development and repopulation may further have been hindered from a time since the [[North Street Arcade]], a listed building from the 1930s in the traditional [[Art Deco]] style, burned down in what many people believe were suspicious circumstances in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3636381.stm BBC News reportage on the North Street Arcade Fire]&lt;/ref&gt;

A rich literary heritage is evident in the area. ''[[The Northern Whig]]'' was a popular satirical newspaper in the 19th century (very much in the same vein as [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']]), with its headquarters on the corner of Waring Street and Bridge Street, opposite the Assembly Rooms. Today, ''The Northern Whig'' building is a pub and restaurant, but the tradition of satirical writing still has a home in Cathedral Quarter through ''[[The Vacuum]]'', which has its offices in the area. Cathedral Quarter is very close to both the [[Belfast Central Library]] building and the headquarters of local newspaper publication the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]''. ([https://www.flickr.com/photos/gerryward/1863364591/in/set-72157600469678047 Central Library photo link.]) The ''[[Sunday World]]'' has its Belfast offices in Commercial Court in the Cathedral Quarter. Another newspaper, the ''[[Belfast News Letter]]'', formerly had its headquarters on Donegall Street. ''[[The Irish News]]'', another well-known newspaper, still has its head office on Donegall Street.

As if to connect with this literary flavour, a popular pub in the area is named after Belfast poet [[John Harold Hewitt|John Hewitt]]. The John Hewitt houses noteworthy and interesting artwork and photographs in changing exhibitions, sometimes of political subjects, often with the art being for sale. As well there is a particular small-but-significant political display installation, and some cuttings about the poet John Hewitt.

Belfast's Custom House, situated on the very edge of Cathedral Quarter by the city's central Laganside bank, was a popular site for public speakers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In those times, in the vein of London's [[Speakers' Corner]], the city's citizens often participated in the art of lively and spontaneous debate on any given subject. Today, in the site's reincarnation as Custom House Square, activities can be widely varied, from more pedestrian and family-orientated performances and activities to large-scale music concerts, D.J. performances and circus-style performance events for both adults and children. In autumn 2008, a showcase style afternoon with a succession of performers of roots, modern folk and country music from all over the world was hosted in tents. This is a characteristic type of occasion in Custom House Square which happens quite a number of times each year. This occasion was the closing day of the internationally highly acclaimed annual Open House Festival of the city. The festival takes place in many venues, including others within Cathedral Quarter, and its presence within marquees in Custom House Square in 2008 included an international festival of chilli peppers and chilli dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Open House Festival 2008 review. {{cite web |url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=2272 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213233749/http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=2272 |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival in late Spring is one of the larger of the city's many cultural festivals.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This festival has become internationally recognised and attracts a good number of international performers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Though the CQAF is a notably smaller affair than the Belfast Festival at Queen's which has been known at times as the second largest international European arts Festival (second in size to the Edinburgh Festival).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} An offshoot of this festival which is organised by the same Cathedral Quarter festival company is a smaller annual cultural festival, which however has a duration of most of the month: The Out to Lunch Arts Festival happens in The Cathedral Quarter in January.

Also central to the area is the Belfast campus of the [[University of Ulster]], incorporating the Art College. Nearby North Street is home to many of Belfast's most notorious bars and venues, particularly renowned during the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement of the 1970s. These include The Front Page and Giro's (closed 2004). [[Derry]] rockers [[The Undertones]] were regular visitors to the University of Ulster's student union building, the Conor Hall, as well as The Assembly Rooms (a building which currently houses a Central Belfast gallery of The Emer Gallery, and has been known as The Northern Bank theatre). Local punk producer [[Terri Hooley]] ran a record store called Cathedral Records in the North Street Arcade before 2004's fire.

The area hosts a good number of various kinds of artists' spaces, though these are generally not open to the public. There are meetings in and around the area of various cultural and community organisations which members of the public can attend; for example the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080929021402/http://www.humanists.net/belfast/home.htm Belfast Humanist Group] meet a couple of times a month at the Community Arts Forum opposite the cathedral.

The cathedral itself remains a venue for cultural events, including evening and sometimes lunchtime music concerts. Concerts can be given by the musical performers associated with the cathedral and, more often, by independent musicians. The services of the cathedral frequently include sung services by the cathedral choir, and organ playing by the cathedral organist or sometimes a visiting organist. Evensong is also sung here. The Sunday sung service is at 11 am. There is also a youth choir of the cathedral which performs, of persons in their late teens and early twenties who are thought to be of a high standard of music making. Their aim is to perform and produce marketed recordings and radio recordings. Persons of any religion or none are welcome to attend services, musical or otherwise. Concerts given by independent musicians are given in a lovely venue and are not connected with the spiritual affairs of the Church of Ireland cathedral.

[http://www.niwarmemorial.org The Northern Ireland War Memorial] is a quite recently established commemorative museum and exhibition space in Talbot Street (along one side of the cathedral). Prince Michael of Kent was Guest of Honour at [https://web.archive.org/web/20081231114545/http://www.nio.gov.uk/prince-michael-of-kent-opens-new-northern-ireland-war-memorial-in-belfast/media-detail.htm?newsID=15528 a commemorative service in re-dedication of the War Memorial] on November 4, 2008.

On the corner of Donegall Street and Waring Street, a former bank building had become known as the Northern Bank Theatre, having housed irregular dramatic performances, mostly limited to festival times. This fine city building had been known in a former incarnation as the Exchange and Assembly Rooms. In 2008's Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival, a monologue production about the Burmese opposition leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], ''The Lady of Burma'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cqaf.com/theatre_06.htm|title=The Lady of Burma|access-date=2008-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705015118/http://www.cqaf.com/theatre_06.htm#|archive-date=2008-07-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a popular play, it also proving a good use of this building. There has been much comment about the desire for this building to have a cultural use, given its excellent location and spatial quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/belfast/assembly_rooms.shtml|title=The Exchange and Assembly Rooms|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A future permanent function of the building is not known publicly.

Late in 2008, the former Northern Bank building has become a city centre location for [http://www.emergallery.com/ The Emer Gallery], an established Belfast gallery which is based near the northern edge of Belfast in the Cavehill vicinity. A large retrospective of the work of [[Armagh]] artist J. B. Vallely was programmed here until early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7734490.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Northern Ireland &amp;#124; Artist's 50-year career honoured |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition also demonstrated the suitability of the building as a gallery space. The Emer Gallery is named after a female Irish mythological character.

==Laganside Corporation revitalisation==
In recent years, Belfast based public-private body [[Laganside Corporation]] has announced plans to revitalise the area. Their sponsored initiatives have included a 'Managed Workspace' scheme, in which artists are invited to inhabit workshop space owned and refurbished by Laganside. The first such scheme was the refurbishment in 2002 of an old cotton warehouse, named Cotton Court. Other Managed Workspaces are at 23-25 Donegall Street and 9-13 Royal Avenue. It was at this time that Cathedral Quarter was given its name. Such was the popularity of the scheme that many other quarters have subsequently emerged in Belfast, both spontaneously and by design, such as the [[Gaeltacht Quarter]], [[Titanic Quarter]] and [[Queen's Quarter]].

The new-found enthusiasm for the Cathedral Quarter has seen the commitment of a number of private investors, resulting in a number of hotel and bar developments appearing in recent years. Three competing commercial developments are currently in progress in the area. Public investment, mostly on the part of [[Belfast City Council]], has also been apparent. In 2003, the council began a programme of street landscaping that began with laying new paving stones in Hill Street and Talbot Street, and which culminated in the opening in 2004 of Custom House Square, a council-managed public square in front of Belfast's old Custom House building.

==Future plans==
[[Image:Graffiti on North Street Arcade, Donegall Street, Belfast, July 2004.jpg|thumb|250px|[[North Street Arcade]], with graffiti alleging that the 2004 fire was deliberate]]
The extent of private development in the Cathedral Quarter has led to criticism from the area's residents as to the intentions of [[Laganside Corporation]] in the area. A mixture of public and private developments initiatives has resulted in a general groundswell of support for the area, but critics have noted that Cathedral Quarter suffers from a lack of general leadership and accountability. The majority of the land in the area is owned by private developers, and the area fronting Royal Avenue and Donegall Street, which has been earmarked for a development due to open in 2010, was recently center of a controversy between the planners Dunloe-Ewart and coalition of the residents fronted by the Community Arts Forum{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;!-- ROYAL AVE AND DONEGALL STREET FORM A CORNER, SO WHAT AREA IS BEING REFERRED TO? WHAT WAS THE CONTROVERSY OVER?--&gt;. Eventually, the argument had to be mediated by the [[Northern Ireland Office]], though the N.I.O. have no more of a say in the future of the area as any other party.

Some of these problems may be ironed out when Laganside closes its offices in 2009, when it has promised to split responsibility for its development briefs, including Cathedral Quarter, between the [[Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure]] for Northern Ireland (D.C.A.L., usually pronounced as 'Dee-Kal') and [[Belfast City Council]]. The future of the area in the favour of public ownership over private development is hoped to become clear by a reasonable time after the planned transfer.

Disappointingly, a once touted planned development of ''The Four Corners'' site into a new major arts and entertainment space with cafe and bar provision did not materialise and it seems much of the great potential of such a significant site has not been heeded. Many will have been or are disappointed; the proposed arts development was advertised with illustrations outside the building. This historic Belfast building has been redeveloped as the second hotel in Belfast of the lower mid-price hotel chain, Premier Inn, and includes a large restaurant and bar, as also at Premier Inn, Alfred Street.

In the meantime, it can be seen that Cathedral Quarter has been developing, neither very quickly nor very slowly, into a quite diverse and in part, and at times, lively area, with an attractive variety of eateries and drinking hostelries. The close vicinity to The Merchant Hotel, extending to include the area from Malmaison Hotel, past McHughs Bar, to Mynt Bar and Club, can be one of the liveliest city districts on a weekend night.

The Cathedral Quarter is clearly a developing area of the city. While it has considerable good attractions presently, it is also true that its designation as a cultural quarter may easily lead to an apprehension of a usually busy and significantly developed cultural area of Belfast presently, which may bring some disappointment to visitors.

The good number of established attractions and their collection in this area of spirit and good interest are to any visitor likely to be found as well appreciated, rewarding establishments. The collection here makes the area attractive to residents and visitors certainly, and also assures great potential of the area for sensitive, hopefully unrestricted cultural development. However, presently, the area can also be reasonably quiet, and can seem a fractionally developed, half alive and half neglected world, weekend nights near The Merchant Hotel and the few main city arts festivals times aside.

Many properties in this prime area lie dormant and neglected. The increasing popularity of the quarter is apparent, while there is some development: at this time (mid-Autumn '08) at the junction of Waring Street and Donegall Street, Belfast's second, new Premier Inn hotel has opened, which has connected the public bar ''The Four Corners'' and restaurant attached at street level. It seems that this area is ripe for rapid, sensitive cultural redevelopment.

== The architectural competition ==
In 2006, Belfast's Old Museum Arts Centre arts company and the Northern Ireland Arts Council announced plans to develop a dedicated arts venue for the city on the site of the Talbot Street car park. N.I.A.C. and Belfast City Council provided funds for a temporary arts venue on Hill Street, named 'The Black Box', until the Talbot Street development was finished. Currently referred to as [https://web.archive.org/web/20091003085034/http://www.oldmuseumartscentre.org/about/news.php?news=1 The Metropolitan Arts Centre, or The M.A.C.], the building opened in 2012 following an [[architectural design competition]] managed by [[RIBA Competitions]] where [http://www.hallmcknight.com/projects/1/the-mac Hackett Hall McKnight Architects] were appointed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4089">The '''chain-linked model''' or '''Kline model''' of innovation was introduced by mechanical engineer Stephen J. Kline in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1985). Research, Invention, Innovation and Production: Models and Reality, Report INN-1, March 1985, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; and further described by Kline and economist [[Nathan Rosenberg]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, S.J. &amp; N. Rosenberg (1986). “An overview of innovation.” In R. Landau &amp; N. Rosenberg (eds.), The Positive Sum Strategy: Harnessing Technology for Economic Growth. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, pp. 275–305.&lt;/ref&gt; The chain-linked model is an attempt to describe complexities in the  [[innovation]] process. The model is regarded as Kline's most significant contribution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/971028kline.html Salisbury, David F., "Memorial for Stephen Kline; engineer, interdisciplinary thinker," news release, Stanford University, October 27, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In the chain-linked model, new knowledge is not necessarily the driver for innovation.  Instead, the process begins with the identification of an unfilled market need.  This drives research and design, then redesign and production, and finally marketing, with complex [[feedback]] loops between all the stages.  There are also important feedback loops with the organization's and the world's stored base of knowledge, with new basic research conducted or commissioned as necessary, to fill in gaps. 

It is often contrasted with the so-called [[linear model of innovation]],&lt;ref&gt;Caraça, João,  Bengt-Åke Lundvall, and Sandro Mendonça (2009).  “The changing role of science in the innovation process: From Queen to Cinderella?” Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change 76, 861–867.&lt;/ref&gt; in which basic research leads to applied development, then engineering, then manufacturing, and finally marketing and distribution.

==Applications==
The Kline model was conceived primarily with commercial industrial settings in mind, but has found broad applicability in other settings, for example in military technology development.&lt;ref&gt;Marius Vassiliou, Stan Davis, and Jonathan Agre (2011).  Innovation Patterns in Some Successful C2 Technologies." Proc. 16th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, Quebec, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations and extensions of the model have been described by a number of investigators.&lt;ref&gt;Kameoka, A., D.

'''''Clear Body, Clear Mind''''' is a book published in 1990 by the [[Church of Scientology]]'s publishing house [[Bridge Publications (Scientology)|Bridge Publications]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bridgepub.com/trade/mandp/cbcm.vm Bridge Publications official website]&lt;/ref&gt; It is credited to [[L.

==Purification Rundown==
{{Main|Purification Rundown}}

The Purif consists of a "combination of exercise, vitamins, nutrition and sauna use," which purportedly "dislodges drug residues and other toxins from the fatty tissues so that these substances can then be eliminated from the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Purification Program? |work=Basic Facts About the Scientology Religion |url=http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg019.html |accessdate=2006-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522093809/http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg019.html |archivedate=2006-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists are expected to take the Purif as part of their spiritual progress,&lt;ref name="refslund"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Dorthe Refslund|title=Scientology|editor=James R.

==Medical claims==
{{Main|Medical claims in Scientology doctrine}}

''Clear Body, Clear Mind'' includes a disclaimer to the effect that the Purification Rundown is not a medical treatment and that it should not be read as making medical claims.&lt;ref name="desio" /&gt; However, in their Introduction to the book, David Root M.D. and James Barnes write: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;L. Ron Hubbard's Purification program remains the only proven and safe method for reducing or eliminating chemical residues from the body. It has been used to alleviate the symptoms and concerns of people exposed to radiation. With each year, the importance of this discovery to every man, woman and child on this planet becomes more evident.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hubbard claims to have been the discoverer of the "[[acid flashback]]" phenomenon, in which [[LSD]] is said to lodge itself in tissues and re-enter the bloodstream years later. He claims to have made this discovery "In the 1970s, working with cases of individuals who had been drug users". (pg. 23, 1990 hardcover edition)

Scientology's official website says of the book: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Pesticides, solar radiation, drug and environmental toxins have become increasingly pervasive in today’s society. They damage not just your health, but your personality and your ability to think clearly. ''Clear Body, Clear Mind -'The Effective Purification Program''', by L. Ron Hubbard, details his groundbreaking discoveries in this field. Discover the world’s only all-natural, proven program to eliminate drug and toxic residues lodged in the fatty tissues of your body. Over 250,000 have done this program with spectacular success." [https://web.archive.org/web/20080112082001/http://www.scientology.org/en_US/results/introservice/books/cbcm.html] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The claim of "Over 250,000" successes drew censure from the UK's [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1425742/Scientologist-drug-claim-on-poster-is-censured.html|title=Scientologist drug claim on poster is censured|last=Petre|first=Jonathan|date=March 27, 2003|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was a count of everyone who had completed the program, including people whose "drug" exposure was infrequent use of alcoholic drinks or prescription drugs.&lt;ref name="grn_bates"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/mar/27/religion.anglicanism|title=Cult church censured on drug ads|last=Bates|first=Stephen|date=March 27, 2003|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 review of the book at a medical conference described the mega-doses of niacin as inappropriate, especially since they cause the release of [[histamine]], which is counterproductive when dealing with chemical sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt, T. (1995) "Sauna-Depuration: Toxicokinetics" presentation at 2nd Aspen Environmental Medicine Conference. Aspen, Colorado, September 7–9. cited in 
{{cite book|last=Staudenmayer|first=Herman|title=Environmental Illness: myth and reality|publisher=CRC Press|year=1998|pages=48|isbn=978-1-56670-305-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related books==
In ''[[All About Radiation]]'', Hubbard (1957) sets out his idiosyncratic theories of [[radiation]], including the idea that large doses of vitamins could both alleviate and prevent [[radiation sickness]].&lt;ref name="atack142"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jon | last=Atack | year=1990| title = A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L.

''Purification: An Illustrated Answer To Drugs'' (New Era Publications, 1984. {{ISBN|87-7336-350-2}}) is an earlier, illustrated explanation of the Purification Rundown.&lt;ref name="refslund"/&gt; Another illustrated book, ''Narconon New Life Detoxification Program: the effective purification program by L. Ron Hubbard.'' (Bridge Publications, 1991. {{ISBN|0-88404-658-3}}) is listed as based on ''Clear Body, Clear Mind''.

==Life and career==
Denis Dutton was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States, on 9 February 1944, as the second of four children of William and Thelma Dutton,&lt;ref name=woo&gt;{{Cite news| last = Woo| first = Elaine| title = Denis Dutton dies at 66: Founder of Arts &amp; Letters Daily website| work = Los Angeles Times| accessdate = 2012-02-27| date = 2 January 2011| url = http://articles.latimes.com/print/2011/jan/02/local/la-me-denis-dutton-20110102}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were booksellers and founded what became [[Dutton's Books]], a chain of independent bookstores.&lt;ref name=margalit-fox /&gt; He grew up in North Hollywood, graduated from [[North Hollywood High School]],&lt;ref name=woo /&gt; and was educated at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where he earned his bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1966 and his PhD in philosophy in 1975.&lt;ref name=margalit-fox /&gt; Between taking these degrees, he went to India with the [[Peace Corps]] and learned to play [[sitar]].&lt;ref name=margalit-fox /&gt; Dutton taught at several American universities, including the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and the [[University of Michigan–Dearborn]], before emigrating to New Zealand.

Dutton started teaching at the [[University of Canterbury]], [[Christchurch]], in 1984.&lt;ref name=margalit-fox /&gt; From 2008 to 2010, he was the Head of the Philosophy school in an unofficial capacity and acted briefly as Head of Humanities. At its December 2010 graduation ceremony, the University of Canterbury awarded Dutton a research medal for his work.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4463532"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/4463532/Renowned-academic-receives-top-honour |title=Renowned academic receives top honour |author=Matthews, Philip |date=16 December 2010 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[editorial board]] for ''[[The Rutherford Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Editorial board | url=http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/editorial.html | work=[[The Rutherford Journal]] | accessdate=19 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 2010, Dutton died from [[prostate cancer|cancer]].&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4498558"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/4498558/Professor-web-entrepreneur-Denis-Dutton-dies |title=Professor, web entrepreneur Denis Dutton dies |date=28 December 2010 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12088898 | work=BBC News | title=Arts author Denis Dutton dies aged 66 | date=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts &amp; Letters Daily==
{{main|Arts &amp; Letters Daily}}
Dutton was best known for the web aggregation site [[Arts &amp; Letters Daily]], which he founded in 1998 and which secured him a place among "the most influential media personalities in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Grossman| first = Lev| title = Meet Joe Blog| work = Time| date = 13 June 2004| url = http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,650732,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site, described as "the first and foremost aggregator of well-written and well-argued book reviews, essays, and other articles in the realm of ideas",&lt;ref name=eskin&gt;{{cite news|date=28 December 2010|title=Denis Dutton|first=Blake|last=Eskin|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/postscript/2.html#entry-2000000001114450|work=The New Yorker}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; features links to articles across the web about literature, art, science, and politics, for which Dutton wrote pithy teasers.&lt;ref name=margalit-fox /&gt; In recognition of ''Arts &amp; Letters Daily'', [[Steven Pinker]] called Dutton a visionary for recognizing that a website "could be a forum for cutting-edge ideas, not just a way to sell things or entertain the bored".&lt;ref name=woo /&gt;

==Cybereditions==
Dutton served as executive director of Cybereditions, a [[print on demand]] publishing company he founded in 2000&lt;ref name=boynton&gt;{{Cite news| last = Boynton| first = Robert S.| title = Hoping Web Success Strikes Twice| work = New York Times| location = New York| date = 11 November 2000| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/11/arts/hoping-web-success-strikes-twice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which specializes in new and out-of-print copyright works, mostly of a scholarly nature. The editorial board of the company has included other academics such as [[Frederick Crews]], [[Anthony Grafton]] and [[Marjorie Perloff]].&lt;ref name=riemer&gt;{{cite news | title=Reading between the dots|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=3 March 2001 |first=Andrew |last=Riemer|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
Dutton wrote on [[authenticity in art]] and distinguished between ''nominal authenticity'', in which a work of art is correctly attributed to its author rather than being a forgery, and ''expressive authenticity'', where a work is a true expression of an individual's or a society's values and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Authenticity in Art |url=http://www.denisdutton.com/authenticity.htm |journal=The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics |editor=Jerrold Levinson |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |author=Denis Dutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Art Instinct'' (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 1-60819-055-2| last = Dutton| first = Denis| title = The Art Instinct: Beauty, Pleasure, and Human Evolution| location = Oxford| year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton opposes the view that art appreciation is culturally learned, claiming instead that art appreciation stems from evolutionary adaptions made during the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/books/review/Gottlieb-t.html?ref=books | work=The New York Times | title=The Descent of Taste | first=Anthony | last=Gottlieb | date=1 February 2009 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set out abbreviated versions of his theory in a 2009 [[Google Videos|Google Talk]] lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Denis Dutton | year=2009 | title =Authors@Google: Denis Dutton |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-Di86RqDL4| publisher = YouTube.com | location = Mountain View, CA | accessdate = 27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2010 [[TED (conference)|TED talk]].&lt;ref name=ted&gt;{{Cite video | publisher = Video on TED.com | people = Dutton, Denis (Contributor) | title = Denis Dutton: A Darwinian theory of beauty | series = TED | accessdate = 2012-03-12 | date = February 2010 | url = http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton also argued that progress in the arts and sciences had declined, especially since around 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denisdutton.com/murray_review.htm |title=Of Human Accomplishment| first=Denis|last=Dutton|work=Denisdutton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of academic prose==
As editor of the journal ''[[Philosophy and Literature]]'', Dutton ran the Bad Writing Contest, which aimed to "expose 'pretentious, swaggering gibberish' passed off as scholarship at leading universities".&lt;ref name=woo /&gt; In 1995, the contest was won by [[Homi K. Bhabha]] and [[Fredric Jameson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Dutton | first = Denis | title = The Bad Writing Contest: Press Releases, 1996–1998 | work = DenisDutton.com | accessdate = 2010-10-30 | year = 1998 | url = http://denisdutton.com/bad_writing.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the contest awarded first place to philosopher and [[University of California-Berkeley]] Professor [[Judith Butler]], for a sentence which appeared in the journal ''[[Diacritics (journal)|diacritics]].''&lt;ref name="language-crimes"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Dutton | first = Denis | title = Language Crimes: A Lesson in How Not to Write, Courtesy of the Professoriate | work = The Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2010-10-30 | date = 5 February 1999 | url = http://www.denisdutton.com/language_crimes.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler defended her work against the charges of academic [[pedantry]] and [[obscurantism]] in the pages of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Butler | first = Judith | title = A 'Bad Writer' Bites Back | work = New York Times | accessdate = 2010-10-30 | date = 20 March 1999 | url = https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/wash/www/butler.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111008194554/https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/wash/www/butler.htm | archivedate = 8 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton then ended the contest.

The Bad Writing Contest emerged in an intellectual climate dominated by fallout from the [[Sokal affair]],&lt;ref name=leo&gt;{{cite news|work=The Washington Times|date=13 March 1999| title=Pomobabble rooted in ivy|first=John|last=Leo|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

==Politics and activism==
Dutton supported "conservative ideas"&lt;ref name=colebatch&gt;{{cite news|title=Vale Denis Dutton: A professor of philosophy who civilized the Internet|first=Hal G.P.|last=Colebatch|date=30 December 2010|work=American Spectator|url=http://spectator.org/archives/2010/12/30/vale-denis-dutton|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118092733/http://spectator.org/archives/2010/12/30/vale-denis-dutton|archivedate=18 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] for some years.&lt;ref name=woo /&gt;

Dutton was one of the founding members and first chair of the [[NZ Skeptics]]. His skepticism led him to believe that "[[climate change]] is still an open question".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/lifestyle/248382/And-in-this-corner|title=And in this corner...|work=The Press|date=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a passionate supporter of [[public radio]]. In the early 1990s he founded the lobby group ''The New Zealand Friends of Public Broadcasting'' in response to proposals to devolve New Zealand's two non-commercial public radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzine.co.nz/features/broadcasting.html|title=NZine: Public broadcasting- Not everyone is apathetic|date=18 July 1998|accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 he was appointed to the board of directors of [[Radio New Zealand]], where he served for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/node/12965|title=Board appointments for NZOA and RNZ|date=4 February 2002|author=Marion Hobbs, MP|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After concluding his term as a director, Dr Dutton and Dr John Isles issued a report criticising Radio New Zealand for loss of neutrality in news and current affairs, failure to adhere to charter and opposed to contestable funding of broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/mi-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/6/5/4/47HansD_20040331_00001531-Radio-New-Zealand-Amendment-Bill-In-Committee.htm |author=Coddington, Deborah M.P. |title=Parliamentary debate: 3rd reading of Radio New Zealand Amendment Bill |date=30 March 2004 |accessdate=2008-03-27 |work=Hansard }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Bullough''' (28 March 1880 – 17 September 1934) was an English [[aesthetics|aesthetician]] and scholar of [[modern language]]s, who worked at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He did experimental work on the perception of [[color|colours]], and in his theoretical work introduced the concept of [[psychical distance]]: that which "appears to lie between our own self and its affections" in aesthetic experience. In languages, Bullough was a dedicated teacher who published little. He came to concentrate on Italian, and was elected to the [[Serena Professor of Italian|Chair of Italian]] at Cambridge in 1933.

==Life and work==

===Early life to "Psychical Distance," 1880&amp;ndash;1914===

Edward Bullough was born in [[Thun]], [[Switzerland]], on 28 March 1880, to John Bullough and Bertha Schmidlein.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Trayes, ed., ''Biographical History of Gonville and Caius College'', vol. 5, ''Admissions from 1911 to 1932'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1948), 132.&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he lived mostly in Germany, and was educated at Vitzthum Gymnasium, [[Dresden]].&lt;ref&gt;M. O. [Michael Oakeshott], "Edward Bullough," ''Caian'' 43, no. 1 (1934): 1. It was a convention at the time that articles in the ''Caian'' were signed with initials only. Oakeshott is identified in Elizabeth M. Wilkinson, introduction to ''Aesthetics'', by Edward Bullough (London: Bowes and Bowes, 1957), xii.&lt;/ref&gt; At seventeen Bullough moved to England,&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1899 matriculated from [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] in the [[University of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Rouse Ball and J. A. Venn, eds., ''Admissions to Trinity College, Cambridge'', vol. 5, ''1851 to 1900'' (London: Macmillan, 1913), 1134.&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied Medieval and Modern Languages.&lt;ref&gt;Trayes, ''Biographical History of Caius'', 132.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated BA (Class I) in 1902, MA in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;Ball and Venn, ''Admissions to Trinity'', 1134.&lt;/ref&gt; after which he taught French and German at Cambridge colleges and lectured in the university.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time Bullough became interested in [[aesthetics]], and "prepared himself to deal with [its] problems … by a study of [[physiology]] and general [[psychology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2. See also Edward Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1934), 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 Bullough gave a course of lectures in aesthetics, the first such at Cambridge, privately printed as ''The Modern Conception of Aesthetics''.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2. Bullough mistakenly says the year was 1906 in ''Italian Perspectives'', 8. The lectures are first announced, to begin on 14 October 1907, in the ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 37, no. 39 (1907): 1018.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated the course annually "until shortly before his death".&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullough conducted experimental work on the perception of [[color|colours]] in the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory, the basis for a series of three papers in the ''British Journal of Psychology'': "The Apparent Heaviness of Colours" (1907), "The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Single Colours" (1908), and "The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Simple Colour-Combinations" (1910).&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullough also had an interest in [[parapsychology]], and was a member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Bullough married Enrichetta Angelica Marchetti (daughter of the actor [[Eleonora Duse]]), with whom he would have a son and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;"Professor Bullough, Italian Studies at Cambridge," ''The Times'', 18 September 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to a Drosier Fellowship at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]] in 1912,&lt;ref&gt;Trayes, ''Biographical History of Caius'', 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year published his noted theoretical paper, {{" '}}Psychical Distance' as a Factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle". [[Psychical distance]] (Bullough capitalises the words) is that which, in certain situations, "appears to lie between our own self and its affections, using the latter term in its broadest sense as anything which affects our being".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bullough, {{" '}}Psychical Distance' as a Factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle," ''British Journal of Psychology'' 5, no. 2 (1912): 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic production and appreciation are two such situations.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Psychical Distance] has a ''negative'', inhibitory aspect—the cutting-out of the practical sides of things and of our practical attitude to them—and a ''positive'' side—the elaboration of the experience on the new basis created by the inhibitory action of Distance.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The relation between [[self]] and [[object (philosophy)|object]] remains a personal one (it is not like the impersonal relation in [[science|scientific]] observation, for example) and Bullough thinks that a "concordance" between them is necessary for aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 91&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt; However this must not be such that psychical distance is lost: Bullough imagines a jealous husband watching a performance of ''[[Othello]]'', who "will probably do anything but appreciate the play".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 93.&lt;/ref&gt; This "[[antinomy]] of Distance"&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 92.&lt;/ref&gt; leads Bullough to say that what is desirable in art, "both in appreciation and production", is "the utmost decrease of Distance without its disappearance".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 94. In the source, the second quotation is mostly italicised.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War service to death, 1915&amp;ndash;1934===

In the [[First World War]], Bullough was recruited as a civilian in the summer of 1915 to the [[Admiralty]]'s [[cryptanalysis|cryptoanalysis]] section, [[Room 40]]. He served for four years, finally as a Lieutenant of the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 4.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war he returned to Caius, where he had been re-elected to a fellowship in January 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He published in the ''British Journal of Psychology'' two more papers on aesthetic theory, "The Relation of Aesthetics to Psychology" (1919) and "Mind and Medium in Art" (1920), and a review of experimental work (1921).&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he was appointed College Lecturer in [[modern language]]s and University Lecturer in German,&lt;ref&gt;P. Giles, "Appointment of a University Lecturer in German," ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 50, no. 31 (1920): 758.&lt;/ref&gt; and he edited the anthology ''Cambridge Readings in Italian Literature''.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 Bullough resigned his university post,&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Pearce, "University Lectureship in German," ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 53, no. 41 (1923): 1042.&lt;/ref&gt; wishing to concentrate instead on Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he joined the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] as a [[Third Order of Saint Dominic|Dominican Tertiary]], and afterwards was active in the Cambridge University Catholic Association.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decade he published translations of [[Étienne Gilson]], [[Karl Adam (theologian)|Karl Adam]], and [[Pope Pius XI|Achille Ratti]] (by then Pope Pius XI), and gave three papers on [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] at Catholic summer schools in Cambridge and [[Salzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 7.&lt;/ref&gt; A colleague believed that his work in Italian studies "all went into his lectures and teaching", rather than research for publication.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted anonymously in Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed University Lecturer in Italian in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Trayes, ''Biographical History of Caius'', 132. No reference has been located in the ''Cambridge University Reporter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullough was elected to the [[Serena Professor of Italian|Chair of Italian]] at Cambridge in March 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Will Spens, "Professorship of Italian: Election," ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 63, no. 29 (1933): 830.&lt;/ref&gt; In his printed inaugural lecture, titled ''Italian Perspectives'', he claims that the Italian "perspective" is one of "continuity of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] with [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Modern history|modern]] times",&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 36.&lt;/ref&gt; so that tradition is treated "with the easy familiarity of a family possession".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that because the European classical tradition is also, for the Italian, the native tradition, "the 'national' inheritance of Italy lies at the same time embedded in the foundations of Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In illustration, Bullough proposes [[Roman law]], the [[Renaissance]], and the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] as "three contributions made by Italy to the patrimony of the civilised world".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; He offers the contemporary [[Italian Fascism|fascist movement]] as a tentative fourth:&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 62&amp;ndash;63.&lt;/ref&gt; a successor to the chair, Uberto Limentani, believed there was "no doubt" that Bullough sympathised with fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Uberto Limentani, "Leone and Arthur Serena and the Cambridge Chair of Italian, 1919&amp;ndash;1934," ''Modern Language Review'' 92, no. 4 (1997): 891.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short illness&lt;ref&gt;"Professor Bullough," ''The Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting from an internal operation,&lt;ref&gt;H. O. Evennett, "Edward Bullough," ''Dublin Review'' 196, no. 392 (1935): 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullough died in a nursing home in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] on 17 September 1934. He was buried at Woodchester Priory in [[Stroud]].&lt;ref&gt;"Professor Bullough," ''The Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Michael Oakeshott]], a colleague at Caius, wrote Bullough's obituary for their college record.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth M. Wilkinson, introduction to ''Aesthetics'', xii. Bullough's influence on Oakeshott's aesthetics is discussed in Efraim Podoksik, ''In Defence of Modernity: Vision and Philosophy in Michael Oakeshott'' (Exeter: Imprint Academic, 2003), 109&amp;ndash;117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family home on Buckingham Road, Cambridge was offered to the Dominican Order by his widow and is now [[Cambridge Blackfriars]].

'''Funk &amp; Wagnalls''' was an American [[publisher]] known for its reference works, including ''A Standard Dictionary of the English Language'' (1st ed. 1893-5), and the ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia'' (25 volumes, 1st ed. 1912).&lt;ref name="FW1996"&gt;Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopedia was renamed ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Encyclopedia'' in 1931 and was later{{when|date=March 2013}} known as ''New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia'', ''Universal Standard Encyclopedia'', ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Reference Encyclopedia'', and ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia'' (29 volumes, 1st ed. 1971).&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt;

The last printing of ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia'' was in 1997.  As of 2018, annual Yearbooks are still in production.

The '''I.K. Funk &amp; Company''', founded in 1875, was renamed '''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company''' after two years, and later became '''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Inc.''', then '''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Corporation'''.&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt;

==History==
[[Isaac Kaufmann Funk]] founded the business in 1875 as I.K. Funk &amp; Company.&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt; In 1877, [[Adam Willis Wagnalls]], one of Funk's classmates at Wittenberg College (now [[Wittenberg University]]), joined the firm as a partner and the name of the firm was changed to Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company.

During its early years, Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company published religious books. The publication of ''[[The Literary Digest]]'' in 1890 marked a shift to publishing of general reference [[dictionary|dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedia]]s. The firm published ''The Standard Dictionary of the English Language'' &lt;sup&gt;({{OCLC|19715240}})&lt;/sup&gt; in 2 volumes in 1893 &amp; 1895 and ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia'' &lt;sup&gt;({{OCLC|1802064}})&lt;/sup&gt; in 1912.

In 1913, the ''New Standard Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language'' was published under the supervision of Isaac K. Funk (Editor-in-Chief). The ''New Standard Unabridged Dictionary'' was revised until 1943, a later edition that was also supervised by Charles Earl Funk.

The encyclopedia was based upon ''[[Chambers's Encyclopaedia]]'':
"Especially are we indebted to the famous ''Chambers's Encyclopaedia''...With its publishers we have arranged to draw upon its stores as freely as we have found it of advantage so to do."&lt;ref&gt;Publishers' Preface, ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia'', 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilfred J. Funk]], the son of Isaac Funk, was president of the company from 1925 to 1940.

Unicorn Press (later known as the Standard Reference Work Publishing Co.) obtained the rights to publish the encyclopedia, and by 1953 that firm began to sell the encyclopedia through a [[supermarket]] [[continuity marketing]] campaign,&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt; encouraging consumers to include the latest volume of the encyclopedia on their [[shopping list]]s. Grocery stores in the 1970s in the [[Midwest]] (Chicago – Jewel Grocers) typically kept about four volumes in a rotation, dropping the last and adding the latest until all volumes could be acquired with the initial first volume being 99 cents. The first several volumes were gold painted along the edges and the later volumes were not. These volumes typically were $2.99 and then toward the later volumes the price had increased with the [[1973–75 recession|inflation of the 1970s]]. If one did not go shopping on a weekly basis, or delivery was spotty, there was a good chance that a volume might be missed to complete the set.

In 1965, Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co. was sold to [[Reader's Digest]].

In 1971, the company, now Funk and Wagnalls, Incorporated, was sold to [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Smith| first = William D.| title = Merger News| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-11-24| date = 1971-02-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/02/archives/ashland-seeking-home-oil-control-kentucky-company-holding-talks.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dun and Bradstreet retained ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia'', but other reference works were relinquished to other publishers.&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt;

In 1984, Dun &amp; Bradstreet sold Funk &amp; Wagnalls, Inc., to a group of Funk &amp; Wagnalls executives, who in turn sold it to [[Field Enterprises|Field Corporation]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Fabrikant| first = Geraldine| title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Field Publications Agrees To Buy Funk &amp; Wagnalls| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-11-24| date = 1988-05-27| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/27/business/the-media-business-field-publications-agrees-to-buy-funk-wagnalls.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the company was sold to [[K-III|K-III Holdings, Inc]], and then in 1993 Funk &amp; Wagnalls Corporation acquired the ''[[World Almanac]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Hicks| first = Jonathan P.| title = COMPANY NEWS; K-III Holdings to Buy Field Assets| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-11-24| date = 1990-12-22| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/22/business/company-news-k-iii-holdings-to-buy-field-assets.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt;

In 1998, as part of the Information division of [[Primedia|Primedia Inc.]] (the renamed K-III), the encyclopedia content appeared on the Web site "funkandwagnalls.com". This short-lived venture was shut down in 2001.

[[Ripplewood Holdings]] bought Primedia's education division in 1999, which became part of [[Reader's Digest Association]] in 2007. In 2009, Funk &amp; Wagnalls was acquired by ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = World Book Launches New Co-Edition Business under Funk &amp; Wagnalls Brand | publisher = Business Wire | accessdate = 2014-07-08 | date = 2010-06-23 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100623006207/en/World-Book-Launches-Co-Edition-Business-Funk-Wagnalls#.U7t41LEn-Q4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing to purchase rights to the text of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and ''World Book Encyclopedia'' for its ''[[Encarta]]'' digital encyclopedia, [[Microsoft]] reluctantly used (under license) the text of Funk &amp; Wagnalls encyclopedia for the first editions of its encyclopedia. This licensed text was gradually replaced over the following years with content Microsoft created itself.&lt;ref&gt;Randall E. Stross, ''The Microsoft Way: The Real Story of How the Company Outsmarts its Competition'' (Reading: Addison-Wesley, 1996), pp. 81f, 91f&lt;/ref&gt;

The first day of [[Bhadro]] (5th month of [[Bengali calendars|Bengali calendar]]) started on the eve of Bisharjan of Manasha ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: মনসার ভাসান)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and later celebrated on the day of [[Vijayadashami|Vijaya Dashami]] during the monsoon season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The festival revolves around a teenage boy. The boy dresses in [[Sari|shari]] and grows out his hair, with the intent of resembling a girl.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The young boys were sexually abused and that contributed to the decline of this form of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/magazine/2012/09/02/cinema.htm|title=::: Star Weekend Magazine ::|website=www.thedailystar.net|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the festival he plays the role of pantomime by dancing or otherwise representing the Ghatu song.

'''''Guernica''''' ({{IPA-eu|ɡer'nika}}) is a large oil painting on canvas by [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Pablo Picasso]] completed in June 1937,&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"&gt;Richardson (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; at his home on Rue des Grands Augustins, in Paris. The painting, now in the [[Museo Reina Sofia]] in Madrid, was done with a palette of gray, black, and white, and is regarded by many art critics as one of the most moving and powerful anti-war paintings in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/pablo-picasso-9440021#surrealism |title=Pablo Picasso |website=Biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing at {{convert|3.49|m|ftin|sp=us}} tall and {{convert|7.76|m|ftin|sp=us}} wide, the painting shows the suffering of people and animals wrenched by violence and chaos. Prominent in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, and flames.

The painting was created in response to the [[bombing of Guernica]], a [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] [[Guernica (town)|town]] in northern [[Spain]], by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] [[Military aircraft|warplanes]] at the request of the Spanish [[Spain under Franco|Nationalists]]. Upon completion, ''Guernica'' was exhibited at the Spanish display at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] (Paris International Exposition) in the 1937 World's Fair in Paris and then at other venues around the world. The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief.&lt;ref name="Cohen_2003"/&gt; The painting became famous and widely acclaimed, and it helped bring worldwide attention to the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Commission==
In January 1937, the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican]] government commissioned Picasso to create a large [[mural]] for the Spanish display at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] at the [[1937 World's Fair]] in Paris. At the time, Picasso was living in Paris, where he had been named Honorary Director-in-Exile of the [[Prado Museum]]. He had last visited Spain in 1934 and never returned.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; His initial sketches for the project, on which he worked somewhat dispassionately from January until late April, depicted his perennial theme of the artist's studio.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; Immediately upon hearing reports of the 26 April bombing of Guernica, the poet [[Juan Larrea (poet)|Juan Larrea]] visited Picasso and urged him to make the bombing his subject.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; However, it was only on 1 May, having read [[George Steer]]'s eyewitness account of the bombing (originally published in both ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 28 April), that he abandoned his initial project and started sketching a series of preliminary drawings for ''Guernica''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Preston, Paul]] (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOpqVkAyFkAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Steer%27s+report+preston ''The Destruction of Guernica''. HarperCollins] At Google Books. Retrieved 18 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
{{See also|Bombing of Guernica|Spanish Civil War|Spanish Civil War, 1937}}

===Bombing of 26 April 1937===
[[Guernica (town)|Guernica]] is a town in the province of [[Biscay]] in Basque Country. During the Spanish Civil War, it was regarded as the northern bastion of the Republican resistance movement and the center of Basque culture, adding to its significance as a target.&lt;ref name = Arhheim1973&gt;Arhheim, (1973) p. ???&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican forces were made up of assorted factions (Communists, Socialists, Anarchists and others) with differing goals, but united in their opposition to the Nationalists. The Nationalists, led by General Francisco Franco, sought a return to pre-Republican Spain, based on law, order, and traditional Catholic values.&lt;ref&gt;Barton (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 16:30 on Monday, 26 April 1937, warplanes of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Condor Legion]], commanded by Colonel [[Wolfram von Richthofen]], bombed Guernica for about two hours. Germany, at this time led by Hitler, had lent material support to the Nationalists. Later, intense aerial bombardment became a crucial preliminary step in the [[Blitzkrieg|Blitzkrieg tactic]].&lt;ref name=Ray2006&gt;Ray (2006),168–171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arhheim1973/&gt;

In his journal for 30 April 1937, von Richthofen wrote:
{{quote|When the first Junkers squadron arrived, there was smoke already everywhere (from the VB [VB/88] which had attacked with 3 aircraft); nobody would identify the targets of roads, bridge, and suburb, and so they just dropped everything right into the center. The 250s toppled a number of houses and destroyed the water mains. The incendiaries now could spread and become effective. The materials of the houses: tile roofs, wooden porches, and half-timbering resulted in complete annihilation. Most inhabitants were away because of a holiday; a majority of the rest left town immediately at the beginning [of the bombardment]. A small number perished in shelters that were hit."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oppler (1988), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other accounts state that the town's inhabitants were in fact congregated in the center of town, as it was market day, and when the bombardment commenced, were unable to escape because the roads were full of debris and the bridges leading out of town had been destroyed.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|right|thumb|Guernica in ruins, 1937]]
Guernica's location was at a major crossroads 10 kilometers from the front lines and between the front lines and Bilbao, the capital of Bizkaia ([[Biscay]]). Any Republican retreat towards Bilbao and any Nationalist advance towards Bilbao had to pass through Guernica. "During 25 April, many of the demoralized (Republican) troops from Marquina fell back on Guernica, which lay 10 kilometers behind the lines."&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006), 231&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfram von Richthofen's war diary entry for 26 April 1937 states, "K/88 [the Condor Legion bomber force] was targeted at Guernica in order to halt and disrupt the Red withdrawal which has to pass through here."  Under the German concept of tactical bombing, areas that were routes of transportation and troop movement were considered to be legitimate military targets, and tactical aircraft tended to operate just outside the range of friendly artillery; in the German mindset, Guernica was thus a major target in support of the Republican offensive. The following day, Richthofen wrote in his war diary, "Guernica burning."&lt;ref name="beevor233"&gt;Beevor (2006), 233.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Republican retreat towards Bilbao did pass through Guernica, before and after the bombing, and, as Beevor points out, "At Guernica the communist [[Rosa Luxemburg]] Battalion under Major Cristobal held back the nationalists for a time".&lt;ref name="beevor233"/&gt;

Guernica was a quiet village. The nearest military target of any consequence was a factory on the outskirts of the town, which manufactured various war products. The factory went through the attack unscathed. Thus, the motivation of the bombing was one of intimidation.

===Aftermath===
Because a majority of the town's men were away, engaged in fighting on behalf of the Republicans, the town at the time of the bombing was populated mostly by women and children.&lt;ref name=Preston2007&gt;Preston (2007).12–19.&lt;/ref&gt; These demographics are reflected in the painting because, as [[Rudolf Arnheim]] writes, for Picasso: "The women and children make ''Guernica'' the image of innocent, defenseless humanity victimized. Also, women and children have often been presented by Picasso as the very perfection of mankind. An assault on women and children is, in Picasso's view, directed at the core of mankind." Clearly, the Nationalists sought to demoralize the Republicans and the civilian population as a whole by demonstrating their military might on a town that stood for traditional Basque culture and innocent civilians.&lt;ref name=Arhheim1973/&gt;

After the bombing, the work of the Basque and Republican sympathizer and ''The Times'' journalist [[George Steer]] propelled this event onto the international scene and brought it to Pablo Picasso's attention. Steer's eyewitness account was published on 28 April in both ''The Times'' and ''The New York Times'', and on the 29th appeared in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', a French Communist daily. Steer wrote:

{{quote|Guernica, the most ancient town of the Basques and the centre of their cultural tradition, was completely destroyed yesterday afternoon by insurgent air raiders. The bombardment of this open town far behind the lines occupied precisely three hours and a quarter, during which a powerful fleet of aeroplanes consisting of three types of German types, Junkers and Heinkel bombers, did not cease unloading on the town bombs weighing from 1,000 lbs. downwards and, it is calculated, more than 3,000 two-pounder aluminium incendiary projectiles. The fighters, meanwhile, plunged low from above the centre of the town to machinegun those of the civilian population who had taken refuge in the fields."&lt;ref name=Preston2007/&gt;}}

While Picasso was living in Nazi-occupied Paris during World War II, one German officer allegedly asked him, upon seeing a photo of ''Guernica'' in his apartment, "Did you do that?" Picasso responded, "No, you did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Lubbock |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/08/highereducation.news |title=Review: Guernica by Gijs van Hensbergen &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The photographer [[Dora Maar]]—who had worked with Picasso since mid-1936, photographing his studio and teaching him the technique of [[photogram|cameraless photography]]—&lt;ref&gt;Fluegel (1980), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; documented the stages ''Guernica'' went through on its way to completion. Apart from their documentary and publicity value, Maar's photographs "helped Picasso to eschew color and give the work the black-and-white immediacy of a photograph", according to [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]].&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; The work was painted using a matte house paint specially formulated at Picasso's request to have the least possible gloss,&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; and the American artist [[John Ferren]] assisted him in stretching the monumental canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/john-ferren]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729100546/https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/john-ferren |date=29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, Picasso had rarely allowed strangers into his studio to watch him work, but he admitted influential visitors to his studio to observe the progress of the painting, believing that the publicity to be gained would help the antifascist cause.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt;

As he worked on the mural, Picasso said: "The Spanish struggle is the fight of reaction against the people, against freedom. My whole life as an artist has been nothing more than a continuous struggle against reaction and the death of art. How could anybody think for a moment that I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ... In the panel on which I am working, which I shall call ''Guernica'', and in all my recent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death."&lt;ref&gt;Tóibín (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

After 35 days of work, he finished the painting on 4 June 1937.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt;

==Composition==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|470px|center]]
The scene is within a room where, on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a grieving woman who holds a dead child in her arms. The center of the painting is occupied by a horse falling in agony, as if it had just been run through by a spear or javelin. There is a large gaping wound in the horse's side.

Under the horse is a dead, dismembered, soldier. The hand of his severed right arm still grasps a shattered sword, from which a flower grows. The palm of the soldier's open left hand contains a stigmata, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the [[stigmata]] of Christ. A bare light bulb blazes in the shape of an evil eye over the suffering horse's head.

To the upper right of the horse, a frightened female figure, who seems to be witnessing the scenes before her, appears to have floated into the room through a window. She carries a flame-lit lamp which is positioned close to the bare bulb.

From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. She looks up blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming have replaced the tongues of the bull, the grieving woman, and the horse. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light can be seen.

On the far right, a woman with arms raised in terror is entrapped by fire from above and below; her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right end of the mural.

Two "hidden" images formed by the horse appear in ''Guernica'':
* A human skull overlays the horse's body.
* A bull appears to gore the horse from underneath. The bull's head is formed mainly by the horse's entire front leg which has the knee on the ground. The leg's knee cap forms the head's nose. A horn appears within the horse's breast.The bull's tail forms the image of a flame with smoke rising from it, seemingly appearing in a window created by the lighter shade of gray surrounding it.

==Symbolism and interpretations==
Interpretations of ''Guernica'' vary widely and contradict one another. This extends, for example, to the mural's two dominant elements: the bull and the horse. Art historian Patricia Failing said, "The bull and the horse are important characters in Spanish culture. Picasso himself certainly used these characters to play many different roles over time. This has made the task of interpreting the specific meaning of the bull and the horse very tough. Their relationship is a kind of ballet that was conceived in a variety of ways throughout Picasso's career."

When pressed to explain the elements in ''Guernica'', Picasso said,

{{quote|...this bull is a bull and this horse is a horse... If you give a meaning to certain things in my paintings it may be very true, but it is not my idea to give this meaning. What ideas and conclusions you have got I obtained too, but instinctively, unconsciously. I make the painting for the painting. I paint the objects for what they are.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/guernica_nav/gnav_level_1/5meaning_guerfrm.html ...questions of meaning], part of a series of web pages on ''Guernica'' in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Treasures of the World'' series. Accessed 16 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The Dream and Lie of Franco]]'', a series of narrative sketches Picasso also created for the World's Fair, [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] is depicted as a monster that first devours his own horse and later does battle with an angry bull. Work on these illustrations began before the bombing of Guernica, and four additional panels were added, three of which relate directly to the Guernica mural.

According to scholar Beverly Ray, the following list of interpretations reflects the general consensus of historians: "The shape and posture of the bodies express protest"; "Picasso uses black, white, and grey paint to set a somber mood and express pain and chaos"; "flaming buildings and crumbling walls not only express the destruction of Guernica, but reflect the destructive power of civil war"; "the newspaper print used in the painting reflects how Picasso learned of the massacre"; "The light bulb in the painting represents the sun"; and "The broken sword near the bottom of the painting symbolizes the defeat of the people at the hand of their tormentors".&lt;ref name=Ray2006/&gt;

Alejandro Escalona said, "The chaos unfolding seems to happen in closed quarters provoking an intense feeling of oppression. There is no way out of the nightmarish cityscape. The absence of color makes the violent scene developing right before your eyes even more horrifying. The blacks, whites, and grays startle you—especially because you are used to see war images broadcast live and in high-definition right to your living room."&lt;ref name = "75years" /&gt;

In drawing attention to a number of preliminary studies, the so-called primary project,&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Spies]]: Guernica und die Weltausstellung von 1937. In: Id.: Kontinent Picasso. Ausgewählte Aufsätze, Munich 1988, S. 63–99.&lt;/ref&gt; that show an atelier installation incorporating the central triangular shape which reappears in the final version of ''Guernica'', Becht-Jördens and Wehmeier interpret the painting as a self-referential composition in the tradition of atelier paintings such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]]. In his ''chef d'oeuvre'', Picasso seems to be trying to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. But far from being a mere political painting, ''Guernica'' should be seen as Picasso's comment on what art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates every human being and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death.&lt;ref&gt;See Becht-Jördens (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
===1937 Paris International Exhibition===
''Guernica'' was initially exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The Pavilion, which was financed by the Spanish Republican government at the time of civil war, was built to exhibit the Spanish government's struggle for existence contrary to the Exposition's technology theme. The Pavilion's entrance presented an enormous photographic mural of Republican soldiers accompanied by the slogan:

:We are fighting for the essential unity of Spain.
:We are fighting for the integrity of Spanish soil.
:We are fighting for the independence of our country and for
:the right of the Spanish people to determine their own destiny.

The display of ''Guernica'' was accompanied by a poem by [[Paul Éluard]], and the pavilion displayed ''[[The Reaper (Miró painting)|The Reaper]]'' by [[Joan Miró]] and ''[[Mercury fountain|Mercury Fountain]]'' by [[Alexander Calder]], both of whom were sympathetic to the Republican cause.

At its unveiling at the Paris Exhibition it garnered little attention. The public's reaction to ''Guernica'' was mixed.&lt;ref&gt;Witham (2013), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Aub]], one of the officials in charge of the Spanish pavilion, was compelled to defend the work against a group of Spanish officials who objected to the mural's modernist style and sought to replace it with a more traditional painting that was also commissioned for the exhibition, ''Madrid 1937 (Black Aeroplanes)'' by Horacio Ferrer de Morgado.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; Some Marxist groups criticized Picasso's painting as lacking in political commitment and faulted it for not offering a vision of a better future.&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, Robin A. (2006). ''Surrealism and the Spanish Civil War''. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 241. {{ISBN|0300112955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Morgado's painting was a great success with Spanish Communists and with the public.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; The art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] was also critical of ''Guernica'', but for different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Witham (2013), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In a later essay, Greenberg termed ''Guernica'' "jerky" and "too compressed for its size", and compared it unfavorably to the "magnificently lyrical" ''[[The Charnel House]]'' (1944–48), a later antiwar painting by Picasso.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg (1993), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the painting's admirers were the art critic [[Jean Cassou]] and the poet [[José Bergamín]], both of whom praised the painting as quintessentially Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2003), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Leiris]] perceived in the painting a foreshadowing: "On a black and white canvas that depicts ancient tragedy ... Picasso also writes our letter of doom: all that we love is going to be lost..."&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2003), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European tour===
''Guernica'', for which Picasso was paid 200,000 francs for his costs by the Spanish Republican government, was one of the few major paintings that were not sold directly from artist to his exclusive contracted [[art dealer]] and friend, [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MbJ7bzsbo8C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83 Van Hensbergen, Gijs (2005) ''Guernica'' p. 83 Bloomsbury Publishing] At Google Books. Retrieved 4 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after its exhibition Rosenberg organised a four-man extravaganza [[Scandinavia]]n tour of 118 works by Picasso, [[Matisse]], [[Braque]] and [[Henri Laurens]]. The main attraction was ''Guernica'', and from January to April 1938 the tour visited [[Oslo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg|Göteborg]]. In September 1938 the painting travelled to England, exhibited in [[London]]'s [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] organized by [[Roland Penrose]] with [[Clement Attlee]], where it arrived on 30 September 1938, the same day the [[Munich Agreement]] was signed by the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany. It then travelled onwards to [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]] and in early 1939 [[Manchester]]. There, Manchester Foodship For Spain, a group of artists and activists engaged in sending aid to the people of Spain, exhibited the painting in the HE Nunn &amp; Co Ford automobile showroom for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16927120 |title=BBC News – Picasso's Guernica in a car showroom |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 February 2012 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then returned briefly to France.

===American tour===
After the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain, the painting was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. The San Francisco Museum of Art (later [[SFMOMA]]) gave the work its first public, free appearance in the United States from 27 August to 19 September 1939. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City then mounted a Picasso exhibition on 15 November 1939 that remained on view until 7 January 1940, entitled: ''Picasso: 40 Years of His Art'', that was organized by [[Alfred H. Barr]] in collaboration with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The exhibition contained 344 works, including ''Guernica'' and its studies.&lt;ref&gt;Fluegel (1980), p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

At Picasso's request the safekeeping of the piece was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, as it was Picasso's expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; Between 1939 and 1952, the painting traveled extensively in the United States; between 1953 and 1956 it was shown in [[Brazil]], at the first-ever Picasso retrospective in [[Milan]], Italy, and then in numerous other major European cities, before returning to MoMA for a retrospective celebrating Picasso's 75th birthday. It then went on to [[Chicago]] and [[Philadelphia]]. By this time, concern for the state of the painting resulted in a decision to keep it in one place: a room on MoMA's third floor, where it was accompanied by several of Picasso's preliminary studies and some of [[Dora Maar]]'s photographs of the work in progress. The studies and photos were often loaned for other exhibitions, but until 1981, ''Guernica'' itself remained at MoMA.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/guernica/glevel_1/gtimeline.html Timeline], part of a series of web pages on ''Guernica'' in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Treasures of the World'' series. Accessed 16 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Vietnam War]], the room containing the painting became the site of occasional anti-war vigils. These were usually peaceful and uneventful, but on 28 February 1974, [[Tony Shafrazi]]—ostensibly protesting Second Lieutenant [[William Calley]]'s petition for habeas corpus following his indictment and sentencing for the murder of 109 Vietnamese civilians during the [[My Lai massacre]]—defaced the painting with red spray paint, painting the words "KILL LIES ALL"; the paint was removed with relative ease from the varnished surface.&lt;ref name="Hoberman 2004"&gt;Hoberman 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment in Spain==
As early as 1968, Franco had expressed an interest in having ''Guernica'' come to Spain.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; However, Picasso refused to allow this until the Spanish people again enjoyed a republic. He later added other conditions, such as the restoration of "public liberties and democratic institutions". Picasso died in 1973. Franco, ten years Picasso's junior, died two years later, in 1975. After Franco's death, Spain was transformed into a democratic [[constitutional monarchy]], ratified by [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|a new constitution]] in 1978. However, MoMA was reluctant to give up one of its greatest treasures and argued that a monarchy did not represent the republic that had been stipulated in Picasso's will as a condition for the painting's delivery. Under great pressure from a number of observers, MoMA finally ceded the painting to Spain in 1981. The Spanish historian [[Javier Tusell]] was one of the negotiators.

Upon its arrival in Spain in September 1981,&lt;ref name=uned/&gt; it was first displayed behind bomb-and bullet-proof glass screens&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8TO5wF6wUfoC&amp;pg=PA294 Van Hensbergen, Gijs (2005) ''Guernica'' p. 305.

Retrieved 18 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time there has never been any attempted vandalism or other security threat to the painting.
[[File:Mural del Gernika.jpg|right|thumb|A tiled wall in Gernika claims ''"Guernica" Gernikara'', "The ''Guernica'' (painting) to Gernika."]]
In 1992, the painting was moved from the [[Museo del Prado]] to a purpose-built gallery at the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía]], both in Madrid, along with about two dozen preparatory works.&lt;ref name=his&gt;[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/la-institucion/the-extension/el-cason-del-buen-retiro/historia/ The Casón del Buen Retiro: History] [[Museo del Prado]]. Retrieved 18 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This action was controversial in Spain, since Picasso's will stated that the painting should be displayed at the Prado. However, the move was part of a transfer of all of the Prado's collections of art after the early 19th century to other nearby buildings in the city for reasons of space; the Reina Sofía, which houses the capital's national collection of 20th-century art, was the natural place to move it to.
At the Reina Sofía, the painting has roughly the same protection as any other work.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;[http://www.picassoswar.com/interview.html Author interview] on Russell Martin's ''Picasso's War'' site. Accessed 16 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tapestry at the United Nations==

[[File:Guernica at the Whitechapel - geograph.org.uk - 1593698.jpg|thumb|The tapestry, at the [[Whitechapel Gallery]] in 2009]]

A full-size [[tapestry]] copy of Picasso's ''Guernica'', by {{ill|Jacqueline de la Baume Dürrbach|WD=Q32979529}},&lt;ref name="IPoG"&gt;{{Cite news |title=In praise of ... Guernica |work=The Guardian |accessdate = 2017-07-12 |date=2009-03-26 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/26/pablo-picasso-guernica-spain-war }}&lt;/ref&gt; is hung at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations]] in [[New York City]] at the entrance to the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] room. It was displayed first from 1985 to 2009, and returned in 2015. It was commissioned in 1955 by [[Nelson Rockefeller]], since Picasso refused to sell him the original.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Peter. [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/oct/03/art "A scream we can't ignore"], ''The Guardian'', 10 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The tapestry was placed on loan to the United Nations by the Rockefeller estate in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2009), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The tapestry is less monochromatic than the original and uses several shades of brown.

On 5 February 2003 a large blue curtain was placed to cover this work at the UN, so that it would not be visible in the background when [[Colin Powell]] and [[John Negroponte]] gave press conferences at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day, it was claimed that the curtain was placed there at the request of television news crews, who had complained that the wild lines and screaming figures made for a bad backdrop, and that a horse's hindquarters appeared just above the faces of any speakers. Some diplomats, however, in talks with journalists claimed that the Bush Administration pressured UN officials to cover the tapestry, rather than have it in the background while Powell or other US diplomats argued for war on Iraq.&lt;ref name="Cohen_2003"&gt;Cohen (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In a critique of the covering, columnist Alejandro Escalona hypothesized that ''Guernica''{{'}}s "unappealing ménage of mutilated bodies and distorted faces proved to be too strong for articulating to the world why the US was going to war in Iraq", while referring to the work as "an inconvenient masterpiece."&lt;ref name = "75years" /&gt;

On 17 March 2009, Deputy Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Marie Okabe announced that the ''Guernica'' tapestry had been moved to a gallery in London in advance of extensive renovations at UN Headquarters. The ''Guernica'' tapestry was the showcase piece for the grand reopening of the [[Whitechapel Gallery]]. It was located in the 'Guernica room' which was originally part of the old Whitechapel Library.&lt;ref&gt;Hensbergen (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the tapestry was on temporary loan to the [[San Antonio Museum of Art]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]] from the Rockefeller family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samuseum.org|title=San Antonio Museum of Art - Home|first=San Antonio Museum of|last=Art|website=Samuseum.org|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was returned to the UN by March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Remnick, David (2015). [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman "Today's Woman"], ''The New Yorker'', 23 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance and legacy==
{{quote box| quote = ''Guernica'' is to painting what [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] is to music: a cultural&lt;br /&gt;icon that speaks to mankind not only against war but also of hope and peace.&lt;br /&gt;It is a reference when speaking about genocide from [[El Mozote massacre|El Salvador]] to [[Srebrenica massacre|Bosnia]].

During the 1970s, it was a symbol for Spaniards of both the end of the Franco regime and of [[Basque nationalism]]. The [[Basque National Liberation Movement|Basque left]] has repeatedly used imagery from the picture. An example is the organization [[Etxerat]] which uses a reversed image of the lamp as its symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etxerat|url=http://www.etxerat.eus/index.php/eu/txostenak/hilabetekaria|publisher=Etxerat|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works inspired by ''Guernica'' include [[Goshka Macuga]]'s ''The Nature of the Beast'' (2009–2010), which used the Whitechapel-hosted [[Guernica (Picasso)#Tapestry at the United Nations|United Nations Guernica tapestry]]; ''The Keiskamma Guernicas'' (2010–2017); and Erica Luckert's theatrical production of ''Guernica'' (2011–2012).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Art and design historian Dr Nicola Ashmore curated an exhibition, ''Guernica Remakings'', at the [[University of Brighton]] galleries from 29 July 2017 to 23 August 2017.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

''Guernica'' has become a universal and powerful symbol warning humanity against the suffering and devastation of war.&lt;ref name = "75years" /&gt; Moreover, the fact that there are no obvious references to the specific attack has contributed to making its message universal and timeless.&lt;ref name = "75years" /&gt;

In biblical studies, '''inclusio''' is a [[literary device]] based on a concentric principle, also known as '''bracketing''' or an '''envelope structure''', which consists of creating a frame by placing similar material at the beginning and end of a section, although whether this material should consist of a word or a phrase, or whether greater amounts of text also qualify, and of what length the frames section should be, are matters of some debate. Inclusio is found in various sources, both antique and new.  The purpose of an inclusio may be structural - to alert the reader to a particularly important theme - or it may serve to show how the material within the inclusio relates to the inclusio itself.  An important case of this occurs in the Gospel of Mark's treatment of the "Cursing of the Fig Tree" and the "Cleansing of the Temple" (Chapter 11).  By giving the first half of the story before the Cleansing of the Temple, and the conclusion after, Mark creates a "frame" that effectively highlights that he wants the Cleansing of the Temple to be seen in light of the Cursing of the Fig Tree - i.e. Jesus' actions in the Temple are not just a reform measure, but a judgment against it.

==In the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament)==

While this may not be evident to many of the Bible's modern day readers, the [[Hebrew Bible]] is full of literary devices, some of which, having fallen out of favor over the years, are lost on most modern readers. ''Inclusio'', of which many instances can be found in the Bible, is one of these, although many instances of its usage are not apparent to those reading translations of the Bible rather than the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] source.

Particularly noteworthy are the many instances of ''inclusio'' in the [[Book of Jeremiah]]. A rather far-flung example of ''inclusio'' in the Book of Jeremiah can be found in its first section, chapters 1–24, which are enveloped both by a similar question in the first and last episode (1:11, 24:3), and by similar imagery—that of almond rods and baskets of figs. ''Inclusio'' may also be found between chapters 36 and 45, both of which mention Baruch ben Nerya, to whom Jeremiah's prophecies were entrusted. ''Bracketing'' can also be seen in The Lord's sayings in 1:10 and 24:6. Indeed, the whole book save for its last (52nd) chapter—which some claim was appended to it—can be thought of as inside the ''inclusio'' formed by 1:1 and 51:64, both of which mention the preaching of Jeremiah (דברי ירמיה), thus implying the lateness of chapter 52; although analyzing whether so trivial a measure has any meaning but that which appeases the eye is best left to the astute reader. None of this is to say that the shorter forms of inclusio—those in which the section enframed is quite shorter—are not found in the Book of Jeremiah. An example is found in Jeremiah 4:22, which reads:

{| align="center" dir="rtl"
|כי אויל עמי אותי לא ידעו בנים סכלים המה ולא נבונים המה חכמים המה להרע ולהיטיב לא ידעו.
|}

{| align="center"
([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]]: ''For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.'')
|}

The phrase "לא ידעו" (''did not know'') is found at the beginning and the end of The Lord's analysis of his people. English translations do not preserve this structure.

Inclusio also abounds in other books of the Bible. An obvious example of inclusio is found in the first and last (29th) verses of Psalm 118 "הודו לה' כי-טוב כי לעולם חסדו.". Another, more disputed, example may be found in the [[Book of Ruth]], where one finds a certain resemblance, if somewhat [[chiastic]], between 1:1 and 1:22—in the former Elimelekh leaves [[Bethlehem]] in favor of [[Moab]], and in the latter Ruth and [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] leave [[Moab]] in favor of Bethlehem.  Finally, it has been suggested that [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2 contains inclusio, for the male is created at the start of the passage and the female at the end, providing textual evidence for the parallels between the two.

==In Rabbinic Literature==

The rabbis of the Talmud were aware of occurrences of inclusio in the Bible, as shown by R. Yohanan's comment in the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 10a that "Any psalm dear to David he opened with "אשרי" ('happy is he') and closed with "אשרי" ('happy is he'). Redactors of rabbinic document frequently made use of inclusio to mark off the endpoints of literary units of different sizes and possibly to suggest conceptual connections between seemingly disparate statements. At the end of the Mishnah tractate Kelim, R. Yose explicitly notes the phenomenon: "Happy are you, Kelim, in that you opened with [statements regarding] impurity and departed with [statements regarding] purity." Tractate Berakhot, which opens with a discussion of the laws of reciting the שמע (Hear O Israel) passage from Deuteronomy 6:4-9, concludes with a homiletic interpretation of the second verse from this passage (v. 5), showing how the ritual recitation of the tractate's opening may serve as a source of spiritual instruction at the tractate's end. Tractate Nazir is framed by allusions to two famous biblical Nazirites - Samson (M. Nazir 1:2) and Samuel (M. Nazir 9:5), representing respectively negative and positive exemplars of this institution.

Many chapters of Mishnah are also framed by inclusio. In the opening mishnah of Taanit Chapter 1, R. Joshua notes that rain on the festival of Sukkot is "not a sign of blessing", and the closing mishnah of the chapter notes that rainfall after the month of Nisan is "a sign of curse". This characterization of rainfall as God's way of communicating His blessings and curses is a central theme of the chapter. Sometimes the inclusio is based on a wordplay. Ohalot Chapter 7 opens with a discussion of corpse impurity in a "נפש אטומה" ('solid monument')and closes with the statement that a baby whose head has emerged from the womb may not be killed to save the mother because "אין דוחין נפש מפני נפש" ('one soul may not be set aside in favor of another'). The use of the word נפש (nefesh) at the beginning and the end of the chapter in opposite meanings, symbolizing respectively death and life, emphasize the interconnection between the mysteries of birth and of death.

Examples of inclusio may be found in later rabbinic literature as well. Tosefta Makkot Chapter 3 opens and closes with statements regarding the designation of three cities of refuge. Homilies regarding Isaiah 32:20 appear at the beginning and end of BT Bava Kamma Chapter 1. The opening homily of Leviticus Rabba 29 asserts that the fate of Adam on the day of his creation is a sign for his children annually on the same date, and the closing homily of this section asserts that when Israel observes the commandments of this day God will regard them as having been created anew. Rabbinic redactors, following in the footsteps of their biblical predecessors, continued to employ inclusio as a literary marker and tool.

==In the New Testament==

The [[New Testament]] also uses inclusio. The main teaching part in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] starts and ends with the expression “the Law and the Prophets” (Matthew 5:17 + 7:12). [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]’s account of the first part of [[Jesus]]’ public ministry is framed by an account on his teaching and his miracles (Matthew 4:23 +9:35).
Also, Matthew’s Gospel begins with the prophecy that Jesus' name would be “Emmanuel, that is, ‘God with us,’” (1:23, in which the author has linked Isaiah 7:14 and 8:8, 10 together) and it ends with the promise, "I am with you always, to the end of the age". This forms an inclusio about Jesus in his relationship to his people that suggests his deity. 
The [[letter to the Hebrews]] uses [[Jeremiah]]’s prophecy as an inclusio in 8:8-12 and 10:16-18.
There are many more examples of this literary device in the New Testament.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6589">'''KISS''' is an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] for "'''Keep it simple, stupid'''" as a design principle noted by the [[U.S. Navy]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=TDal/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPar/&gt; The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore [[simplicity]] should be a key goal in [[design]], and that unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]].&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt; The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970.&lt;ref name=Pit/&gt; Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward",&lt;ref name="monash"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.monash.edu/business/marketing/marketing-dictionary/k/kiss-principle |title=Kiss principle definition by MONASH Marketing Dictionary| date=1994-11-18 | accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; "keep it small and simple" and "keep it stupid simple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html| title=Kiss Principle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The acronym was reportedly coined by [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], lead engineer at the [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]] (creators of the [[Lockheed U-2]] and [[SR-71 Blackbird]] spy planes, among many others).&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt;

While popular usage has transcribed it for decades as "Keep it simple, stupid", Johnson transcribed it as "Keep it simple stupid" (no comma), and this reading is still used by many authors.&lt;ref name=misra&gt;Ram B. Misra (2004), "Global IT Outsourcing: Metrics for Success of All Parties", ''Journal of Information Technology Cases and Applications'', volume 6 issue 3, page 21. [http://web.njit.edu/~jerry/Outsourcing/out-JITCA-6-3-2004-2.pdf Online version]. Retrieved 2009-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no implicit meaning that an engineer was stupid; just the opposite.&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt;

The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools. Hence, the "stupid" refers to the relationship between the way things break and the sophistication available to repair them.

The acronym has been used by many in the [[List of military slang terms|U.S. military]], especially the [[List of U.S. Navy acronyms and expressions|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Air Force]], and in the field of [[software developer|software development]].

==Variants==
The principle most likely finds its origins in similar [[Minimalism|minimalist]] concepts, such as [[Occam's razor]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication", [[Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s "[[Less is more (architecture)|Less is more]]", [[Bjarne Stroustrup]]'s "Make Simple Tasks Simple!", or [[Antoine de Saint Exupéry]]'s "It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away". [[Colin Chapman]], the founder of [[Lotus Cars]], urged his designers to "Simplify, then add lightness". [[Heath Robinson]] machines and [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg's machines]], intentionally overly-complex solutions to simple tasks or problems, are humorous examples of "non-KISS" solutions. Also Shakespeare's "Brevity is the soul of wit".

A variant — "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler" — is attributed to [[Albert Einstein]], although this may be an editor's paraphrase of a lecture he gave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/#more-2363|title=Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler|publisher=Quote Investigator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film animation==
Master animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] explains the KISS principle in his book ''[[The Animator's Survival Kit]]'', and [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] write about it in ''[[Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life]]'', a considerable work of the genre. The problem faced is that inexperienced animators may "over-animate" in their works, that is, a character may move too much and do too much.  Williams urges animators to "KISS".

'''Horse Cave Theatre''' (in its mid-life known as Kentucky Repertory Theatre) is a [[theater]] company located in [[Horse Cave, Kentucky]], United States. The company is located in two former commercial buildings in the city's [[downtown]] area.

KRT was formed as Horse Cave Theatre in 1976, and was a novelty for its time: a professional theater company located in a small rural town, producing a series of plays in a [[repertory]] cycle. The theater's proximity to the [[Mammoth Cave National Park]] tourist area was hoped to help attract theatergoers, and that has been proven to be the case over the years, though the theater enjoys substantial support from the town's residents as well, as well as those in neighboring [[Cave City, Kentucky|Cave City]], [[Glasgow, Kentucky|Glasgow]], [[Munfordville, Kentucky|Munfordville]] and other surrounding cities.

The primary season for KRT was originally in the [[summer]], when tourism business in the area is at its peak. In recent times, the company shifted its season to a period between [[autumn]] and [[Christmas]], while continuing to present a single production in the summer to attract tourists.  Over the years, KRT productions have run the gamut of theater, from [[George Bernard Shaw]] to [[Neil Simon]], with one play by [[William Shakespeare]] being featured nearly every season. The company has also encouraged works by Kentucky playwrights, including at least one such work in its repertory nearly every season. [[Sallie Bingham]], a descendant of the Bingham family of Louisville (former owners of ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' and numerous other media properties), has had three of her plays produced by KRT.

The theater was housed in two renovated buildings, and seated 346 people in its main auditorium. An entrance building, built to resemble a tobacco barn typically found in southern Kentucky, was added at the opening. In 1998, the company purchased a residential building for office space, and a nearby warehouse for [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]] and [[Theatrical properties|prop]] construction. The main theater buildings are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Warren Hammack was KRT's first artistic director, serving the company for 25 years until his retirement.

He was succeeded by director, [[Robert Brock]].  Mr. Brock was the Artistic Director of Kentucky Repertory Theatre from 2002-2011. In that time he produced 86 plays, 11 of them were new scripts premiering at the theatre. Under his directorship the theatre's Educational Outreach Programs tripled the number of students impacted (15,000 students in 22 counties annually). He created the very popular and successful Young Performers Program in 1999 and produced and directed 14 shows involving middle and high school students from the region. The Young Performers Program produced a number of young actors that went on to receive theatre scholarships to colleges and universities nationwide. 9 Young Performers were accepted into the Governor's School for the Arts. Mr. Brock also initiated a cooperative program with T J Samson Hospital and Barren County Drug Prevention to address health issues with young people in the region. The program was called Project HEAT (Health Education Awareness Theatre) and produced three plays that toured to schools. These plays offered an entertaining and imaginative approach to looking at Drug, Alcohol and Tobacco Abuse, Bullying and Hygiene. In 2008 Mr. Brock accepted the Governor's Arts Award on behalf of KRT. While Mr. Brock was Artistic Director, KRT received many accolades, among them being named ‘one of the Top Ten small regional theatres in the nation’ by USA Today. The Theatre's Educational Outreach Program was written up in the [[The Cincinnati Enquirer|Cincinnati Enquirer]], [[The Indianapolis Star]], [[The Evansville Courier]], and [[The Dallas Morning News]]. While Mr. Brock was Director, KRT was commissioned by the [[Kentucky Humanities Council]] and the Kentucky Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission to produce two plays about Lincoln ( Abraham Lincoln and One Man's Lincoln) during the bicentennial years 2008-2009. Mr Brock performed with [[Annie Potts]] in 2 productions of [[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]] in 2002 and 2003 that played in Horse Cave, Elizabethtown and Bowling Green, and directed [[Sally Struthers]] in another production of Love Letters in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.glasgowdailytimes.com/news/lifestyles/love-letters/article_f94f82b0-2fa1-592b-8a4d-f0fc54a2e7a8.html|title=‘Love Letters’|last=Times|first=SUSAN TEBBENGlasgow Daily|work=Glasgow Daily Times|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://subscriber.thenewsenterprise.com/content/struthers-gallagher-star-elizabethtown-presentation-love-letters|title=Struthers, Gallagher to star in Elizabethtown presentation of 'Love Letters' {{!}} TheNewsEnterprise.com|website=subscriber.thenewsenterprise.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Christopher Carter Sanderson for one season. For the 2013 season, RepALLIANCE under the direction of Ken Neil Hailey took over the producing duties. In May 2013, the theatre was closed due to debt that had built up over a number of the later seasons. The theatre and its board suspended operations while the core directors and actors who produced the successful final season moved on and formed a new company, Kentucky Stage(s), in residence at Bowling Green's new SKyPAC (Southern Kentucky Performing Arts Center during the 2013-14 season. Kentucky Stage(s) observed the process after closure and has retained a contract to reacquire and restore the theatre, re-re-branding the facility again as THE HORSE CAVE THEATRE. Plans to reopen the theatre by the summer of 2015 were unsuccessful.

The '''Keshcarrigan Bowl''' is an [[Iron age]] bronze bowl discovered to the north of [[Keshcarrigan]], [[county Leitrim]], [[Ireland]], in the [[19th century]]. The bowl was found in the waterway between [[Lough Scur]] and [[Lough Marrave]] ("lake of death").{{sfn|Mulvany, Fraser, Roberts, Mulvany, O'Flaherty|1852|pp=lix}} It was perhaps a ceremonial drinking cup.{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=325}} The bowl would have been a  prestigious item in [[1st century]] [[Ireland]], the bird-shaped handle outstandingly designed and skillfully executed.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=94}}{{sfn|Allen|1898|pp=5}} The Keshcarrigan Bowl is in the [[National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology|archaeology branch of the National Museum of Ireland]].{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}}

The Keshcarrigan bowl is considered one of the finest classic cast bronze cups, or drinking vessel.  Made of bright-yellow metal, it was discovered {{nobreak|{{circa|1842|1850}}}} during the building of the "[[Shannon–Erne Waterway|Ulster Canal]]".{{sfn|Mulvany, Fraser, Roberts, Mulvany, O'Flaherty|1852|pp=lix}}{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=325}}{{sfn|Wilde|1857|534}} The [[bowl]] is a fine golden [[bronze]] only {{convert|14|cm|1}} wide and {{convert|1|mm}} in thickness, being cast or beaten into shape before being finished and polished by being spun on a lathe.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}}{{sfn|Harding|2007|pp=183}}{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=323}} The neck was finished off against an internal mould.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}} The principal decorative feature of the bowl is its cast bronze zoomorphic handle, following the graceful shape of a bird-beast head of a somewhat nondescript appearance influenced by the flamboyant ornamentation of its time, soldered to the body of the vessel at the base and loosely connected to the vessel neck.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}}{{sfn|Allen|1898|pp=52}} The ridge at the front of the bird-head, the 'shield' below, and impression of a beak turning-backward, are all characteristic of the male-[[Shelduck]].{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=95}}

In 2018 it was shown on an [[Irish postage stamp]], after featuring in ''[[A History of Ireland in 100 Objects]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://100objects.ie/keshcarrigan-bowl/ Page] in ''[[A History of Ireland in 100 Objects]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Torrs Pony-cap and Horns|Witham Shield|Wandsworth Shield}}
The brilliantly modeled ducks-head handle on the Keshcarrigan bowl is an early masterpiece of the style, comparable to the best British work of the period such as the bird-finials on the [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns|Torrs Chamfrein horns]],{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=94}} the stylistic identity of both heads representing ducks, and both having empty slots for studs in the eyes.{{sfn|Atkinson, Piggott|1953|pp=223}} The Torrs style originated in Britain in the middle or second half of the third century BC. The Keshcarrigan cup is on stylistic grounds likely to be contemporary with the Torrs pieces, with the “crimped” pattern on the rim of the Keshcarrigan bowl perhaps comparable with similar techniques used on [[Wandsworth Shield|the circular Wandsworth boss]] and the terminal circular insignias on the [[Witham Shield]].  The bowl seems to have close affinities to pottery bowls of identical profile from Brittany, which have a similar “crimped” pattern on their inner rims. Being lathe-spun the age of the bowl suggests a comparatively late date at variance with the stylistic evidence.  The bowl is of importance in showing the Torrs style is recorded in both Britain and Ireland.{{sfn|Atkinson, Piggott|1953|pp=231}}  The cup resembles another found at [[Fore, County Westmeath]], which is slightly earlier and imported from Britain, as this may also be.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace and O'Floinn, 4:7 (Fore), 4:8 (Keshcarrigan)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==  
The bowl was intended for drinking purposes, for eating food out of, as a container, and ceremonial purposes.{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=325}}{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=94}}{{sfn|Allen|1898|pp=52}} Metal handled cups are a feature of late [[La Tène culture]], and their production might have been stimulated by the re-appearance of wine-services imported from the Classical world.{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=221}}{{refn|The bowl was found in, or beside, [[Lough Marrave]]  ({{lang-ga|Loch Marbh}}, "dead lake" or "lake of death"), perhaps deposited as a pagan ritual offering.|group=n|name=cupInDeadLake}}

==Origin==
Some sources suggest the bowl was imported across the [[Irish Sea]] because the practice of producing bronze bowls using a spinning technique was done in the [[Belgae#Belgae outside Gaul|Belgae]] workshops of south-east [[England]], and Roman continental workshops, rather than Ireland.{{sfn|Harding|2007|pp=183}}{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=93}} However the evidence for this conclusion is conjecture, and the Keshcarrigan bowl was just as likely made in Ireland.{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=220}} A reasonably close parallel to the Keshcarrigan cup is a handled vessel of willow, presumably Irish origin, in the National Museum of Ireland, and another bronze handle from a similar profile cup was discovered at [[County Galway]].{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=220}} Conversely, though a similar handle was recently found in the Somerset hoard,{{sfn|Harding|2007|pp=183}} no other vessel of this style was found in southern Britain,{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=221}} so the practice of making bowls with ornamental bird handles must have become established in Ireland sometime in the early [[1st Century]] AD.{{sfn|Jope|1971|pp=118}}

===Belgae refugees===
[[Fintan O'Toole|O'Toole]] suggested the Keshcarrigan Bowl represents evidence for the movement of people into Ireland following upheavals in Celtic Europe in the century before and after the birth of Christ. Gallic [[Belgae|Belgic tribes]] crossed into Britain as refugees from the Romans and displacing native people some of whom came to Ireland.{{sfn|O'Toole|2013|p=45}}

== ''Horrible Histories Gruesome Guides'' ==

Previously ''Horrible Histories Cities''
Some ''Horrible Histories'' have been based around a particular city, rather than a nation or a specific time period. They also have a map when the front cover is folded out, and explain some structures in the city when the back cover is folded out. Therefore, many people consider them to be a sub-series as well. (Even though Loathsome London doesn't have these qualities, it was included into this sub-series during the republishing of the series from 2008 to 2011.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1407104233 Amazon.com: London (Horrible Histories Gruesome Gd) (9781407104232): Terry Deary: Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BO34LAAACAAJ&amp;dq=horrible+histories&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lPerTffbLo-2vQO-oomWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwADgK ''Gruesome Guides'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ludic Interfaces Example.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Student experiment in Interface Design developed at UP Valencia]]
A '''ludic interface''' is a type of [[interface (computing)|computer interface]]. In the field of [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI), the term '''ludic Interfaces''' describes a discipline that focuses on [[user interface]]s that are inherently "playful". This field of interface research and design draws on concepts introduced by Dutch historian and cultural theorist [[Johan Huizinga]] in the book [[Homo Ludens (book)|Homo Ludens]] ("Man the Player" or "Playing Man").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Huizinga
  | first = Johan
  | title = Homo ludens. Vom Ursprung der Kultur im Spiel
  | publisher = Rowohlt Verlag
  | year = 1994 (orig. 1938)
  | isbn = 3-499-55435-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Huizinga's work is considered an important contribution to the development of [[game studies]].

The various tools and concepts associated with ludic interface development differ from mainstream technological systems that employ human computer interfacing and interaction. Ludic interfaces tend to be  more playful, are [[user-generated]] and user-driven, flexible, low-cost and [[cooperative]]. Such interfaces are often experimental and draw upon methods and knowledge from [[video game design]],  [[interactive media]], [[modding]] cultures, media conversion, and [[social networks|social networking]]. The goal of ludic interface design is to create interfacing technology that offers ease of use and is inherently playful.

==Core concept==
At its core, "ludic interfaces" is a subcategory of interfaces in general. The notion is not restricted to electronics or human–computer interaction, even if the terminology was developed in respect to digital technology. Various authors suggest to use the term "ludic interfaces" for non-digital phenomena, e.g. architectural facades, skins, wearable computers, media art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | first = Laurent
  | title = Interface Cultures: Artistic Aspects of Interaction
  | publisher = Transcript Verlag
  | year = 2008
  | isbn = 3899428846}}
&lt;/ref&gt; "Ludic Interfaces" is also a Masters programme development on a European level. It is the title of a European collaboration in creating a network of academic institutions and of world leading media centres to investigate, design and test publicly shared digital content. The programme development is a joint project by the University of Potsdam, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, Universität für künstlerische und industrielle Gestaltung in Linz, and by the [[University of Salford]] in Greater [[Manchester]].

==History==

Ludic interface design was first defined in 2002 by William Gaver, in "Designing for Homo Ludens",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Gaver
  | first = William
  | title = Designing for Homo Ludens
  | journal = I3 Magazine
  |date=June 2002}}
&lt;/ref&gt; expanded in a later article in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Gaver
 | first=William

 | publisher=Springer
 | year=2009
 | chapter=Designing for Homo Ludens, Still.
 | pages=163–178
 | location=London
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was revisited in 2008 by [[ISEA International|International Symposium on Electronic Art]]) curators Gunalan Nadarajan and Vladimir Todorović to describe a panel section of ISEA2008 in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Nadarajan
  | first = Gunalan
  | title = ISEA2008 Conference Proceedings
  | publisher = ISEA2008 Pte Ltd
  | year = 2008
  | isbn = 978-981-08-0768-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced with the aim of counterbalancing the tendency of "infantilization of play" and stressing the "complicities between technology and pleasure".

In the same year a group of game artists and scholars at Leuphana University in Lueneburg started lecturing and writing about the theory of Ludic Interfaces and applied for a European grant to develop a Masters programme in Ludic Interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;An interview about Ludic Interfaces by Digital Arts and Architecture Lab with Mathias Fuchs can be found on http://inm.de/index.cfm?siteid=190&amp;CFID=3969946&amp;CFTOKEN=5bbbde746c0b288f-653F9F40-A892-243B-D200A47407920729&amp;jsessionid=80308ba15754$1E$2F$3&lt;/ref&gt; The application was successful and the development has successfully been completed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | date=August 19, 2009 &lt;!-- at 3:47 pm --&gt; 
 | accessdate = 2009-11-19}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "ludic interfaces" has also historical roots in artistic practice and analysis of interfaces (cf. Christa Sommerer, Laurent Mignonneau),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Sommerer, Christa/ Lakhmi, Jain/ Mignonneau

&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of "playfulness" as a design and arts strategy, or the "Ludic Society" arts organisation.

==Examples==
{{original research|section|date=August 2014}}
[[Image:Ludic Interfaces Kilby Tarot 200.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Ludic interface experiment by student Jess Kilby from University of Salford, using RFID tag technology for a digital tarot reader.]][[Image:Mathias Fuchs postvinyl resfest live.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Ludic interface by Mathias Fuchs, using Djing tools in combination with a game engine: "postvinyl"]]

Jess Kilby’s RFID Tarot table consists of a hand-painted black table with letters and signs drawn upon it, and a white set of cards containing radio-frequency tags. The installation is an example for a ludic set-up where the interface contributes significantly to the magic of the game. Hidden information within the blank cards allows the RFID reader, a digital tarot reader automaton, to interpret information hidden from the human eye. Kilby’s system interprets the information contained within the cards and displays videos of a frightening future. The game could certainly be implemented as a Flash simulation or be built for a 2D monitor display system, but without the materiality of the ludic interface, without the special lighting, and without the artist dressed in a fortune teller’s dress the game would not work at all. The same holds true for [[Mary Flanagan]]’s “Giant Joystick”. It is the interface with all its materiality, erotic connotations and haptic features which makes the ludic installation work so well. Ludic interfaces can also facilitate play in a musical sense. The "postvinyl" performance, originally commissioned by futuresonic festival [[Manchester]] in 2004 recontextualizes a computer game in a performance environment.

'''Marietta Pallis''' (1882–1963) was a [[Greeks|Greek]]-Briton [[ecology|ecologist]] and [[botany|botanical]] artist. She is noted for research in aquatic botany, especially the [[Norfolk Broads]] and the [[Danube Delta]] as well as her creation of devotional landscapes.

==Biography==
Pallis was born in [[Bombay]],&lt;ref name="Matless"/&gt; the daughter of the [[Greeks|Greek]] poet and language reformer [[Alexandros Pallis]]. She moved to England when she was 12&lt;ref name="BDWS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogilvie|first=Marilyn Bailey|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: L-Z|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-92040-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LTSYePZvSXYC&amp;lpg=PA973&amp;ots=hOp4oWZ1aA&amp;dq=Marietta%20Pallis&amp;pg=PA973#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Harvey, Joy Dorothy|page=973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was brought up in Liverpool. Her younger brother was [[Marco Pallis]], an author and mountaineer who wrote about Tibet. From 1904 to 1907 she studied botany at [[Liverpool University]] and attended [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] from 1910 to 1912.&lt;ref name="Matless"/&gt; Pallis rented and later owned Long Gores farm, marshland property in Hickling, Norfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Le Vay|first=Benedict|chapter=Marietta Pallis|title=Eccentric Cambridge|year=2006|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|location=Chalfont St. Peter|isbn=978-1-84162-172-2|pages=123–124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTJaxmQ9ow8C&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=%22Marietta%20Pallis%22&amp;pg=PA123#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pallis studied the plav, floating reed systems of the [[Danube Delta]]; writing a paper for the journal of the Linnaean Society in 1916.&lt;ref name="Matless"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matless|first=David|title=Sacred Gardens And Landscapes: Ritual And Agency|year=2006|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-88402-305-0|pages=263–294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=muhAPvjxXnQC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;lpg=PA263&amp;dq=%22Marietta+Pallis%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1WXwa4eMrA&amp;sig=22i8xy5qf8lJeexDobtx6z284XU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=22qBUIThDuKW2QXv8YGAAg&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwCA|author2=Cameron, Laura|chapter=Devotional Landscape in the work of Marietta Pallis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her father's death in 1935, Pallis travelled the eastern Mediterranean with her partner Phyllis Clark. She purchased the Long Gores property in 1935, planted specimens that she had acquired during her travel, and constructed a studio and garage. Pallis created in Long Gores a devotional symbolic Greek landscape, featuring the Double Headed Eagle Pool, a pool with an island shaped in the form of a crowned, double-headed [[Double-headed eagle|Byzantine eagle]] featuring the [[Papal cross|Papal Cross]], the cross of the patriarch of Constantinople and her own Greek initials.&lt;ref name="Matless"/&gt; She continued to write on Greek history and created pamphlets in the late 1950s and early 1960s concerning what she referred to as "philosophical biology".&lt;ref name="Matless"/&gt;

Pallis died in [[Norwich]], aged 81. She is buried with her companion Clark near the [[Norfolk Broads]] on the central island of the Double Headed Eagle Pool.&lt;ref name="Matless"/&gt; The tree ''[[Fraxinus pallisiae]]'' is named for her.&lt;ref name="BDWS"/&gt;

'''''Metamorphosis of Narcissus''''' (1937) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the [[Catalan phonology|Spanish]] [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]]. This painting is from Dalí's [[Paranoiac-critical method|paranoiac-critical]] period. According to [[Greek mythology]], [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] fell in love with his own reflection in a pool. Unable to embrace the watery image, he pined away, and the gods immortalized him as a flower. Dalí completed this painting in 1937 on his long-awaited return to [[Paris]] after having had great success in the [[United States]].

The painting shows Narcissus sitting in a pool, gazing down. Not far away there is a decaying stone figure which corresponds closely to him but is perceived quite differently; as a hand holding up a bulb or egg from which [[Narcissus (plant)|a Narcissus]] is growing. The egg has been used as a symbol for sexuality in other paintings by Dalí. In the background, a group of naked figures can be seen, while a third Narcissus like figure appears on the horizon.

Dalí wrote the following poem, which accompanied the painting when it was initially exhibited:

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
Under the split in the retreating black cloud 
the invisible scale of spring 
is oscillating 
in the fresh April sky. 
On the highest mountain, 
the god of the snow, 
his dazzling head bent over the dizzy space of reflections, 
starts melting with desire 
in the vertical cataracts of the thaw 
annihilating himself loudly among the excremental cries of minerals, 
or 
between [sic] the silences of mosses 
towards the distant mirror of the lake 
in which, 
the veils of winter having disappeared, 
he has newly discovered 
the lightning flash 
of his faithful image. 
It seems that with the loss of his divinity the whole high plateau 
pours itself out, 
crashes and crumbles 
among the solitude and the incurable silence of iron oxides 
while its dead weight 
raises the entire swarming and apotheosic 
plateau from the plain 
from which already thrust towards the sky 
the artesian fountains of grass 
and from which rise, 
erect, 
tender, 
and hard, 
the innumerable floral spears 
of the deafening armies of the germination of the narcissi.
&lt;ref&gt;[[Meredith Etherington-Smith]], ''The Persistence of Memory: A Biography of Dalí'', New York 1993, p.222.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;|text=Under the split in the retreating black cloud

the innumerable floral spears

Already the heterosexual group, in the renowned poses of preliminary expectation, conscientiously ponders over the threatening libidinous cataclysm, the carnivorous blooming of its latent morphological atavisms.
In the heterosexual group, 
in that kind date of the year 
(but not excessively beloved or mild), 
there are 
the Hindou 
tart, oily, sugared 
like an August date, 
the Catalan with his grave back 
well planted 
in a sun-tide, 
a Whitsuntide of flesh inside his brain,
the blond flesh-eating German, 
the brown mists 
of mathematics 
in the dimples 
of his cloudy knees, there is the English woman, 
the Russian, 
the Swedish women, 
the American 
and the tall darkling Andalusian, 
hardy with glands and olive with anguish.
Far from the heterosexual group, the shadows of the avanced [sic] afternoon draw out across the countryside, and cold lays hold of the adolescent’s nakedness as he lingers at the water’s edge.
When the clear and divine body of Narcissus 
leans 
down to the obscure mirror of the lake,
when his white torso folded forward 
fixes itself, frozen, 
in the silvered and hypnotic curve of his desire, 
when the time passes 
on the clock of the flowers of the sand of his own flesh,
Narcissus loses his being in the cosmic vertigo 
in the deepest depths of which 
is singing 
the cold and Dyonisiac siren of his own image. 
The body of Narcissus flows out and loses itself 
in the abyss of his reflection, 
like the sand glass that will not be turned again.
Narcissus, you are losing your body, 
carried away and confounded by the millenary reflection of your 
disappearance 
your body stricken dead 
falls to the topaz precipice with yellow wreckage of love, 
your white body, swallowed up, 
follows the slope of the savagely mineral torrent 
of the black precious stones with pungent perfumes, 
your body ... 
down to the unglazed mouths of the night 
on the edge of which 
there sparkles already 
all the red silverware 
of dawns with veins broken in ‘the wharves of blood’.
Narcissus, 
do you understand? 
Symmetry, divine hypnosis of the mind’s geometry, already fills up your 
head, 
with that incurable sleep, vegetable, atavistic, slow 
Which withers up the brain 
in the parchment substance 
of the kernel of your nearing metamorphosis.
The seed of your head has just fallen into the water.
Man returns to the vegetable state 
by fatigue-laden sleep 
and the gods 
by the transparent hypnosis of their passions. 
Narcissus, you are so immobile 
one would think you were asleep. 
If it were a question of Hercules rough and brown, 
one would say: he sleeps like a bole [sic]
in the posture 
of an Herculean oak. 
But you, Narcissus, 
made of perfumed bloomings of transparent adolescence, 
you sleep like a water flower.
Now the great mystery draws near, 
the great metamorphosis is about to occur.
Narcissus, in his immobility, absorbed by his reflection with the digestive slowness of carnivorous plants, becomes invisible.
There remains of him only 
the hallucinatingly white oval of his head, 
his head again more tender, 
his head, chrysalis of hidden biological designs, 
his head held up by the tips of the water’s fingers, 
at the tips of the fingers 
of the insensate hand, 
of the terrible hand, 
of the excrement-eating hand, 
of the mortal hand 
of his own reflection.
When that head slits 
when that head splits 
when that head bursts, 
it will be the flower, 
the new narcissus,|sign=[[Salvador Dalì]]|source=[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/dali-metamorphosis-of-narcissus-t02343/text-catalogue-entry]}}

'''''Miranda''''' was a British television [[sitcom]] written by and starring comedian [[Miranda Hart]]. It originally aired on [[BBC Two]] from 9 November 2009 and later on [[BBC One]]. 
Developed from Hart's semi-autobiographical [[BBC Radio 2]] comedy ''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop'' (2008), the situation comedy revolves around socially inept Miranda, who frequently finds herself in awkward situations.  The show features actors [[Sarah Hadland]], [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]], [[Patricia Hodge]], [[Sally Phillips]], [[James Holmes (actor)|James Holmes]] and [[Bo Poraj]]. It was filmed in front of live audiences at the [[BBC Television Centre]] and [[The London Studios]].

Receiving positive comments from critics, ''Miranda'' won a [[Royal Television Society]] award and gained several [[BAFTA TV Award]] nominations.&lt;ref name="Sally"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6794548.ece|title=The best television for autumn 2009|last=Kinnes|first=Sally|work=[[Sunday Times]]|publisher=[[News International]]|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6898506.ece|title=Miranda Hart stands head and shoulders above the rest|last=Maxwell|first=Dominic|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[News International]]|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mean vicky"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2009/nov/24/miranda-funny|title=Miranda: you are awful, but I like you|last=Frost|first=Vicky|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=9 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922201136/http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2009/nov/24/miranda-funny|archivedate=22 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has since been regularly repeated on British television and is available in the United States through [[Hulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/miranda|title=Hulu: Watch Miranda online|publisher=[[Hulu]]|accessdate=27 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630032639/http://www.hulu.com/miranda|archivedate=30 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premise ==
{{main|List of Miranda episodes}}

The episodes revolve around the difficulties Miranda ([[Miranda Hart]]) gets herself into. She is {{convert|6|ft|1|in|cm|abbr=on}} tall and, sometimes mistaken for a man, is addressed as 'Sir'. She has never fit in with her old boarding school friends, Tilly ([[Sally Phillips]]) and Fanny ([[Katy Wix]]), and finds social situations awkward, especially around men. She is a constant disappointment to her mother, Penny ([[Patricia Hodge]]), who is desperate for her to get a proper job and a husband. Although Miranda owns and lives above her own [[wikt:joke shop|joke shop]] and [[boutique]], she lacks any real capacity for business, so it is managed by her childhood friend Stevie Sutton ([[Sarah Hadland]]). The restaurant next door is initially run by Clive Evans ([[James Holmes (actor)|James Holmes]]), until series three, when the restaurant's chef, Gary Preston ([[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]), purchases it from him. After many failed attempts at dating, Miranda and Gary, a friend from university whom Miranda fancies, decide to be just friends. Nevertheless, when Gary gets a girlfriend called Rose ([[Naomi Bentley]]), it prompts Miranda to start a new relationship with Michael Jackford ([[Bo Poraj]]), a local reporter whose work soon takes him to Africa. Upon his return he proposes to Miranda, as does Gary when he realises his love for her. Miranda accepts Gary's proposal rather than Michael's and Miranda and Gary get married in the final episode.

* [[Miranda Hart]] as Miranda – An ungainly, socially awkward, 35-year-old woman who frequently finds herself in bizarre situations.&lt;ref name="Miranda at www.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w7dv9|title=Miranda at BBC.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123064515/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w7dv9|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is something of a misfit relative to her upper-middle-class, privately educated background, opting to invest an inheritance from her uncle in a joke/gift shop rather than pursuing what her mother perceives as a more "respectable" career, and balking at the supposedly "suitable" men that her mother and friends try to set her up with. Miranda struggles with everyday adult life, often indulging in odd, childlike behaviour (including adding faces and clothes to pieces of fruit and vegetables, dubbing them "Fruit Friends" and "Vegeta-Pals") and getting thrown out of numerous establishments. Although this often irritates her friends and family, they tolerate her because, at heart, she is intelligent and good-natured, despite not always showing it. In the final episode, after she breaks up with Gary, some of her awkward and childish behaviour disappears; this causes considerable concern for her friends and mother, who organise a therapy session. However, she finally accepts that her only serious problem – her lack of confidence – is now gone and although she does not need Gary, she does indeed love him. After an initial panic over an unexpected wedding, she marries Gary at his restaurant.
* [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]] as Gary Preston – A handsome, friendly chef; an old university friend of Miranda's. Although there has always been an undercurrent of attraction between them, neither has pursued it until he begins working at the restaurant next to Miranda's shop. Despite often being confused by Miranda's behaviour, Gary generally finds her kind, open nature endearing, especially as she is willing to help him out when needed. Gary is more confident and worldly than Miranda, but he shares her insecurity in romantic situations, and occasionally becomes embroiled in odd situations with her {{mdash}} for example, the pretence that they have sons called "Cliff" and "Richard" when challenged by a customer in the shop. He is one of the few people who accepts Miranda as she is. Miranda and Gary date briefly in series two, though this breaks down when it is revealed Gary was married (for a green card) to a waitress that Miranda had befriended at the restaurant. Gary also dates Rose briefly in series three, before breaking up with her due to her being unable to accept Miranda. After becoming engaged, Miranda becomes concerned that he has never said he loves her. When she confronts him, Gary tells Miranda that her distinctive lack of confidence in herself means that they can never truly be together. In the final episode, when Miranda accepts herself, she rushes to what she believes is Gary's wedding, where he is actually best man for his former boss Clive. Gary reveals he has already decided that he loves Miranda and offers to elope; she decides that she does not need to run away and marries Gary at Clive's reception.
* [[Sarah Hadland]] as Stevie Sutton – Miranda's childhood friend, and the assistant manager of the joke shop (although in reality she does most of the work due to Miranda's lack of business sense). She is generally more level-headed and ambitious than Miranda, but is not averse to becoming involved in her strange behaviour, or indeed indulging in some of her own, including frequently performing [[Heather Small]]'s "[[Proud (Heather Small song)|Proud]]" while holding a cardboard cut-out of the singer whenever she is pleased with herself.&lt;ref name="Miranda -"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idNNIUUg5NE|title=Miranda – Stevie sings "Proud" on YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215114105/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idNNIUUg5NE|archivedate=15 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Miranda and Stevie often get into petty arguments and competitions, such as when a customer leaves his wallet and both Miranda and Stevie attempt to impress him. Miranda frequently mocks Stevie for her small stature, and frequently pushes her over when she irritates Miranda. Despite often claiming to have "the allure" and mocking Miranda's attempts with men, Stevie also shares Miranda's lack of success, sometimes coming across as desperate when she chats someone up. She occasionally uses an unkempt and unpleasant traffic warden (played by [[Joe Wilkinson]]) as a date when trying to compete with Miranda. In the final episode, the traffic warden appears again and Stevie kisses him to avoid getting a [[parking ticket]].
* [[Patricia Hodge]] as Penny – Miranda's middle-class mother, a "lady who lunches", who likes to impress her friends and fellow [[Women's Institutes|W.I.]] members. Her main mission in life is to find Miranda a man and a better job. She despairs at Miranda's decision to run a joke/gift shop, and her tendency to reject suitable (or at least available) men, on numerous occasions trying to set up Miranda with her cousin. Although often embarrassed by her daughter, Penny displays many of Miranda's erratic traits and often teams up with Miranda for their benefit, such as when they are in the psychiatrist's office. Despite being prepared to humiliate Miranda for her own gain (to the point of holding up a placard offering to pay someone to marry Miranda), Penny's actions are borne out of genuine love and concern, and on the rare occasions where Miranda is doing well she shows her love by cheering "Go Miranda". Penny's catchphrase, "Such fun!" is normally used to describe an activity or event where she believes Miranda may find a husband. Another catchphrase of Penny's, especially in the first series, is 'What I call', which she says before numerous everyday things before Miranda points out that that is simply the word for it, and not just what Penny calls it (for example, 'I'm meeting a friend for a spot of, what I call, tea.') Penny tends to ignore Miranda's obvious disinterest or discomfort. &lt;!-- When two men proposes to Miranda at once in the final episode of series three, Penny desperately screams "just say YES!", not even caring at this point which man she says it to.&lt;ref name="Miranda - proposal scene @ YouTube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7EOmCd0kn0|title=Miranda – proposal scene}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;  In the final episode, Penny turns up at Miranda's flat two days after her break-up with Gary, insensitively suggesting they simply find another groom. Miranda finally loses her temper and tells Penny to get out; this causes Penny to go on a drinking binge at her local tennis club. She soon turns up at Miranda's flat and tearfully confesses that her relationship with Miranda's father has been dead for some time. Thanks to her daughter's new confidence, Penny regains her dignity and joyfully embraces Miranda when she marries Gary several days later.
* [[Sally Phillips]] as Tilly – An old school friend of Miranda's and the daughter of Penny's never-seen friend Belinda, who fits right in with their private school background, often showing more in common with Penny than Miranda does. Tilly is a socialite and normally quite self-centred, though on occasion, she does come through for her friends and shows that she is kind and generous. She will often address Miranda by her school nickname, "Queen Kong" (due to Miranda's stature and clumsiness), despite Miranda's displeasure, but her criticisms and attempts to help Miranda are generally well intentioned. Tilly's catchphrase is "bear with", usually said as she breaks off conversations to read text messages. While seeming more confident and together than Miranda, she has her own problems romantically, particularly when her fiancé, Rupert (played by [[Adam James (actor)|Adam James]]), makes a pass at Miranda behind her back. In the penultimate episode, she becomes engaged to her army doctor boyfriend, "Dreamboat" Charlie (played by [[Adrian Scarborough]]). The final episode sees Miranda give Tilly tickets to [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] so she can be free of her mother and elope with Charlie.
* [[James Holmes (actor)|James Holmes]] as Clive Evans (2009–2010, 2015) – The [[camp (style)|camp]], vicious-tongued owner of the restaurant where Gary works. He is usually more of a hindrance than help whenever he attempts to help Miranda and Gary get together, accidentally revealing, for example, that Gary has a secret wife from [[Hong Kong]] named Tamara (played by [[Stacy Liu]]). Despite his jibes at Miranda, he does show traits of wanting to help her, such as when he pushes her to tell Gary his true feelings. He is absent from the third series having sold the restaurant to Gary off-screen. Clive returns in the final episode and marries the regular customer from previous episodes (played by [[Dominic Coleman]]).
* [[Bo Poraj]] as Michael Jackford (2012–2014) – Miranda's new boyfriend who works as a television reporter and loves Miranda for the real her. Michael made his final appearance in the penultimate episode, when Miranda peacefully turned down his marriage proposal in order to accept Gary's. In the final episode, Penny mentions that the character has flown to Africa, where he had previously returned from on a business venture.
* [[Naomi Bentley]] as Rose (2013) – Gary's new girlfriend. When Rose can't accept his past affections for Miranda, Gary breaks up with her. She is last seen entering Gary's restaurant for its re-opening, but when Miranda confesses her true feelings for Gary during an argument, Rose immediately walks out.
* [[Katy Wix]] as Fanny (2009) – Another socialite friend of Miranda's from boarding school. She appears during the first series&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2360449/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t16|title=Katy Wix|work=IMDb|accessdate=8 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802075340/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2360449/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t16|archivedate=2 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside Tilly, but is not mentioned or seen as of the second series.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt;
* [[John Finnemore (writer)|John Finnemore]] and [[Margaret Cabourn-Smith]] as Chris and Alison (2009–2010, 2013–2014) – Sort-of friends of Gary and Miranda. As university students, Chris and Alison agreed to marry each other if they were still single at a certain age, but Chris whisked Alison away to Paris and proposed. During the second series, Alison becomes pregnant and they decide that Gary and Miranda should be godparents, but Miranda freaks out when they reveal she will also act as Alison's birthing partner. In the third series, Miranda, Gary and Rose babysit for them. They make their final appearance in the penultimate episode; their once joyous marriage now strained.
* [[Dominic Coleman]] (2009, 2013, 2015) as 'Customer' – A [[homosexual|gay]] man who comes into the store on three occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0171015/|title=Dominic Coleman|work=IMDb|accessdate=8 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071035/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0171015/|archivedate=14 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually with the intention of buying something for his niece, but is distracted by the probing questions of Stevie and Miranda and gets roped into their antics (For example, suggesting Miranda should lie about being gay and then being roped into attending her coming out party.) He features in the final episode as the partner of Clive,&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04wtcsd|title=BBC One – Miranda, Specials, The Final Curtain|work=BBC|accessdate=8 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426011643/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04wtcsd|archivedate=26 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose wedding Miranda gatecrashes. Although never mentioned on screen, he is referred to on the BBC's website as 'Jim'.

== Production ==

=== Conception ===

Abigail Wilson, who worked for comedians [[Dawn French]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]], suggested Hart pitch a show to the BBC after seeing her perform in 2003.&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; Following a read-through of her script with Saunders and BBC executives,&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; a television pilot, based on her semi-autobiographical writing, was filmed in early 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml|title=BBC Comedy Blog: Get ready for ''Miranda''|last=Hart|first=Miranda|authorlink=Miranda Hart|date=9 November 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228151534/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml|archivedate=28 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the series was then developed into a sitcom for radio;&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; ''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop'' aired on [[BBC Radio 2]] in August and September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00d3hzr|title=''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop''|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=9 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624120548/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00d3hzr|archivedate=24 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A television series was commissioned in August 2008 and began filming in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/22/comedy.shtml|title=New BBC Two comedy: ''In My Country'' starring Omid Djalili, ''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop'' and ''Rab C Nesbitt'' returns|work=BBC Press Office|publisher=BBC|date=22 August 2008|accessdate=10 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106023056/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/22/comedy.shtml|archivedate=6 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/18/miranda.shtml|title=Miranda starts filming with an all-star cast for her new sitcom on BBC Two|work=BBC Press Office|publisher=BBC|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=3 November 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622192932/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/18/miranda.shtml|archivedate=22 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor shots for series one were filmed in Hounslow, West London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Miranda |last=Hart |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml |title=Comedy Blog: Get ready for Miranda |publisher=BBC |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102221505/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml |archivedate=2 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the BBC's Writersroom, Hart said of the semi-autobiographical basis for the series:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well I developed this stand-up persona, and that's where it all started from. I realised I was getting laughs being a version of me, and that's what ended up in the sitcom. You do ultimately start from yourself but I'm pleased to say I did have to exaggerate for comedic effect. It wasn't entirely autobiographical. I'm not quite that mad.&lt;ref name="Writersroom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/insight/miranda_hart1.shtml|title=Miranda Hart|date=December 2009|work=BBC Writersroom|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213204628/http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/insight/miranda_hart1.shtml|archivedate=13 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Series 1 (2009) ===

Each episode begins with a welcome to audience and a 'Previously in my life ...' segment, and Hart says a joke shop is the "right place" as the setting after being asked to consider an office to "normalise" the character.&lt;ref name="Writersroom"/&gt; Her love of 1970s comedy programmes, such as ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]'', is the influence for ''Miranda''. The episodes end with a 'You have been watching ...' credits section where each cast member waves goodbye, as seen concluding [[Jimmy Perry]] and [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] sitcoms such as ''[[Dad's Army]]'' and ''[[Hi-de-Hi!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/entertainment-chester/chester-cinema-film-tv/2009/11/09/miranda-hart-harks-back-to-tv-golden-age-59067-25124626/|title=Miranda Hart harks back to TV golden age|work=Chester Chronicle|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Andy|last=Welch|date=9 November 2009|accessdate=4 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227075127/http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/entertainment-chester/chester-cinema-film-tv/2009/11/09/miranda-hart-harks-back-to-tv-golden-age-59067-25124626/|archivedate=27 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoted in ''[[The Times]]'', Hart says "I'm saying this is what I'm doing and I'm not scared to do it. Some of my comedy peers do slightly fear being a mainstream figure, as if it's slightly uncool. Well, I thought I'm going to embrace it."&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; Throughout each episode, Hart breaks the [[fourth wall]] and addresses the audience directly, a technique described as a "simple creative decision [that] makes this infectious comedy sing";&lt;ref name=4th&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/miranda_hart_sitcom/press/|title=Miranda – Reviews and Articles – British Comedy Guide|publisher=The British Comedy Guide|accessdate=31 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114065806/http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/miranda_hart_sitcom/press|archivedate=14 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; another critic stated "this is hard to pull off, but it works well".&lt;ref name = 4th/&gt;

=== Specials (2014–2015) ===
Due to the cliffhanger at the end of the third series, it was suspected that ''Miranda'' would return for a fourth series. However, in July 2014, Hart announced that there are no plans for a fourth series but 'a couple of specials' would be made.&lt;ref name=specials/&gt; Hart later announced that the two Christmas specials would be the end to the sitcom. Hart said the end was "going to be really emotional," but added that she didn't want her sitcom character "to keep falling over and making a fool of herself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/000001638/miranda_hart_confirms_sitcom_end/|title=Miranda Hart confirms an end to her hit sitcom|date=23 October 2014|accessdate=23 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024171214/http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/000001638/miranda_hart_confirms_sitcom_end/|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
At the end of the final episode, Miranda said to the audience/viewers: "I don't know when and if I'll see you again..." In June 2015, Miranda Hart revealed that she hadn't ruled out a possible return for ''Miranda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/582430/Miranda-Hart-return-Tom-Ellis-Gary-sitcom|title=Miranda Hart is not ruling out sitcom return with children – TV &amp; Radio – Showbiz &amp; TV – Daily Express|author=Neela Debnath|work=Express.co.uk|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Hadland has suggested that the sitcom is set to return. Speaking in an interview with The Telegraph, the actress – who plays Miranda's friend Stevie in the show – confirmed that the comedy will be back "in some format". However, she wouldn't be drawn on specifics, just saying: "I can say there will be something".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/10/16/sarah-hadland-miranda-is-coming-back/|title=Sarah Hadland: 'Miranda is coming back'|author=Jasper Rees|access-date=4 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104210326/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/10/16/sarah-hadland-miranda-is-coming-back/|archivedate=4 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 2017, Tom Ellis suggested the possibility of future episodes in an interview on [[BBC Radio 2]], saying that "we may be revisiting Miranda in the next couple of years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3703228/hit-comedy-miranda-is-set-to-make-shock-return-two-years-after-the-finale-saw-character-marry-gary/|title=Miranda is to make a shock return two years after the hit comedy's 'finale' saw character marry Gary|date=2017-06-01|work=The Sun|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603065425/https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3703228/hit-comedy-miranda-is-set-to-make-shock-return-two-years-after-the-finale-saw-character-marry-gary/|archivedate=3 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cast of ''Miranda'' (aside from Ellis and Holmes), reunited for the 2017 [[Royal Variety Performance]], for which Hart was the host. They appeared several times throughout the evening in character.

==American remake==
In August 2018, it was reported that ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' star [[Jim Parsons]] was developing a US remake for [[Warner Bros. Television]]. Hart would be involved in developing the remake as a producer, but it was not revealed if she would star as well. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.spoilertv.com/2018/08/miranda-jim-parsons-developing-us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The first series was picked as one of the top 10 forthcoming TV shows for Autumn 2009 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Sally" /&gt; Ahead of the first episode airing, Dominic Maxwell in an article for ''[[The Times]]'' described it as an "old-school" sitcom and said that "It's good fun, if you buy into it. And if you do, it's because of Hart."&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; Also describing it as "old-fashioned", Vicky Frost for ''[[The Guardian]]'' said of the [[slapstick]] physical comedy that "It's not clever – but it is funny.

Tonight was also the first we saw of Miranda's father, played by Tom Conti, who filled most of the episode's falling-over quota, so that Miranda finally remained pretty vertical throughout the episode."&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt; She added that Hart is "a great observer of everyday dilemmas" and the best thing of all is she left the door open for a third series.&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt; Dominic Cavendish of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called ''Miranda'' "the sitcom of the year",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8209865/Miranda-Im-the-friend-you-can-laugh-at.html|title=Miranda: 'I'm the friend you can laugh at'|last=Cavendish|first=Dominic|date=21 December 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=22 December 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228032950/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8209865/Miranda-Im-the-friend-you-can-laugh-at.html|archivedate=28 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chris Harvey of the same newspaper said "The truth is, pretty much every time Miranda turns and looks at the camera, I burst out laughing.

Even when I really, really don't want to."&lt;ref name="LoveHate"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8215227/Miranda-love-her-or-hate-her.html|title=Miranda: love her or hate her?|last=Gee|first=Catherine|author2=Harvey, Chris|date=21 December 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=22 December 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224062607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8215227/Miranda-love-her-or-hate-her.html|archivedate=24 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Catherine Gee said the show was a flop and listed six reasons why, which included unoriginal jokes, Hart's asides to the camera and the show retaining "the worst aspects of the sitcoms of yesteryear."&lt;ref name="LoveHate"/&gt;

The opening episode of the third series became one of the most watched shows in the UK over the Christmas period, attracting a total audience of over 11.5 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9769498/Why-Miranda-is-now-bigger-than-EastEnders.html|title=Why Miranda is now bigger than EastEnders|last=Deacon|first=Michael|date=28 December 2012|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=30 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229222212/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9769498/Why-Miranda-is-now-bigger-than-EastEnders.html|archivedate=29 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For The Telegraph, Michael Deacon compares the programme to a childish Christmas panto, finally adding, "Perhaps I’m just getting old.

[[George Entwistle]] stated, "Miranda's been a tremendous hit with audiences on BBC Two and I'm very glad she's let us persuade her to move to BBC One, where we believe we can build an even bigger following for her multi-award-winning show.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6320">'''Miriam Chaszczewacki''' or '''Miriam Chaszczewacka''' (1924–1942) was a 15-year-old Jewish girl and Holocaust victim who in 1939 began writing a personal diary about her life in the [[Radomsko]] [[ghetto]] which ended a few days before her assassination in 1942.

== Discovery and publication of the diary ==
Miriam's teacher Stefania Heilbrunn returned to [[Radomsko]], [[Poland]] after [[World War II]] had ended. While she was visiting the city cemetery, she met a Polish woman who gave her a sealed envelope saying "My son has asked me to give this to you. I don't know anything about it" and left. In the envelope Heilbrunn found a notebook with handwriting she recognized as belonging to her former student, Miriam Chaszczewacki. Heilbrunn brought the notebook to [[Israel]] and published its content.&lt;ref name=p344&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the diary was written in [[Polish language|Polish]]. Parts of the diary were published in Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish,  English and German. The original notebook was donated to [[Yad Vashem]].

== Life ==
Miriam's mother Sarah Lavit Zelber, born to a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidic]] family was a kindergarten teacher and a public figure. Miriam's father David&lt;ref&gt;תמונתו ופרק לזכרו בספר יזכור ליהדות רדומסקו page 460&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Ukraine]]. He opened a Jewish school in Radomsko where he taught Hebrew. This school was later active in the ghetto. Miriam's  brother Nahum was born in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Children of Dust and Heaven, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam was a 15-year-old [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] student and a member of a Zionist youth movement when the war began. She is described as a gentle, sensitive, intelligent and talented girl who studied Hebrew in her father's school.&lt;ref&gt;נערה בגיטו, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In another testimony, she is described as a shy, romantic and dreamy teenager.&lt;ref name=p86&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miriam's father and brother were murdered in the ghetto by the Germans. The father, David, was killed for refusing to board a deportation train.&lt;ref name=p142&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brother Nahum was buried in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery.&lt;ref name=p184&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapters of the diary ==
The diary begins with the introductory chapter that describes the events between the summer of 1939 and the occupation of Radomsko by the Germans in September 1939. The second part of the diary consists of 27 dated entries starting at 21 April 1941 describing the events of the war and ghetto life along with the typical account of a teenage girl's emotions.

== Death ==
The last entry in the diary in Miriam's handwriting was on 7 October 1942, when Miriam was 18. Between 9 and 12 October 1942 about 14,000 residents of the ghetto were sent to [[Treblinka]].

In the last page of the notebook appears an entry in a different, adult, handwriting, possibly by the Polish policeman who was the son of the woman who passed the notebook to Stefania Heilbrunn:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the evening of the 24 October 1942 she surrendered, together with her mother, to a Polish policeman on duty on Limanewskeigo Str. They asked to be taken to the Judenrat, as they have been hiding for a week in a lavatory and had enough of it all. During the last 3 days they ate raw groats. They were taken to the Police station and the next day left with a transport by lorry to [[Częstochowa]].&lt;ref name=p344/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In one of the diary's last entries, about a month before her death, Miriam wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It may seem silly, but only a step away from death I still worry about my diary. I would not want for it to meet a miserable end in an oven or on a rubbish heap. I wish somebody could find it – even if it be only a German – and would read it. I wish that these scribblings, though they record barely a fraction of the cruelties, would one day serve as a true and faithful document of our times.&lt;ref name=p133&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Memling Triptych of Family Moreel.jpg|thumb|560px|Hans Memling, ''Moreel Triptych'', 1484. [[oil painting|Oil]]-on-wood, 291cm x 121.1cm]]
[[File:Hans Memling - Triptych of the Family Moreel (closed) - WGA14933.jpg|thumb|300px|Exterior panels; [[John the Baptist]] (left) and [[Saint George]] (right)]]
The '''''Moreel Triptych''''' (or the '''''Saint Christopher Altarpiece''''') is the name given to a 1484 panel painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Hans Memling]] (d. 1494). It was [[Donor portrait|commissioned]] by the prominent Bruges politician, merchant and banker Willem Moreel (d. 1501) and his wife Barbara van Vlaenderberch, née van Hertsvelde (d. 1499). It was intended as their [[epitaph]] at the chapel&lt;ref name="b100"&gt;Blum, 100&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[St. James's Church, Bruges]], an extension they paid for, to the funerary church of Willem's family, where the couple intended to be interred in an underground tomb before the altar.

The inner center panel of the [[triptych]] altarpiece show [[Saint Christopher]] holding the [[Christ Child]], with [[Saint Maurus]] to his left and Saint Gills to his right. Willem Moreel kneels in prayer and venerating the saints in the left-hand panel with their five sons. Barbara kneels with eleven of their daughters on the right panel. The exterior panels are probably an early 16th-century addition, completed after the donor's and artist's deaths.

The triptych was installed on the altar of St. James's Church in 1484.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;Pearson, Andrea. ''Envisioning Gender in Burgundian Devotional Art, 1350–1530''. Ashgate, 2005. {{ISBN|978-07-5465-154-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in its original frames, which are each inscribed with the words ''anno Domini 1484'', or a variant containing the year, on their lower borders.&lt;ref name="r352" /&gt; The altarpiece has a strong association with the [[Benedictine]] order; three of the figures are Benedictine monks or saints.&lt;ref name="b101"&gt;Blum, 101&lt;/ref&gt; It is to dedicated to [[Saint Maurus]] and St Giles, the latter a Benedictine hermit. Today the work is located in the [[Groeningemuseum]] in Bruges.

==Commission==
[[File: Hans Memling - Portraits of Willem Moreel and His Wife - WGA14854.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Hans Memling, ''Portrait of the family Moreel'', 1482. Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]
The family of Willem Moreel are known to have lived in Bruges since the 13th century.&lt;ref name="b97"&gt;Blum, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Willem inherited land and a title lord of Oostcleyhem from his father. During his career he was twice appointed both [[alderman]] and [[burgomaster]] of the city, as well as its [[bailiff]] and later its [[treasurer]]. He was named as one of the fortieth riches men in the city in a 1490 tax list. The couple has eighteen children.  Memling earlier portrayed the couple in 1482, with a pair of panel portraits now in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]].

Saint James's Church was his family's burial ground and was founded in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="b100" /&gt; It underwent a major reconstruction in the late 15th century, which Willem Moreel partly financed along with members of the prominent [[Portinari Altarpiece|Portinari]], Gros and Moor families.&lt;ref name="b98" /&gt; The couple intended to be buried with the church building, in a chapel they had paid for and dedicated to saints Gills and Maurus, with space left before the altar as burial space for two people. To the same end, they commissioned the triptych from Memling, then a highly prominent, prestigious and sought-after painter, to be placed on the chapel altar, and only interred in the chapel in 1504, at the request of their son John.&lt;ref name="b98" /&gt; Barbara died in 1899, he followed in 1501.&lt;ref name="b98"&gt;Blum, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moreels did not at first get their wishes as to their burial places. Their standing and political security hamper by the struggles after the deaths of [[Charles the Bold]] in 1477 and [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1482 and the struggle with [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Austria]]. Willem was a prominent adversary of Maximilian, and was imprisoned in October 1481 for six months.&lt;ref name="r356"&gt;Ridderbos et al, 356&lt;/ref&gt; On their deaths, were each buried on exterior church grounds.&lt;ref name="b98" /&gt; They were not moved to their intended resting places in front of the chapel altar until 1504.

==Interior==
The inner panels share a continuous overcast skyline and broad landscape,&lt;ref name="r352"&gt;Ridderbos et all, 352&lt;/ref&gt; which contains two city-scapes, cottages and a meadow with a variety of trees animals and wild strawberries, daisies, daffodils and other recognisable flowers and plants.&lt;ref name="m141"&gt;Michiels, 141&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the sense of harmony, both wing panels are identically composed, excepting the number of children.&lt;ref name="j163"&gt;Jacobs, 163&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen of the couple's eighteen children are shown in total. However, some of the figures are later additions, painted over the first layers of oil and pigment.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

The figures were identified in the mid 19th century by James H. Weale through their facial characteristics and extant established portraits, through the commonality of Christian names from family names to some of the saints, city records, and the examination of headstones in the Saint James graveyard.&lt;ref name="r356" /&gt;

The inner panels are in relatively good condition for late 15th-century oil paintings, but have suffered some damage and paint loss, and have been depreciated by ill-advised restorations and touch-up work.&lt;ref name="m141"&gt;Michiels, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center panel===
[[File:Hans Memling - Triptych of the Family Moreel (central panel) - WGA14930.jpg|320px|thumb|Center panel with Saint Christopher, and Saint Maurus 
to his left and Saint Gills to the right&lt;ref name="j163" /&gt;]]
The central figure is [[Saint Christopher]], patron saint of travelers, who shares his feast day, July 25, with Saint James, after whom the containing church is named.&lt;ref name="b100" /&gt; He is shown standing in water as he crosses a river or inlet, carrying the [[Child Jesus]] on his shoulders. He is presented with his attributes, including a large staff, a symbol of Christ's miraculous presence,&lt;ref name="b101" /&gt; and is intended as a protector against sudden death.&lt;ref name="vp"&gt;"[http://vlaamseprimitieven.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/collection/moreel-triptych Moreel Triptych]". [[Flemish Art Collection]]. Retrieved 16 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher is dressed in a blue coat, covered with a long red cape folded over his right shoulder. He closely resembles depictions in both [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' and now lost ''[[Saint Christopher (after van Eyck)|Saint Christopher]]'', by whom Memling was deeply influenced by.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kmska.be/en/collectie/Restauratie/Hans_Memling/Over_het_kunstwerk.html The Paintings]". [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]. Retrieved 16 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On the left is Saint Maurus who holds a [[crosier]] and looks at an open book. Saint Gills stands to the right, standing with his attributes, an arrow and a [[deer|doe]].&lt;ref name="r352" /&gt; Both are dressed in long black robes and are holding books.

===Left panel===
[[File:Hans Memling 069.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Left panel, with Willem Moreel, sons, and Saint Wilhemus van Maleval]]
The left interior wing shows Willem Moreel kneeling, his hands clasped in prayer, before an open prayer book. His hair is short in a [[bowl cut]],&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt;  wears a fur-lined dress and black [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]], a very fashionable outfit in the 1480s. Behind him are his five male children, also shown kneeling. Of the sons, two are known to have died in infancy. Willem was the oldest, while John and George are thought to have commissioned the outer panels after their parents' death (see below).

The Moreels are presented by Saint Wilhemus van Maleval,&lt;ref name="vp" /&gt; who stands among them, dressed a fur-lined black coat over army clothing.&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt; He places his hand on Willem's shoulder, as he guides and presents him to Christopher in the center panel.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

===Right panel===
[[File:Hans Memling 071.jpg|thumb|180px|Right panel with Barbara Moreel, daughters, and Saint Barbara]]
The right interior wing presents Barbara Moreel with her eleven of her thirteen daughters,&lt;ref name="j163" /&gt; who all also kneel in prayer before an open book. Barbara wears a truncated [[hennin]], a [[damask]] silk dress with a white collar, and a wide red belt with a golden buckle. They are presented by [[Saint Barbara]], patron of the donor's wife,&lt;ref name="r355"&gt;Ridderbos et all, 355&lt;/ref&gt; who is shown standing before the tower where she was, by legend, imprisoned, which through innovative use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], she seems to hold in her hand.&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Hans Memling 049.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Hans Membling, ''[[Sibylla Sambetha]]'', 1480]]--&gt;
One of the daughters, Catherine, earlier posed for Memling's 1480 ''[[Sibylla Sambetha]]''.&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt; The eldest daughter, shown directly behind Barbra, and also in a black dress, is known to have become a Dominican nun. The girl in the light brown clothing, black v-neck and transparent [[veil]] has been identified as Maria from her name written in her headband, their second born daughter, given her linear position in the painting. Genealogical research notes that the couple has two daughters named Marie; but is assumed one died in infancy and the second was named after her. Efforts to name other of the daughters have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="r360"&gt;Ridderbos et al, 360&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the daughters were painted by Memling; examination by the art historian Dirk De Vos identifies at least six that are later additions, layered over the original landscape. Some of these additions can be explained by daughters born after the 1484 completion date, and were probably added by members of Memling's workshop. The left-hand panel containing sons underwent similar updated.&lt;ref name="r360" /&gt;

==Exterior==
The outer part of the wings contains [[grisaille]] representations of [[John the Baptist]] with his lamb and staff (left wing) and [[Saint George]] in full [[armour]], slaying the dragon (right wing) with a lance. The panels may have been completed after the deaths of Willem and Barbara, and dated as c 1504 by a number of art historians, probably commissioned by two of their sons,&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Blum considers this "highly likely". See Blum, 102&lt;/ref&gt; Jan (John) and Jaris (George), as the final, successful, effort to have their parents interred within the chapel space.&lt;ref name="b102"&gt;Blum, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nabataean art''' is the art of the [[Nabataeans]] of North Arabia. They are known for finely-potted painted ceramics, which became dispersed among [[Greco-Roman world]], as well as contributions to sculpture and [[Nabataean architecture]]. Nabataean art is most well known for the archaeological sites in [[Petra]], specifically monuments such as [[Al Khazneh]] and [[Ad Deir]]. [[File:Petra Jordan BW 21.JPG|thumb|right|alt=[[Al Khazneh]] or The Treasury at Petra|[[Al Khazneh]] or The Treasury at Petra]]

==Ceramics==
[[File:Nabataean Pottery.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Examples of Nabataean Ceramics|Examples of Nabataean ceramics]]
Nabataean pottery is characterized by its thin walls and floral motifs. The exclusive use of floral patterns links back to Nabataean [[aniconism]] in their religious practices. The designs on the wares are generally painted on or pressed into the surface with stamps and rouletting wheels. To put a finish on the pieces, the makers burnished them or used a [[sintering]] process. Most of the wares are pinkish in color, much like the cliffs surrounding the city. This is because Nabataean potters used local clay bodies in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil I. Khairy (Spring, 1983). ''Technical Aspects of Fine Nabataean Pottery''. Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research. No. 250 pp. 17-40&lt;/ref&gt; Nabataean wares take many forms, and can be classified by their thickness, rim shape, bases, and decor.&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;Philip C. Hammond (1962). ''A Classification of Nabataean Fine Ware''. American Journal of Archaeology , Vol. 66, No. 2. pp. 169-180&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the forms of the vessels mimic the shape of metal wares from the region.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Vickers (Apr., 1994). ''Nabataea, India, Gaul, and Carthage: Reflections on Hellenistic and Roman Gold Vessels and Red-Gloss Pottery''. American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 98, No. 2. pp. 231-248&lt;/ref&gt; These vessels would have been for daily use, not ceremonial, despite the unusually large amount of broken shards found in rubbish heaps.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;

==Architecture==

===Tombs===
Nabataean tombs are primarily "Rock-Cut tombs." They are created from cutting directly into the landscape, traditionally rock (see [[Rock-cut tombs in Israel]]). Rock-cut tombs are the most frequently found within excavated Nabataean archeological sites. There have been nearly 900 rock-cut tombs found in Petra and Hegra. Nabataean tombs are a fusion Hellenistic and Roman styles as well as a gradual creation of the [[Nabataean]] style. Some offer features of clear Greek influence, such as pediments, metope and triglyph entablatrures, and capitals. They were built to honor Gods and leaders as well as house generations of a specific family. Tombs are located normally inside the city. These tombs are simple in style but elaborated in function, often featuring steps, platforms, libation holes, cisterns, water channels and sometimes banqueting halls. Many feature numerous religious icons, inscriptions, and sanctuaries found in association with springs, catchment pools, and channels.&lt;ref name="Zeyad"&gt;Zeyad al-Salameen (2011). ''The Nabataeans and Aisa Minor''. Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry. Vol. 11, No. 2. 55-78.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Obelisk Tomb and Triclinium.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Obelisk Tomb|Obelisk Tomb]]
Crenelated Tombs (see [[crenelation]]) are popular within Nabataean architecture. There are several variations of crenelation, wavering in number of tiers. Crenelated tombs were created in order to represent fortifications, creating a symbol of cities, strength, military power. Later, under Achaemenid Persians, the fortification context was removed, giving a greater scope to a sign of kingship and authority

Several tombs feature [[obelisks]] on their exterior. Obelisks are a narrow tapering monument, often used to represent the [[Nephesh]], specific leaders, and Gods of monolithic societies. They are often found in Near Eastern and Egyptian architecture.

Tombs with detailed [[facades]] are also quite popular in the Nabataean community. There are a total of eight different façade types: Single Pylon, Double Pylon, Step, Proto-Hegr, Hegr, Arch, Simple Classical and Complex Classical. Single Pylon, Double Pylon, Step, Proto-Hegr, and Hegr are characterized by variations on the crowstep motif, combined with elements from classical architecture. Arch, Simple Classical, and Complex Classical have only classical motifs, which have been given Nabataean interpretation.&lt;ref name="Zeyad"/&gt;

At [[Petra]], there is a series of tombs called the "Royal Tombs." These tombs are split into four sections: the Urn Tomb, the Silk Tomb, the Corinthian Tomb, and the Palace Tomb. The Urn Tomb is built high on the mountain side, and requires climbing up a number of flights of stairs. It has been suggested that this is the tomb of Nabataean King Malchus II who died in 70 AD. Beside it is the Silk Tomb, named from its rich color of the sandstone. The Corinthian Tomb is next, featuring Greek Corinthian columns. Finally the Palace Tomb with three distinct stories in its facade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nabataea.net/royal.html |title=Petra: The Royal Tombs |publisher=Nabataea.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Camel and riders MET me31 67 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Nabataean]] sculpture, camel and riders. ca. 1st century B.C.]]
Early Nabataean sculpture had several characteristics of Roman, Greek, and Syrian sculpture. Wild hair, dramatic facial expressions, and S-curves mirrored the Hellenistic style of sculpture. Greek sculpture was represented with the long, tight beards, symmetry, and perfecting of the human body.&lt;ref name="Zeyadine"&gt;Zayadine, F. (2003). ''The Nabataean Gods and their Sanctuaries''. Petra Rediscovered: Lost City of the Nabataeans. G. Markoe. New York, Harry N. Abrams, Inc.: 57-64.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In later years, Nabataean sculpture later became very stylized. Certain elements, such as hair, were kept in the Greco-Roman style, but lots of other things evolved into what’s now understood to be Nabatataean. These characteristics are found in facial structures. The eyes of several pieces are depicted with characteristically flat, cartoonish, semicircular eyes. The same pieces often have triangular noses and large, round chins. Beyond human forms, Nabataean sculpture has come in the form of animals such as birds, elephants, and camels.&lt;ref name="Zeyadine"/&gt;

A number of different Gods and Goddesses are commonly represented throughout Nabataean sculpture. The majority are Gods and Goddesses that were worshiped by the Nabataeans, however some are representative of Greek, Roman, and Middle Eastern beliefs. In addition, the Zodiacs are periodically represented throughout their many art forms. [[Dushara]] was a principal male deity of the Nabataeans. He has been compared to Zeus in Greek culture as well as [[Dionysus]]. Examples of Dushara have been found in several places in Petra as well as [[Khirbet Et-Tannur]].&lt;ref name="Zeyadine"/&gt; Initially and traditionally, Dushara was represented in an aniconic form such as a square block, as is represented by the baetyls of Petra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nabataea.net/gods.html |title=Nabataean Religion: Pantheon |publisher=Nabataea.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a large amount of detailed sculpture found of Dushura. One specific piece shows a Hellenistic face, showing action and fleshy, vivacious characteristics.&lt;ref name="civca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/cmc/petra/petra5e.shtml |title=PETRA: Lost City of Stone |language=fr |publisher=Civilization.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commonly represented Gods would include: [[Al-Uzza]], [[Al-Kutbay]], [[Nike (mythology)]], and the [[Zodiacs]].&lt;ref name="civca"/&gt;

===Betyls===
[[File:Basel 2012-08 Mattes 1 (215).JPG|thumb|alt=Betyl|Betyl]]
Betyls ([[Baetylus]]) are another tool used for the representation of Gods and Goddesses beyond traditional sculpture. They appear in abundance in Nabataean art. They are often carved within shrines in both public and private places. Some have pedestals or are set within niches. Betyls were used to embody their gods, most often, although not exclusively, Dushara. They can be all sizes, in groups, or stand alone. They appear as relief sculpture and in the round. The carvings are rectangular and non-figural, though in some cases they have stylized eyes and a nose, similar to Aramic and South Arabian face stelae.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wenning (2001). ''The Betyls of Petra.'' Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research , No. 324, Nabataean Petra. pp. 79-95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==

Few instances of Nabataean painting have survived. Most are fragments of purely decorative interior painting. There has been enough to demonstrate, however, that they follow the contemporary [[Hellenistic art#Paintings and mosaics|Hellenistic style]], in which few paintings remain.&lt;ref name="Guardian art article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|title=Discovery of ancient cave paintings in Petra stuns art scholars|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/22/hellenistic-wall-paintings-petra|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=21 August 2010|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nabataean Painting Biclinium 849 Siq al-Barid Jordan1508.jpg|thumb|left|Ceiling frescoes in the Painted House at Little Petra|alt=A painted fresco with many dark spotted areas. In a clearer area closer to the bottom are vines, flowers, and a running squirrel]]
In 2010, it was revealed that a biclinium, now known colloquially as the Painted House, at [[Little Petra]] in [[Jordan]] had extensive ceiling [[fresco]]es, which had long been concealed under soot from [[Bedouin]] campfires, and other inscriptions in the ensuing centuries. A three-year [[art restoration|restoration]] project had made them visible again. They depict, in extensive detail and with a variety of media, including [[glaze (painting technique)|glazes]] and [[gold leaf]], imagery such as grapevines and ''[[putto|putti]]'' associated with the Greek god [[Dionysus]], suggesting the space may have been used for wine consumption, perhaps with visiting merchants. In addition to being the only known example of Nabataean interior [[figurative art|figurative]] painting ''[[in situ]]'', they are one of the very few examples of Hellenistic painting extant, and have been considered superior to later Roman imitations of the style at [[Herculaneum]].&lt;ref name="Guardian art article" /&gt;

The '''National Drama Festivals Association''' (NDFA) was formed in 1964 to encourage and support amateur theatre in all its forms and in particular through the organisation of drama festivals in the United Kingdom.

Since 1974 the NDFA has organised the British All Winners Drama Festival (BAWF) where the very best of British [[amateur theatre]] take part in a week-long celebration of [[theatre]]. The winners of all NDFA member festivals, be they Full Length or One Act Member Festivals, in the previous year are eligible for invitation to take part.

The NDFA also sponsor a Playwriting Competition - the George Taylor Memorial Award. The objective of this competition is to promote new writing for the theatre. Adjudication is carried out by a panel of [[judge]]s and the winners receive a certificate and a cash prize.

Membership of the NDFA is open to all Drama festival organisations and also to theatre groups and individuals who are interested in taking part and supporting drama festivals throughout UK.

The '''Nazca Lines''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|æ|z|k|ɑː}} are a group of very large [[Trench|trenches]] in the [[Nazca Plain|Nazca Desert]], in southern [[Peru]]. They were created between 500 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 500 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.go2peru.com/peru_guide/nazca/nazca_lines.htm|title=Nazca Lines|date=2017-02-22|work=Guía Go2peru|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[Geoglyph|geoglyphs]] are 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) deep, and between 0.4 and 1.1 km (.2  and .7 mi) wide. Their combined length is over 1,300 km (808 mi), and cover an area of about 50 sq km (19 sq mi).

They were made by scraping off&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/archaeology/nasca-lines/|title=The Nasca Lines Are One of Peru's Mysteries|date=2010-11-08|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the top layer of reddish-brown [[iron oxide]]-coated pebbles to reveal a yellow-grey subsoil.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Some of the Nazca lines form shapes that are best seen from the air (~1,500 ft), though they are visible from the surrounding foothills and other high places.&lt;ref name="GardnerCroix1991"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mYPuAAAAMAAJ Gardner's Art Through the Ages: Ancient, medieval, and non-European art]''.

University of Texas Press; 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-292-70496-1}}. p. 88–.&lt;/ref&gt; The shapes are usually made from one continuous line. The largest ones are about 370 m (1,200&amp;nbsp;ft) long.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/archaeology/nasca-lines/|title=Nasca Lines – The Sacred Landscape|last1=Golomb|first1=Jason|website=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures vary in complexity. Hundreds are simple lines and [[geometric shape]]s; more than 70 are [[zoomorphic]] designs of animals such as a hummingbird, spider, fish, llama, jaguar, monkey, lizard, dog and a human. Other shapes include trees and flowers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Scholars differ in interpreting the purpose of the designs, but in general, they ascribe religious significance to them.&lt;ref name="Selin2013"&gt;Helaine Selin.

Because of its isolation and the dry, windless, stable [[Climate of Peru|climate of the plateau]], the lines have mostly been preserved naturally. Extremely rare changes in weather may temporarily alter the general designs. As of 2012, the lines are said to have been deteriorating because of an influx of [[squatters]] inhabiting the lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taj |first=Mitra |date=August 15, 2012 |title=Pigs and squatters threaten Peru's Nazca lines |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/15/us-peru-nazca-squatters-idUSBRE87E0R520120815 |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The high, arid plateau stretches more than {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} between the towns of [[Nazca]] and [[Palpa, Peru|Palpa]] on the ''[[Pampas]] de Jumana'', approximately {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Lima]], roughly matching the main PE-1S [[Pan-American Highway#Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Paraguay|Panamericana Sur]]. The main concentration is in a 10 by 4 km (6 mi by 2 mi) rectangle, south of ''San Miguel de la Pascana'' hamlet. In this area, the most notable geoglyphs are visible.

Although some local geoglyphs resemble [[Paracas culture|Paracas motifs]], scholars believe the Nazca Lines were created by the [[Nazca culture]].

In 1994, they were designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==History==
The first published mention of the Nazca Lines was by [[Pedro Cieza de León]] in his book of 1553, and he mistook them for [[trail blazing|trail markers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w3dUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PT84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 141 Pedro Cieza de León, ''La Chronica del Peru'' (The chronicle of Peru)], (Antwerp, (Belgium): Martin Nucio, 1554), p. 141. Note: Cieza discussed the Nazca region of Peru and said that ''"y por algunas partes delos arenales se veen señales, paraque atinen el camino que han de lleuar"'' ("and in some parts of the desert are seen signals, so that they [i.e., the Indians] find the path that has to be taken").&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1586, Luis Monzón reported having seen ancient ruins in Peru, including the remains of "roads".&lt;ref&gt;Luis Monzón (1586) "Descripcion de la tierra del repartimiento de los rucanas antamarcas de la corona real, jurisdicion de la ciudad de Guamanga. año de 1586." in:   Marcos Jiménez de la Espada, ed., ''Relaciones geográficas de Indias: Peru'', volume 1 (Madrid, Spain:  Manuel G. Hernandez, 1881), pp. 197–216.  On [https://books.google.com/books?id=35oaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 210], Munzón notes seeing ancient ruins, including ''"y hay señales de calles"'' ("and there are signs of streets"). Munzón asked elderly Indians about the ruins. They told him that before the Incas, a people whom ''"llamaron ''viracochas''"'' ("they called ''viracochas''") inhabited the area, and ''"A éstos les hacian caminos, que hoy dia son vistos, tan anchos como una calle"'' ("To those [places] they made paths, that are seen today, as wide as a street").&lt;/ref&gt; Although the lines were partially visible from the nearby hills, the first to report them were Peruvian military and civilian pilots. 

In 1927 the Peruvian archaeologist  Toribio Mejía Xesspe spotted them while he was hiking through the foothills. He discussed them at a conference in Lima in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Mejía Xesspe, Toribio (1939) "Acueductos y caminos antiguos de la hoya del Río Grande de Nazca" (Aqueducts and ancient roads of the Rio Grand valley in Nazca), ''Actas y Trabajos Cientificos del 27 Congreso Internacional de Americanistas'' (Proceedings and scientific works of the 27th international congress of American anthropologists), '''1''': 559–569.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Kosok]], an American historian from [[Long Island University]], is credited as the first scholar to study the Nazca Lines at length. In Peru in 1940–41 to study ancient irrigation systems, he flew over the lines and realized one was in the shape of a bird. Another chance observation helped him see how lines converged at the [[winter solstice]] in the Southern Hemisphere. He began to study how the lines might have been created, as well as to try to determine their purpose. He was joined by archeologist Richard P. Schaedel from the United States, and [[Maria Reiche]], a German mathematician and archaeologist from Lima, to help determine the purpose of the Nazca Lines. They proposed one of the earliest reasons for the existence of the figures: to be markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] rose on significant dates. Archaeologists, historians, and mathematicians have all tried to determine the purpose of the lines.

Determining how they were made has been easier than determining why they were made. Scholars have theorized the Nazca people could have used simple tools and surveying equipment to construct the lines. Archaeological surveys have found wooden stakes in the ground at the end of some lines, which supports this theory. One such stake was [[carbon-dated]] and was the basis for establishing the age of the design complex.

Refuting the hypothesis of [[Erich von Däniken]] that the lines had to have been created by "[[ancient astronauts]]", prominent skeptic [[Joe Nickell]] has reproduced the figures using tools and technology available to the Nazca people. ''[[Scientific American]]'' called his work "remarkable in its exactness" when compared to the existing lines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1V-BIdlc9YEC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=joe+nickell+nazca+lines&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=nazca&amp;f=false Nickell, Joe (2005). ''Unsolved History: Investigating Mysteries of the Past''], The University Press of Kentucky {{ISBN|978-0-8131-9137-9}}, pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt; With careful planning and simple technologies, Nickell proved that a small team of people could recreate even the largest figures within days, without any aerial assistance.&lt;ref name="reece"/&gt;

Most of the lines are formed on the ground by a shallow trench with a depth between {{convert|10|and|15|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. Such trenches were made by removing the reddish-brown [[iron oxide]]-coated pebbles that cover the surface of the Nazca Desert. When this gravel is removed, the light-colored clay earth exposed in the bottom of the trench produces lines and contrasts sharply in color and tone with the surrounding land surface. This sublayer contains high amounts of [[Lime (material)|lime]] which, with the morning mist, hardens to form a protective layer that shields the lines from winds, thereby preventing [[erosion]].

The Nazca "drew" several hundred simple, but huge, curvilinear animal and human figures by this technique. In total, the [[earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] project is huge and complex: the area encompassing the lines is nearly {{convert|450|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, and the largest figures can span nearly 370 m (1,200&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt; Some figures have been measured: the hummingbird is {{cvt|93|m|ft}} long, the condor is {{cvt|134|m|ft}}, the monkey is {{cvt|93|by|58|m|ft}}, and the spider is {{cvt|47|m|ft}}. The extremely dry, windless, and constant climate of the Nazca region has preserved the lines well. This desert is one of the driest on Earth and maintains a temperature near {{cvt|25|C|F}} year round. The lack of wind has helped keep the lines uncovered and visible.

The discovery of two new small figures was announced in early 2011 by a Japanese team from [[Yamagata University]]. One of these resembles a human head and is dated to the early period of Nazca culture or earlier, and the other, undated, is an animal. In March 2012, the university announced a new research center would be opened at the site in September 2012 to study the area for the next 15 years. The team has been conducting field work there since 2006, when it had found approximately 100 new [[geoglyph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Team finds more Peru geoglyphs|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20110120a6.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715002321/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20110120a6.html|archivedate=2012-07-15|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=Japan Times|date=Jan 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University to open center at Nazca Lines|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120322b3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326155532/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120322b3.html|archivedate=2012-03-26|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=Japan Times|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier Paracas geoglyphs ==

The [[Paracas culture]] is considered the precursor that influenced the development of the Nazca Lines. In 2018, drones used by archaeologists revealed many geoglyphs in the Palpa province that are being assigned to the Paracas culture. Many predate the associated Nazca lines by a thousand years. Some demonstrate a significant difference in the subjects and locations, such as some being on hillsides.&lt;ref&gt;Greshko, Michael, [https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/new-nasca-nazca-lines-discovery-peru-archaeology/ Exclusive: "Massive Ancient Drawings Found in Peruvian Desert"], ''National Geographic'', 5 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Their co-discoverer, Peruvian archaeologist Luis Jaime Castillo Butters, indicates that many of these newly discovered geoglyphs represent warriors.

==Purpose==
[[file:Nazca Lines SPOT 1311.jpg|right|thumb|Nazca Lines seen from [[SPOT Satellite]]]]
[[Anthropologist]]s, [[ethnologist]]s, and [[archaeologist]]s have studied the ancient Nazca culture to try to determine the purpose of the lines and figures. One hypothesis is that the Nazca people created them to be seen by deities in the sky. 

[[Paul Kosok]] and [[Maria Reiche]] advanced a purpose related to [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], as has been common in other cultures: the lines were intended to act as a kind of [[observatory]], to point to the places on the distant horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies rose or set in the solstices. Many prehistoric [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures in the Americas and elsewhere constructed earthworks that combined such astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the late [[Mississippian culture]] at [[Cahokia]] and other sites in present-day United States. Another example is [[Stonehenge]] in England.

[[Gerald Hawkins]] and [[Anthony Aveni]], experts in [[archaeoastronomy]], concluded in 1990 that the evidence was insufficient to support such an astronomical explanation.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8160-2581-9"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cameron, Ian |title=Kingdom of the Sun God: A History of the Andes and Their People |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |date=1990 |page=46 |isbn=0-8160-2581-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Reiche asserted that some or all of the figures represented [[constellation]]s. By 1998, Phyllis B. Pitluga, a protégé of Reiche and senior astronomer at the [[Adler Planetarium]] in [[Chicago]], had concluded that the animal figures were "representations of heavenly shapes". According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "she contends they are not shapes of constellations, but of what might be called ''counter constellations'', the irregularly-shaped dark patches within the twinkling expanse of the [[Milky Way]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/15/world/maria-reiche-95-keeper-of-an-ancient-peruvian-puzzle-dies.html?pagewanted=all ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr, "Maria Reiche, 95, Keeper of an Ancient Peruvian Puzzle, Dies"], ''The New York Times,'' 15 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Aveni criticized her work for failing to account for all the details.

Alberto Rossell Castro (1977) proposed a multi-functional interpretation of the geoglyphs. He classified them into three groups: the first appeared to be tracks connected to irrigation and field division, the second are lines that are axes connected with mounds and cairns, and the third was linked to astronomical interpretations.&lt;ref&gt; Rossel Castro, Albert. (1977) ''Arqueología Sur del Perú'', Lima: Editorial Universo&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, archaeologist [[Johan Reinhard]] published archaeological, [[ethnographic]], and historical data demonstrating that worship of mountains and other water sources predominated in Nazca religion and economy from ancient to recent times. He theorized that the lines and figures were part of religious practices involving the worship of deities associated with the availability of water, which directly related to the success and productivity of crops. He interpreted the lines as sacred paths leading to places where these deities could be worshiped. The figures were symbols representing animals and objects meant to invoke the aid of the deities in supplying water. The precise meanings of many of the individual geoglyphs remain unknown.

[[Henri Stierlin]], a Swiss [[art historian]] specializing in Egypt and the Middle East, published a book in 1983 linking the Nazca Lines to the production of ancient textiles that archeologists have found wrapping [[mummies]] of the [[Paracas culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Stierlin (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; He contended that the people may have used the lines and trapezes as giant, primitive [[loom]]s to fabricate the extremely long strings and wide pieces of textiles typical of the area. According to his theory, the figurative patterns (smaller and less common) were meant only for ritualistic purposes. This theory is not widely accepted, although scholars have noted similarities in patterns between the textiles and the Nazca Lines. They interpret these similarities as arising from the common culture.

The first systematic field study of the geoglyphs was made by Markus Reindel and Johny Cuadrado Island. Since 1996, they have documented and excavated more than 650 sites.  They compared the iconography of the lines to  ceramics of the cultures. As archeologists, they believe that the figurative motifs of geoglyphs can be dated to having been made between 200 and 600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Reindel and Wagner, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the results of geophysical investigations and the observation of geological faults, Johnson argued that some geoglyphs followed the paths of aquifersm from which aqueducts (or ''[[puquios]]'') collected water.&lt;ref&gt; Johnson et al. 2002 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicola Masini]] and [[Giuseppe Orefici]] have conducted research in Pampa de Atarco (at about 10 km south of Pampa de Nasca), which they believe reveals a spatial, functional and religious relationship between these geoglyphs and the temples of [[Cahuachi]].&lt;ref&gt; Masini et al. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, they investigated using  remote sensing techniques and found "five groups of geoglyphs, each of them characterized by a specific motif and shape, and associated with a distinct function".&lt;ref&gt; Masini et al. 2016, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; They identified a ceremonial one, characterized by meandering motifs. Another is related to calendrical purpose, as proved by the presence of radial centers aligned along the directions of winter solstice and equinox sunset.  As have earlier scholars, the two Italians believe that the geoglyphs were the venues of events linked to the agriculture calendar. These also served to strengthen social cohesion among various groups of pilgrims, sharing common ancestors and religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Masini et al. 2016, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative explanations==
[[file:NEO nazca lines big.jpg|right|thumb|Satellite picture of an area containing lines: north is to the right (coordinates: {{coord|14|43|S|75|08|W|}})]]&lt;!-- note image is rotated approx. 90° cw, with north at right --&gt;
Other theories were that the geometric lines could indicate water flow or irrigation schemes, or be a part of rituals to "summon" water. The spiders, birds, and plants may be fertility symbols. It also has been theorized that the lines could act as an [[astronomical calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Cynthia Stokes|title=Big History|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|date=2007|page=167|isbn=978-1-59558-196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phyllis Pitluga, senior astronomer at the [[Adler Planetarium]] and a protégé of Reiche, performed computer-aided studies of star alignments. She asserted the giant spider figure is an [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic]] diagram of the [[Orion (constellation)|constellation Orion]]. She further suggested that three of the straight lines leading to the figure were used to track the changing [[declinations]] of the three stars of [[Orion's Belt]]. In a critique of her analysis, Dr. Anthony F. Aveni noted she did not account for the other 12 lines of the figure. 

He commented generally on her conclusions, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I really had trouble finding good evidence to back up what she contended. Pitluga never laid out the criteria for selecting the lines she chose to measure, nor did she pay much attention to the archaeological data Clarkson and Silverman had unearthed. Her case did little justice to other information about the coastal cultures, save applying, with subtle contortions, Urton's representations of constellations from the highlands. As historian [[Jacquetta Hawkes]] might ask: was she getting the pampa she desired?&lt;ref&gt;Aveni, Anthony F. ''Between the Lines: The Mystery of the Giant Ground Drawings of Ancient Nasca, Peru ''. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press. 1 July 2006 {{ISBN|0-292-70496-8}} p.205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=J5mEfUJgno0C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=pitluga+nazca+lines&amp;ei=zpVES4LGEJ-SygTgp53oBw&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jim Woodmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/scienceinthesand/the-theory-of-jim-woodman|title=The Theory of Jim Woodman - Science in the Sand|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; theorized that the Nazca lines could not have been made without some form of flight to observe the figures properly. Based on his study of available technology, he suggests a [[hot-air balloon]] was the only possible means of flight at the time of construction. To test this hypothesis, Woodmann made a hot-air balloon using materials and techniques he understood to have been available to the Nazca people. The balloon flew, after a fashion. Most scholars have rejected Woodmann's thesis as ''[[ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc]]'',&lt;ref name="reece"&gt;Katherine Reece, [http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=96 "Grounding the Nasca Balloon"], ''Into the Hall of Ma'at'' website&lt;/ref&gt; because of the lack of any evidence of such balloons.&lt;ref&gt;Haughton (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation and environmental concerns==
People trying to preserve the Nazca Lines are concerned about threats of [[pollution]] and [[erosion]] caused by [[deforestation]] in the region.

After flooding and mudslides in the area in mid-February 2007, Mario Olaechea Aquije, archaeological resident from Peru's [[National Institute of Culture]], and a team of specialists surveyed the area. He said, "[T]he mudslides and heavy rains did not appear to have caused any significant damage to the Nazca Lines". He noted that the nearby Southern [[Pan-American Highway]] did suffer damage, and "the damage done to the roads should serve as a reminder to just how fragile these figures are."&lt;ref&gt;Living in Peru.

He had damaged three of the geoglyphs by leaving substantial tire marks across an area of approximately 150 by 350 feet (46 m by 107 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/01/a-truck-driver-inexplicably-plowed-over-a-2000-year-old-historical-site-in-peru-damaging-the-designs/ |title= A truck driver inexplicably plowed over a 2,000-year-old site in Peru, damaging the designs |date= Feb 1, 2018 |publisher= Washington Post |first= Eli |last= Rosenberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Recoupment''' is the practice, common in the [[music industry]], of claiming an advance provided to an artist back ''from that artist'' rather than (or, as well as) from related sources.  Many [[record label]]s practice recoupment, and most new artists have little choice but to accept it since they lack the negotiating power to obtain a better contract.

==Examples==
Suppose that a music label gives a band a $250,000 advance to record an album.  The label agrees to do so in return for 90% of the sales.  In addition, the label will specify certain standards for production of the album, for example, which studios the band will engage.  The label may even hold the advance and make all disbursements on the band's behalf, ensuring the funds are used exactly as agreed.  In other words, the $250,000 advance is not simply pocketed by the band -- it is to be spent on album production and the band's reasonable expenses during production.  The album is recorded, and sells 200,000* copies at $10 each, yielding $2m.  The record company takes 90% of this as agreed, leaving the band with $200,000 of their own.  This is the situation without recoupment.

With recoupment, the label advances the band $250,000 as before.  As before, the band (or the label, on the band's behalf) spends substantially all of the advance to produce an album meeting the label's specifications.  The album again sells 200,000 copies at $10 each, yielding $2m.  The record company takes 100% of the first $250,000 in sales (recouping the $250,000 advance to the band), and 90% of all further sales, as agreed.  The band's net is effectively reduced to 0% of the first $250,000 in sales and 10% of the further $1.75m, leaving them with a total of $175,000.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Recoupment deals primarily involve new artists, or those without a proven sales history, so selling 200,000 copies would be fairly unusual.  More typically, 10,000 or fewer copies are sold by a new artist.  In this more typical case, the label recoups only $100,000 of the $250,000 advance, along with other non-recoupable expenses incurred in getting the album out into the world.

A '''religious image''', sometimes called a '''votive image''', is a work of [[visual art]] that is representational and has a religious purpose, subject or connection. All major historical religions have made some use of religious images, although their use is strictly controlled and often controversial in many religions, especially [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] ones. General terms associated with religious images include [[cult image]], a term for images, especially in [[sculpture]] which are or have been claimed to be the object of [[religious worship]] in their own right,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and [[icon]] strictly a term for [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious images,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} but often used more widely, in and outside the area of religion.

[[Image:Madonna catacomb.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fresco]] depicting the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Christ Child]] in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]] in [[Rome]]. This is earliest known image of Mary and the Infant Jesus independent of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] episode. The figure at the left appears to be [[Balaam]] pointing to a star (outside the frame). The star is from {{bibleverse||Numbers|24:17|HE}}.]]

Images flourished within the Christian world, but by the 6th century, [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|certain factions]] arose within the Eastern Church to challenge the use of icons, and in 726-30 they won Imperial support.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The [[Byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]] actively destroyed icons in most public places, replacing them with the only religious depiction allowed, [[Christian cross|the cross]]. The [[Iconodules]] (those who favored the veneration of images), on the other hand, argued that icons had always been used by Christians and should continue to be allowed. They further argued that not only should the use of icons be permitted, it was necessary to the Christian faith as a testimony of the [[dogma]] of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Christ]]. [[Saint John Damascene]] argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Of old God the incorporial and uncircumscribed was not depicted at all. But now that God has appeared in the flesh and lived among men, I make an image of the God who can be seen. I do not worship matter, but I worship the Creator of matter, who for my sake became material and deigned to dwell in matter, who through matter effected my salvation."&lt;ref&gt;St. John Damascene, ''On the Holy Icons'' ([[Patrologia Graecae]], xciv, 1245A)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, after much debate at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]], held in 787, the Iconodules, supported by the Empress, upheld the use of icons as an integral part of Christian [[Sacred tradition|tradition]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, and the Western Church, which had been almost totally unaffected by the dispute, confirmed this.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} According to the definition of the council, icons of Jesus are not intended to depict his divinity, but only the [[Logos|Incarnate Word]]. Saints are depicted because they reflect the grace of God, as depicted by their [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]].

===Eastern Christianity===
{{Main|Icon}}
[[Image:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg|thumb|Icon of [[Christ Pantokrator]] ([[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], [[Mount Sinai]]).]]
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] fully ascribes to the teachings of the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] and celebrates the restoration of the use of icons after the period of Iconoclasm on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]]. So important are the icons in Orthodox theology that the ceremony celebrating their restoration is known as the [[Triumph of Orthodoxy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the traditions of [[Eastern Christianity]], only flat images or ''[[bas relief]]'' images are used (no more than 3/4 [[relief]]). Because the Eastern Church teaches that icons should represent the spiritual reality rather than the physical reality, the traditional style of Orthodox iconography was developed in which figures were stylized in a manner that emphasized their holiness rather than their humanity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Traditional icons differ from Western art in that they are not romantic or emotional, but call the viewer to "sobriety" (''[[nipsis]]''). The manner of depicting the face, and especially the eyes, is intended to produce in the viewer a sense of calm, devotion, and a desire for [[asceticism]]. Icons also differ from Western art in that they use [[inverse perspective]] (giving the impression that the icon itself is the source of light), and for this reason make very little use of shadow or highlight. The background of icons is usually covered with [[gold leaf]] to remind the viewer that the subject pictured is not earthly but otherworldly (gold being the closest earthly medium in which to signify heavenly glory).

[[Image:Eglise de Bethanie, peintures murales.jpg|thumb|left|Drawings made from [[icon]] murals in Betania [[Monastery]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], exemplifying classical Orthodox iconography.]]

Jesus and the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] are depicted wearing the robes of [[philosopher]]s. The precise manner of depicting the face of Jesus and many of the saints is also fixed by tradition. Even the colours used in depicting the clothing of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and other saints is fixed by tradition, with symbolic meaning attached to each color.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Icons of Jesus depict him with a halo that displays three bars of a cross and the Greek letters which signify [[YHWH|I AM]] (the Divine Name which God revealed to [[Moses]] at the [[Burning Bush]]). The halos of saints, even the [[Theotokos]] (Mother of God) are usually simple circles, filled with gold leaf. Over the centuries, painter's manuals have developed to help preserve the traditions and techniques of Orthodox iconography, one of the best-known is the manual from the [[Stroganov School]] of iconography in Russia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Despite these strict guidelines, the Orthodox iconographic style is not stilted, and the individual artist is always permitted to bring his own style and spiritual insight into his work, so long as he remains faithful to [[Sacred Tradition]], and many icons display remarkable movement and depth.

The thoughtful use of symbolism allows the icon to present complex teaching in a simple way, making it possible to educate even the illiterate in theology. The interiors of Orthodox Churches are often completely covered in icons of Christ, Mary and the saints.  Most are portrait figures in various conventional poses, but many narrative scenes are also depicted.  It is not unusual in narrative icons for the same individual to be depicted more than one time.

[[Image:Frescos in St. Georges church in Qakh, Azerbaijan 1.jpg|thumb|[[Sacred Tradition]] determines not only the style of representation, but also the traditional placement of icons in an Orthodox church (Georgian Orthodox Church of St. George in [[Qax]], [[Azerbaijan]]]]

Orthodox Christians do not pray "to" icons; rather, they pray "before" them. An icon is a medium of communication, rather than a medium of art. Gazing at an icon is intended to help draw the worshipper into the heavenly kingdom. As with all of Orthodox theology, the purpose is ''[[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]]'' (mystical union with God).{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Icons are [[veneration|venerated]] by the faithful by [[poklon|bowing]] and kissing them. Traditionally, the faithful would not kiss the face of the one depicted on the icon, but rather the right hand or foot depicted on the icon. The composition of an icon is planned with this veneration in mind, and the iconographer will usually portray his subject so that the right hand is raised in blessing, or if it is the saint's full figure is depicted, the right foot is visible.

Icons are also honored with [[thurible|incense]] and by burning [[lampada]]s (oil lamps) in front of them. Icons are carried in [[procession]]s, and the [[bishop]] or [[priest]] may [[blessing|bless]] the people by holding an icon upright and making the [[sign of the cross]] with it over them.

===Western Christianity===
[[File:Interior, All Saints Church, Bolton - geograph.org.uk - 428400.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom, in its current form, in the parish church of [[Bolton, Cumbria|Bolton]] in [[Cumbria]], [[England]].]]
Until the 13th century, icons followed a broadly similar pattern in West and East, although very few such early examples survive from either tradition.  Western icons, which are not usually so termed, were largely patterned on Byzantine works, and equally conventional in composition and depiction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  From this point on the Western tradition came slowly to allow the artist far more flexibility, and a more realistic approach to the figures.

In the 15th century the use of icons in the West was enormously increased by the introduction of [[old master print|prints]] on [[paper]], mostly [[woodcut]]s which were produced in vast numbers.  With the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], after an initial uncertainty among early [[Lutherans]], [[Protestants]] came down firmly against icon-like portraits, especially larger ones, even of Christ.  Many Protestants found these [[Idolatry|idolatrous]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Catholics maintained and even intensified the traditional use of icons, both printed and on paper, using the different styles of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]].  Popular Catholic imagery to a certain extent has remained attached to a [[Baroque painting|Baroque style]] of about 1650, especially in [[Italy]] and [[Spain]].

In the [[Church of England]], the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms of the United Kingdom]] has been used like an icon, owing to its absence of human portraiture, as a representation of the sovereign as Head of the Church. It has been done in wood and stone as well as painted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasler|first=Charles|title=The Royal Arms – Its Graphic And Decorative Development| publisher=Jupiter|date=1980|pages=87,93,97}} Retrieved 29 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{expand section|date=November 2011}}
[[Image:Murudeshwar shiva.JPG|thumb|The [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]]. Note the ''[[damaru]]'' drum held in his back hand.]] {{Main|Hindu iconography}}
Images of [[Hindu gods]] and goddesses use a rich [[symbol]]ism. Some figures are blue-skinned (the color of [[heaven]]) or have multiple arms holding various symbols which depict aspects of the god.

==Islam==
{{See also|Islamic art}}
[[Muslims]] view sanctified icons as idols, and strictly forbid their worship, nor do they pray in front of one.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  However, the various [[divisions of Islam]] take different positions on the role of visual depictions of living (or once-living) creatures, including people.  At one end of the spectrum, sects such as the [[Wahhabi]]s totally ban drawings and photography.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Some branches of Islam forbid only the former but allow the latter.  The majority of [[Sunni]] Muslims permit both.  Some [[Shia]] allow even [[Depictions of Muhammad|the depiction of]] [[Muhammad]] and the [[twelve Imams]], a position totally unacceptable to most Sunnis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Judaism==
It is commonly thought that the [[Judaism|Jews]] absolutely prohibit "[[Idolatry|graven images]]"; this, however, is not entirely true. There are numerous instances within [[Torah|the scriptures]] that describe the creation and use of images for religious purposes (the angels on the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the bronze snake [[Moses]] mounted on a pole, etc.). What is important to note is that none of these are worshipped as [[God]]. Since God is incorporeal and has no form, He cannot be depicted.  During the Late Antique period of [[Jewish history]] it is clear that restrictions on representation were relaxed considerably; for example, the synagogue at [[Dura Europas]] had large figurative wall paintings{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.  It is also clear there was a tradition of painted [[scroll]]s, of which the [[Joshua Roll]] and the [[Utrecht Psalter]] are medieval Christian copies, none of the originals having survived{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.  There are also many medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s, especially of the [[Haggadah of Pesach]] ([[Passover]]).

A unique Jewish tradition of animal iconography was developed in Eastern Europe, which included symbolic depictions of God's attributes and powers as various animal scenes and plant ornaments in the [[wooden synagogues]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth]], as well as some mystical imagery on the gravestones. A part of the same imagery also appears on the [[Ashkenazic]] [[Shiviti|Shivisi]] - meditative images used for contemplation over God's name, not unlike the Eastern [[Mandala]]s.

Some synagogue wall paintings contained over 80 various animals, including lions, [[unicorn]]s, [[dragon]]s, lion-headed mermaids, [[three hares]], three intertwined fishes, [[Uroboros]], elephants, deer, leopards, bears, foxes, wolves, squirrels, turkeys, ostriches and many others.

God himself was usually represented as a two-headed golden eagle in the center of the Sun, painted on the ceiling of the synagogue, and surrounded by the Zodiac circle. This system was based on the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] symbolic tradition; unfortunately, the meaning of some forgotten symbols is hard to recover.

[[Thomas Hubka]] has traced the style of decorative painting in the wooden synagogues to the medieval Hebrew illuminated manuscripts of Ashkenazi Jewry, and its meaning to the Jewish mystical literature, such as the [[Zohar]] and the works of Rabbi [[Eleazar of Worms|Elazar Rokeach]].&lt;ref&gt;"Medieval Themes in the Wall-Paintings of 17th and 18th-Century Polish Wooden Synagogues," by Thomas C. Hubka, p. 213 ff. in ''Imagining the Self, Imagining the Other: Visual Representation and Jewish-Christian Dynamics in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period, edited By Eva Frojmovic, BRILL, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Historie und Leben der berühmtesten europäischen Mahler frontispiece 1710.jpg|thumb|
Roger de Piles, [[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to ''History and life of the famous European Painters'', Hamburg, Benj. Schiller, 1710]]
'''Roger de Piles''' (7 October 1635 – 5 April 1709) was a French painter, engraver, art critic and diplomat.

==Life==
Born in [[Clamecy, Nievre|Clamecy]], Roger de Piles studied philosophy and theology, and devoted himself to painting.

In 1662 he became tutor to [[Michel Amelot de Gournay]],  whom he was to follow throughout his life, acting as secretary to his various missions as French ambassador to Venice, Portugal, Spain.

In [[Venice]] (1682–1685) he started a famous collection of prints, drawings and paintings of [[Giorgione]], [[Correggio]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Antoine Coypel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Forest]].

He also acquired a taste for political intrigue using his travels ostensibly undertaken to study the European collections, as a buyer for [[Louis XIV]], as  cover for confidential missions - for example in Germany and Austria (1685) on behalf of Louis' minister, the [[marquis de Louvois]].

He was not always fortunate as a spy. In 1692, during the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], he was arrested in [[the Hague]] carrying a false passport and imprisoned for the next five years. He spent his time writing ''L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres ...avec un traité du peintre parfait''.&lt;ref&gt;"Epitome of the life of the painters... with a treaty on the perfect painter".&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1699 following his appointement as Conseiller Honoraire to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]].

In 1705 he followed Amelot de Gournay to Spain but illness forced him to return to Paris, where he died in 1709.

==Art critic==
His important contribution to [[Aesthetics|aesthetic theory]] rests on his ''Dialogue sur le coloris'' ("Dialogue on colours"), in which he initiated his famous defence of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] in the argument started in 1671 by [[Philippe de Champaigne]] on the relative merits of [[drawing]] and [[color]] in the work of [[Titian]] (in a lecture to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] on Titian's ''Virgin and Child with St John''.)

The argument is most fascinating as an early debate on classic vs modern in painting; in essence on the mathematics of [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]] and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in [[drawing]]&amp;mdash;the classic approach&amp;mdash; as opposed to the colored [[brush]] stroke&amp;mdash;the approach of the moderns. In his detailed study of the argument, ''Roger de Piles et les débats sur le coloris au siècle de Louis XIV'' (1965), B. Teyssèdre gives a touching account of the ''bohème'' of the "modern" ''réfusés'' in seventeenth century Paris, a history that was to repeat itself with the [[Impressionists]].

In the course of the argument Roger de Piles introduced the term  "''clair-obscur''" ([[Chiaroscuro]]) to highlight the effect of color in accentuating the tension between light and dark in a painting.

The way Roger de Piles documented his argument with Venetian and northern European examples was of influence to [[Antoine Coypel]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]], [[Nicolas de Largillière]] and [[François de Troy]].

==Balance of painters==
To his last published work: ''Cours de peinture par principes avec un balance de peintres'' (1708) de Piles appended a list of fifty-six major painters with whose work he had acquainted himself as a connoisseur during his travels.

To each painter in the list he gave marks from 0 to 18 for composition, drawing, color and expression. This gave an overview of aesthetic appreciation hinging on the balance between color and design. The highest marks went to [[Raffaello Sanzio]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], with a slight bias on color for Rubens, a slight bias on drawing for Raphaël. Painters who scored very badly in anything but color were [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]] and remarkably [[Michelangelo Caravaggio]] with 16 on color and 0 (zero) on expression. Painters who fell far behind Rubens and Raphaël but whose balance between color and design was perfect were [[Lucas van Leyden]], [[Sebastian Bourdon]], [[Albrecht Dürer]].

==List==

The complete list is transcribed here from Manlio Brusatin:''Histoire des couleurs'' (Paris: Flammarion, 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–104), reproduced in Elisabeth G. Holt ''Literary Sources of Art History'', (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1947), pp.&amp;nbsp;415–416

Samuel Alken entered the [[Royal Academy Schools]], London, as a sculptor in 1772. He published ''A New Book of Ornaments Designed and Etched by Samuel Alken'' in 1779, and later established himself as one of the most competent engravers in the new technique of aquatint.

His works included plates after [[George Morland]], [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]], [[Thomas Rowlandson]] and [[Francis Wheatley (painter)|Francis Wheatley]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Alken, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; His plates for ''Sixteen views of the lakes in Cumberland and Westmorland''  after drawings  [[John Emes]] and John Smith &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=List Of New Publications, And New Editions|journal=The Register of the Times, Or: Political Museum|date=1795|volume=6|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NME_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sixteen views of the lakes in Cumberland and Westmorland|url=http://collections.britishart.yale.edu/vufind/Record/2034876|publisher=Yale Center For British Art|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; were  published in 1796,&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; and a set of aquatint views of North Wales  after drawings by the Rev.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">The '''Scriblerus Club''' was an informal association of authors, based in London, that came together in the early 18th century. They were prominent figures in the [[Augustan literature|Augustan Age]] of English letters. The nucleus of the club included the satirists [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Alexander Pope]]. Other members were [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St. John]] and [[Thomas Parnell]]. The group was founded in 1714 and lasted until the death of the founders, finally ending in 1745. Pope and Swift are the two members whose reputations and work have the most long-lasting influence. Working collaboratively, the group created the persona of '''Martinus Scriblerus''', through whose writings they accomplished their satirical aims. Very little of this material, however, was published until the 1740s. [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer]] occasionally joined the club for meetings, though he is not known to have contributed to their literary output.  He, along with Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, contributed to the literary productions of the Club.

The club began as an effort to satirize the abuses of learning wherever they might be found, which led to ''[[The Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus]]''. The second edition of Pope's ''[[The Dunciad]]'' also contains work attributed to Martinus Scriblerus.

[[Richard Owen Cambridge]] wrote a [[mock epic]] poem, the ''Scribleriad'', where the hero is Martinus Scriblerus.

[[Henry Fielding]]'s play ''[[The Welsh Opera]]'' is presented as a tribute to the "Scriblerians".  Fielding's pen name was "Scriblerus Secundus."

The '''Symphony No. 5½, ''A Symphony for Fun''''', is an [[orchestra]]l [[symphony]] written in 1946 by the [[United States|American]] composer [[Don Gillis (composer)|Don Gillis]].

Gillis, a prolific composer, had already written five symphonies when he embarked on this work's composition.  He stated that he originally set out to write his sixth symphony, but found that the music emerged so light-hearted in character that rather than give the symphony a conventional number he elected to publish it as no. 5½.

The work is in four [[Movement (music)|movements]], the titles being punning references to the usual forms found in corresponding movements of "serious" symphonies.

#Perpetual emotion
#Spiritual?
#Scherzophrenia
#Conclusion!

The symphony was first performed in May 1947 by the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] conducted by [[Arthur Fiedler]].  Four months later, in September, the work received its first radio broadcast performance with [[Arturo Toscanini]] conducting the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26549">The phrase '''synesthesia in art''' has historically referred to a wide variety of artists experiments that have explored the co-operation of the senses (e.g. seeing and hearing; the word synesthesia is from the Ancient Greek σύν (syn), "together," and αἴσθησις (aisthēsis), "sensation") in the genres of [[visual music]], [[music visualization]], [[audiovisual art]], [[abstract film]], and [[intermedia]] (Campen 2007, Jewanski &amp; Sidler 2006, Moritz 2003, 1999, Berman 1999, Maur 1999, Gage 1994, 1999).  The age-old artistic views on synesthesia have some overlap with the current neuroscientific view on [[synesthesia|neurological synesthesia]], but also some major differences, e.g. in the contexts of investigations, types of synesthesia selected, and definitions. While in neuroscientific studies synesthesia is defined as the elicitation of perceptual experiences in the absence of the normal sensory stimulation, in the arts the concept of synaesthesia is more often defined as the simultaneous perception of two or more stimuli as one gestalt experience (Campen 2009). 
The usage of the term synesthesia in art should, therefore, be differentiated from [[synesthesia|neurological synesthesia]] in scientific research. Synesthesia is by no means unique to artists or musicians. Only in the last decades have scientific methods become available to assess synesthesia in persons. For synesthesia in artists before that time one has to interpret (auto)biographical information. For instance, there has been debate on the neurological synesthesia of historical artists like [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Scriabin]] (cf. Jewanski &amp; Sidler 2006, Ione 2004, Dann 1999, Galeyev 2001). 
Additionally, Synesthetic art may refer to either art created by synesthetes or art created to elicit synesthetic experience in the general audience.

==Distinctions==
When discussing synesthesia in art, a distinction needs to be made between two possible meanings:
# Art by synesthetes, in which they draw on their personal synesthetic perceptions to create works of art.
# Art that is meant to evoke synesthetic associations in a general (mainly non-synesthetic) audience.

These distinctions are not mutually exclusive, as, for example, art by a synesthete might also evoke synesthesia-like experiences in the viewer. However, it should not be assumed that all "synesthetic" art accurately reflects the synesthetic experience. For more on artists who either were synesthetes themselves, or who attempted to create synesthesia-like mappings in their art, see the [[list of people with synesthesia]].

== Art by synesthetes==
[[Image:SteenVision.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Vision'' by Carol Steen; Oil on Paper; 15 × 12¾ inches; 1996]]

Several contemporary visual artists have discussed their artistic process, and how synesthesia helps them in this, at length.&lt;ref name="Steen"&gt;Steen, C. (2001). Visions Shared: A Firsthand Look into Synesthesia and Art, Leonardo, Vol. 34, No. 3, Pages 203-208 {{doi|10.1162/002409401750286949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carol Steen]] experiences multiple forms of synesthesia, including grapheme → color synesthesia, music → color synesthesia, and touch → color synesthesia. She most often uses her music → color synesthesia and touch → color synesthesia in creating her works of art, which often involves attempting to capture, select, and transmit her synesthetic experiences into her paintings. Steen describes how her synesthetic experience during an acupuncture session led to the creation of the painting ''Vision''.

{{quotation|One day, many years ago, I was having an acupuncture treatment and was lying flat on my back, on a futon, stuck full of needles. My eyes were shut and I watched intently, as I always do, hoping to see something magical, which does not always occur. Sometimes what I see is just not interesting or beautiful. Lying there, I watched the soft, undulating, black background I always see when I shut my eyes become pierced by a bright red colour that began to form in the middle of the rich velvet blackness. The red began as a small dot of intense colour and grew quite large rather quickly, chasing much of the blackness away. I saw green shapes appear in the midst of the red colour and move around the red and black fields. This is the first vision that I painted exactly as I saw it... |Artist Carol Steen, recalling the experience that led to the creation of ''Vision''.&lt;ref name="Steen"/&gt;}}

[[Image:SmilackWeekends.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Weekends Are Taller than Weekdays'' by Marcia Smilack; [[Inkjet]] ([[Giclee]]) print on watercolor paper, 40 × 60 inches; 2003]]

Rather than trying to create depictions of what she experiences, "Reflectionist" Marcia Smilack uses her synesthetic experience in guiding her towards creating images that are aesthetically pleasing and appealing to her. Smilack takes pictures of reflected objects, mostly using the surface of the water, and says of her photography style:

{{quotation|I taught myself to take pictures by shooting whenever I experience a synesthetic reaction to what I see: if I experience a sensation of texture, motion or taste, I take the picture. If the reflection elicits the sound of cello, I shoot the picture. I photograph reflections on moving water. It works like this: I watch the surface of the sea until I experience one of my synesthetic responses. When I do, I trust it to be a reliable signal that tells me it is the right time to take the picture, so I click the shutter. Within the creative process, I think of my synesthetic responses as vital messengers that arrive faster than thought to deliver one urgent message which I always heed: beauty is lurking. |Reflectionist Marcia Smilack on her photography technique&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marciasmilack.com/synethesia-intro.php Marcia Smilack Website] Accessed 20 Aug 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anne Salz, a Dutch musician and visual artist, perceives music in colored patterns. She describes her painting inspired by Vivaldi’s ''Concerto for Four Violins'':

[[Image:Salz vivaldi2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Vivaldi'' by Anne Salz; Oil on Board, 50 × 50 cm; 2003]]

{{quotation|The painting represents the opening of the concerto for four violins. I listen to the music while I paint. First, the music gives me an optimistic, happy feeling and I perceive red, yellow, and orange colors in a great variety with little contrast. It looks like a field of these colors. I perceive the color field as a musical chord. You can compare it with the colors of a blanket or cover made of autumn leaves.}}

She explains that the painting is not a copy of what she hears; rather, when she listens to music, she perceives more colorful textures than she normally perceives and she is able to depict them in the painting. She also expresses the movement of the music, as its energy influences the pictorial composition. She explains how she perceives the painting:
{{quotation|The lively movements in the music become a stream of glowing shades of orange. The black structure provides cadence and reveals its significance and character. It is an indispensable foundation for the moving colors. The painting evokes my feelings again when I listen to the music again. I hear the melodies in my mind when I look at it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anne-salz.nl Anne Salz Website] Accessed 31 Aug 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anne Patterson, a New York-based artist with a background in theatrical set design, describes the genesis of her installation of 20 miles of silk ribbons suspended from the vaulted ceiling arches of [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco|San Francisco's Grace Cathedral]], which was inspired by a cello performance of [[Bach]]:

{{quotation|When listening to music, I see colors and shapes, either angular or circular, and get a sense of whether the piece is horizontal or vertical. [[Joshua Roman|Joshua's]] piece was all blue and green.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastcodesign.com/3024639/an-artist-suspends-20-miles-of-ribbon-inside-grace-cathedral&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Brandy Gale, a Santa Cruz, California-based Canadian painter and photographer "experiences an involuntary joining or crossing of any of her senses – hearing, vision, taste, touch, smell and movement. Gale paints from life rather than from photographs and by exploring the sensory panorama of each locale attempts to capture, select, and transmit these personal experiences."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brandygale.com/contact--brandy-gale-2/ Brandy Gale website&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Growing up with this gift, I thought everyone had it. But it turns out that it is not so common, and it took the school psychologist to figure out why the letter "A" was always yellow to me, or the fresh cut grass on the way to school triggered a melody in my head, or why certain shapes had personalities and smells. Artist, Brandy Gale&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brandygale.com/contact--brandy-gale-2/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to her field work, Gale also paints live, sometimes performing her painting experience live before an audience with musical accompaniment, as she did at the 2013 [http://www.the-eg.com/ EG Conference] in Monterey, CA. with cellist Philip Sheppard,&lt;ref&gt;http://library.fora.tv/2013/04/19/The_Wondrous_Sensory_Spectrum_of_Brandy_Gale EG7 Conference, Monterey, CA&lt;/ref&gt; at the Oakland Garden of Memory in June 2014 with her husband, guitarist and composer [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gardenofmemory.com/ Garden of Memory Oakland, CA&lt;/ref&gt; and with Kaiser and guitarist [http://avamendozamusic.com/ Ava Mendoza] at The Stone in NYC.&lt;ref&gt;http://thestonenyc.com/calendar.php?month=0 The Stone NYC&lt;/ref&gt; Gale's 2014 solo exhibition ''Coastal Synaesthesia:Paintings and Photographs of Hawaii, Fiji and California'' was held at Gualala Arts Gallery, Gualala, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gualalaarts.org/Exhibits/Gallery/2015-01-Coastal-Synaesthesia.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202215117/http://www.gualalaarts.org/Exhibits/Gallery/2015-01-Coastal-Synaesthesia.html |archivedate=2015-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|There is power, joy, and physical challenge in painting outdoors ''alla prima'', especially for a full spectrum synesthete like Brandy [Gale], whose visions from her 5 fully-crossed senses are transmitted to others through the polychromatic intensity of her ''plein air'' work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-eg.com/presenters/brandy-gale E.G. Conference presenter biography&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Art meant to evoke synesthetic associations==
[[File:Fantasia theatrical trailer.png|thumb|right|Title screen in the original theatrical trailer]]
Perhaps the most famous work which might be thought to evoke synesthesia-like experiences in a non-synesthete audience is the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film [[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]], although it is unknown if this was intentional or not.  Another classical example is the use of the [[color organ]] which would project colored lights along with the musical notes, to create a synesthetic experience in the audience (Campen 2007, Jewanski &amp; Sidler 2006).

[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6.jpg|thumb|250px|''Composition VI'' (1913) by [[Vassily Kandinsky]]|alt=Rectangular, multicolored abstract painting]]
[[Wassily Kandinsky]] working in the 1920s, may not have been a synesthete, despite his fame for his synesthetic artwork. Many of his paintings and stage pieces were based upon a set and established system of correspondences between colors and the timbres of specific musical instruments. Kandinsky himself, however, stated that his correspondences between colors and musical timbres have no "scientific" basis, but were founded upon a combination of his own personal feelings, current prevailing cultural biases, and mysticism ({{Harvnb|Kandinsky|1994}}; {{Harvnb|Dann|1998}}; {{Harvnb|Riccò|1999|pp=138–142}} Jewanski &amp; Sidler 2006, Campen 2007).

==History==
[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldo - Four Seasons in One Head - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| Four Seasons in One Head by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]]]]
The interest in synesthesia is at least as old as Greek philosophy. One of the questions that the classic philosophers asked was if color (chroia, what we now call timbre) of music was a physical quality that could be quantified (Campen 2007, Gage 1994, Ferwerda &amp; Struycken 2001, Jewanski 1999). The first known experiment to test correspondences between sound and color was conducted by the Milanese artist [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] at the end of the sixteenth century. He consulted with a musician at the court of Rudolph II in Prague to create a new experiment that sought to show the colors that accompany music. He decided to place different colored strips of painted paper on the gravicembalo, a keyboard instrument (Gage, 1994). He was also an artist who created strange portraits from unusual objects, such as ''Four Seasons in One Head''. The problem of finding a mathematical system to explain the connection between music and color has both inspired and frustrated artists and scientists throughout the ages. The seventeenth-century physicist [[Isaac Newton]] tried to solve the problem by assuming that musical tones and color tones have frequencies in common. He attempted to link sound oscillations to respective light waves. According to Newton, the distribution of white light in a spectrum of colors is analogous to the musical distribution of tones in an octave. So, he identified seven discrete light entities, that he then matched to the seven discrete notes of an octave (Campen 2007, Peacock 1988).

===Color organs===
{{Main|Color organ}} 
Inspired by Newton’s theory of music-color correspondences, the French Jesuit Louis-Bertrand Castel designed a color harpsichord (clavecin oculaire) with colored strips of paper which rose above the cover of the harpsichord whenever a particular key was hit (Campen 2007, Franssen 1991). Renowned masters like [[Telemann]] and [[Rameau]] were actively engaged in the development of a clavecins oculaire. The invention of the gas light in the nineteenth century created new technical possibilities for the color organ. In England between 1869 and 1873, the inventor Frederick Kastner developed an organ that he named a Pyrophone. The British inventor Alexander Rimington, a professor in fine arts in London, documented the phrase ‘Colour-Organ’ for the first time in a patent application in 1893. Inspired by Newton’s idea that music and color are both grounded in vibrations, he divided the color spectrum into intervals analogous to musical octaves and attributed colors to notes. The same notes in a higher octave produced the same color tone but then in a lighter value (Peacock 1988). Around the turn of the century, concerts with light and musical instruments were given quite regularly. As most technical problems had been conquered, the psychological questions concerning the effects of these performances came to the fore. The Russian composer [[Alexander Scriabin]] was particularly interested in the psychological effects on the audience when they experienced sound and color simultaneously. His theory was that when the correct color was perceived with the correct sound, ‘a powerful psychological resonator for the listener’ would be created. His most famous synesthetic work, which is still performed today, is Prometheus, Poem of Fire. On the score of Prometheus, he wrote next to the instruments separate parts for the tastiere per luce, the color organ (Campen 2007, Galeyev 2001, Gleich 1963).

===Musical paintings===
In the second half the nineteenth century, a tradition of musical paintings began to appear that influenced symbolist painters (Campen 2007, Van Uitert 1978). In the first decades of the twentieth century, a German artist group called The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]) executed synesthetic experiments that involved a composite group of painters, composers, dancers and theater producers. The group focused on the unification of the arts by means of "Total Works of Art" ([[Gesamtkunstwerk]]) (Von Maur 2001, Hahl-Koch 1985, Ione 2004). [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]'s theory of synesthesia, as formulated in the booklet "Concerning the Spiritual in Art" (1910), helped to shape the ground for these experiments. He described synesthesia as a phenomenon of transposition of experience from one sense modality to another, as in unisonous musical tones (Kandinsky 1910, Düchting 1996). Kandinsky was not the only artist at this time with an interest in synesthetic perception. A study of the art at the turn of the century reveals in the work of almost every progressive or avant-garde artist an interest in the correspondences of music and visual art. Modern artists experimented with multi-sensory perception like the simultaneous perception of movement in music and film (Von Maur 2001, Heyrman 2003).

===Visual music===
{{Main|Visual music}} 
Starting in the late 1950s, electronic music and electronic visual art have co-existed in the same digital medium (Campen 2007, Collopy 2000, Jewanski &amp; Sidler 2006, Moritz 2003). Since that time, the interaction of these fields of art has increased tremendously. Nowadays, students of art and music have digital software at their disposal that uses both musical and visual imagery. Given the capability of the Internet to publish and share digital productions, this has led to an enormous avalanche of synesthesia-inspired art on the Internet (Campen 2007) (cf. website RhythmicLight.com on the history of visual music). For instance, [[Stephen Malinowski]] and Lisa Turetsky from Berkeley, California wrote a software program, entitled the [http://www.musanim.com/mam/mamsoft.htm Music Animation Machine], that translates and shows music pieces in colored measures.

===Synesthetic artists===
With today’s knowledge and testing apparatus, it can be determined with more certainty if contemporary artists are synesthetic. By interviewing these artists, one gets some insights into the process of painting music (cf. Steen, Smilack, Salz). The lines of artistic explorations of synesthesia and scientific research into the subject have become closely intertwined in the last decade. Some contemporary artists are active members of synesthesia associations in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and other countries (cf. Arte Citta) [http://www.artecitta.es]. In and outside these associations that house scientists and artists, the exchange of ideas and collaborations between artists and scientists has grown rapidly in the last decades (cf. the Leonardo online bibliography Synesthesia in Art and Science) [http://lbs.mit.edu/isast/spec.projects/synesthesiabib.html], and this is only a small selection of synesthetic work in the arts. New artistic projects on synesthesia are appearing every year. These painters, sculptors, designers and musicians have shown to be well-informed on the latest scientific insights in synesthesia. They combine this scientific knowledge and personal intuition in a range of artistic expressions. For instance they capture their synesthetic perceptions in painting, photographs, textile work, and sculptures. Beside these ‘classical’ materials of making art, an even larger production of synesthesia-inspired works is noticed in the field of digital art (Campen 2007).

'''''The Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester Jansz''''' is a painting created by the Dutch painter [[Adriaan de Lelie]] in 1794-95. It is part of the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum|Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]], 63.7&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 85.7&amp;nbsp;cm high, executed in oil paint on panel. It depicts the art collector [[Jan Gildemeester|Jan Gildemeester Jansz]] (or Jan Jansz. Gildemeester) in the midst of his large [[Collection (artwork)|collection]] of paintings, showing them to friends.

The painting was acquired by the Rijksmuseum in 1964&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Bruyn Kops|first=C. J.|date=1965-01-01|title=De Amsterdamse verzamelaar Jan Gildemeester Jansz|jstor=40381555|journal=Bulletin van het Rijksmuseum|volume=13|issue=3|pages=79–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being part of a French private collection.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/5389|title=Explore Adriaan de Lelie|website=rkd.nl|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art historical context and inspiration ==

[[File:David Teniers the Younger - Archduke Leopold William in his Gallery at Brussels - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|Example of a Flemish 17th-Century 'konstkamer'. [[David Teniers the Younger]]: ''Archduke Leopold William in his Gallery at Brussels'', ca. 1650, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Wien.]]

=== Konstkamers ===
According to the art historian C.J. De Bruyn Knops, the subject of the work - an [[Private collection|art collector]] at home, showing his art collection to his friends - is unique in [[Netherlands|Northern-Netherlandish]] painting before 1800. In Flemish ([[Southern Netherlands|Southern-Netherlandish]]) painting, this genre was common in the 17th Century; it was executed by masters like [[Willem van Haecht]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Gillis van Tilborch|Gillis van Tilborgh]] and [[Gonzales Coques|Gonzales Cocques]], but in the Northern Netherlands the subject didn't become popular. Probably Adriaan de Lelie had seen such works while studying in [[Antwerp]]. However, the Flemish 'konstkamers' ('art rooms') looked very different: they used to depict imaginary architecture, and probably not reality as seen by the painter. The Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester Jansz, on the contrary, is a very accurate depiction of a real space.

[[File:Zoffany Royal Collection.jpg|thumb|[[Johan Zoffany]]: ''The Academicians of the Royal Academy'', 1772, Royal Collection of the United Kingdom. Jan Jansz. Gildemeester owned an engraving after this painting, which might have inspired the spontaneous figures in the work by Adriaan de Lelie.]]

=== Household scenes ===
Adriaan de Lelie follows the tradition of intimate [[household]] scenes that were painted very commonly in the Northern Netherlands since the 17th Century. Usually, the people in such genre works are clearly striking a pose, while the visitors in The Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester Jansz look very natural, as if they are unaware of the presence of the painter. Probably, De Lelie was inspired by English contemporaries here: Jan Jansz. Gildemeester possessed a 1773 engraving of a spontaneous group painting by [[Johan Zoffany]], which must have been familiar to De Lelie.

== Depicted space, people and artworks ==
[[File:Overzicht zandstenen voorgevel gezien vanaf overzijde - Amsterdam - 20408958 - RCE.jpg|left|thumb|Herengracht 475 in 2005.]]
The two rooms depicted in this painting still exist: the large room in front and the smaller one with windows in the back are part of the house that was owned by Jan Jansz. Gildemeester since 1792, currently a [[Rijksmonument]] located on Herengracht 475 in Amsterdam. The ceiling painting in the first room (by [[Jacob de Wit]], 1731) the relief above the door and other decorations have been restored during a 20th-Century renovation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Jan Jansz. Gildemeester stands in the middle of the work. Adriaan de Lelie has probably portrayed himself kneeling on the right. Other people depicted in the work are possibly the Amsterdam-based art trader Pierre Fouquet Jr., Dutch physicist baron [[Cornelis Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff|Cornelius Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff]] (wearing a [[tricorne]] hat), painter [[Jurriaan Andriessen (artist)|Jurriaan Andriessen]], tradesman Anthony Dull and his wife Marianne Dull-Dohrmann (sitting behind the easel on the left), and art collector and writer Bernardus de Bosch Jeronimosz.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; - according to C.J. De Bruyn Knops, the RKD and the Rijksmuseum's website, but this opinion is questioned by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Eeghen|first=I.H.|date=February 1972|title=De restauratie van Herengracht 475|url=http://archief.amstelodamum.nl/resources/1972_mb_59.pdf|journal=Amstelodamum|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-04-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917052253/http://archief.amstelodamum.nl/resources/1972_mb_59.pdf|archivedate=2016-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As usual in that era, the paintings are arranged in rows, close to each other on the walls. It is highly likely that the visible artworks were chosen by the collector and painter together, specifically for this painting, and that they were considered the highlights from Gildemeesters collection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many works in the first room can be identified with certainty. The art collection of Jan Jansz. Gildemeester was [[auction]]ed after his death in 1800, and the [[auction catalog]]ue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/catalvan00schl|title=Catalogus van het kabinet van schilderyen, nagelaaten door den kunstminnaar Jan Gildemeester Jansz|last=Schley|first=Philippe van der|last2=Jean de Bosch|last3=Jean Yver|last4=R. Meurs Pruyssenaar|date=1800-01-01|publisher=Amsterdam : Philippe van der Schley}}&lt;/ref&gt; documents the works in quite a bit of detail. Gildemeester's taste as an art collector corresponds with that of his contemporaries: he mainly owned [[Genre painting|genre pieces]], [[Marine art|marine paintings]], [[Landscape painting|landscapes]], [[Animal painter|animal]] and [[Still life|still-life]] paintings. His earliest purchases probably were [[drawing]]s and [[Printmaking|prints]], of which he also built a considerable collection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A second and smaller version (85 x 135.9&amp;nbsp;cm) from ca. 1864 is in [[Dahesh Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minimusdesign.com/dma/portfolio/alexandre-cabanelthe-birth-of-venus/ Alexandre Cabanel, Adolphe Jourdan, The Birth of Venus] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130129111922/http://www.minimusdesign.com/dma/portfolio/alexandre-cabanelthe-birth-of-venus/ |date=2013-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third (106 x 182.6&amp;nbsp;cm)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000264 The Metropolitan Museum of Art - The Birth of Venus]&lt;/ref&gt; version dates from 1875; it is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].

Shown to great success at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1863, ''The Birth of Venus'' was immediately purchased by [[Napoleon III]] for his own personal collection.&lt;ref name="Rosenblum38"&gt;Rosenblum 1989, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
That same year Cabanel was made a professor of the [[École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]].

Cabanel's erotic imagery, cloaked in historicism, appealed to the propriety of the higher levels of society.&lt;ref name="Rosenblum38" /&gt; Art historian and curator [[Robert Rosenblum]] wrote of Cabanel's ''The Birth of Venus'' that "This Venus hovers somewhere between an ancient deity and a modern dream"; he described "the ambiguity of her eyes, that seem to be closed but that a close look reveals that she is awake ...  A nude who could be asleep or awake is specially formidable for a male viewer".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Kern, ''Eyes of Love: The Gaze in English and French Paintings and Novels 1840-1900'' p.101, 1996, Reaktion Books, Art &amp; Art Instruction, {{ISBN|0-948462-83-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabanel was a determined opponent of the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], especially [[Édouard Manet]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} although the refusal of the academic establishment to realize the importance of new ideas and sources of inspiration would eventually prove to be the undoing of the Academy.

At the Salon of 1863, ''The Birth of Venus'' was one of a multitude of female nudes. Bathed in opalescent colors, the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] shyly looks to the viewer from beneath the crook of her elbow. Two years later, Manet presented his now renowned painting ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' at the Salon as well. Today both hang in the Musee’d’ Orsay. Unlike Venus’s ethereal-like palette, Manet painted Olympia with pale, placid skin tone, and darkly outlined the figure. Her only seemingly modest gesture is her placement of her hand over her leg, though it is not out of shyness- one must pay before they can see. James Rubin writes of the two works: “The ''Olympia'' is often compared to Cabanel’s ''Birth of Venus'', for the latter is a far more sexually appealing work, despite its mythological guise… It is evident Manet’s demythologizing of the female nude was foremost a timely reminder of modern realities. The majority of critics attacked the painting with unmitigated disgust…: “What is this odalisque with the yellow belly, ignoble model dredged up from who knows where?” [And] “The painter’s attitude is of inconceivable vulgarity.”&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, ''Impressionism'', 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Cabanel depicts personality, but in subtle ways through her relaxed posture and sleepy expression. Jenna-Marie Newberry writes of Venus: “The lightest of color used in ''The Birth of Venus'' alludes to the lightness and enlightenment of relaxation, amplifying the reclining nude’s placid demeanor and virginity. The contraposto twist of the figure with the melodramatic swoop of the arm over the face comes directly from his previous paintings … Venus herself takes over the entire front of the picture plane. Her hair has been deepened, adding more to her allure and purity.” It is as if the viewer is catching a glimpse of a goddess simply basking in the nature that enfolds her. She is calm, and asks nothing with her gaze. She is a part of her surroundings and the viewer is privy to behold upon the scene. By adhering to the accepted canon of the day, Cabanel produced a quite seductive painting of a mythological beauty presented in a calculated way that was acceptable for viewers at the time of its creation. Following the Salon it was said: “His dark-eyed heroines, thinly painted, usually in muted colors and immaculately drawn, were popular on both sides of the Atlantic”.&lt;ref&gt;Whitely&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Over time, Alexandre developed what would become his signature style. It was his attention to detail that made him popular in the nineteenth century. Cabanel was schooled at the Ecole des Beaux Arts under the painter [[François-Edouard Picot]]. Following his tutelage, he entered his first Salon in 1843 and won second place in the Prix de Rome in 1845. “Several major decorative commissions followed including the ceiling in the Cabinet des Dessins in the Louvre, and are typical of Cabanel’s talent for achieving sumptuous effects.” Initially famous for his mythological paintings, Cabanel also made a name for himself in Europe and abroad through his portraits.  “Praised as a portraitist of women, Cabanel expressed that he was particularly adept at painting portraits of American women.”&lt;ref&gt;Zalewski, “Alexander,” 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A portrait by Cabanel was a desirable commodity. He was a favored portraitist of the Emperor Napoleon himself, and he also refused to travel outside France to accept a commission. This required American elite to travel to Paris to sit for him. “Cabanel had the ability to lend his sitters an air of gentility and urbanity, and to give them an aristocratic allure … "{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}  C.H Stranahan summarized the appeal of Cabanel’s style shortly before his death saying: “…He is especially the master of every grace attractive to woman; great judiciousness in rendering what his subtle reading of the human face gives him; great power and knowledge of hands, which leads to his throwing a veil of mystery over the expression, even leaving a softening vagueness…" 
 
Upon his death in 1889, “Journals and dailies paid indulgent tribute to Cabanel in obituaries.” In one, he was called “the most distinguished painter of the grand style,” and “all commented on Cabanel’s liberal teaching".&lt;ref&gt;Zalewski, 157-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Feast of Venus''''' is a painting by Flemish painter  [[Rubens]], now in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna. It is a fanciful depiction of the Roman festival [[Veneralia]] celebrated in honor of [[Venus Verticordia]].

==Influences==
[[File:Worship of Venus (Peter Paul Rubens) - Nationalmuseum - 17602.tif|thumb|left|Rubens. The Worship of Venus (after Titian). c. 1630s. Nationalmuseum, Stockholm.]]
===Titian and Philostratus===
Rubens thought highly of [[Titian]] and made a copy of the Venetian master's ''[[The Worship of Venus]]'' which remained in Rubens' private collection until his death.{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=159}} Titian's work, in turn, was based on the ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'' of the [[sophist]] [[Philostratus of Lemnos]]. The ''Imagines'' consisted of a series of descriptions of ancient paintings presumably decorating a third-century villa near Naples.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=94}} In the description entitled ''[[Cupid|Cupids]]'' (''[[Erotes]]''), Philostratus portrays a "swarm" of cupids in a fragrant garden gathering [[Apple#Greek mythology|apples]], kissing the apples and throwing them back and forth, engaging in archery using themselves as targets since the arrows are arrows of love, wrestling, and chasing a [[Rabbits and hares in art#Antiquity|hare]] (a symbol of fertility). While the cupids are cavorting, nymphs are attending to a statue of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] that is garnished with a silver mirror, gilded sandals, and golden brooches.{{sfn|Philostratus the Elder|Philostratus the Younger|Callistratus|1931|pp=21-29}} Both Titian and Rubens in his copy depict most of this activity in great detail.

===Ovid===
The fourth book (April){{sfn|Ovid|}} of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' also served as inspiration for Rubens' ''The Feast of Venus''.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=160}} A portion of the poem describes a women's festival held on April 1 to honor both Venus Verticordia and [[Fortuna Virilis]]. Per Ovid, the festival includes the washing and decoration of a statue of Venus, ritual bathing under boughs of [[Myrtus#In myth and ritual|myrtle]], and offerings of incense to Fortuna Virilis so that the goddess may hide physical blemishes from the eyes of men.{{sfn|Ovid|}} The work, not always corroborated by other sources, portrays a somewhat conflicted account of the festival that blurs distinctions between class and the rite's purpose.{{sfn|Pasco-Pranger|2006|p=147}} Primarily, the cult was intended to turn a woman's heart from lust (''[[Lust|libidine]]'') to chastity (''[[pudicitia]]''){{sfn|Pasco-Pranger|2006|p=145}} so that she may retain her "beauty, virtue and good repute."{{sfn|Ovid|}} However, in addition to brides and mothers, Ovid includes "you who must not wear the [[Fillet (clothing)|headbands]] and [[Stola|long robes]]".{{sfn|Ovid|}} This is a euphemistic reference to prostitutes (''[[Meretrix|meretrices]]'') who were not allowed to wear the hairstyle and clothes of a respectable matron. Instead, they wore a short tunic and [[toga]]. Prostitutes were not being asked to embrace chastity, so their participation must have served other purposes.{{sfn|Pasco-Pranger|2006|p=149}}

==Composition==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Venus Feast (detail) - WGA20317.jpg|thumb|Detail of dancing nymphs and satyrs. The nymph on the far left was modeled by Rubens' wife Helena.]]
Rubens combined key elements of ''Imagines'' and ''Fasti'' along with details of his own invention to create a spirited allegory of conjugal bliss where "voluptuous sensuality is joined and enhanced by the propriety of marriage."{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=162}}

A statue of Venus Verticordia in a ''[[Capitoline Venus|pudica]]'' pose is the focal point of the work. She is surrounded by attendants who, in turn, are encircled by dancing and cavorting cupids, [[satyr|satyrs]], [[nymph|nymphs]], and [[maenad|maenads]]. Rubens includes all three of Ovid's classes of women in his work. The well-clothed matrons are shown performing rites. One washes the statue while the other, in an attitude of prayer, offers incense from a flaming tripod to Fortuna Virilis. The sea of dancing cupids has momentarily parted to allow two eager brides bearing dolls as offerings to rush to the goddess. The prostitutes are also present. Naked except for fluttering draperies, they stand at the foot of Venus. One clutches a comb while holding up a mirror so that the goddess can view herself.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Fehl|1972|pp=160-161}} The temple of Venus is shown in the background behind a grotto in which a stream of water cascades into an overflowing basin. Rubens does not depict any of the celebrants ritually bathing as described by Ovid, but the basin in the grotto alludes to that practice.{{sfn|Fehl|1972|pp=160-161}}

Rubens, like Titian, filled his canvas with a swarm of frisky cupids. Rubens applied his own distinct details to the [[Putto|amoretti]], however. Some of them are depicted as females without wings. Art historian [[Philipp Fehl]] has postulated the amorous couple in the right foreground accompanied by two pairs of doves represents [[Cupid and Psyche]], highlighting how marriage enriches love.{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=162}} Another winged cupid lowers a wreath of roses over the head of Venus in accordance with Ovid: "Now she’s given fresh flowers, and new-sprung roses."{{sfn|Ovid|}}{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=161}} The remainder of the cupids who are not dancing are collecting the apples of Venus as described by Philostratus as well as sheaves of wheat and clusters of grapes. The wheat and grapes are attributes of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Bacchus]] respectively and the gods they represent are shown as seated statues over the grotto. This detail adds to the lustful nature of Rubens' portrayal since a well-known adage immortalized in a play by [[Terence]] states: ''[[sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus]]'' (without food and wine, love grows cold).{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=161}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=95}}

The frolicking nymphs and satyrs in front of the grotto are a [[Bacchanalia|bacchanalian]] representation of pure erotic desire. Rubens used his young wife [[Helena Fourment]] as the model for the nymph on the far left. She is being held aloft by a leering satyr as she lewdly clutches his horns and stares out of the canvas with a knowing look.{{sfn|Chapman|2017|pp=461-462}}

[[File:The Jack Pine, by Tom Thomson.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tom Thomson]], ''The Jack Pine'' (1916–17). Oil on canvas; 127.9 × 139.8 cm. [[National Gallery of Canada]], Ottawa]]

'''''The Jack Pine''''' is a well-known [[oil painting]] by [[Canadian art]]ist [[Tom Thomson]]. A representation of the most broadly distributed [[pine]] species in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsu.edu/project/dendrology/index/plantae/vascular/seedplants/gymnosperms/conifers/pine/pinus/contortae/jack/jackpine.html ncsu]&lt;/ref&gt; it is considered an iconic image of the country's landscape,&lt;ref name="S1"&gt;Silcox, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGC"&gt;[http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artwork_e.jsp?mkey=11056 National Gallery of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the country's most widely recognized and reproduced artworks.

The painting was completed in 1917, the year of Thomson's death. It is a roughly square canvas that measures 127.9&amp;nbsp;× 139.8 cm. It has been in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] since 1918. 

==Background==
[[File:Tom Thomson - Pine Island, Georgian Bay.jpg|thumb|Foreground trees and a distant body of water form a common motif in Thomson's work. In this regard ''Pine Island, Georgian Bay'' (1914–16) is a precursor to ''The Jack Pine'' and ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Tom Thomson (2002), 40&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Beginning in 1913, Thomson annually stayed in [[Algonquin Park]] from the spring until the autumn, often working as a guide while also fishing and painting for his own pleasure. In 1916, he also worked in the Park as a fire ranger.&lt;ref&gt;Klages, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; It was there, on Grand Lake with the hills near Carcajou Bay in the background, that Thomson made the oil [[study (art)|sketch]] in 1916 that he would use for the final painting in 1917.&lt;ref name="M1"&gt;Murray, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous other paintings by Thomson with compositions similar to that of ''The Jack Pine'': in fact, the majority of Thomson's canvasses depict the far side of a shore.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  These include ''Northern Lake'' (1912–13), his first; ''Pine Island, Georgian Bay'' (1914–16; pictured); and more famously, ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'' (1917), another painting of iconic status.&lt;ref name="S1"&gt;Silcox, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Tom Thomson Sketch for 'The Jack Pine' 1916.jpg|thumb|Thomson's spring 1916 sketch for ''The Jack Pine''. Oil on panel; 21.1 x 26.8 cm. [[RiverBrink Art Museum]], Queenston, Canada (purchased 1947).&lt;ref&gt;''Tom Thomson'' (2002), plate 97&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The painting depicts a [[jack pine]] as a decorative and abstracted pattern, its shapes boldly simplified against the sunset.&lt;ref name="NGC"&gt;[http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artwork_e.jsp?mkey=11056 National Gallery of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M1"/&gt; This stylization demonstrates Thomson's command of decorative effects, developed during his years as a graphic designer,&lt;ref&gt;Marlow, Kirk. "[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t118/e2580 Thomson, Tom]." The Oxford Companion to Western Art. Ed. Hugh Brigstocke. Oxford Art Online. June 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and with the strong colour and value contrasts, creates the picture's symbolic resonance.&lt;ref name="NGC"&gt;[http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artwork_e.jsp?mkey=11056 National Gallery of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; The pine, its branches bowed and placed to the right of centre, extends nearly the full length of the canvas, and is cropped at the top. It rises from a rocky foreground; the hardy jack pine often takes root on shores hostile to other trees, its sparsely leaved branches forming eccentric shapes.&lt;ref name="M1"/&gt; It is silhouetted against water and sky, with the canvas bisected by the far shore.

The final canvas differs markedly from Thomson's spring 1916 sketch.&lt;ref&gt;''Tom Thomson'' (2002), pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; He made the tree appear larger by lowering the hills on the far side of the lake. The weather had been stormy when Thomson made the sketch and the dark, rolling clouds were echoed in the heavy, swirling brushwork of the sky and the slate grey lake. In the final painting, Thomson has swapped the storm clouds for a clear twilight sky. The sky and lake are now highly stylized, painted in long horizontal brushstrokes that show, along with its nearly square format, the influence of Thomson's colleague [[Lawren Harris]].&lt;ref name="M1"/&gt;

Thomson began with a [[vermilion]] red undertone, which he likely chose to avoid mixing the [[complementary colour]]s red and green. The red was allowed to show through in parts of the tree, foreground landscape, and hills,&lt;ref name="M1"/&gt; making the colour "[seem] to vibrate".&lt;ref&gt;p. 79 in Murray, Joan (1998). ''Tom Thomson: Design For a Canadian Hero''. Dundurn Press. {{ISBN|1550023152}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yet the focal point of the painting is not in the foreground, but at the distant shore—the patch of snow just below the centre of the canvas. Dennis Reid, who wrote a booklet on the painting for the National Gallery, points out an almost circular shape made by the foreground elements that encompass the focal point. The circle is formed from the large curving branches of the tree, the sloping left foreground, and the smaller tree at right. Reid writes&lt;!--haha--&gt; that this near-circle "exists in space more like a ball, and as we peer through that ball to the opposite shore, for an instant we're inside our eye."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson's background in design lent his composition an [[Art Nouveau|Art-Nouveau]] sensibility. One reviewer notes the effect in it and ''The West Wind'': "[these] two best-known canvases&amp;nbsp;... are essentially ''Art Nouveau'' designs in the flat, the principal motif in each case being a tree drawn in great sinuous curves&amp;nbsp;... Such pictures, are, however, saved from complete stylization by the use of uncompromisingly native subject-matter and of Canadian colours, the glowing colours of autumn."&lt;ref&gt;Quotation of R. H. Hubbard (1962), in Reid, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[A. Y. Jackson]], Thomson was dissatisfied with the canvas, particularly the background and sky.&lt;ref name="M1"/&gt;

== Interpretation ==

Tom Thomson had little to say about ''The Jack Pine'' or his painting in general. ''The Jack Pine'', a stylized landscape with few elements&amp;nbsp;– painted by a man who died the year he painted it, a man who would become an icon in his country&amp;nbsp;— has encouraged various readings of Thomson's artistic motivations. Dennis Reid observes the limitations of received views of such popular artworks: "''The Jack Pine'', is, after all, like all successful works of art a living thing that grows or declines, unfolds or closes up, according to the nature and the quality of the attention it receives. In that sense, there are as many meanings as there are viewers."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blodwen Davies]] was the first biographer of Thomson, and a [[Theosophist]]. Emphasizing the "spirit" of the painting, she wrote in 1935, "the spirit of the canvas leaps out to meet the spectator in a way no reproduction can fully convey. There is no fumbling, no hesitancy here&amp;nbsp;... [Thomson's] brush was sure. Heavily laden with paint it swept over the canvas in broad, exultant strokes in which the very spirit of Tom Thomson still speaks aloud."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reid, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Another Theosophist, Fred Housser, described the painting in 1926 as "a devotional meditative study. A single tree stands spreading the tracery of its limbs and branches like the pulsating veins of Mother Nature&amp;nbsp;... [One] could believe that this tree was to the nature-worshipper Thomson what the symbol of the cross was to a mediaeval mystic."&lt;ref name="r26"&gt;Quoted in Reid, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson was an important influence on the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], with members such as [[Lawren Harris]] advocating his work. In a review of the Art Gallery of Toronto's Inaugural Exhibition of 1926, Harris dismissed much of the American art shown there, writing that most of it "represented the average of the academies... no one of these canvasses&lt;ref&gt;Harris reserved praise only for [[Arthur B. Davies]] and [[Rockwell Kent]] with respect to American art at the exhibition. (Larisey)&lt;/ref&gt; approaches Thomson's ''The West Wind'' or ''Jack Pine'' in devotion and greatness of spirit." Those two paintings, he wrote, "contain the lasting qualities of the best old masters. The devotional mood of ''The Jack Pine'' is the same as in [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''Madonna and Child''".&lt;ref&gt;Larisey, Peter. ''Light for a Cold Land: Lawren Harris's Work and Life – An Interpretation''. Toronto: Dundern Press, 1993. {{ISBN|1-55002-188-5}}. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Arthur Lismer]], also part of the Group of Seven, commented on Thomson's painting. Writing in 1930, he stated that ''The Jack Pine'' was a work of "significant form&amp;nbsp;... The artist thinks of big things first&amp;nbsp;– and the design in this picture is the biggest thing in it. It is like a symphony of music. All the instruments are playing a part, and none is out of harmony with the whole&amp;nbsp;... the theme of a painting is a movement in space. The upright lines of the tree trunk give it serenity; the horizontal lines of the shore supplement this and give it strength; the rounded masses of the hills repeat the circular rhythm of the foliage masses, giving movement and powerful rhythm to the whole composition."&lt;ref name="r26"/&gt;

Peter Mellen, author of ''The Group of Seven'' (1970), wrote of the work's "perfect serenity. It is evening&amp;nbsp;– the sky and lake are perfectly calm and are painted in broad, flat horizontal strokes. Even the soft mauves, pinks, and greens contribute to this effect. Countering the strong horizontals are the drooping red tendrils of the bare pine branches, the vertical lines of the trees, and the curves of the hills&amp;nbsp;... [Thomson] achieves pure poetry in painting, by combining an intuitive feeling for nature with an almost classical control of technique."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reid, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Jean Boggs proposed that Thomson was influenced by the European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]]: "against the dying light and sky the scraggly forms of ''The Jack Pine'' are most dramatic, its branches struggling to life but dominated by dark-green, tattered, bat-like forms as if the tree were a symbol&amp;nbsp;– beautiful, oriental, but a symbol nevertheless of Thomson's wish for his own death on this spot."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reid, 28&lt;/ref&gt; Others considered the painting evidence that Thomson was, or might have become, an increasingly [[abstract art|abstract]] or [[expressionism|Expressionist]] artist.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 29; Grace&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provenance and exhibition ==

The [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] has held the work since shortly after its creation. During his wilderness travels, Thomson likely stored ''The Jack Pine'' in his shack behind the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]]. In late 1917, Dr. Norm MacCallum, Thomson's patron, put it and a few other works by Thomson on display at the [[The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto|Arts and Letters Club]]. Representatives of the National Gallery visited the club on two occasions in the spring of 1918. The museum wished to add to its existing collection of three works by Thomson. Director Eric Brown was appalled on his first visit at the poor lighting provided the paintings. For the second visit, May 2, the display had been improved, and the director and his associate chose ''The Jack Pine'' (along with Thomson's ''Autumn Garland'' and 25 sketches) for the National Gallery. Brown wrote to a colleague that ''The Jack Pine'' was "in our opinion, and that of Thomson's fellow painters, the best picture of any kind he ever painted."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after ''The Jack Pine'' arrived in Ottawa in August 1918, it was sent to St. Louis, Missouri, as part of an exhibition of contemporary [[Canadian art]]. It circulated until 1919, and only in February 1920 was the painting first displayed in Canada, as part of a Thomson memorial exhibition. In the next five decades it would be displayed widely, in Europe (London, Paris, Ghent), and across Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Jack Pine'' was included in an exhibition of Thomson's work that travelled across Canada in 2003, organized by the National Gallery and the Art Gallery of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;A 140-plate book on Thomson was published in 2002 to coincide with the exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; It was then shown at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in Russia in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/09/09/thomsonhermitage040909.html Iconic Tom Thomson works showcased at Russia's Hermitage].

''The Jack Pine'', with other works by Thomson, has become an iconic representation of the [[Canadian geography|Canadian landscape]]. Thomson's life and mysterious death is a popular subject of Canadian biography and poetry. Even ''The Jack Pine'' is a title referent in a few poems, including [[Henry Beissel]]'s "Tom Thomson's Jackpine" and Doug Barbour's "Tom Thomson's 'The Jack Pine' (1916–1917)".&lt;ref&gt;Grace, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Beissel's poem concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
... the light is at peace with the tree and the lake.
Calmly it amplifies the beryline silence brooding
on the waters where Tom's spirit rests forever
alongside the sky stretched out in the shadow
of the jackpine that holds heaven and earth
together in an embrace encompassing the hills
the lake, the seasons, and the void that fills
the dark spaces between them and infinity.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in full in [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9CfKx7SeIoC&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22the%20light%20is%20at%20peace%20with%20the%20tree%22&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20light%20is%20at%20peace%20with%20the%20tree%22&amp;f=false Grace, p. 2]. Attributed to unpublished typescript, no date&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting has been widely reproduced, seen across Canada in schools and public institutions. In 1967, a stamp featuring ''The Jack Pine'' was released to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the painting's creation and Thomson's death.&lt;ref&gt;Grace, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The pine depicted in the painting was located by park staff in 1970. The tree was already dead by the time of its discovery; it later fell over and was used for firewood by campers.&lt;ref&gt;"Algonquin Park site marks location where Tom Thomson sketched famous work", The Canadian Press. August 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A lookout at Grand Lake now marks the site of the painting with a plaque that notes the significance of Thomson's work and depicts the painting alongside a photograph of the scene from the 1970s, before the tree fell.

'''''The Merchant of Venice''''' is a 16th-century play written by [[William Shakespeare]] in which a merchant in Venice (Antonio) must default on a large loan provided by a Jewish moneylender, [[Shylock]]. It is believed to have been written between 1596 and 1599. Though classified as a [[Shakespearean comedy|comedy]] in the [[First Folio]] and sharing certain aspects with Shakespeare's other [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]], the play is  most remembered for its dramatic scenes, and it is best known for [[Shylock]] and the famous "Hath not a Jew eyes?" speech on humanity. Also notable is [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]]'s speech about "[[The quality of mercy (Shakespeare quote)|the quality of mercy]]". Critic [[Harold Bloom]] listed it among Shakespeare's great comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vftwsGjRSNMC|title=William Shakespeare: Comedies|page=1|editor-last=Bloom|editor-first=Harold|publisher=Infobase Publishing|date=2009|isbn=1604136316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot summary ==
[[File:Gilbert-Shylock.jpg|thumb|Gilbert's ''[[Shylock]] After the Trial'', an illustration to The ''Merchant of Venice''.]]
Bassanio, a young [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] of noble rank, wishes to woo the beautiful and wealthy heiress [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] of Belmont. Having squandered his estate, he needs 3,000 [[ducats]] to subsidise his expenditures as a suitor. Bassanio approaches his friend [[Antonio (Merchant of Venice)|Antonio]], a wealthy merchant of Venice who has previously and repeatedly bailed him out. Antonio agrees, but since he is cash-poor – his ships and merchandise are busy at sea to [[Tripoli]]s, [[the Indies]], [[New Spain|Mexico]] and [[England]] – he promises to cover a bond if Bassanio can find a lender, so Bassanio turns to the Jewish moneylender Shylock and names Antonio as the loan's guarantor.

Antonio has already antagonized Shylock through his outspoken [[antisemitism]] and because Antonio's habit of lending money without interest forces Shylock to charge lower rates.  Shylock is at first reluctant to grant the loan, citing abuse he has suffered at Antonio's hand. He finally agrees to lend the sum to Bassanio without interest upon one condition: if Antonio is unable to repay it at the specified date, Shylock may take a [[pound (mass)|pound]] of Antonio's flesh. Bassanio does not want Antonio to accept such a risky condition; Antonio is surprised by what he sees as the moneylender's generosity (no "usance" – interest – is asked for), and he signs the contract. With money at hand, Bassanio leaves for Belmont with his friend Gratiano, who has asked to accompany him. Gratiano is a likeable young man, but he is often flippant, overly talkative, and tactless. Bassanio warns his companion to exercise self-control, and the two leave for Belmont.

Meanwhile, in Belmont, Portia is awash with suitors. Her father left a [[Will and testament|will]] stipulating each of her suitors must choose correctly from one of three caskets – made of gold, silver and lead respectively. Whoever picks the right casket wins Portia's hand. The first suitor, the Prince of Morocco, chooses the gold casket, interpreting its slogan, "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire", as referring to Portia. The second suitor, the conceited Prince of Arragon, chooses the silver casket, which proclaims, "Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves", as he believes he is full of merit. Both suitors leave empty-handed, having rejected the lead casket because of the baseness of its material and the uninviting nature of its slogan, "Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath". The last suitor is Bassanio, whom Portia wishes to succeed, having met him before. As Bassanio ponders his choice, members of Portia's household sing a song that says that "fancy" (not true love) is "engend'red in the eyes, / With gazing fed";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/merchant/MerchantText32.html#67|title=The Merchant of Venice: Act 3, Scene 2|website=www.shakespeare-navigators.com|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassanio chooses the lead casket and wins Portia's hand.

[[File:Shakespeare's Heroines - Jessica.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of Jessica, from ''The Graphic Gallery of Shakespeare's Heroines'']]
At Venice, Antonio's ships are reported lost at sea, so the merchant cannot repay the bond. Shylock has become more determined to exact revenge from Christians because his daughter Jessica eloped with the Christian Lorenzo and converted. She took a substantial amount of Shylock's wealth with her, as well as a turquoise ring which Shylock had been given by his late wife, Leah. Shylock has Antonio brought before court.

At Belmont, Bassanio receives a letter telling him that Antonio has been unable to repay the loan from Shylock. Portia and Bassanio marry, as do Gratiano and Portia's handmaid Nerissa. Bassanio and Gratiano leave for [[Venice]], with money from Portia, to save Antonio's life by offering the money to Shylock. Unknown to Bassanio and Gratiano, Portia sent her servant, Balthazar, to seek the counsel of Portia's cousin, Bellario, a lawyer, at [[Padua]].

The climax of the play takes place in the court of the [[Doges of Venice|Duke of Venice]]. Shylock refuses Bassanio's offer of 6,000 ducats, twice the amount of the loan. He demands his pound of flesh from Antonio. The Duke, wishing to save Antonio but unable to nullify a contract, refers the case to a visitor. He identifies himself as Balthasar, a young male "doctor of the law", bearing a letter of recommendation to the Duke from the learned lawyer Bellario. The doctor is Portia in disguise, and the law clerk who accompanies her is Nerissa, also disguised as a man. As Balthasar, Portia repeatedly asks Shylock to show mercy in a [[The quality of mercy (Shakespeare quote)|famous speech]], advising him that mercy "is twice blest: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes" (IV, i, 185). However, Shylock adamantly refuses any compensations and insists on the pound of flesh.

As the court grants Shylock his bond and Antonio prepares for Shylock's knife, Portia deftly appropriates Shylock's argument for "specific performance". She says that the contract allows Shylock to remove only the ''flesh'', not the "blood", of Antonio (see [[Quibble (plot device)|quibble]]). Thus, if Shylock were to shed any drop of Antonio's blood, his "lands and goods" would be forfeited under Venetian laws. She tells him that he must cut precisely one pound of flesh, no more, no less; she advises him that "if the scale do turn, But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate."

Defeated, Shylock concedes to accepting Bassanio's offer of money for the defaulted bond, first his offer to pay "the bond thrice", which Portia rebuffs, telling him to take his bond, and then merely the principal, which Portia also prevents him from doing on the ground that he has already refused it "in the open court". She cites a law under which Shylock, as a Jew and therefore an "alien", having attempted to take the life of a citizen, has forfeited his property, half to [[Venetian Republic|the government]] and half to Antonio, leaving his life at the mercy of the Duke. The Duke pardons Shylock's life. Antonio asks for his share "in use" until Shylock's death, when the principal will be given to Lorenzo and Jessica. At Antonio's request, the Duke grants remission of the state's half of forfeiture, but on the condition that Shylock convert to Christianity and bequeath his entire estate to Lorenzo and Jessica (IV,i).

Bassanio does not recognise his disguised wife, but offers to give a present to the supposed lawyer. First she declines, but after he insists, Portia requests his ring and Antonio's gloves. Antonio parts with his gloves without a second thought, but Bassanio gives the ring only after much persuasion from Antonio, as earlier in the play he promised his wife never to lose, sell or give it. Nerissa, as the lawyer's clerk, succeeds in likewise retrieving her ring from Gratiano, who does not see through her disguise.

At Belmont, Portia and Nerissa taunt and pretend to accuse their husbands before revealing they were really the lawyer and his clerk in disguise (V). After all the other characters make amends, Antonio learns from Portia that three of his ships were not stranded and have returned safely after all.

== Date and text ==

The date of composition for ''The Merchant of Venice'' is believed to be between 1596 and 1598. The play was mentioned by [[Francis Meres]] in 1598, so it must have been familiar on the stage by that date. The title page of the first edition in 1600 states that it had been performed "divers times" by that date. Salerino's reference to his ship the ''Andrew'' (I,i,27) is thought to be an allusion to the Spanish ship ''St. Andrew,'' captured by the English at [[Cádiz]] in 1596. A date of 1596–97 is considered consistent with the play's style.

The play was entered in the [[Stationers' Register|Register]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]], the method at that time of obtaining [[copyright]] for a new play, by [[James Roberts (printer)|James Roberts]] on 22 July 1598 under the title ''The Merchant of Venice'', otherwise called ''The Jew of Venice''. On 28 October 1600 Roberts transferred his right to the play to the stationer [[Thomas Heyes]]; Heyes published the first [[book size|quarto]] before the end of the year. It was printed again in 1619, as part of William Jaggard's so-called [[False Folio]]. (Afterward, Thomas Heyes' son and heir Laurence Heyes asked for and was granted a confirmation of his right to the play, on 8 July 1619.) The 1600 edition is generally regarded as being accurate and reliable. It is the basis of the text published in the 1623 [[First Folio]], which adds a number of stage directions, mainly musical cues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Wells]] and Michael Dobson, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2001, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Shylock and the antisemitism debate ===
The play is frequently staged today, but is potentially troubling to modern audiences because of its central themes, which can easily appear [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]]. Critics today still continue to argue over the play's stance on the Jews and Judaism.
[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Shylock e jessica.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Shylock and Jessica'' (1876) by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]].]]

==== Shylock as a villain ====
English society in the Elizabethan era has been described as "judeophobic".&lt;ref&gt;Philipe Burrin, ''Nazi Anti-Semitism: From Prejudice to Holocaust''. The New Press, 2005, p. 17. {{ISBN|1-56584-969-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of the Jews in England|English Jews]] had been [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled]] under [[King Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1290 and were not permitted to return until 1656 under the rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]]. In Venice and in some other places, Jews were required to wear a red hat at all times in public to make sure that they were easily identified, and had to live in a ghetto protected by Christian guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Venice.html|title=Venice, Italy Jewish History Tour|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's play may be seen as a continuation of this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hales, John W. [https://archive.org/stream/englishhistorica09londuoft#page/652/mode/2up "Shakespeare and the Jews"], ''The English Review'', Vol. IX, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; The title page of the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Quarto]] indicates that the play was sometimes known as ''The Jew of Venice'' in its day, which suggests that it was seen as similar to Marlowe's ''[[The Jew of Malta]]''. One interpretation of the play's structure is that Shakespeare meant to contrast the mercy of the main Christian characters with the vengefulness of a Jew, who lacks the religious [[divine grace|grace]] to comprehend mercy. Similarly, it is possible that Shakespeare meant Shylock's [[forced conversion]] to Christianity to be a "[[happy ending]]" for the character, as, to a Christian audience, it saves his soul and allows him to enter Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Gorman | last=Beauchamp | date=2011 | title=Shylock's Conversion | work=[[Humanitas]] | volume=24 | pages=55–92 | url=http://www.nhinet.org/beauchamp24-1.pdf | access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of what Shakespeare's [[authorial intent]] may have been, the play has been made use of by antisemites throughout the play's history. The [[Nazis]] used the usurious Shylock for their propaganda. Shortly after [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, ''The Merchant of Venice'' was broadcast for propagandistic ends over the German airwaves. Productions of the play followed in [[Lübeck]] (1938), [[Berlin]] (1940), and elsewhere within the Nazi territory.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture by James Shapiro: "Shakespeare and the Jews".&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles called ''Observer'', first published in 1785, British playwright [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]] created a character named Abraham Abrahams, who is quoted as saying, "I verily believe the odious character of Shylock has brought little less persecution upon us, poor scattered sons of [[Abraham]], than the [[Inquisition]] itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Louis I.|title=Richard Cumberland: Critic and Friend of the Jews (Classic Reprint)|year=2012|publisher=Forgotten Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland later wrote a successful play, ''[[The Jew]]'' (1794), in which his title character, [[The Jew|Sheva]], is portrayed sympathetically, as both a kindhearted and generous man. This was the first known attempt by a dramatist to reverse the negative stereotype that Shylock personified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armin|first=Robert|title=Sheva, the Benevolent|year=2012|publisher=Moreclacke Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stereotypes of Jews in literature|depiction of Jews in literature]] throughout the centuries bears the close imprint of Shylock. With slight variations much of English literature up until the 20th century depicts the Jew as "a monied, cruel, lecherous, avaricious outsider tolerated only because of his golden hoard".&lt;ref&gt;David Mirsky, "The Fictive Jew in the Literature of England 1890–1920", in the ''Samuel K. Mirsky Memorial Volume''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shylock as a sympathetic character ====
[[File:Portia and Shylock.jpg|thumb|right|''Shylock and Portia'' (1835) by [[Thomas Sully]].]]
Many modern readers  and theatregoers have read the play as a plea for tolerance, noting that Shylock is a sympathetic character. They cite as evidence that Shylock's "trial" at the end of the play is a mockery of justice, with Portia acting as a judge when she has no right to do so. The characters who berated Shylock for dishonesty resort to trickery in order to win. In addition, Shakespeare gives Shylock one of his most eloquent speeches:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''Salerio.'' Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh. What's that good for?
''Shylock.'' To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies – and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.&lt;/poem&gt;|Act III, scene I}}

It is difficult to know whether the sympathetic reading of Shylock is entirely due to changing sensibilities among readers—or whether Shakespeare, a writer who created complex, multi-faceted characters, deliberately intended this reading.

One of the reasons for this interpretation is that Shylock's painful status in Venetian society is emphasised. To some critics, Shylock's celebrated "Hath not a Jew eyes?" speech redeems him and even makes him into something of a tragic figure; in the speech, Shylock argues that he is no different from the Christian characters.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Detractors note that Shylock ends the speech with a tone of revenge: "if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?" Those who see the speech as sympathetic point out that Shylock says he learned the desire for revenge from the Christian characters: "If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction."

Even if Shakespeare did not intend the play to be read this way, the fact that it retains its power on stage for audiences who may perceive its central conflicts in radically different terms is an illustration of the subtlety of Shakespeare's characterisations.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2007), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the trial Shylock represents what Elizabethan Christians believed to be the Jewish desire for "justice", contrasted with their obviously superior Christian value of mercy. The Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to love his enemies, although they themselves have failed in the past. Jewish critic [[Harold Bloom]] suggests that, although the play gives merit to both cases, the portraits are not even-handed: "Shylock's shrewd indictment of Christian hypocrisy delights us, but … Shakespeare’s intimations do not alleviate the savagery of his portrait of the Jew…"&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2007), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antonio, Bassanio ===
Antonio's unexplained depression – "In sooth I know not why I am so sad" – and utter devotion to Bassanio has led some critics to theorise that he is suffering from [[unrequited love]] for Bassanio and is depressed because Bassanio is coming to an age where he will marry a woman. In his plays and poetry Shakespeare often depicted strong male bonds of varying [[homosociality]], which has led some critics to infer that Bassanio returns Antonio's affections despite his obligation to marry:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Bloom|title=Interpretations: William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice|year=2010|publisher=Infobase|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60413-885-6|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;ANTONIO: Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end,
Say how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.

BASSANIO: But life itself, my wife, and all the world
Are not with me esteemed above thy life;
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you. (IV,i)&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In his essay "Brothers and Others", published in ''The Dyer's Hand,'' [[W. H. Auden]] describes Antonio as "a man whose emotional life, though his conduct may be chaste, is concentrated upon a member of his own sex." Antonio's feelings for Bassanio are likened to a couplet from Shakespeare's ''Sonnets'': "But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,/ Mine be thy love, and my love's use their treasure." Antonio, says Auden, embodies the words on Portia's leaden casket: "Who chooseth me, must give and hazard all he hath." Antonio has taken this potentially fatal turn because he despairs, not only over the loss of Bassanio in marriage but also because Bassanio cannot requite what Antonio feels for him. Antonio's frustrated devotion is a form of idolatry: the right to live is yielded for the sake of the loved one. There is one other such idolator in the play: Shylock himself. "Shylock, however unintentionally, did, in fact, hazard all for the sake of destroying the enemy he hated, and Antonio, however unthinkingly he signed the bond, hazarded all to secure the happiness of the man he loved." Both Antonio and Shylock, agreeing to put Antonio's life at a forfeit, stand outside the normal bounds of society. There was, states Auden, a traditional "association of sodomy with usury", reaching back at least as far as [[Dante]], with which Shakespeare was likely familiar. (Auden sees the theme of [[usury]] in the play as a comment on human relations in a mercantile society.)

Other interpreters of the play regard Auden's conception of Antonio's sexual desire for Bassanio as questionable. Michael Radford, director of the 2004 film version starring [[Al Pacino]], explained that, although the film contains a scene where Antonio and Bassanio actually kiss, the friendship between the two is platonic, in line with the prevailing view of male friendship at the time. [[Jeremy Irons]], in an interview, concurs with the director's view and states that he did not "play Antonio as gay". [[Joseph Fiennes]], however, who plays Bassanio, encouraged a homoerotic interpretation and, in fact, surprised Irons with the kiss on set, which was filmed in one take. Fiennes defended his choice, saying "I would never invent something before doing my detective work in the text. If you look at the choice of language … you'll read very sensuous language. That's the key for me in the relationship. The great thing about Shakespeare and why he's so difficult to pin down is his ambiguity. He's not saying they're gay or they're straight, he's leaving it up to his actors. I feel there has to be a great love between the two characters … there's great attraction. I don't think they have slept together but that's for the audience to decide."&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.

== Performance history ==

The earliest performance of which a record has survived was held at the court of [[James I of England|King James]] in the spring of 1605, followed by a second performance a few days later, but there is no record of any further performances in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Boyce, ''Encyclopaedia of Shakespeare'', New York, Roundtable Press, 1990, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, [[George Granville]] staged a successful adaptation, titled ''The Jew of Venice'', with [[Thomas Betterton]] as Bassanio. This version (which featured a [[masque]]) was popular, and was acted for the next forty years. Granville cut the clownish [[#Characters|Gobbos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warde|first1=Frederick|title=The Fools of Shakespeare; an interpretation of their wit, wisdom and personalities|date=1915|publisher=McBride, Nast &amp; Company|location=London|pages=103–120|url=http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/characters/merchantgobbo.html|accessdate=28 April 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/foolsshakespear00wardgoog|archivedate=2006-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[decorum]]; he added a jail scene between Shylock and Antonio, and a more extended scene of toasting at a banquet scene. [[Thomas Doggett]] was Shylock, playing the role comically, perhaps even farcically. [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Rowe]] expressed doubts about this interpretation as early as 1709; Doggett's success in the role meant that later productions would feature the troupe clown as Shylock.

In 1741, [[Charles Macklin]] returned to the original text in a very successful production at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], paving the way for [[Edmund Kean]] seventy years later (see below).&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Halliday, ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 261, 311–12. In 2004, the film was released.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Sullivan]] wrote [[incidental music]] for the play in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/venice/index.html Information about Sullivan's incidental music to the play] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125144749/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/venice/index.html |date=25 November 2009 }} at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 31 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shylock on stage ===
{{See also|Shylock}}

Jewish actor [[Jacob Pavlovitch Adler|Jacob Adler]] and others report that the tradition of playing Shylock sympathetically began in the first half of the 19th century with [[Edmund Kean]],&lt;ref&gt;Adler erroneously dates this from 1847 (at which time Kean was already dead); the ''Cambridge Student Guide to The Merchant of Venice'' dates Kean's performance to a more likely 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; and that previously the role had been played "by a comedian as a repulsive [[clown]] or, alternatively, as a monster of unrelieved evil." Kean's Shylock established his reputation as an actor.&lt;ref&gt;Adler (1999), p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kean's time forward, all of the actors who have famously played the role, with the exception of [[Edwin Booth]], who played Shylock as a simple villain, have chosen a sympathetic approach to the character; even Booth's father, [[Junius Brutus Booth]], played the role sympathetically. [[Henry Irving]]'s portrayal of an aristocratic, proud Shylock (first seen at the Lyceum in 1879, with Portia played by [[Ellen Terry]]) has been called "the summit of his career".&lt;ref&gt;Wells and Dobson, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Adler was the most notable of the early 20th century: Adler played the role in [[Yiddish theatre|Yiddish]]-language translation, first in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Yiddish Theater District]] in the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], and later on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where, to great acclaim, he performed the role in [[Yiddish]] in an otherwise English-language production.&lt;ref&gt;Adler (1999), pp. 342–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kean and Irving presented a Shylock justified in wanting his [[revenge]]; Adler's Shylock evolved over the years he played the role, first as a stock Shakespearean villain, then as a man whose better nature was overcome by a desire for revenge, and finally as a man who operated not from revenge but from [[pride]]. In a 1902 interview with ''Theater'' magazine, Adler pointed out that Shylock is a wealthy man, "rich enough to forgo the interest on three thousand ducats" and that Antonio is "far from the chivalrous gentleman he is made to appear. He has insulted the Jew and spat on him, yet he comes with hypocritical politeness to borrow money of him." Shylock's fatal flaw is to depend on the law, but "would he not walk out of that courtroom head erect, the very apotheosis of defiant hatred and scorn?"&lt;ref&gt;Adler (1999), pp. 344–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern productions take further pains to show the sources of Shylock's thirst for vengeance. For instance, in the [[The Merchant of Venice (2004 film)|2004 film adaptation]] directed by [[Michael Radford]] and starring [[Al Pacino]] as Shylock, the film begins with text and a montage of how [[Venice Ghetto|Venetian Jews]] are cruelly abused by bigoted Christians. One of the last shots of the film also brings attention to the fact that, as a convert, Shylock would have been cast out of the Jewish community in Venice, no longer allowed to live in the ghetto. Another interpretation of Shylock and a vision of how "must he be acted" appears at the conclusion of the autobiography of [[Alexander Granach]], a noted Jewish stage and film actor in Weimar Germany (and later in Hollywood and on Broadway).&lt;ref&gt;Granach (1945; 2010), pp. 275–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Performing arts}}

'''Theatre''' or '''theater'''&lt;ref&gt;Originally spelled ''theatre'' and ''teatre''. From around 1550 to 1700 or later, the most common spelling was ''theater''. Between 1720 and 1750, ''theater'' was dropped in [[British English]], but was either retained or revived in [[American English]] (''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edition, 2009, CD-ROM: {{ISBN|978-0199563838}}). Recent dictionaries of American English list ''theatre'' as a less common variant, e.g., ''Random House Webster's College Dictionary'' (1991); ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 4th edition (2006); ''New Oxford American Dictionary'', third edition (2010); [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theater ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' (2011)].&lt;/ref&gt; is a collaborative form of [[fine art]] that uses live performers, typically [[actor|actors or actresses]], to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and [[stagecraft]] such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marvin Carlson|M. Carlson]], [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/jdtc/article/view/1642/1606 "Psychic  Polyphony"], pp. 35–47 in ''Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism'', Fall 1986, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The specific place of the performance is also named by the word "theatre" as derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] θέατρον (théatron, "a place for viewing"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, "to see", "to watch", "to observe").

Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, [[stock character]]s, and plot elements. Theatre artist [[Patrice Pavis]] defines theatricality, [[Theatre language|theatrical language]], stage writing and the [[Medium specificity|specificity]] of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other [[performing arts]], [[literature]] and [[the arts]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavis|1998|pp=345–346}}. Drawing on the "[[semiotic]]s" of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], Pavis goes on to suggest that "the specificity of theatrical signs may lie in their ability to use [[Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce#II. Icon, index, symbol|the three possible functions of signs]]: as [[Iconicity|icon]] ([[Mimesis|mimetically]]), as [[Indexicality|index]] (in the situation of [[enunciation]]), or as symbol (as a [[Semiotics|semiological system]] in the fictional mode). In effect, theatre makes the sources of the words visual and concrete: it indicates {{em|and}} incarnates a fictional world by means of signs, such that by the end of the process of signification and symbolization the spectator has reconstructed a theoretical and aesthetic model that accounts for the dramatic universe."&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern theatre includes performances of [[play (theatre)|plays]] and [[musical theatre]]. The art forms of [[ballet]] and [[opera]] are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging. They were influential to the development of musical theatre; see those articles for more information.

The [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] is where western theatre originated.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54). Brown writes that [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] "was essentially the creation of [[classical Athens]]: all the dramatists who were later regarded as classics were active at Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE (the time of the [[Athenian democracy]]), and all the surviving plays date from this period" (1998, 441). "The dominant culture of [[Classical Athens|Athens in the fifth century]]", Goldhill writes, "can be said to have invented theatre" (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a broader [[culture]] of theatricality and performance in [[classical Greece]] that included [[Athenian festivals|festivals]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious rituals]], [[Ancient Greece#Political structure|politics]], [[Ancient Greek law|law]], athletics and gymnastics, [[Music of ancient Greece|music]], [[Ancient Greek literature#Classical and Pre-Classical Antiquity|poetry]], weddings, funerals, and ''[[Symposium|symposia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge (1997, 3, 6), Goldhill (1997, 54) and (1999, 20–xx), and Rehm (1992. 3). Goldhill argues that although activities that form "an integral part of the exercise of citizenship" (such as when "the Athenian citizen speaks in the Assembly, exercises in the gymnasium, sings at the symposium, or courts a boy") each have their "own regime of display and regulation," nevertheless the term "performance" provides "a useful heuristic category to explore the connections and overlaps between these different areas of activity" (1999, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Participation in the city-state's many festivals—and mandatory attendance at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] as an audience member (or even as a participant in the theatrical productions) in particular—was an important part of [[citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelling (2005, 83).&lt;/ref&gt; Civic participation also involved the evaluation of the [[rhetoric]] of [[orators]] evidenced in performances in the [[Athenian law court (classical period)|law-court]] or [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|political assembly]], both of which were understood as analogous to the theatre and increasingly came to absorb its dramatic vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill (1999, 25) and Pelling (2005, 83–84).&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks also developed the concepts of [[dramatic criticism]] and theatre architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Dukore (1974, 31), Janko (1987, ix), and Ward (1945, 1).&lt;!-- These citations only support "criticism" - need others for professional actors and architecture --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Actors were either amateur or at best semi-professional.&lt;ref&gt;novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/spd130et/ancientgreek.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Greece]] consisted of three types of [[drama]]: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–19).&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of theatre in ancient Greece, according to Aristotle (384–322 BCE), the first theoretician of theatre, are to be found in the festivals that honoured Dionysus. The performances were given in semi-circular auditoria cut into hillsides, capable of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor (orchestra), dressing room and scene-building area (skene). Since the words were the most important part, good acoustics and clear delivery were paramount. The actors (always men) wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/chambdictwh/theatre|title=Credo Reference Library Login Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), Ley (2007, 206), and Styan (2000, 140). Taxidou notes that "most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct" (2004, 104).&lt;/ref&gt; Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 32–33), Brown (1998, 444), and Cartledge (1997, 3–5). Cartledge writes that although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honoured their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]]. If not attaining the quality and stature of the fifth-century 'classics', original tragedies nonetheless continued to be written and produced and competed with in large numbers throughout the remaining life of the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]]—and beyond it" (1997, 33).&lt;/ref&gt;

No tragedies from the 6th century BCE and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in during the 5th century BCE have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15) and Kovacs (2005, 379). We have seven by Aeschylus, seven by Sophocles, and eighteen by Euripides. In addition, we also have the ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', a satyr play by Euripides. Some critics since the 17th century have argued that one of the tragedies that the classical tradition gives as Euripides'—''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]''—is a 4th-century play by an unknown author; modern scholarship agrees with the classical authorities and ascribes the play to Euripides; see Walton (1997, viii, xix). (This uncertainty accounts for Brockett and Hildy's figure of 31 tragedies.)&lt;/ref&gt; We have complete texts [[Extant literature|extant]] by [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15). The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] adds a fourth, anonymous playwright to those whose work survives.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of tragedy remain obscure, though by the 5th century BCE it was [[institution]]alised in competitions (''[[agon]]'') held as part of festivities celebrating [[Dionysus]] (the [[Family tree of the Greek gods|god]] of [[wine]] and [[fertility]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Brown (1998, 441–447).&lt;/ref&gt; As contestants in the City Dionysia's competition (the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama) playwrights were required to present a [[tetralogy]] of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–17).

Exceptions to this pattern were made, as with [[Euripides]]' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' in 438 BCE. There were also separate competitions at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] for the performance of [[dithyramb]]s and, after 488–7 BCE, [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedies]].&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of tragedies at the City Dionysia may have begun as early as 534 BCE; official records (''didaskaliai'') begin from 501 BCE, when the satyr play was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Brown (1998, 442). Rehm offers the following argument as evidence that tragedy was not institutionalised until 501 BCE: "The specific cult honoured at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] was that of Dionysus Eleuthereus, the god 'having to do with [[Eleutherae]]', a town on the border between [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] that had a sanctuary to Dionysus. At some point [[Classical Athens|Athens]] annexed Eleutherae—most likely after the overthrow of the [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratid]] tyranny in 510 and the democratic reforms of [[Cleisthenes]] in 508–07 BCE—and the cult-image of Dionysus Eleuthereus was moved to its new home. Athenians re-enacted the incorporation of the god's cult every year in a preliminary rite to the City Dionysia. On the day before the festival proper, the cult-statue was removed from the [[Greek temple|temple]] near the [[theatre of Dionysus]] and taken to a temple on the road to Eleutherae. That evening, after [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] and [[hymn]]s, a torchlight procession carried the statue back to the temple, a symbolic re-creation of the god's arrival into Athens, as well as a reminder of the inclusion of the Boeotian town into Attica. As the name Eleutherae is extremely close to eleutheria, 'freedom', Athenians probably felt that the new cult was particularly appropriate for celebrating their own political liberation and democratic reforms." (1992, 15).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Athenian tragedies dramatise events from [[Greek mythology]], though ''[[The Persians]]''—which stages the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] response to news of their military defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in 480 BCE—is the notable exception in the surviving drama.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442). [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]] argues that in ''[[The Persians]]'' [[Aeschylus]] substitutes for the usual temporal distance between the audience and the [[Greek Heroic Age|age of heroes]] a spatial distance between the Western audience and the Eastern [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian culture]]. This substitution, he suggests, produces a similar effect: "The 'historic' events evoked by the chorus, recounted by the messenger and interpreted by Darius' ghost are presented on stage in a legendary atmosphere. The light that the tragedy sheds upon them is not that in which the political happenings of the day are normally seen; it reaches the Athenian theatre refracted from a distant world of elsewhere, making what is absent seem present and visible on the stage"; Vernant and Vidal-Naquet (1988, 245).&lt;/ref&gt; When Aeschylus won first prize for it at the City Dionysia in 472 BCE, he had been writing tragedies for more than 25 years, yet its tragic treatment of recent history is the earliest example of [[drama]] to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16).&lt;/ref&gt; More than 130 years later, the philosopher [[Aristotle]] analysed 5th-century Athenian tragedy in the oldest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]]—his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE).

[[Ancient Greek comedy|Athenian comedy]] is conventionally divided into three periods, "Old Comedy", "Middle Comedy", and "New Comedy". Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of [[Aristophanes]], while Middle Comedy is largely lost (preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]]). New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of [[Menander]]. Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a line 1449a]: "Comedy, as we have said, is a representation of inferior people, not indeed in the full sense of the word bad, but the laughable is a species of the base or ugly. It consists in some blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster, an obvious example being the comic mask which is ugly and distorted but not painful'."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the categories of comedy and tragedy at the City Dionysia, the festival also included the [[Satyr play|Satyr Play]]. Finding its origins in rural, agricultural rituals dedicated to Dionysus, the satyr play eventually found its way to Athens in its most well-known form. Satyr's themselves were tied to the god Dionysus as his loyal woodland  companions, often engaging in drunken revelry and mischief at his side. The satyr play itself was classified as tragicomedy, erring on the side of the more modern burlesque traditions of the early twentieth century. The plotlines of the plays were typically concerned with the dealings of the pantheon of Gods and their involvement in human affairs, backed by the chorus of [[Satyrs]]. However, according to Webster, satyr actors did not always perform typical satyr actions and would break from the acting traditions assigned to the character type of a mythical forest creature.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, T.B.L. “Monuments Illustrating Tragedy and Satyr Play (Second Edition with Appendix).” Bulletin Supplement (University of London. Institute of Classical Studies), no. 20, 1967, pp. iii–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Pompeii - Villa del Cicerone - Mosaic - MAN.jpg|thumb|Mosaic depicting masked actors in a play: two women consult a "witch"]]
Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Roman historian [[Livy]] wrote that the Romans first experienced theatre in the 4th century BCE, with a performance by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] actors.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; Beacham argues that they had been familiar with "pre-theatrical practices" for some time before that recorded contact.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 3).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and [[acrobatics]], to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]], to the [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate [[Tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of [[Latin literature]] of the highest quality for the stage. The only surviving Roman tragedies, indeed the only plays of any kind from the Roman Empire, are ten dramas- nine of them pallilara- attributed to Lucuis Annaeus Seneca (4 BCE–65 CE), the Corduba-born Stoic philosopher and tutor of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;John, Gassner, and Allen Ralph.

[[File:Kovalan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Koothu]] is an ancient form of performing art that originated in early [[Tamilakam]].]]
The earliest-surviving fragments of [[Sanskrit drama]] date from the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and  (1998, 516–517).&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516" &gt;Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient ''[[Vedas]]'' ([[hymn]]s from between 1500 and 1000 BCE that are among the earliest examples of [[History of literature#India|literature]] in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of [[dialogue]]) and the [[ritual]]s of the [[Vedic period]] do not appear to have developed into theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516" /&gt; The ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' by [[Patañjali]] contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name="Richmond517" &gt;Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise on [[grammar]] from 140 BCE provides a feasible date for the beginnings of [[theatre in India]].&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt;

The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is ''[[Natyashastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' (''Nātyaśāstra''), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BCE to 200 CE) and whose authorship is attributed to [[Bharata Muni]]. The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], [[Theatre architecture|architecture]], [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt; In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in a [hereditary process]. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain.

[[File:കൂടിയാട്ടത്തിലെസുഗ്രീവൻ.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Performer playing [[Sugriva]] in the [[Koodiyattam]] form of [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].]]

Under the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (''sutradhara''), who may also have acted.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a [[Puppetry|puppeteer]]—the literal meaning of "''sutradhara''" is "holder of the strings or threads".&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt; The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 518).&lt;/ref&gt; There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played characters their own age, while others played ages different from their own (whether younger or older). Of all the elements of theatre, the ''Treatise'' gives most attention to acting (''abhinaya''), which consists of two styles: realistic (''lokadharmi'') and conventional (''natyadharmi''), though the major focus is on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 518). The literal meaning of ''abhinaya'' is "to carry forwards".&lt;/ref&gt;

Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii" &gt;Brandon (1981, xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised [[stock character]]s, such as the hero (''nayaka''), heroine (''nayika''), or clown (''vidusaka''). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. [[Kālidāsa]] in the 1st century BCE, is arguably considered to be ancient [[India]]'s greatest Sanskrit dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram]]'' (''Mālavikā and Agnimitra''), ''[[Vikramuurvashiiya]]'' (''Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi''), and ''[[The Recognition of Sakuntala|Abhijñānaśākuntala]]'' (''The Recognition of Shakuntala''). The last was inspired by a story in the ''Mahabharata'' and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|Śakuntalā]]'' (in English translation) influenced [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808–1832).&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii" /&gt;

The next great Indian dramatist was [[Bhavabhuti]] (c. 7th century CE). He is said to have written the following three plays: ''Malati-Madhava'', ''Mahaviracharita'' and ''Uttar Ramacharita''. Among these three, the last two cover between them the entire epic of ''Ramayana''. The powerful Indian emperor [[Harsha]] (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy ''[[Ratnavali]]'', ''[[Priyadarsika]]'', and the [[Buddhist]] drama ''[[Nagananda]]''.

===Chinese theatre===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Lijiang Yunnan China-Naxi-people-carrying-baskets-01.jpg|thumb|Public performance in Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Open Air Theatre.]]
There are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as the [[Shang Dynasty]]; they often involved happiness, mimes, and acrobatic displays.The [[Tang Dynasty]] is sometimes known as "The Age of 1000 Entertainments". During this era, Ming Huang formed an acting school known as The [[Pear Garden]] to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical. That is why actors are commonly called "Children of the Pear Garden." During the Dynasty of Empress Ling, [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]] first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the [[puppets]], as opposed to the type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda.

Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets’ heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a donkey).They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the eleventh century before becoming a tool of the government.

In the [[Song Dynasty]], there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the [[Yuan Dynasty]] into a more sophisticated form known as ''[[zaju]]'', with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, one of the best known of which is Beijing Opera,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} which is still popular today.

[[Xiangsheng]] is a certain traditional Chinese comedic performance in the forms of monologue or dialogue.

===Post-classical theatre in the West===
{{self-published|Section|date=August 2012}}
Theatre took on many alternate forms in the West between the 15th and 19th centuries, including ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' and [[melodrama]]. The general trend was away from the poetic drama of the Greeks and the [[Renaissance]] and toward a more naturalistic prose style of dialogue, especially following the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuritz (1988, 305).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Obviously, this is just a place-holder, as much is missing. --&gt;

Theatre took a big pause during 1642 and 1660 in England because of the [[Puritans|Puritan]] Interregnum. Theatre was seen as something sinful and the Puritans tried very hard to drive it out of their society. This stagnant period ended once Charles II came back to the throne in 1660 in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. Theatre (among other arts) exploded, with influence from French culture, since Charles had been exiled in France in the years previous to his reign.

One of the big changes was the new theatre house. Instead of the type of the Elizabethan era, such as the [[Globe Theatre]], round with no place for the actors to really prep for the next act and with no "theatre manners,” the theatre house became transformed into a place of refinement, with a stage in front and stadium seating facing it. Since seating was no longer all the way around the stage, it became prioritized—some seats were obviously better than others. The king would have the best seat in the house: the very middle of the theatre, which got the widest view of the stage as well as the best way to see the point of view and vanishing point that the stage was constructed around. [[Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg]] was one of the most influential set designers of the time because of his use of floor space and scenery.

Because of the turmoil before this time, there was still some controversy about what should and should not be put on the stage. [[Jeremy Collier]], a preacher, was one of the heads in this movement through his piece ''A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage''. The beliefs in this paper were mainly held by non-theatre goers and the remainder of the Puritans and very religious of the time. The main question was if seeing something immoral on stage affects behavior in the lives of those who watch it, a controversy that is still playing out today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Scott R.|title=The English Theatre, 1642–1800|url=http://www.cwu.edu/~robinsos/ppages/resources/Theatre_History/Theahis_10.html|work=Scott R.

[[File:Charles XII High Life below Stairs Mr. Macready 1829.jpg|thumb|Billing for a British theatre in 1829]]

The seventeenth century had also introduced women to the stage, which was considered inappropriate earlier. These women were regarded as celebrities (also a newer concept, thanks to ideas on individualism that arose in the wake of [[Renaissance Humanism]]), but on the other hand, it was still very new and revolutionary that they were on the stage, and some said they were unladylike, and looked down on them. Charles II did not like young men playing the parts of young women, so he asked that women play their own parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Lives Surrounding Late 18th Century Theatre|url=http://engl3621mgc.tripod.com/|work=English 3621 Writing by Women|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because women were allowed on the stage, playwrights had more leeway with plot twists, like women dressing as men, and having narrow escapes from morally sticky situations as forms of comedy.

Comedies were full of the young and very much in vogue, with the storyline following their love lives: commonly a young roguish hero professing his love to the chaste and free minded heroine near the end of the play, much like [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan's]] ''[[The School for Scandal]]''. Many of the comedies were fashioned after the French tradition, mainly Molière, again hailing back to the French influence brought back by the King and the Royals after their exile. [[Molière]] was one of the top comedic playwrights of the time, revolutionizing the way comedy was written and performed by combining Italian [[commedia dell'arte]] and [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] French comedy to create some of the longest lasting and most influential satiric comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bermel|first=Albert|title=Moliere – French Dramatist|url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/Theatre/Moliere/moliere.shtml|work=Discover France|publisher=Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tragedies were similarly victorious in their sense of righting political power, especially poignant because of the recent Restoration of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Joseph|title=The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: Volume 3: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century|year=2010|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1551116112|pages=533–535|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also imitations of French tragedy, although the French had a larger distinction between comedy and tragedy, whereas the English fudged the lines occasionally and put some comedic parts in their tragedies. Common forms of non-comedic plays were sentimental comedies as well as something that would later be called ''tragédie bourgeoise'', or [[domestic tragedy]]—that is, the tragedy of common life—were more popular in England because they appealed more to English sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthew|first=Brander|title=The Drama in the 18th Century|url=http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc20w1.html|work=Moonstruch Drama Bookstore|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While theatre troupes were formerly often travelling, the idea of the national theatre gained support in the 18th century, inspired by [[Ludvig Holberg]]. The major promoter of the idea of the national theatre in Germany, and also of the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' poets, was [[Abel Seyler]], the owner of the [[Hamburgische Entreprise]] and the [[Seyler Theatre Company]].&lt;ref name="abel-seyler"&gt;Wilhelm Kosch, "Seyler, Abel", in ''Dictionary of German Biography'', eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, {{ISBN|3110966298}}, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th century]], the popular theatrical forms of [[Romanticism]], [[melodrama]], [[Victorian burlesque]] and the [[well-made play]]s of [[Eugène Scribe|Scribe]] and [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]] gave way to the [[problem play]]s of [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]]; the [[farce]]s of [[Georges Feydeau|Feydeau]]; [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] [[opera]]tic ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]''; [[musical theatre]] (including [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s operas); [[F. C. Burnand]]'s, [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s drawing-room comedies; [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]; proto-[[Expressionism]] in the late works of [[August Strindberg]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]];&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 293–426).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edwardian musical comedy]].

These trends continued through the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]] in the [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] of [[Constantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] and [[Lee Strasberg]], the political theatre of [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], the so-called [[Theatre of the Absurd]] of [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Eugène Ionesco]], American and British musicals, the collective creations of companies of actors and directors such as [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]], experimental and [[postmodern theatre]] of [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] and [[Robert Lepage]], the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] theatre of [[August Wilson]] or [[Tomson Highway]], and [[Augusto Boal]]'s [[Theatre of the Oppressed]].

The first form of [[Theatre of India|Indian theatre]] was the [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].&lt;ref name="Richmond, Swann 1993"&gt;Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; It began after the development of [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] and before the development of theatre in other parts of Asia.&lt;ref name="Richmond, Swann 1993"/&gt; It emerged sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE and flourished between the 1st century CE and the 10th, which was a period of relative peace in the [[history of India]] during which hundreds of plays were written.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese forms of [[Kabuki]], [[Noh|Nō]], and [[Kyōgen]] developed in the 17th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Deal (2007, 276).&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] included [[puppet]] theatre (which included hand puppets, [[shadow play]]s and [[marionette]] productions) and live passion plays known as ''ta'ziya'', where actors re-enact episodes from [[Muslim history]]. In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic plays revolved around the ''[[Shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Secular plays were known as ''akhraja'', recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''ta'ziya'' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Moreh (1986, 565–601).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Drama===
{{main article|Drama}}
[[Drama]] is the specific [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of [[fiction]] [[Mimesis|represented]] in [[performance]].&lt;ref name="elam98"&gt;Elam (1980, 98).&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "[[Action (philosophy)|action]]", which is derived from the verb δράω, ''dráō'', "to do" or "to act". The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by [[actor]]s on a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] before an [[audience]], presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref name="Pfister 1977, 11"&gt;Pfister (1977, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English Renaissance theatre|early modern]] [[tragedy]] ''[[Hamlet]]'' ([[1601 in literature|1601]]) by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical Athenian]] tragedy ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (c. 429 BCE) by [[Sophocles]] are among the masterpieces of the art of drama.&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson (1949, 2–3).&lt;/ref&gt; A modern example is ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]'' by [[Eugene O'Neill]] (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Burt (2008, 30–35).&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered as a genre of [[poetry]] in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and the [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] modes ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE)—the earliest work of [[dramatic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Fergusson]] writes that "a drama, as distinguished from a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]], is not primarily a composition in the verbal medium; the [[Dialogue (fiction)|words]] result, as one might put it, from the underlying [[Dramatic structure|structure of incident]] and [[Character (arts)|character]]. As [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] remarks, 'the poet, or "maker" should be the maker of [[Plot (narrative)|plots]] rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he [[Mimesis|imiates]], and what he imitates are [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]'" (1949, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "drama" in the narrow sense to designate a specific ''type'' of [[Play (theatre)|play]] dates from the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th century]]. Drama in this sense refers to a play that is ''neither'' a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, [[Émile Zola|Zola's]] ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' ([[1873 in literature|1873]]) or [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov's]] ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' ([[1887 in literature|1887]]). In Ancient Greece however, the word ''drama'' encompassed all theatrical plays, tragic, comic, or anything in between.

Drama is often combined with [[theatre music|music]] and [[dance]]: the drama in [[opera]] is generally sung throughout; [[Musical theatre|musicals]] generally include both spoken [[dialogue]] and [[song]]s; and some forms of drama have [[incidental music]] or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue ([[melodrama]] and Japanese [[Noh|Nō]], for example).&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;See the entries for "opera", "musical theatre, American", "melodrama" and "Nō" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In certain periods of history (the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and modern [[Romanticism|Romantic]]) some dramas have been written to be [[Closet drama|read]] rather than performed.&lt;ref name="closet"&gt;While there is some dispute among theatre historians, it is probable that the plays by the Roman [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] were not intended to be performed. ''[[Manfred]]'' by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] is a good example of a "[[Verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic poem]]." See the entries on "Seneca" and "Byron (George George)" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.&lt;ref name="impro"&gt;Some forms of improvisation, notably the [[Commedia dell'arte]], improvise on the basis of '[[lazzi]]' or rough outlines of scenic action (see Gordon (1983) and Duchartre (1929)). All forms of improvisation take their cue from their immediate response to one another, their characters' situations (which are sometimes established in advance), and, often, their interaction with the audience. The classic formulations of improvisation in the theatre originated with [[Joan Littlewood]] and [[Keith Johnstone]] in the UK and [[Viola Spolin]] in the US; see Johnstone (1981) and Spolin (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
{{Main article|Musical theatre}}
[[Music]] and theatre have had a close relationship since ancient times—[[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]], for example, was a form of [[dance]]-[[drama]] that employed a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] whose parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an ''[[aulos]]''—an instrument comparable to the modern [[clarinet]]), as were some of the actors' responses and their 'solo songs' ([[Monody|monodies]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 150n7).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[musical theatre]] is a form of theatre that also combines music, spoken dialogue, and dance. It emerged from [[comic opera]] (especially [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]), [[Variety show|variety]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]] genres of the late [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th]] and early [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2003, 4–11).&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Edwardian musical comedy]] that began in the 1890s, the [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals of the early 20th century, and comedies in the 1920s and 1930s (such as the works of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]), with ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), musicals moved in a more dramatic direction.&lt;ref&gt;The first "[[Edwardian musical comedy]]" is usually considered to be ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), even though it was produced eight years before the beginning of the [[Edwardian era]]; see, for example, Fraser Charlton, [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/fraser.charlton/edmuscom/page12/edmuscom_what.html "What are EdMusComs?"] (FrasrWeb 2007, accessed May 12, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Famous musicals over the subsequent decades included ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1956), ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957), ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' (1960), ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' (1967), ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' (1975), ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1980), ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1986), and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = John| last = Kenrick | title = History of Stage Musicals| url = http://www.musicals101.com/erastage.htm| year = 2003| accessdate = May 26, 2009}}&lt;!-- Looking for a printed source in preference to theatre dept's webpage --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more contemporary hits including ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1994), ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' (1997), ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' (2003), and ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' (2015).

Musical theatre may be produced on an intimate scale [[Off-Broadway]], in [[Community theatre|regional theatres]], and elsewhere, but it often includes spectacle. For instance, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[West End theatre|West End]] musicals often include lavish costumes and sets supported by multimillion-dollar budgets.&lt;!-- Need a source that says B/WE musicals often include these, rather than an example --&gt;

[[File:Roman masks.png|thumb|Theatrical masks of Tragedy and Comedy. Mosaic, [[Roman art]]work, 2nd century CE. [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]], [[Italy]]]]

===Comedy===
{{Main article|Comedy}}

Theatre productions that use [[humour]] as a vehicle to tell a story qualify as comedies. This may include a modern [[farce]] such as ''[[Boeing-Boeing (play)|Boeing Boeing]]'' or a classical play such as ''[[As You Like It]]''. Theatre expressing bleak, controversial or taboo subject matter in a deliberately humorous way is referred to as [[black comedy]]. Black Comedy can have several genres like slapstick humour, dark and sarcastic comedy.

===Tragedy===
{{Main article|Tragedy}}
{{quote|Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude: in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play; in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions.|[[Aristotle]]|[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Butcher, [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/poetics/], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle's phrase "several kinds being found in separate parts of the play" is a reference to the structural origins of drama. In it the spoken parts were written in the [[Attic dialect]] whereas the choral (recited or sung) ones in the [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]], these discrepancies reflecting the differing religious origins and [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]] of the parts that were fused into a new entity, the theatrical ''drama''.

[[Tragedy]] refers to a specific [[Poetic tradition|tradition]] of [[drama]] that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1118) and Williams (1966, 14–16).&lt;/ref&gt; That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of [[cultural identity]] and historical continuity—"the [[Classical Athens|Greeks]] and the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]], in one cultural form; [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenes]] and [[Christian]]s, in a common activity," as [[Raymond Williams]] puts it.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966, 16).&lt;/ref&gt; From its obscure origins in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatres of Athens]] 2,500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], through its singular articulations in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], to the more recent [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] tragedy of [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]], [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett's]] [[Modernism|modernist]] meditations on death, loss and suffering, and [[Heiner Müller|Müller's]] [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] reworkings of the tragic canon, tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966, 13–84) and Taxidou (2004, 193–209).&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make [[genre]] distinctions, whether at the scale of [[poetry]] in general (where the tragic divides against [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]). In the [[Modernity|modern]] era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, [[melodrama]], [[Tragicomedy|the tragicomic]], and [[epic theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;See Carlson (1993), Pfister (1977), Elam (1980) and Taxidou (2004). [[Drama]], in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-[[Genre|generic]] [[deterritorialization]] from the [[Nineteenth century theatre|mid-19th century]] onwards. Both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Augusto Boal]] define their [[epic theatre]] projects ([[Non-Aristotelian drama]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]] respectively) against models of [[tragedy]]. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation (2004, 193–209).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improvisation===
{{Main article|Improvisational theatre}}
Improvisation has been a consistent feature of theatre, with the Commedia dell'arte in the sixteenth century being recognised as the first improvisation form. Popularized by Nobel Prize Winner [[Dario Fo]] and troupes such as the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] improvisational theatre continues to evolve with many different streams and philosophies. [[Keith Johnstone]] and [[Viola Spolin]] are recognized as the first teachers of improvisation in modern times, with Johnstone exploring improvisation as an alternative to scripted theatre and Spolin and her successors exploring improvisation principally as a tool for developing dramatic work or skills or as a form for situational comedy. Spolin also became interested in how the process of learning improvisation was applicable to the development of human potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=194|title=The Purpose of Playing: Modern Acting Theories in Perspective|first=Robert|last=Gordon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmAue-VUMmYC&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=Viola%20Spolin%20purpose&amp;pg=PA194#v=onepage&amp;q=Viola%20Spolin%20purpose&amp;f=false|date=2006|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0472068876}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spolin's son, [[Paul Sills]] popularized improvisational theatre as a theatrical art form when he founded. as its first director, [[the Second City]] in [[Chicago]].

==Theories==
{{Main article|Dramatic theory}}
[[File:Kirmestheater1.JPG|thumb|Village feast with theatre performance circa 1600.]]
Having been an important part of human culture for more than 2,500 years, theatre has evolved a wide range of different [[Dramatic theory|theories]] and practices. Some are related to political or spiritual ideologies, while others are based purely on "artistic" concerns. Some processes focus on a story, some on theatre as event, and some on theatre as catalyst for social change. The [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]], in his seminal treatise, ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) is the earliest-surviving example and its arguments have influenced theories of theatre ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Dukore (1974, 31) and Janko (1987, ix).&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he offers an account of what he calls "poetry" (a term which in Greek literally means "making" and in this context includes [[drama]]—[[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[tragedy]], and the [[satyr play]]—as well as [[lyric poetry]], [[epic poetry]], and the [[dithyramb]]). He examines its "first principles" and identifies its [[genre]]s and basic elements; his analysis of [[tragedy]] constitutes the core of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Poetics'' 1447a13 (1987, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle argues that tragedy consists of six qualitative parts, which are (in order of importance) ''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'' or "plot", ''[[ethos]]'' or "character", ''[[dianoia]]'' or "thought", ''[[Lexis (Aristotle)|lexis]]'' or "diction", ''[[Melos (Aristotle)|melos]]'' or "song", and ''[[opsis]]'' or "spectacle".&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 19) and Janko (1987, xx, 7–10).&lt;/ref&gt; "Although Aristotle's ''Poetics'' is universally acknowledged in the [[Western culture|Western]] critical tradition", [[Marvin Carlson]] explains, "almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions."&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 16).&lt;/ref&gt; Important [[theatre practitioner]]s of the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]] include [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], [[Jacques Copeau]], [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Joan Littlewood]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [[Augusto Boal]], [[Eugenio Barba]], [[Dario Fo]], [[Viola Spolin]], [[Keith Johnstone]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)]].

Stanislavski treated the theatre as an [[The arts|art-form]] that is [[Medium specificity|autonomous]] from [[literature]] and one in which the [[playwright]]'s contribution should be respected as that of only one of an ensemble of creative artists.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 124, 202) and (2008b, 6), Carnicke (1998, 162), and Gauss (1999, 2). In 1902, Stanislavski wrote that "the author writes on paper. The actor writes with his body on the stage" and that the "score of an opera is not the opera itself and the script of a play is not drama until both are made flesh and blood on stage"; quoted by Benedetti (1999a, 124).&lt;/ref&gt; His innovative contribution to modern acting theory has remained at the core of mainstream [[Western culture|western]] performance training for much of the last century.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1032), Carnicke (1998, 1), Counsell (1996, 24–25), Gordon (2006, 37–40), and Leach (2004, 29).&lt;/ref&gt; That many of the precepts of his [[Stanislavski's system|system of actor training]] seem to be common sense and self-evident testifies to its hegemonic success.&lt;ref name="Counsell 1996, 25"&gt;Counsell (1996, 25).&lt;/ref&gt; Actors frequently employ his basic concepts without knowing they do so.&lt;ref name="Counsell 1996, 25"/&gt; Thanks to its promotion and elaboration by acting teachers who were former students and the many translations of his theoretical writings, Stanislavski's 'system' acquired an unprecedented ability to cross cultural boundaries and developed an international reach, dominating debates about acting in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1032), Carnicke (1998, 1, 167), Counsell (1996, 24), and Milling and Ley (2001, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Many actors routinely equate his 'system' with the North American [[Method acting|Method]], although the latter's exclusively psychological techniques contrast sharply with Stanislavski's multivariant, holistic and [[Psychophysiology|psychophysical]] approach, which explores character and action both from the 'inside out' and the 'outside in' and treats the actor's mind and body as parts of a continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (2005, 147–148) and Carnicke (1998, 1, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==
[[File:Vienna - Vienna Opera Backstage - 9729.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A theatre stage building]]
{{Main article|Stagecraft}}
Theatre presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref name="Pfister 1977, 11"/&gt; The production of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] usually involves contributions from a [[playwright]], [[theatre director|director]], a [[Cast member|cast]] of [[actor]]s, and a technical [[production team]] that includes a [[set designer|scenic or set designer]], [[lighting designer]], [[costume designer]], [[sound design]]er, [[Stage management|stage manager]], [[production manager]] and technical director. Depending on the production, this team may also include a [[composer]], [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]], [[video design]]er or [[fight director]].

Stagecraft is a generic term referring to the technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it relates primarily to the practical implementation of a designer's artistic vision.

In its most basic form, stagecraft is managed by a single person (often the stage manager of a smaller production) who arranges all scenery, costumes, lighting, and sound, and organizes the cast. At a more professional level, for example in modern Broadway houses, stagecraft is managed by hundreds of skilled carpenters, painters, electricians, stagehands, stitchers, wigmakers, and the like. This modern form of stagecraft is highly technical and specialized: it comprises many sub-disciplines and a vast trove of history and tradition. The majority of stagecraft lies between these two extremes. Regional theatres and larger community theatres will generally have a technical director and a complement of designers, each of whom has a direct hand in their respective designs.

==Sub-categories and organization==
There are many modern theatre movements which go about producing theatre in a variety of ways. Theatrical enterprises vary enormously in sophistication and purpose. People who are involved vary from novices and hobbyists (in community theatre) to professionals (in Broadway and similar productions). Theatre can be performed with a shoestring budget or on a grand scale with multimillion-dollar budgets. This diversity manifests in the abundance of theatre sub-categories, which include:
* [[Broadway theatre]] and [[West End theatre]]
* [[Community theatre]]
* [[Dinner theater]]
* [[Fringe theatre]]
* [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Off West End]]
* [[Off-Off-Broadway]]
* [[Regional theater in the United States|Regional theatre in the United States]]
* [[Summer stock theatre]]

===Repertory companies===
[[File:Cruikshank Pierce' Egan's Real Life - Drury Lane Theatre 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], London, circa 1821]]
While most modern theatre companies rehearse one piece of theatre at a time, perform that piece for a set "run", retire the piece, and begin rehearsing a new show, [[repertory]] companies rehearse multiple shows at one time. These companies are able to perform these various pieces upon request and often perform works for years before retiring them. Most dance companies operate on this repertory system. The [[Royal National Theatre]] in London performs on a repertory system.

Repertory theatre generally involves a group of similarly accomplished actors, and relies more on the reputation of the group than on an individual star actor. It also typically relies less on strict control by a director and less on adherence to theatrical conventions, since actors who have worked together in multiple productions can respond to each other without relying as much on convention or external direction.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson (1982.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Producing vs. presenting===
In order to put on a piece of theatre, both a theatre company and a [[theatre (structure)|theatre venue]] are needed. When a theatre company is the sole company in residence at a theatre venue, this theatre (and its corresponding theatre company) are called a resident theatre or a producing theatre, because the venue produces its own work. Other theatre companies, as well as dance companies, who do not have their own theatre venue, perform at rental theatres or at presenting theatres. Both rental and presenting theatres have no full-time resident companies. They do, however, sometimes have one or more part-time resident companies, in addition to other independent partner companies who arrange to use the space when available. A rental theatre allows the independent companies to seek out the space, while a presenting theatre seeks out the independent companies to support their work by presenting them on their stage.

Some performance groups perform in non-theatrical spaces. Such performances can take place outside or inside, in a non-traditional performance space, and include [[street theatre]], and [[site-specific theatre]]. Non-traditional venues can be used to create more immersive or meaningful environments for audiences. They can sometimes be modified more heavily than traditional theatre venues, or can accommodate different kinds of equipment, lighting and sets.&lt;ref&gt;Alice T. Carter, "[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_575857.html Non-traditional venues can inspire art, or just great performances] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903150133/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_575857.html |date=2010-09-03 }}", ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', 2008-07-07. Retrieved 2011-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[touring theatre|touring company]] is an independent theatre or dance company that travels, often internationally, being presented at a different theatre in each city.

===Unions===
There are many theatre unions including: [[Actors' Equity Association]] (for actors and stage managers), the [[Stage Directors and Choreographers Society]] (SDC), and the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE, for designers and technicians). Many theatres require that their staff be members of these organizations.

'''{{nihongo|Tokyo Kodomo Club|東京こどもクラブ|Tōkyō Kodomo Kurabu}}''', meaning '''Tokyo Children Club''', is an [[early childhood education]] program published in Japan in an audio-visual format, distributed monthly on a [[Gramophone record|record]]. The 7-inch record contained stories and songs, accompanied by a [[picture book]] that could be bound in a special folder. The early-childhood education program came in two courses: a 2-4 year old course and a 5-7 year old course. Each of the courses was designed to complete in 12 months. In addition on a quarterly basis, the Club sent out supplemental stories, songs and other music on a 12-inch record. The recitations on Side A were by {{nihongo|"Uncle Maeda"|前田武彦|Takehiko Maeda}}, and on Side B, {{nihongo|"Bin-chan"|楠トシエ|Toshie Kusunoki}}. The records were monaural recordings at 33-1/3 rpm. Presently, the recordings have gone out of print, making their procurement quite difficult.

==Programs==
The programs were designed to familiarize children with stories and songs from around the world, with emphasis on European orchestral works. Main story narration often featured Classical music as a background music in order to help set the tone of the story. The bullets found in the index to each lesson were color-coded: red for the main story, blue for the songs and yellow for the occasional extra story. In the original course series, the main stories and songs were bulleted with a star and the extra stories with a circle. However, in later course series, they switched their bullets to red circles, blue squares and yellow triangles, keeping the same color code as before.

===Sing in English Group===
The Tokyo Kodomo Club issued two courses of children’s songs in English for the Japanese audience in the '''{{nihongo|Sing in English Group|英語で歌う会|Ei-go de Utau Kai}}''' series. These songs were sung by Esther Ghan and her children. The '''{{nihongo|Let’s Sing English Songs|英語で歌いましょう|Ei-go de Utaimashō}}''' course was designed similarly to their Japanese courses, where the lesson units were distributed monthly on a record. Each of the courses was designed to complete in 12 months, with the course set spanning two years. For the older children, '''{{nihongo| Folk-album for All|みんなのフォーク・アルバム|Minna no Fōku-arubamu}}''' in a set of six lesson units and a Christmas supplement were provided. It also spanned over two years.

The "'''Town Musicians of Bremen'''" ({{lang-de|Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten}}) is a popular [[fairy tale]] retrieved and recorded by the [[Brothers Grimm]]. It was first published in [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] in 1819. It tells the story of four aging domestic animals, who after a lifetime of hard work are neglected and mistreated by their former masters. Eventually, they decide to run away and become town musicians in the city of [[Bremen]]. Contrary to the story's title the characters never arrive in [[Bremen]], as they succeed in tricking and scaring off a band of robbers, capturing their spoils, and moving into their house. According to the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]], the story qualifies as a ''Type 130'' folktale ("Outcast animals find a new home").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/brementown/other.html | title= Tales Similar To Bremen Town Musicians |author=  | date= | publisher=SurLaLune Fairy Tales| accessdate=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the story, a [[donkey]], a [[dog]], a [[cat]], and a [[rooster]] (or hen), all past their prime years in life and usefulness on their respective farms, were soon to be discarded or mistreated by their masters. One by one, they leave their homes and set out together. They decide to go to [[Bremen]], known for its freedom, to live without owners and become musicians there ("Something better than death we can find anywhere").

On the way to Bremen, they see a lighted cottage; they look inside and see four robbers enjoying their ill-gotten gains. Standing on each other's backs, they decide to scare the robbers away by making a din; the men run for their lives, not knowing what the strange sound is. The animals take possession of the house, eat a good meal, and settle in for the evening.

Later that night, the robbers return and send one of their members in to investigate. He sees the Cat's eyes shining in the darkness and the robber thinks he is seeing the coals of the fire. He reaches over to light his candle. Things happen in quick succession; the Cat scratches his face with her claws, the Dog bites him on the leg, the Donkey kicks him with his hooves, and the Rooster crows and chases him out the door, screaming. He tells his companions that he was beset by a horrible [[Witchcraft|witch]] who scratched him with her long fingernails (the Cat), an man with a knife (the Dog), a black [[monster]] who had hit him with a club (the Donkey), and worst of all, the [[judge]] who screamed from the rooftop (the Rooster). The robbers abandon the cottage to the strange creatures who have taken it, where the animals live happily for the rest of their days.

In the original version of this story, which dates from the twelfth century, the robbers are a bear, lion, and wolf, all animals featured in heraldric devices. When the donkey and his friends arrive in Bremen, the townsfolk applaud them for having rid the district of the terrible beasts. An alternate version involves the animals' master(s) being deprived of his livelihood (because the thieves stole his money and/or destroyed his farm or mill) and having to send his animals away, unable to take care of them any further. After the animals dispatch the thieves, they take the ill-gotten gains back to their master so he can rebuild. Other versions involve at least one wild, non-livestock animal, such as a [[lizard]], helping the domestic animals out in dispatching the thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://germanstories.vcu.edu/grimm/bremer_dual.html | title= Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten / Bremen Town Musicians |author=  | date= | publisher=German stories| accessdate=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural legacy==
The tale has been retold through [[Animation|animated pictures]], [[motion pictures]] (often [[musical film|musicals]]), theatre plays and operas.

===Screen and stage adaptations===
[[File:Bremenskie muzykanty.jpg|thumb|''[[Town Musicians of Bremen (film)|Town Musicians of Bremen]]'', 1969 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] animated film]]
* German-U.S. composer [[Richard Mohaupt]] created the opera ''Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten'', which premiered in Bremen 1949.
* The tale was adapted in humorous fashion for the British children's series ''[[Wolves, Witches and Giants]]'' narrated by [[Spike Milligan]], but with the action taking place in 'Brum' (short for [[Birmingham]]) rather than Bremen.
* In the Soviet Union, the story was loosely adapted into an animated musical in 1969 by Yuri Entin and [[Vasily Livanov]] at the studio [[Soyuzmultfilm]], ''[[The Bremen Town Musicians (film)|The Bremen Town Musicians]]''. It was followed by a sequel called ''On the Trail of the Town Musicians of Bremen''. In 2000, a second 56-minute sequel was made, called ''The New Bremen Musicians'' ({{lang|ru|Но́вые бре́менские}}, Novyye bremenskiye).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&amp;p=show_film&amp;fid=5903 The New Bremen Musicians], Animator.ru&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1976, in Italy, [[Sergio Bardotti]] and [[Luis Enríquez Bacalov]] adapted the story into a musical play called ''I Musicanti'', which two years later was translated into Portuguese by the Brazilian composer [[Chico Buarque]]. The musical play was called ''Os Saltimbancos'', was later released as an album, and became one of the greatest classics for children in Brazil. This version was also made into a movie.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138073/&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spain]], the story was made into an animated feature film, ''[[Los Trotamúsicos]]'' in 1989, directed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Cruz Delgado|es}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096742/ |title=Los 4 músicos de Bremen (1989) |publisher=IMDb |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in itself inspired the Spanish animated series ''[[Los Trotamúsicos]]''. The series follows the story of four animal friends: ''Koki'' the rooster, ''Lupo'' the dog, ''Burlón'' the cat and ''Tonto'' the donkey; who form a band in the playing respectively guitar, drums, trumpet and saxophone. Unlike in the original story, they arrive to Bremen, before going back to live in the robbers' house.
* In 1972, [[Jim Henson]] produced a version with his [[Muppets]] called ''[[The Muppet Musicians of Bremen]]''.
* In 1981 in Japan, Tezuka Productions made loose science fiction themed animated feature film adaptation titled Bremen 4: Angels in Hell (ブレーメン４ 地獄の中の天使たち/Bremen 4: Jigoku no Naka no Tenshi-tachi)revolving around an Alien visiting Earth, during a military invasion of a fictional Bremen and giving the 4 animals based on the ones from the original tale, a device that can transform them in to humans. Despite being aimed at children the film has a substantial amount of gun violence and depictions of war crimes but its core theme is Anti-war.
* In Germany and the United States, the story was adapted into an animated feature in 1997 under the title ''[[The Fearless Four (film)|The Fearless Four]]'' (''[[:de:Die furchtlosen Vier|Die furchtlosen Vier]]''), though it varied considerably from the source material; while the general plot is the same, the four arrive in Bremen and help to free it from the grasp of the corrupt corporation Mix Max, along with rescuing animals that the company plans to turn into sausage. It starred R&amp;B singer [[James Ingram]] as Buster the dog, guitarist [[B.B. King]] as Fred the donkey, singer and pianist [[Oleta Adams]] as Gwendolyn the cat and Italian musician [[Zucchero Fornaciari]] as Tortellini the Rooster in the original English version. 
* On [[Cartoon Network]] in between cartoon breaks during the ''Out of Tune Toons'' marathon and on Cartoonetwork Video, there are cartoon shorts (called "Wedgies") of an animal garage band based on the tale called ''The Bremen Avenue Experience'' featuring a cat (Jessica), dog (Simon), donkey (Barret) and rooster (Tanner). They are either a modern adaptation of ''Town Musicians of Bremen'' or descendants of the old musicians of Bremen.
* The [[HBO Family]] animated series, ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', adapted this story in Season 3 and did a country/African-American twist on it featuring [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Hazel (the dog), [[Gladys Knight]] as Chocolate (the donkey), [[Dionne Warwick]] as Miss Kitty (the cat), and [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as Scratchmo (the rooster).

===Literature===
* [[Richard Scarry]] wrote an adaptation of the story in his book ''Richard Scarry's Animal Nursery Tales'' in 1975. In it, the donkey, dog, cat and rooster set out since they are bored with farming.
* In the visual novel ''Morenatsu'', the dog character Kouya is part of a rock band with three other performers: who are a cat, a bird, and a horse. The protagonist makes note of the resemblance to the Town Musicians of Bremen, with a brief monologue explaining the fairy tale.
* The fourth volume of the comic album series ''[[Blacksad]]'' a mystery unfolds in New Orleans around the remaining members of a defunct musical group formerly composed of a dog, a cat, a rooster, and a donkey, all of whom had migrated to the city from their home on a Southern island.

===Music===
* In the early 20th century, the American folk/swing/children's musician [[Frank Luther]] popularized the musical tale as the ''Raggletaggletown Singers'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://mej.sagepub.com/cgi/content/citation/38/5/48 Sing Alone and like It Music], Charles L. Gary, Educators Journal April/May 1952 38: 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; presented in children's school music books and performed in children's plays.
* In 2015, Japanese rock musician [[Kenshi Yonezu]] released his third album titled ''Bremen'', with the sixth track "Will-O-Wisp"'s lyrics being centred on the Town Musicians of Bremen.
* In 2012, American artists PigPen Theatre Co. released their debut album titled ''Bremen'', with the fifth track "Bremen"'s lyrics telling the story of the Town Musicians of Bremen.
* ''The Musicians of Bremen'' (1972), based on the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tale, the "Town Musicians of Bremen", for male voices: two [[Countertenor|countertenors]], tenor, two baritones and bass; premiered by [[King's Singers|The King's Singers]] in Sydney on 15 May 1972.

* Statues modeled after the Town Musicians of Bremen statue now reside in front of each of the five [[List of schools of veterinary medicine#Germany|German veterinary schools]]. 
* A [[persiflage]] of this tale can be found on the wall in the Fort Napoleon, [[Ostend]], Belgium. Heinrich-Otto Pieper, a German soldier during World War I, painted the German and the Austro-Hungarian eagles throned on a rock, under the light of a Turkish crescent. They look with contempt on the futile efforts of the Town Musicians of Bremen to chase them away. These animals are symbols for the Allied Forces: on top the French cock, standing on the Japanese jackal, standing on the English bulldog, standing on the Russian bear. Italy is depicted as a twisting snake and Belgium a tricolored [[beetle]].

'''Wladimir Davidovich Baranoff-Rossine''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Давидович Баранов-Россине}}) (1888–1944) was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Russia]]n and [[France|French]] painter of Jewish origin, [[avant-garde]] artist ([[Cubo-Futurism]]), and inventor.

==Biography==

Wladimir Baranoff-Rossine was born in [[Kherson]], [[Russian Empire]] (present day [[Ukraine]]) under the name '''Shulim Wolf Leib Baranov'''.

In 1902 he studied at the School of the [[Society for the Furthering of the Arts]] in [[St. Petersburg]]. From 1903 to 1907 he attended the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in St. Petersburg.

In 1908 he exhibited with the group [[Zveno (art)|Zveno]] (The Link) in [[Kiev]] organized by the artist [[David Burliuk]] and his brother [[Wladimir Burliuk]].

In 1910 he moved to [[Paris]], where until 1914 he was a resident in the artist's colony [[La Ruche]] together with [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Sonia Delaunay-Terk]], [[Nathan Altman]] and others. He exhibited regularly in Paris after 1911.

He returned to Russia in 1914. In 1916 he had a solo exhibition in [[Oslo]]. In 1918 he had exhibits with the union of artists ''[[Mir Iskusstva]]'' (World of Art) in [[Petrograd]] (St.Petersburg). In the same year he had an exhibition with the group ''Jewish Society for the Furthering of the Arts'' in Moscow, together with [[Nathan Altman]], [[El Lissitzky]] and [[David Shterenberg]]. He participated at the ''First State Free Art Exhibition'' in Petrograd in 1919.

In 1922 Baranoff-Rossine was the teacher at the Higher Artistic-Technical Workshops ([[VKhUTEMAS]]) in Moscow.

In 1924 he had the first presentation of his [[optophonic piano]] during a performance at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow - a [[synaesthesia|synaesthetic instrument]] that was capable of creating sounds and coloured lights, patterns and textures simultaneously.

In 1925 he emigrated to [[France]].

Continuously experimenting, Baranoff-Rossine applied the art of colour to military art with the technique of camouflage or the Cameleon process and this was marketed with [[Robert Delaunay]]. Baranov-Rossine is credited as an author of [[pointillist]] or [[Motion camouflage|dynamic military camouflage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfact.com/auction-lot/vladimir-davidovich-baranov-rossine,-1888-1944-,-1-c-0wjcri1u03 Lot 228: Wladimir Davidovich Baranoff-Rossiné, 1888-1944 , The Church oil on canvas - Sotheby's], artfact.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iencheres.com/art/wbr/index.cfm/museum/index.cfm?ChoiceLang=English Wladimir Baranoff-Rossiné | The Russian Avantgarde], iencheres.com&lt;/ref&gt; He also invented a "photochromometer" that allowed the determination of the qualities of precious stones. In another field, he perfected a machine that made, sterlized and distributed fizzy drinks, the "Multiperco", and this received several technical awards at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baranoff-rossine.com/museum/biography/ Baranoff-Rossiné biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the German occupation Baranoff-Rossine was deported to a [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[concentration camp]] and murdered there by the Nazis.

'''''ZeniMax v. Oculus''''' is a civil lawsuit filed by [[ZeniMax Media]] against [[Oculus VR]] on charges of theft of [[intellectual property]] relating to Oculus' [[virtual reality]] device, the [[Oculus Rift]].

==Background==
The [[Oculus Rift]] is a [[virtual reality]] headset that was developed by [[Oculus VR]]. The company was founded by [[Palmer Luckey]], who had a keen interest in [[head-mounted display]]s and had developed a prototype of the Oculus Rift by 2012. Concurrently, [[John Carmack]], at the time of [[id Software]], a subsidiary under [[ZeniMax Media]], also was interested in head-mounted displays, saw Luckey's prototype for the Rift and modified it, showcasing the updated prototype at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012]] (E3) that June using a modified version of id's ''[[Doom 3]]''.

Following E3 2012, Oculus VR launched a [[Kickstarter]] to fund further development of the Rift, ultimately raising more than $2.4 million through it, one of the largest crowdfunding ventures at that time. The attention led to additional [[venture funding]], with more than $91 million invested by 2013. During this, Carmack left id Software to become the Chief Technology Officer for Oculus VR. In March 2014, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] announced that [[Facebook]] had acquired Oculus VR for $2 billion.

[[File:Oculus_Rift_-_Developer_Version_-_Back_and_Control_Box.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Oculus Rift]] "Development Kit 1" headset, developed from the 2013 Kickstarter funding]]
Around May 2014, shortly after Facebook made its deal to acquire Oculus VR, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that ZeniMax had sent two letters to Facebook and Oculus VR, asserting that any technology contributions Carmack had made towards VR while he was still an employee of id Software, including the "VR testbed" that Carmack had frequently demonstrated, were within the [[intellectual property]] (IP) of id and ZeniMax.&lt;ref name="wsj letters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303948104579534013624548846 |title=Oculus, Facebook Face Challenge to Rights Over 'Rift'|first1=Liz|last1=Hoffman|first2=Reed|last2=Albergotti|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, ZeniMax said that they "provided necessary VR technology and other valuable assistance to Palmer Luckey and other Oculus employees in 2012 and 2013 to make the Oculus Rift a viable VR product, superior to other VR market offerings."&lt;ref name="verge-zeniconflict"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5671620/oculus-and-facebook-face-legal-challenge|title=Oculus and Facebook face legal challenge from John Carmack's former employer|first=Sean|last=Hollister|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZeniMax stated that a 2012 [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA) and a non-ownership agreement that covered VR technology and signed by Luckey, prior to Oculus VR's formation, would cover any of Carmack's contributions to VR.&lt;ref name=verge-onedocument&gt;{{cite web|title=One document could decide whether Oculus owes ZeniMax millions|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5672928/this-document-could-decide-whether-oculus-owes-zenimax-millions|first=Sean|last=Hollister|work=[[The Verge]]|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZeniMax contends that they had attempted to resolve these issues with Oculus prior to their acquisition by Facebook "whereby ZeniMax would be compensated for its intellectual property through equity ownership in Oculus but were unable to reach a satisfactory resolution".&lt;ref name="verge-zeniconflict"/&gt; Oculus denied the claims, stating that "It's unfortunate, but when there's this type of transaction, people come out of the woodwork with ridiculous and absurd claims".&lt;ref name="wsj letters"/&gt;

ZeniMax formally filed a lawsuit against Luckey and Oculus VR on May 21, 2014 in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] and seeking a jury trial. The lawsuit contended that Luckey and Oculus used ZeniMax's "trade secrets, copyrighted computer code, and technical know-how relating to virtual reality technology", as provided by Carmack, to develop the Oculus Rift product, and sought for financial damages for contract breach, copyright infringement, and unfair competition. ZeniMax also charged that Oculus, through Carmack, were able to hire several former ZeniMax/id Software employees who also had technical knowledge of its VR technology, which would allow them to rapidly fine-tune the VR testbed system to create the Rift.&lt;ref name="engadget suit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/05/21/oculus-vr-lawsuit|title=Oculus VR and Palmer Luckey being sued by CTO's former employer|first=Ben|last=Gilbert|date=May 21, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/21/5739086/oculus-vr-and-its-founder-sued-by-zenimax-and-id-software|title=Oculus VR and its founder sued by ZeniMax and id Software|first=Josh|last=Lowensohn|date=May 21, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its files, ZeniMax revealed it has "invested tens of millions of dollars in research and development" into VR technology, and that because they felt "Oculus and Luckey lacked the necessary expertise and technical know-how to create a viable virtual reality headset", they "sought expertise and know-how from Zenimax".&lt;ref name="engadget suit"/&gt;

Oculus initially responded to the charges as "The lawsuit filed by ZeniMax has no merit whatsoever. As we have previously said, ZeniMax did not contribute to any Oculus technology. Oculus will defend these claims vigorously."&lt;ref name="engadget suit"/&gt; The company filed its formal response on June 25, 2014, stating that ZeniMax "falsely claims ownership in Oculus VR technology in a transparent attempt to take advantage of the Oculus VR sale to Facebook".&lt;ref name="polygon reply"/&gt; Oculus stated that prior to the acquisition by Facebook, "ZeniMax never raised any claim of infringement against Oculus VR, undoubtedly because ZeniMax never has contributed any intellectual property or technology to Oculus VR".&lt;ref name="polygon reply"/&gt;

The response stated that ZeniMax's filing "deliberately misstating some facts and omitting others" and that "there is not a line of ZeniMax code or any of its technology in any Oculus VR product".&lt;ref name="polygon reply"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sarkar|first1=Samit|title=Oculus: ZeniMax suit is a 'transparent attempt to take advantage' of Facebook acquisition|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/25/5841764/oculus-zenimax-lawsuit-response}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oculus' response included photographs and documents that demonstrated they had been working on their own VR technology as early as August 2010. The response further contended that the key document of ZeniMax's suit, the NDA signed by Luckey, was "never finalized", and thus is not a "valid and enforceable agreement".&lt;ref name="polygon reply"/&gt;

ZeniMax amended the case to include Facebook among the defendants on August 29, 2014. ZeniMax charged that Facebook intended to "leverage and commercially exploit Oculus’s virtual reality technology — which is built upon ZeniMax’s unlawfully misappropriated intellectual property — for the financial benefit of Facebook’s core business of online social networking and advertising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2014/08/zenimax-adds-facebook-to-its-suit-against-oculus.html|title=Zenimax adds Facebook to its suit against Oculus, expands allegations against social network|first=Bill|last=Flook|date=August 29, 2014|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[Washington Business Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oculus and Facebook attempted to have the case dismissed, but the presiding judge disagreed, and, in August 2015, allowed the case to proceed to a jury trial expected to start in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/10/game-publishers-lawsuit-against-oculus-moves-forward/?_r=0|title=Game Publisher's Lawsuit Against Oculus Moves Forward|first=Nick|last=Winfield|date=August 10, 2015|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==District Court trial==
During the [[discovery (law)|discovery phase]], ZeniMax had sought a [[deposition (law)|deposition]] from Zuckerberg, believing he had "unique knowledge" of the Facebook-Oculus deal. At request from Facebook, the judge ruled that Zuckerberg must provide a deposition, but only after lesser-ranking employees had been deposed as to have a "less intrusive discovery" process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3013144/legal/facebooks-zuckerberg-ordered-to-testify-over-oculus-purchase.html|title=Facebook's Zuckerberg ordered to testify over Oculus purchase|first=John|last=Ribeiro|date=December 9, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=[[PC World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, it was discovered that ZeniMax had further modified their complaint, specifically adding by name Carmack as Oculus's CTO, and [[Brendan Iribe]] as Oculus' CEO. The updated complaint alleged that during his last days at id Software, Carmack "copied thousands of documents from a computer at ZeniMax to a USB storage device", and later after his employment was terminated he "returned to ZeniMax's premises to take a customized tool for developing VR Technology belonging to ZeniMax that itself is part of ZeniMax's VR technology".&lt;ref name="gamespot amended 2016"/&gt; ZeniMax's complaint charged that Iribe had directed Oculus to "[disseminate] to the press the false and fanciful story that Luckey was the brilliant inventor of VR technology who had developed that technology in his parents' garage", when "Luckey lacked the training, expertise, resources, or know-how to create commercially viable VR technology", thus aiding in the IP theft from ZeniMax.&lt;ref name="gamespot amended 2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/zenimax-bashes-palmer-luckey-claims-oculus-lied-ab/1100-6442895|title=ZeniMax Bashes Palmer Luckey, Claims Oculus Lied About His Accomplishments|first=Alex|last=Newhouse|date=August 22, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work= [[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the updated complaint asserts Facebook had more involvement as it knew or had reason to know that Oculus' claims on the VR IP was false. Oculus responded, "This complaint filed by ZeniMax is one-sided and conveys only ZeniMax's interpretation of the story.&lt;ref name="gamespot amended 2016"/&gt; The court had a computer forensic expert evaluate the contents of Carmack's computer, and on October 28, 2016, the expert reported that from their findings "statements and representations that have been sworn to and are before the court are factually inaccurate".&lt;ref name="polygon oct2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/10/28/13462260/oculus-zenimax-lawsuit-expert|title=Carmack hard drive contains proof of factual inaccuracies in Oculus lawsuit, expert says|first=Brian|last=Crecente|date=October 28, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ordered Oculus to comply with providing previously-redacted communications it had with Carmack as a result, as well as requesting [[Samsung]] to provide information on its [[Samsung Gear VR]] which was co-created with Oculus.&lt;ref name="polygon oct2016"/&gt;

===Decision===
The jury trial completed on February 2, 2017, with the jury finding that Luckey had violated the NDA he had with ZeniMax, and awarding $500 million to ZeniMax.&lt;ref name='jury_result'&gt;{{cite news|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=Oculus, execs liable for $500 million in ZeniMax VR trial|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/oculus-execs-liable-for-500-million-in-zenimax-vr-trial/|accessdate=1 February 2017|publisher=Ars Technica|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='jury_form'&gt;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/occverdict-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, the jury found that Oculus, Facebook, Luckey, Iribe, and Carmack did not misappropriate or steal trade secrets,&lt;ref name='jury_result'/&gt;&lt;ref name='jury_form'/&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon 500m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/1/14474198/oculus-lawsuit-verdict|title=Oculus lawsuit ends with half billion dollar judgment awarded to ZeniMax|first1=Timothy|last1=Poon|first2=Brain|last2=Crecente|date=February 1, 2017|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though ZeniMax continued to publicly assert otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2017/02/02/zenimax-may-seek-an-injunction-to-halt-oculus-rift-sales-in-wake-of-broken-nda-verdict-details-evidence-of-oculuss-alleged-theft|title=ZeniMax may seek an injunction to halt Oculus Rift sales in wake of broken NDA verdict, details evidence of Oculus's alleged theft|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[VG247]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oculus will have to pay $200 million for breaking the non-disclosure agreement, and additional $50 million for copyright infringement; for [[false designation of origin]] charges, Oculus and Luckey will have to pay $50 million each, while Iribe will be responsible for $150 million.&lt;ref name="polygon 500m" /&gt;

==Appeals and additional actions==
While Oculus said "the jury found decisively in our favor" over the issue of trade secrets,&lt;ref name="polygon 500m"/&gt; the company plans to file an appeal on the other charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/01/technology/zenimax-oculus-lawsuit-500-million|title=Facebook loses $500 million Oculus lawsuit|first=Selena|last=Larson|date=February 1, 2017|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmack stated that he disagreed with the decision, particularly on ZeniMax's "characterization, misdirection, and selective omissions" regarding his behavior, adding that he had accounted for all the data in his possession.&lt;ref name="carmack response"/&gt; Carmack took issue with one of ZeniMax's expert witnesses who testified that non-literal copying, the act of creating a program with similar functions but using different computer code, constitutes a copyright violation.&lt;ref name="carmack response"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/290678/Zenimax_vs_Oculus_Carmack_denies_allegations_slams_expert_analysis.php|title=Zenimax vs. Oculus: Carmack denies allegations, slams expert analysis|first=Chris|last=Kerr|date=February 1, 2017|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZeniMax stated that it is considering a court-ordered halt to all Oculus Rift units in light of the jury decision;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/1/14478258/zenimax-oculus-injunction|title=ZeniMax may seek court order to halt sale of current Oculus Rift headsets|first=Brian|last=Crecente|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on February 24, 2017, filed an injunction to have the court halt sales of the Oculus Rift and development kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/zenimax-files-injunction-against-oculus-over-use-o/1100-6448175|title=ZeniMax Files Injunction Against Oculus Over Use Of 'Stolen Tech'|first=Oscar|last=Dayus|date=February 24, 2017|accessdate=March 10, 2017|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral arguments for these injunctions were held on June 19, 2017. ZeniMax argued that either Oculus should halt sales of the Rift, or otherwise receive 20% of all Rift sales over the next ten years. Oculus, in addition to its own filings towards a new trial, requested the judge throw out the jury verdict, or reduced the penalty to $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/300362/After_winning_500M_in_lawsuit_against_Oculus_ZeniMax_pushes_for_more.php | title = After winning $500M in lawsuit against Oculus, ZeniMax pushes for more | first = Alex | last = Wawro | date = June 21, 2017 | accessdate = June 22, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, the judge overseeing the case agreed to cut the damages owed by Oculus in half to {{USD|250 million}} (with an additional {{USD|54 million}} in interest), while denying Zenimax their request to halt Oculus sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/facebook-oculus-virtual-reality-stolen-tech-damages-are-halved | title = Facebook Payout in Oculus Copyright Spat Cut to $250 Million | first=  Tom  |last = Korosec | date = June 27, 2018 | accessdate = June 28, 2018 | work = [[Bloomberg L.P.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other lawsuits==
In a separate lawsuit filed in March 2017, Carmack asserted that ZeniMax did not complete its payment to him of the acquisition of id Software, and asked the court to find for him for the remaining $22 million he states the company owes him. ZeniMax's lawyers asserted that from the Oculus case, they had not been found in violation of Carmack's employment after ZeniMax acquired id Software and that this new suit was "without merit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/business/technology/2017/03/09/legal-feud-over-facebook-owned-oculus-has-another-dallas-chapter|title=Legal feud over Facebook-owned Oculus has another Dallas chapter|first=Melissa|last=Repco|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate=March 10, 2017|work=[[Dallas News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2018, Carmack stated that he and ZeniMax reached an agreement and that "Zenimax has fully satisfied their obligations to me", and this lawsuit was subsequently dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/12/john-carmack-zenimax-lawsuits/ | title = 'Doom' co-creator John Carmack ends legal fight with ZeniMax | first = Daniel | last = Cooper | date = October 12, 2018 | accessdate = October 12, 2018 | work = [[Engadget]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, ZeniMax filed a new lawsuit towards Samsung over the Gear VR. In addition to the previous legal decision over IP issues related to the Oculus technology used in the Gear VR, ZeniMax also contends in the new suit that Carmack had allowed Matt Hooper, who had been recently fired as a creative director from id, into id's facilities after hours without permission to work out an "attack plan" for developing mobile VR, which would ultimately lead to the Gear VR device. ZeniMax seeks punitive damages as well as a share of profits from Gear VR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/15/15643252/zenimax-samsung-lawsuit | title = ZeniMax: Samsung’s Gear VR tech conceived at id | first = Brian | last=  Crecente | date = May 15, 2017 | accessdate =  May 16, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
