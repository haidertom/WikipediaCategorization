[[File:BOD test bottles (biological oxygen demand) (3231600029).jpg|thumb|BOD test bottles at the laboratory of a [[wastewater treatment]] plant.]]
'''Biochemical Oxygen Demand''' ('''BOD''', also called '''Biological Oxygen Demand''') is the amount of [[Oxygenation (environmental)|dissolved oxygen]] needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.  The BOD value is most commonly expressed in milligrams of oxygen consumed per litre of sample during 5 days of incubation at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and is often used as a surrogate of the degree of [[Organic compound|organic]] [[pollution of water]].&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Clair N. Sawyer |author2=Perry L. McCarty |author3=Gene F. Parkin | title=Chemistry for Environmental Engineering and Science | edition=5th | location=New York | year=2003 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | isbn=0-07-248066-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BOD can be used as a gauge of the effectiveness of [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plants. It is listed as a [[conventional pollutant]] in the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act, sec. 304(a)(4), {{USCSub|33|1314|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

BOD is similar in function to [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD), in that both measure the amount of [[organic compound]]s in water. However, COD is less specific, since it measures everything that can be chemically oxidized, rather than just levels of biodegradable organic matter.

==Background==
Most natural waters contain small quantities of [[organic compound]]s.  Aquatic [[microorganisms]] have evolved to use some of these compounds as [[food]].  Microorganisms living in oxygenated waters use dissolved oxygen to oxidatively degrade the organic compounds, releasing [[energy]] which is used for [[Bacterial growth|growth]] and [[reproduction]].  Populations of these microorganisms tend to increase in proportion to the amount of food available.  This microbial [[metabolism]] creates an oxygen demand proportional to the amount of organic compounds useful as food.  Under some circumstances, microbial metabolism can consume dissolved oxygen faster than atmospheric oxygen can dissolve into the water or the autotrophic community (algae, cyanobacteria and macrophytes) can produce.  Fish and aquatic insects may die when oxygen is depleted by microbial metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Charles R. &amp; Horne, Alexander J. ''Limnology'' (1983) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-023651-8}} pp.88&amp;267&lt;/ref&gt;

Biochemical oxygen demand is the amount of oxygen required for microbial metabolism of organic compounds in water.  This demand occurs over some variable period of time depending on temperature, [[nutrient]] concentrations, and the [[enzyme]]s available to indigenous microbial populations.  The amount of oxygen required to completely oxidize the organic compounds to carbon dioxide and water through generations of microbial growth, death, decay, and cannibalism is total biochemical oxygen demand (total BOD).  Total BOD is of more significance to [[food web]]s than to [[water quality]].  Dissolved oxygen depletion is most likely to become evident during the initial aquatic microbial population explosion in response to a large amount of organic material.  If the microbial population deoxygenates the water, however, that lack of oxygen imposes a limit on population growth of [[aerobic respiration|aerobic]] aquatic microbial organisms resulting in a longer term food surplus and oxygen deficit.&lt;ref name="reid"&gt;Reid, George K. ''Ecology of Inland Waters and Estuaries'' (1961) Van Nostrand Reinhold pp.&amp;nbsp;317–320&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard temperature at which BOD testing should be carried out was first proposed by the [[Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal]] in its eighth report in 1912:
&lt;blockquote&gt;" (c) An effluent in order to comply with the general standard must not contain as discharged more than 3 parts per 100,000 of suspended matter, and with its suspended matters included must not take up at 65°F   more than 2.0 parts per 100,000 of dissolved oxygen in 5 days. This general standard  should be prescribed either by Statute or by order of the Central Authority, and should be subject to modifications by that Authority after an interval of not less than ten years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This was later standardised at 68&amp;nbsp;°F and then 20&amp;nbsp;°C.  This temperature may be significantly different from the temperature of the natural environment of the water being tested.

Although the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal proposed 5 days as an adequate test period for rivers of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], longer periods were investigated for [[North America]]n rivers.  Incubation periods of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 days were being used into the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, John F. ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage'' 9th Ed. (1946) American Public Health Association p.139&lt;/ref&gt;  Keeping dissolved oxygen available at their chosen temperature, investigators found up to 99 percent of total BOD was exerted within 20 days, 90 percent within 10 days, and approximately 68 percent within 5 days.&lt;ref&gt;Urquhart, Leonard Church ''Civil Engineering Handbook'' 4th Ed. (1959) McGraw-Hill p.&amp;nbsp;9–40&lt;/ref&gt;  Variable microbial population shifts to [[nitrifying bacteria]] limit test [[reproducibility]] for periods greater than 5 days.  The 5-day test protocol with acceptably reproducible results emphasizing carbonaceous BOD has been endorsed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  This 5-day BOD test result may be described as the amount of oxygen required for aquatic microorganisms to stabilize decomposable organic matter under aerobic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Clair N. &amp; McCarty, Perry L. ''Chemistry for Sanitary Engineers'' 2nd Ed. (1967) McGraw-Hill pp.&amp;nbsp;394–399&lt;/ref&gt;  Stabilization, in this context, may be perceived in general terms as the conversion of food to living aquatic [[fauna]].  Although these fauna will continue to exert biochemical oxygen demand as they die, that tends to occur within a more stable evolved [[ecosystem]] including higher [[trophic level]]s.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt;

=== Typical values ===
Most pristine rivers will have a 5-day carbonaceous BOD below 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L. Moderately [[pollution|polluted]] rivers may have a BOD value in the range of 2 to 8&amp;nbsp;mg/L. Rivers may be considered severely polluted when BOD values exceed 8&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Connor |first=Richard |authorlink = |title =The United Nations World Water Development Report 2016: Water and Jobs, chapter 2: The Global Perspective on Water |publisher =UNESCO |volume = |edition = |date =2016 |location =Paris |page =26 |isbn =978-92-3-100155-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal [[sewage]] that is efficiently treated by a [[sewage treatment|three-stage process]] would have a value of about 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L or less. Untreated sewage varies, but averages around 600&amp;nbsp;mg/L in [[Europe]] and as low as 200&amp;nbsp;mg/L in the U.S., or where there is severe [[groundwater]] or [[surface water]] [[Infiltration/Inflow]]. The generally lower values in the U.S. derive from the much greater water use per capita than in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Sawyer" /&gt;

== Methods ==
There are two commonly recognized methods for the measurement of BOD.

=== Dilution method ===
This standard method is recognized by U.S. [[EPA]], which is labeled Method 5210B in the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater&lt;ref&gt;Lenore S. Clesceri, Andrew D. Eaton, Eugene W. Rice (2005). Standard Methods for Examination of Water &amp; Wastewater Method 5210B. Washington, DC: American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association, and the Water Environment Association. http://www.standardmethods.org .&lt;/ref&gt;  
In order to obtain BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in a sample must be measured before and after the incubation period, and appropriately adjusted by the sample corresponding dilution factor. This analysis is performed using 300 ml incubation bottles in which [[buffered dilution water]] is dosed with seed microorganisms and stored for 5 days in the dark room at 20&amp;nbsp;°C to prevent DO production via photosynthesis. In addition to the various dilutions of BOD samples, this procedure requires dilution water blanks, [[glucose glutamic acid]] (GGA) controls, and seed controls. The dilution water blank is used to confirm the quality of the dilution water that is used to dilute the other samples. This is necessary because impurities in the dilution water may cause significant alterations in the results. The GGA control is a standardized solution to determine the quality of the seed, where its recommended BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 198&amp;nbsp;mg/l ± 30.5&amp;nbsp;mg/l.
For measurement of '''carbonaceous BOD''' (cBOD), a nitrification inhibitor is added after the dilution water has been added to the sample. The inhibitor hinders the [[oxidation]] of ammonia nitrogen, which supplies the nitrogenous BOD (nBOD). When performing the BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test, it is conventional practice to measure only cBOD because nitrogenous demand does not reflect the oxygen demand from organic matter.  This is because nBOD is generated by the breakdown of proteins, whereas cBOD is produced by the breakdown of organic molecules.

BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated by:
*Unseeded:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BOD}_5 = \frac{(D_0 - D_5)}{P}&lt;/math&gt;
*Seeded:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BOD}_5 = \frac{(D_0 - D_5) - (B_0 - B_5)f}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt; D_0&lt;/math&gt; is the dissolved oxygen (DO) of the diluted solution after preparation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; D_5&lt;/math&gt; is the DO of the diluted solution after 5 day incubation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; P&lt;/math&gt; is the decimal dilution factor
:&lt;math&gt; B_0&lt;/math&gt; is the DO of diluted seed sample after preparation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; B_5&lt;/math&gt; is the DO of diluted seed sample after 5 day incubation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of seed volume in dilution solution to seed volume in BOD test on seed

=== Manometric method ===
This method is limited to the measurement of the oxygen consumption due only to carbonaceous oxidation. [[Ammonia]] oxidation is inhibited.

The sample is kept in a sealed container fitted with a [[pressure sensor]]. A substance that absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] (typically [[lithium hydroxide]]) is added in the container above the sample level. The sample is stored in conditions identical to the dilution method. Oxygen is consumed and, as ammonia oxidation is inhibited, carbon dioxide is released. The total amount of gas, and thus the pressure, decreases because carbon dioxide is absorbed. From the drop of pressure, the sensor electronics computes and displays the consumed quantity of oxygen.

The main advantages of this method compared to the dilution method are:
* simplicity: no dilution of sample required, no seeding, no blank sample.
* direct reading of BOD value.
* continuous display of BOD value at the current incubation time.

== Alternative methods ==

=== Biosensor ===
An alternative to measure BOD is the development of biosensors, which are devices for the detection of an analyte that combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector component. Enzymes are the most widely used biological sensing elements in the fabrication of biosensors. Their application in biosensor construction is limited by the tedious, time consuming and costly enzyme purification methods. Microorganisms provide an ideal alternative to these bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lei|first1=Yu|title=Microbial biosensors|url=http://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/downloads/microbial%20sensor%2006.pdf|website=www.cbs.umn.edu|publisher=Analytica Chimica Acta 568 (2006) 200–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many micro organisms useful for BOD assessment are relatively easy to maintain in pure cultures, grow and harvest at low cost. Moreover, the use of microbes in biosensor field has opened up new possibilities and advantages such as ease of handling, preparation and low cost of device. A number of pure cultures, e.g. ''Trichosporon cutaneum, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas sp.'' etc. individually, have been used by many workers for the construction of BOD biosensor. On the other hand, many workers have immobilized activated sludge, or a mixture of two or three bacterial species and on various membranes for the construction of BOD biosensor. The most commonly used membranes were polyvinyl alcohol, porous hydrophilic membranes etc.&lt;ref name="igib.res.in"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kumar|first1=Rita|title=IMMOBILIZED MICROBIAL CONSORTIUM USEFUL FOR RAPID AND RELIABLE BOD ESTIMATION|url=http://www.igib.res.in/pme/patents.htm|website=www.igib.res.in|publisher=CSIR-Institute of Genomics &amp; Integrative Biology (IGIB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A defined microbial consortium can be formed by conducting a systematic study, i.e. pre-testing of selected micro-organisms for use as a seeding material in BOD analysis of a wide variety of industrial effluents. Such a formulated consortium can be immobilized on suitable membrane, i.e. charged nylon membrane useful for BOD estimation. Suitability of charges nylon membrane lies in the specific binding between negatively charged bacterial cell and positively charged nylon membrane. So the advantages of the nylon membrane over the other membranes are : The dual binding, i.e. Adsorption as well as entrapment, thus resulting in a more stable immobilized membrane. Such specific Microbial consortium based BOD analytical devices, may find great application in monitoring of the degree of pollutional strength, in a wide variety of Industrial waste water within a very short time.&lt;ref name="igib.res.in" /&gt;

Biosensors can be used to indirectly measure BOD via a fast (usually &lt;30 min) to be determined BOD substitute and a corresponding calibration curve method (pioneered by Karube et al., 1977). Consequently, biosensors are now commercially available, but they do have several limitations such as their high maintenance costs, limited run lengths due to the need for reactivation, and the inability to respond to changing quality characteristics as would normally occur in wastewater treatment streams; e.g. diffusion processes of the biodegradable organic matter into the membrane and different responses by different microbial species which lead to problems with the reproducibility of result (Praet et al., 1995). Another important limitation is the uncertainty associated with the calibration function for translating the BOD substitute into the real BOD (Rustum ''et al.'', 2008).

===Fluorescent RedOx Indicator===
A surrogate to BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; has been developed using a [[resazurin]] derivative which reveals the extent of oxygen uptake by micro-organisms for organic matter mineralization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=2013130308 A |title=Process for directly measuring multiple biodegradabilities |pubdate=2013-05-23 |fdate=2012-11-21 |pridate=2011-11-23 |invent1=Nathalie Pautremat |invent2=Romy-Alice Goy |invent3=Zaynab El Amraoui |invent4=Yves Dudal |assign1= Envolure}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cross-validation performed on 109 samples in Europe and the United-States showed a strict statistical equivalence between results from both methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muller|first1=Mathieu|last2=Bouguelia|first2=Sihem|last3=Goy|first3=Romy-Alice|last4=Yoris|first4=Alison|last5=Berlin|first5=Jeanne|last6=Meche|first6=Perrine|last7=Rocher|first7=Vincent|last8=Mertens|first8=Sharon|last9=Dudal|first9=Yves|title=International cross-validation of a BOD5 surrogate|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research|date=2014|pages=1–4|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-014-3202-3|doi=10.1007/s11356-014-3202-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French start-up [http://envolure.com/index-en.html Envolure] (Montpellier, France) offers the kit [http://envolure.com/enverdi-en.html ENVERDI] which enables the users to perform up to 40 BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously in 48 hours in a single 96-wells microplate.

===Software sensor===
Rustum et al. (2008) proposed the use of the KSOM to develop intelligent models for making rapid inferences about BOD using other easy to measure water quality parameters, which, unlike BOD, can be obtained directly and reliably using on-line hardware sensors. This will make the use of BOD for on-line process monitoring and control a more plausible proposition. In comparison to other data-driven modeling paradigms such as multi-layer perceptrons artificial neural networks (MLP ANN) and classical multi-variate regression analysis, the KSOM is not negatively affected by missing data. Moreover, time sequencing of data is not a problem when compared to classical time series analysis.

== Dissolved oxygen probes: Membrane and luminescence ==

Since the publication of a simple, accurate and direct dissolved oxygen analytical procedure by Winkler,&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, L. W. (1888). "Die zur Bestimmung des in Wasser gelösten Sauerstoffes " Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft 21(2): 2843–2854.&lt;/ref&gt; the analysis of dissolved oxygen levels for water has been key to the determination of surface water purity and ecological wellness. The Winkler method is still one of only two analytical techniques used to calibrate oxygen electrode meters; the other procedure is based on oxygen solubility at saturation as per [[Henry's law]]. Though many researchers have refined the Winkler analysis to dissolved oxygen levels in the low PPB range, the method does not lend itself to automation.

The development of an analytical instrument that utilizes the reduction-oxidation (redox) chemistry of oxygen in the presence of dissimilar metal electrodes was introduced during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kemula, W. and S. Siekierski (1950). "Polarometric determination of oxygen." Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 15: 1069–75.&lt;/ref&gt; This redox electrode (also known as dissolved oxygen sensor&lt;ref name=WWT&gt;{{cite news|title=Technically Speaking: dissolved oxygen control|url=http://wwtonline.co.uk/features/technically-speaking-dissolved-oxygen-control|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=Water and Wastewater Treatment|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) utilized an oxygen-permeable membrane to allow the diffusion of the gas into an electrochemical cell and its concentration determined by polarographic or galvanic electrodes. This analytical method is sensitive and accurate to down to levels of ± 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/l dissolved oxygen. Calibration of the redox electrode of this membrane electrode still requires the use of the Henry's law table or the [[Winkler test for dissolved oxygen]].

[[File:Dissolved oxygen sensor in a sewer treatment plant.webm|thumb|Dissolved oxygen sensor in a [[sewage treatment plant]] used as a feedback loop to control the [[Centrifugal fan|blowers]] in an [[aeration]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Calvin|title=Repair or Rethink?|url=http://www.tpomag.com/editorial/2012/04/repair_or_rethink|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=Treatment Plant Operator|issue=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the last two decades, a new form of electrode was developed based on the luminescence emission of a photo active chemical compound and the quenching of that emission by oxygen. It is also called optical dissolved oxygen sensor.&lt;ref name=WWT/&gt; This quenching photophysics mechanism is described by the Stern–Volmer equation for dissolved oxygen in a solution:&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Fresnadillo, D., M. D. Marazuela, et al. (1999). "Luminescent Nafion Membranes Dyed with Ruthenium(II) Complexes as Sensing Materials for Dissolved Oxygen." Langmuir 15(19): 6451–6459.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Test limitations ==
The test method involves variables limiting reproducibility. Tests normally show observations varying plus or minus ten to twenty percent around the mean.&lt;ref name="Hammer"&gt;{{cite book | author=Hammer, Mark J. | title=Water and Waste-Water Technology | year=1975 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | isbn=0-471-34726-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}

=== Toxicity ===
Some wastes contain chemicals capable of suppressing microbiological growth or activity.  Potential sources include industrial wastes, [[antibiotic]]s in pharmaceutical or [[medical waste]]s, sanitizers in food processing or commercial cleaning facilities, [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] disinfection used following conventional sewage treatment, and odor-control formulations used in sanitary waste holding tanks in passenger vehicles or portable toilets.  Suppression of the microbial community oxidizing the waste will lower the test result.&lt;ref name="Hammer" /&gt;{{rp|85}}

=== Appropriate microbial population ===
The test relies upon a microbial ecosystem with enzymes capable of oxidizing the available organic material.  Some waste waters, such as those from biological secondary [[sewage treatment]], will already contain a large population of microorganisms acclimated to the water being tested.  An appreciable portion of the waste may be utilized during the holding period prior to commencement of the test procedure.  On the other hand, organic wastes from industrial sources may require specialized enzymes.  Microbial populations from standard seed sources may take some time to produce those enzymes.  A specialized seed culture may be appropriate to reflect conditions of an evolved ecosystem in the receiving waters.&lt;ref name="Hammer" /&gt;{{rp|85–87}}

== History  ==
The ''[[Royal Commission]] on River Pollution'', which was established in 1865 and the formation of the ''[[Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal]]'' in 1898 led to the selection in 1908 of BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; as the definitive test for organic [[Water pollution|pollution]] of rivers. Five days was chosen as an appropriate test period because this is supposedly the longest time that river water takes to travel from source to [[estuary]] in the [[U.K.]]. In its sixth report the Royal Commission recommended that  the standard set should be 15 parts by weight per million of water.&lt;ref name="Royal"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924003641929 Final Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Inquire and Report What Methods of Treating and Disposing of Sewage. 1912 ]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the Ninth report the commission had revised the recommended standard : &lt;blockquote&gt;" An effluent taking up 2–0 parts dissolved oxygen per 100,000 would be found by a
simple calculation to require dilution with at least 8 volumes of river water taking up 0.2 part if the resulting mixture was not to take up more than 0.4 part. Our experience indicated that in a large majority of cases the volume of river water would exceed 8 times the volume of effluent, and that the figure of 2–0 parts dissolved oxygen per 100,000, which had been shown to be practicable, would be a safe figure to adopt for the purposes of a general standard, taken in conjunction with the condition that the effluent should not contain more than 3–0 parts per 100,000 of suspended solids."&lt;ref name="Royal" /&gt;   &lt;/blockquote&gt;This was the cornerstone 20:30 (BOD:Suspended Solids) + full [[nitrification]] standard which was used as a yardstick in the U.K. up to the 1970s for sewage works [[effluent]] quality.

The [[United States]] includes BOD effluent limitations in its [[sewage treatment|secondary treatment]]  regulations. Secondary sewage treatment is generally expected to remove 85 percent of the BOD measured in sewage and produce effluent BOD concentrations with a 30-day average of less than 30&amp;nbsp;mg/L and a 7-day average of less than 45&amp;nbsp;mg/L.  The regulations also describe "treatment equivalent to secondary treatment" as removing 65 percent of the BOD and producing effluent BOD concentrations with a 30-day average less than 45&amp;nbsp;mg/L and a 7-day average less than 65&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/40cfr133_07.html "Secondary Treatment Regulation."] ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' 40 CFR Part 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Oceanographic Data Centre''' ('''BODC''') is a national facility for looking after and distributing [[data]] about the [[marine (ocean)|marine]] environment. BODC is the designated marine science data centre for the [[UK]] and part of the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC). The centre provides a resource for science, education and industry, as well as the general public. BODC is hosted by the [[National Oceanography Centre]] (NOC) — primarily at its facility in [[Liverpool]], with small number of its staff in [[Southampton]].

[[File:Bidston Observatory.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Bidston Observatory, home of BODC from 1975 to 2004.]]
[[File:Joseph Proudman Building.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Joseph Proudman Building, Liverpool.]]

== History ==
The origins of BODC go back to 1969 when NERC created the '''British Oceanographic Data Service''' ('''BODS'''). Located at the National Institute of [[Oceanography]], [[Wormley, Surrey|Wormley]] in [[Surrey]], its purpose was to: 
* Act as the UK's National Oceanographic Data Centre
* Participate in the international exchange of data as part of the [[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]] (IOC) network of national data centres

In 1975 BODS was transferred to [[Bidston]] Observatory on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], near Liverpool, as part of the newly formed Institute of Oceanographic Sciences. The following year BODS became the Marine Information and Advisory Service (MIAS)[http://www.soton.ac.uk/library/about/nol/mias.html]. Its primary activity was to manage the data collected from weather ships, [[Oil platform|oil rigs]] and [[Data Buoys|data buoys]].
The data banking component of MIAS was restructured to form BODC in April 1989. Its mission was to 'operate as a world-class data centre in support of UK marine science'. BODC pioneered a start to finish approach to marine data management. This involved:
* Assisting in the collection of data at sea
* Quality control of data
* Assembling the data for use by the scientists
* The publication of data sets on [[CD-ROM]]
In December 2004, BODC moved to the purpose-built [[Joseph Proudman]] Building on the campus of the [[University of Liverpool]]. A small number of its staff are based in the [[National Oceanography Centre]] (NOC), Southampton.

== Aims ==
* Work alongside scientists during marine research projects
* Provide quality control and archiving of oceanographic data
* Maintain an online source of information and improve public access to marine data
* Provide innovative marine data products

== National role ==
[[File:Current meter inventory.jpg|250px|right|thumb|BODC [[current meter]] data holdings from around the UK.]]
BODC is one of six designated data centres that manage NERC's environmental data and has a number of national roles and responsibilities:
* Performing data management for NERC-funded marine projects
* Maintaining and developing its archive of marine data, the '''National Oceanographic Database''' ('''NODB''')
* Managing, checking and archiving data from [[tide gauge]]s around the UK coast for the [[UK National Tide Gauge Network|National Tide Gauge Network]], which aims to obtain high quality [[tidal]] information and to provide warning of possible flooding of coastal areas around the British Isles. This  is part of the [[National Tidal and Sea Level Facility|National Tidal &amp; Sea Level Facility]] (NTSLF)
* Hosting the Marine Environmental Data and Information Network ([http://www.oceannet.org/ MEDIN])
* Working in partnership with other NERC marine research centres:
** [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS)

The '''European Organization for Nuclear Research''' ({{lang-fr|Organisation européenne pour la recherche nucléaire}}), &lt;!-- The official name contains organization/organisation NOT council/conseil. Read the history section before you vandalize the article. --&gt;known as '''CERN'''&lt;!-- The acronym is explained in CERN's website: https://home.cern/about --&gt; ({{IPAc-en|s|ɜːr|n}}; {{IPA-fr|sɛʁn}}; derived from the name {{lang|fr|Conseil européen pour la recherche nucléaire}}), is a [[Europe]]an research organization that operates the largest [[particle physics]] laboratory in the world. Established in 1954, the organization is based in a northwest suburb of [[Geneva]] on the Franco–Swiss border, and has 22 [[#Member states and budget|member states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://international-relations.web.cern.ch/International-Relations/ms/ |title=Member States |website=International Relations |publisher=CERN |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel]] is the only non-European country granted full membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/55869|title=CERN to admit Israel as first new member state since 1999 - CERN Courier|author=|date=|website=cerncourier.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; CERN is an official [[United Nations General Assembly observers|United Nations Observer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/member-states/intergovernmental-organizations/index.html|title=Intergovernmental Organizations|author=|date=|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acronym CERN is also used to refer to the laboratory, which in 2016 had 2,500 scientific, technical, and administrative staff members, and hosted about 12,000 users. In the same year, CERN generated 49 [[petabyte]]s of data.&lt;ref name="infigures"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/2270805/files/486-1611-1-SM.pdf |title=Annual Report 2016 |publisher=CERN |accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CERN's main function is to provide the [[particle accelerator]]s and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics research – as a result, numerous experiments have been constructed at CERN through international collaborations. The main site at [[Meyrin]] hosts a large computing facility, which is primarily used to [[computer data storage|store]] and [[data analysis|analyse data]] from experiments, as well as [[simulation|simulate]] [[event (particle physics)|events]]. Researchers need remote access to these facilities, so the lab has historically been a major [[wide area network]] hub. CERN is also the birthplace of the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The convention establishing CERN was ratified on 29&amp;nbsp;September 1954 by 12 countries in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; The acronym CERN originally represented the French words for {{lang|fr|Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire}} (European Council for Nuclear Research), which was a provisional council for building the laboratory, established by 12 European governments in 1952. The acronym was retained for the new laboratory after the provisional council was dissolved, even though the name changed to the current {{lang|fr|Organisation Européenne pour la Recherche Nucléaire}} (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in 1954.&lt;ref name="cern-name"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/About/Name-en.html |title=The Name CERN |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=CERN |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lew Kowarski]], a former director of CERN, when the name was changed, the abbreviation could have become the awkward OERN, and [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] said that this could "still be CERN even if the name is [not]".{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

CERN's first president was Sir [[Ben Lockspeiser|Benjamin Lockspeiser]]. [[Edoardo Amaldi]] was the general secretary of CERN at its early stages when operations were still provisional, while the first Director-General (1954) was [[Felix Bloch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1730968 |title=People and things : Felix Bloch |accessdate=1 September 2015 |journal=CERN Courier }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laboratory was originally devoted to the study of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], but was soon applied to [[high-energy physics|higher-energy physics]], concerned mainly with the study of interactions between [[subatomic particle]]s. Therefore, the laboratory operated by CERN is commonly referred to as the '''European laboratory for particle physics''' ({{lang|fr|Laboratoire européen pour la physique des particules}}), which better describes the research being performed there.

=== Founding members ===
At the sixth session of the CERN Council, which took place in Paris from 29 June - 1 July 1953, the convention establishing the organization was signed, subject to ratification, by 12 states.
The convention was gradually ratified by the 12 founding Member States: [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://timeline.web.cern.ch/timelines/The-history-of-CERN Founding members], History of CERN, timeline.web.cern.ch&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, CERN attracted media attention when the [[OPERA experiment|OPERA Collaboration]] reported the detection of possibly [[Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly|faster-than-light neutrinos]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Cho, [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/09/neutrinos-travel-faster-light-according-one-experiment ''Neutrinos Travel Faster Than Light, According to One Experiment''], Science NOW, 22 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Further tests showed that the results were flawed due to an incorrectly connected [[GPS]] synchronization cable.&lt;ref name="OPERAanomaly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.cern/press-releases/2011/09/opera-experiment-reports-anomaly-flight-time-neutrinos-cern-gran-sasso|title=OPERA experiment reports anomaly in flight time of neutrinos from CERN to Gran Sasso |publisher=CERN |date= |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] was awarded to [[Carlo Rubbia]] and [[Simon van der Meer]] for the developments that resulted in the discoveries of the W and Z bosons. The 1992 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to CERN staff researcher [[Georges Charpak]] "for his invention and development of particle detectors, in particular the [[multiwire proportional chamber]]". The 2013 Nobel Prize for physics was awarded to [[François Englert]] and [[Peter Higgs]] for the theoretical description of the Higgs mechanism in the year after the Higgs boson was found by CERN experiments.

The [[World Wide Web]] began as a CERN project named [[ENQUIRE]], initiated by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] in 1989 and [[Robert Cailliau]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/en/About/WebStory-en.html |title=CERN.ch |publisher=CERN |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berners-Lee and Cailliau were jointly honoured by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] in 1995 for their contributions to the development of the World Wide Web.

Based on the concept of [[hypertext]], the project was intended to facilitate the sharing of information between researchers. The first website was activated in 1991. On 30&amp;nbsp;April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone. A copy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html |title=The World Wide Web project |publisher=W3C |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html the original first webpage], created by Berners-Lee, is still published on the [[World Wide Web Consortium]]'s website as a historical document.

Prior to the Web's development, CERN had pioneered the introduction of Internet technology, beginning in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ben.web.cern.ch/ben/TCPHIST.html |title=A Short History of Internet Protocols at CERN |publisher=CERN |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, CERN has become a facility for the development of [[grid computing]], hosting projects including the [[Enabling Grids for E-sciencE]] (EGEE) and [[LHC Computing Grid]]. It also hosts the [[CERN Internet Exchange Point]] (CIXP), one of the two main [[internet exchange point]]s in Switzerland.

== Particle accelerators ==
=== Current complex ===
{{CERNaccelerators}}

[[File:Location Large Hadron Collider.PNG|thumb|Map of the [[Large Hadron Collider]] together with the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] at CERN]]

CERN operates a network of six accelerators and a decelerator. Each machine in the chain increases the energy of particle beams before delivering them to experiments or to the next more powerful accelerator. Currently active machines are:
* Two [[linear accelerator]]s generate low energy particles. [[LINAC 2]] accelerates protons to 50&amp;nbsp;[[Megaelectronvolt|MeV]] for injection into the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB), and [[LINAC 3]] provides heavy ions at 4.2&amp;nbsp;MeV/[[Atomic mass unit|u]] for injection into the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linac2.home.cern.ch/linac2/default.htm |title=CERN Website – LINAC |publisher=CERN |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Proton Synchrotron Booster]] increases the energy of particles generated by the proton linear accelerator before they are transferred to the other accelerators.
* The [[Low Energy Ion Ring]] (LEIR) accelerates the ions from the ion linear accelerator, before transferring them to the [[Proton Synchrotron]] (PS). This [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]] was commissioned in 2005, after having been reconfigured from the previous [[Low Energy Antiproton Ring]] (LEAR).
* The 28 [[Gigaelectronvolt|GeV]] [[Proton Synchrotron]] (PS), built during 1954—1959 and still operating as a feeder to the more powerful [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]].
* The [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] (SPS), a circular accelerator with a diameter of 2 kilometres built in a tunnel, which started operation in 1976. It was designed to deliver an energy of 300&amp;nbsp;GeV and was gradually upgraded to 450&amp;nbsp;GeV. As well as having its own beamlines for fixed-target experiments (currently [[COMPASS experiment|COMPASS]] and [[NA62 experiment|NA62]]), it has been operated as a [[proton]]–[[antiproton]] [[collider]] (the Sp{{overline|p}}S collider), and for accelerating high energy [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s which were injected into the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]] (LEP). Since 2008, it has been used to inject protons and [[heavy ion]]s into the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC).
* The [[On-Line Isotope Mass Separator]] (ISOLDE), which is used to study [[radioactive decay|unstable nuclei]]. The radioactive ions are produced by the impact of protons at an energy of 1.0–1.4&amp;nbsp;GeV from the Proton Synchrotron Booster. It was first commissioned in 1967 and was rebuilt with major upgrades in 1974 and 1992.
* The [[Antiproton Decelerator]] (AD), which reduces the velocity of antiprotons to about 10% of the [[speed of light]] for research of [[antimatter]].
* The [[Compact Linear Collider]] Test Facility, which studies feasibility for the future normal conducting linear collider project.
* The [[AWAKE]] experiment, which is a proof-of-principle [[plasma acceleration|plasma wakefield accelerator]].

==== Large Hadron Collider ====
{{Main|Large Hadron Collider}}

Many activities at CERN currently involve operating the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) and the experiments for it. The LHC represents a large-scale, worldwide scientific cooperation project.
[[File:Construction of LHC at CERN.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Construction of the [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] detector for [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] at CERN]]

The LHC tunnel is located 100 metres underground, in the region between the [[Geneva International Airport]] and the nearby [[Jura mountains]]. The majority of its length is on the French side of the border. It uses the 27&amp;nbsp;km circumference circular tunnel previously occupied by the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]] (LEP), which was shut down in November 2000. CERN's existing PS/SPS accelerator complexes are used to pre-accelerate protons and lead ions which are then injected into the LHC.

Seven experiments ([[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]], [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]], [[LHCb]], [[MoEDAL experiment|MoEDAL]],&lt;ref&gt;CERN Courier, [http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/42329 "MoEDAL becomes the LHC's magnificent seventh"], 5 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[TOTEM]], [[LHCf|LHC-forward]] and [[A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]]) are located along the collider; each of them studies particle collisions from a different aspect, and with different technologies. Construction for these experiments required an extraordinary engineering effort. For example, a special [[Crane (machine)|crane]] was rented from Belgium to lower pieces of the CMS detector into its underground cavern, since each piece weighed nearly 2,000 tons. The first of the approximately 5,000 magnets necessary for construction was lowered down a special shaft at 13:00&amp;nbsp;[[GMT]] on 7 March 2005.

The LHC has begun to generate vast quantities of data, which CERN streams to laboratories around the world for distributed processing (making use of a specialized [[grid computing|grid]] infrastructure, the [[LHC Computing Grid]]). During April 2005, a trial successfully streamed 600&amp;nbsp;MB/s to seven different sites across the world.

The initial particle beams were injected into the LHC August 2008.&lt;ref name="NYT2008/07/29"&gt;Overbye, Dennis (29 July 2008). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/science/29cernrap.html Let the Proton Smashing Begin. (The Rap Is Already Written.)]". ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The first beam was circulated through the entire LHC on 10 September 2008,&lt;ref name="CERNPR06.08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.cern/past-events/lhc-first-beam |title=LHC First Beam |publisher=CERN |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the system failed 10 days later because of a faulty magnet connection, and it was stopped for repairs on 19 September 2008.

The LHC resumed operation on 20 November 2009 by successfully circulating two beams, each with an energy of 3.5&amp;nbsp;tera[[electronvolts]] (TeV). The challenge for the engineers was then to try to line up the two beams so that they smashed into each other. This is like "firing two needles across the Atlantic and getting them to hit each other" according to Steve Myers, director for accelerators and technology.

On 30 March 2010, the LHC successfully collided two proton beams with 3.5 TeV of energy per proton, resulting in a 7 TeV collision energy. However, this was just the start of what was needed for the expected discovery of the [[Higgs boson]]. When the 7 TeV experimental period ended, the LHC revved to 8 TeV (4 TeV per proton) starting March 2012, and soon began particle collisions at that energy. In July 2012, CERN scientists announced the discovery of a new sub-atomic particle that was later confirmed to be the [[Higgs boson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Adrian Cho|title=Higgs Boson Makes Its Debut After Decades-Long Search|journal=Science|pages=141–143|volume=337|date=13 July 2012|doi= 10.1126/science.337.6091.141|pmid= 22798574|issue= 6091|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2013, CERN announced that the measurements performed on the newly found particle allowed it to conclude that this is a Higgs boson.&lt;ref name="intersitetunnel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.cern/press-releases/2013/03/new-results-indicate-particle-discovered-cern-higgs-boson |title=New results indicate that particle discovered at CERN is a Higgs boson |publisher=CERN |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013, the LHC was deactivated for a two-year maintenance period, to strengthen the electrical connections between magnets inside the accelerator and for other upgrades.

On 5 April 2015, after two years of maintenance and consolidation, the LHC restarted for a second run. The first ramp to the record-breaking energy of 6.5 TeV was performed on 10 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Luanaigh|first1=Cian|title=First successful beam at record energy of 6.5 TeV|url=https://home.cern/about/updates/2015/04/first-successful-beam-record-energy-65-tev|website=CERN: Accelerating science|publisher=CERN|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Luanaigh|first1=Cian|title=Proton beams are back in the LHC|url=https://home.cern/about/updates/2015/04/proton-beams-are-back-lhc|website=CERN: Accelerating science|publisher=CERN|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the design collision rate was exceeded for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://home.cern/about/opinion/2016/11/lhc-smashes-targets-2016-run-0 |title=LHC smashes targets for 2016 run |date=1 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second two-year period of shutdown is scheduled to begin at the end of 2018.

=== Decommissioned accelerators ===
* The original linear accelerator ([[LINAC 1]]).
* The 600&amp;nbsp;MeV [[Synchrocyclotron]] (SC) which started operation in 1957 and was shut down in 1991.
* The [[Intersecting Storage Rings]] (ISR), an early collider built from 1966 to 1971 and operated until 1984.
* The [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]] (LEP), which operated from 1989 to 2000 and was the largest machine of its kind, housed in a 27&amp;nbsp;km-long circular tunnel which now houses the [[Large Hadron Collider]].
* The [[Low Energy Antiproton Ring]] (LEAR), commissioned in 1982, which assembled the first pieces of true [[antimatter]], in 1995, consisting of nine atoms of [[antihydrogen]]. It was closed in 1996, and superseded by the [[Antiproton Decelerator]].

=== Possible future accelerators ===
CERN, in collaboration with groups worldwide, is investigating two main concepts for future accelerators: A linear electron-positron collider with a new acceleration concept to increase the energy ([[Compact Linear Collider|CLIC]]) and a larger version of the LHC, a project currently named [[Future Circular Collider]].

== Sites ==
[[File:Bldng40cropped.jpg|thumb|Interior of office building 40 at the Meyrin site. Building 40 hosts many offices for scientists from the CMS and ATLAS collaborations.]]

The smaller accelerators are on the main [[Meyrin]] site (also known as the West Area), which was originally built in Switzerland alongside the French border, but has been extended to span the border since 1965. The French side is under Swiss jurisdiction and there is no obvious border within the site, apart from a line of marker stones. There are six entrances to the Meyrin site:{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* ''A'', in Switzerland, for all CERN personnel at specific times.
* ''B'', in Switzerland, for all CERN personnel at all times. Often referred to as the ''main entrance''.
* ''C'', in Switzerland, for all CERN personnel at specific times.
* ''D'', in Switzerland, for goods reception at specific times.
* ''E'', in France, for French-resident CERN personnel at specific times. Named {{lang|fr|Porte Charles de Gaulle}} in recognition of his role in the creation of CERN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/800591|title=Red Carpet for CERN's 50th|journal=CERN Bulletin|date=November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Inter-site tunnel'', in France, for equipment transfer to and from CERN sites in France by personnel with a specific permit. This is the only permitted route for such transfers. By the CERN treaty, no taxes are payable when such transfers are made. Controlled by customs personnel.&lt;ref name="intersitetunnel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoststates.web.cern.ch/hoststates/en/Access/Welcome.html |title=CERN Host relations service page |publisher=CERN |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPS and LEP/LHC tunnels are almost entirely outside the main site, and are mostly buried under French farmland and invisible from the surface. However, they have surface sites at various points around them, either as the location of buildings associated with experiments or other facilities needed to operate the colliders such as cryogenic plants and access shafts. The experiments are located at the same underground level as the tunnels at these sites.

Three of these experimental sites are in France, with ATLAS in Switzerland, although some of the ancillary cryogenic and access sites are in Switzerland. The largest of the experimental sites is the [[Prévessin]] site, also known as the North Area, which is the target station for non-collider experiments on the SPS accelerator. Other sites are the ones which were used for the [[UA1 experiment|UA1]], [[UA2 experiment|UA2]] and the LEP experiments (the latter are used by LHC experiments).

Outside of the LEP and LHC experiments, most are officially named and numbered after the site where they were located. For example, [[NA32 experiment|NA32]] was an experiment looking at the production of so-called "[[charm quark|charmed]]" particles and located at the [[Prévessin]] (North Area) site while [[WA22 experiment|WA22]] used the [[Big European Bubble Chamber]] (BEBC) at the Meyrin (West Area) site to examine neutrino interactions. The [[UA1 experiment|UA1]] and [[UA2 experiment|UA2]] experiments were considered to be in the Underground Area, i.e. situated underground at sites on the SPS accelerator.

Most of the [[List of streets at CERN|roads on the CERN Meyrin and Prévessin sites]] are named after famous physicists, such as Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, and Albert Einstein.

== Participation and funding ==

=== Member states and budget ===

Since its foundation by 12 members in 1954, CERN regularly accepted new members. All new members have remained in the organization continuously since their accession, except Spain and Yugoslavia. Spain first joined CERN in 1961, withdrew in 1969, and rejoined in 1983. Yugoslavia was a founding member of CERN but quit in 1961. Of the 22 members, Israel joined CERN as a full member on 6 January 2014,&lt;ref name=ISR /&gt; becoming the first (and currently only) non-European full member.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman, Fazlur. (2013-11-11) [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.557492 Israel may become first non-European member of nuclear research group CERN – Diplomacy and Defense Israel News]. Haaretz. Retrieved on 2014-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The budget contributions of member states are computed based on their GDP.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Member States' Contributions – 2017 |url=https://fap-dep.web.cern.ch/rpc/member-states-contributions |website=CERN website |publisher=CERN |accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural imperialism''' comprises the [[Culture|cultural]] aspects of [[imperialism]]. Imperialism here refers to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between [[civilization]]s, favoring the more powerful civilization. Thus, cultural imperialism is the practice of promoting and imposing a culture, usually that of a politically powerful [[nation]], over a less powerful society; in other words, the [[cultural hegemony]] of [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] or [[Developed country|economically influential countries]] which determine general cultural values and standardize civilizations throughout the world. The term is employed especially in the fields of history, [[cultural studies]], and [[postcolonial theory]]. It is usually used in a pejorative sense, often in conjunction with calls to reject such influence. Cultural imperialism can take various forms, such as an attitude, a formal policy, or military action, insofar as it reinforces cultural hegemony.

==Background and definitions==
Although the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has a 1921 reference to the "cultural imperialism of the Russians",&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', within "cultural"&lt;/ref&gt; John Tomlinson, in his book on the subject, writes that the term emerged in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0CFMS0z5-gcC&amp;dq=cultural+imperialism&amp;q=%221960s+and+has%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%221960s%20and%20has%22&amp;f=false Tomlinson (1991)], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a focus of research since at least the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hamm, (2005), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Terms such as "[[media imperialism]]", "structural imperialism", "cultural dependency and domination",  "cultural synchronization", "[[electronic colonialism]]", "ideological imperialism", and "[[economic imperialism]]" have all been used to describe the same basic notion of cultural imperialism.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

Various academics give various definitions of the term. American [[media critic]] [[Herbert Schiller]] wrote: "The concept of cultural imperialism today [1975] best describes the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system. The public media are the foremost example of operating enterprises that are used in the penetrative process. For penetration on a significant scale the media themselves must be captured by the dominating/penetrating power. This occurs largely through the commercialization of broadcasting."&lt;ref name="Schiller 76"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiller|first=Herbert I.|title=Communication and cultural domination|publisher=International Arts and Sciences Press, 901 North Broadway, White Plains, New York 10603 |year=1976|pages=9–10|isbn=978-0-87332-079-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom McPhail]] defined "Electronic colonialism as the dependency relationship established by the importation of communication hardware, foreign-produced software, along with engineers, technicians, and related information protocols, that vicariously establish a set of foreign norms, values, and expectations which, in varying degrees, may alter the domestic cultures and socialization processes."&lt;ref name="McPhail"&gt;{{cite book|last=McPhail|first=Thomas L.|title=Electronic colonialism: the future of international broadcasting and communication|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1987|series=Volume 126 of Sage library of social research|page=18|isbn=978-0-8039-2730-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sui-Nam Lee observed that "communication imperialism can be defined as the process in which the ownership and control over the hardware and software of mass media as well as other major forms of communication in one country are singly or together subjugated to the domination of another country with deleterious effects on the indigenous values, norms and culture."&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee |first=Siu-Nam Lee |year=1988|title=Communication imperialism and dependency: A conceptual clarification|journal=International Communication Gazette|publisher=Kiuwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|issue= 41|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ogan saw "media imperialism often described as a process whereby the United States and Western Europe produce most of the media products, make the first profits from domestic sales, and then market the products in Third World countries at costs considerably lower than those the countries would have to bear to produce similar products at home."&lt;ref name="Ogan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ogan|first=Christine|date=Spring 1988|title=Media Imperialism and the Videocassette Recorder: The Case of Turkey|journal=Journal of Communication|volume= 38|issue= 2|page=94|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1988.tb02049.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downing and Sreberny-Mohammadi state: "Imperialism is the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one. Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force. In the history of [[colonialism]], (i.e., the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners), the educational and media systems of many Third World countries have been set up as replicas of those in Britain, France, or the United States and carry their values. Western advertising has made further inroads, as have architectural and fashion styles. Subtly but powerfully, the message has often been insinuated that Western cultures are superior to the cultures of the Third World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Downing,|first=John|author2=Ali Mohammadi |author3=Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi |title=Questioning the media: a critical introduction|publisher=SAGE|year=1995|edition=2, illustrated|page=482|isbn=978-0-8039-7197-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Needless to say, all these authors agree that cultural imperialism promotes the interests of certain circles within the imperial powers, often to the detriment of the target societies.

The issue of cultural imperialism emerged largely from [[communication studies]].&lt;ref name="Salwen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salwen |first=Michael B. |title=Cultural imperialism: A media effects approach  |date=March 1991|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|volume= 8|issue= 1 |pages=29–38 |doi=10.1080/15295039109366778}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cultural imperialism has been used as a framework by scholars to explain phenomena in the areas of [[international relations]], [[anthropology]], education, science, history, literature, and sports.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

==Theoretical foundations==
Many of today's academics that employ the term, ''cultural imperialism,'' are heavily informed by the work of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], [[Edward Said|Said]], and other [[Post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] and postcolonialist theorists.&lt;ref name=White&gt;White, Livingston A. "Reconsidering Cultural Imperialism Theory" ''Transnational Broadcasting Studies'' no.6 Spring/Summer 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the realm of postcolonial discourse, ''cultural imperialism'' can be seen as the cultural legacy of colonialism, or forms of social action contributing to the continuation of Western [[hegemony]]. To some outside of the realm of this discourse, the term is critiqued as being unclear, unfocused, and/or contradictory in nature.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

===Michel Foucault===
The work of French philosopher and [[social theorist]] [[Michel Foucault]] has heavily influenced use of the term ''cultural imperialism,'' particularly his philosophical interpretation of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and his concept of [[governmentality]].

Following an interpretation of power similar to that of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], Foucault defines power as immaterial, as a "certain type of relation between individuals" that has to do with complex strategic social positions that relate to the subject's ability to control its environment and influence those around itself.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. 1979. "''Omnes et Singulatim'': Towards a Criticism of Political Reason" in Faubion, James D. (ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to Foucault, power is intimately tied with his conception of [[truth]]. "Truth", as he defines it, is a "system of ordered procedures for the production, regulation, distribution, circulation, and operation of statements" which has a "circular relation" with systems of power.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. 1979. "Truth and Power" in Faubion, James D. (ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, inherent in systems of power, is always "truth", which is culturally specific, inseparable from [[ideology]] which often coincides with various forms of [[hegemony]]. ''Cultural imperialism'' may be an example of this.

Foucault's interpretation of governance is also very important in constructing theories of transnational power structure.  In his lectures at the [[Collège de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the broad art of "governing", which goes beyond the traditional conception of governance in terms of state mandates, and into other realms such as governing "a household, souls, children, a province, a convent, a religious order, a family".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. 1978. "Governmentality" in  Faubion, James D. (ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press&lt;/ref&gt; This relates directly back to Machiavelli's [[The Prince]], and Foucault's aforementioned conceptions of [[truth]] and [[Power (philosophy)|power]]. (i.e. various [[Subjectivity|subjectivities]] are created through power relations that are culturally specific, which lead to various forms of culturally specific governmentality such as [[neoliberal]] governmentality.)

===Edward Saïd===
Informed by the works of [[Noam Chomsky]], Foucault, and [[Antonio Gramsci]], Edward Saïd is a founding figure of postcolonialism, established with the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), a [[Humanism|humanist]] critique of [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]], which criticizes Western knowledge of "The East"—specifically the English and the French [[Social construct|constructions]] of what is and what is not "Oriental".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Young, ''White Mythologies: Writing History and the West'', New York &amp; London: Routledge, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/said08052003.html Orientalism 25 Years Later, by Said in 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orientalism"&gt;Saïd, Edward. 1978. ''Orientalism.'' New York: Pantheon Books&lt;/ref&gt; Whereby said "knowledge" then led to cultural tendencies towards a [[binary opposition]] of the Orient vs. the Occident, wherein one concept is defined in opposition to the other concept, and from which they emerge as of unequal value.&lt;ref name="Orientalism" /&gt; In ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' (1993), the sequel to ''Orientalism'', Saïd proposes that, despite the formal end of the “age of empire” after the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–45), colonial imperialism left a cultural legacy to the (previously) colonized peoples, which remains in their contemporary civilizations; and that said ''cultural imperialism'' is very influential in the international systems of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref&gt;Saïd, Edward. 1993. ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' New York: Pantheon Books&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak===

A self-described "practical Marxist-feminist-deconstructionist"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LAHIRI|first=BULAN|title=Speaking to Spivak|url=http://www.hindu.com/lr/2011/02/06/stories/2011020650020100.htm|accessdate=9 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=2011-02-06|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] has published a number of works challenging the "legacy of colonialism" including ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Towards a History of the Vanishing Present'' (1999), ''Other Asias'' (2005), and "Can the Subaltern Speak?" (1988).&lt;ref name=speak&gt;[http://www.maldura.unipd.it/dllags/docentianglo/materiali_oboe_lm/2581_001.pdf  Spivak, Gayatri Chakravorty. 1988. "Can the Subaltern Speak"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105154619/http://www.maldura.unipd.it/dllags/docentianglo/materiali_oboe_lm/2581_001.pdf |date=5 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Can the Subaltern Speak?" Spivak critiques common representations in the West of the [[Sati (practice)|Sati]], as being controlled by authors other than the participants (specifically English colonizers and Hindu leaders). Because of this, Spivak argues that the [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]], referring to the communities that participate in the Sati, are not able to represent themselves through their own voice. Spivak says that cultural imperialism has the power to disqualify or erase the knowledge and mode of education of certain populations that are low on the social hierarchy.&lt;ref name=speak /&gt;

Throughout "Can the Subaltern Speak?", Spivak cites the works of Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Walter Benjamin, Louis Althusser, Jacques Derrida, and Edward Said, among others.

In ''A critique of Postcolonial Reason'', Spivak argues that Western philosophy has a history of not only exclusion of the subaltern from discourse, but also does not allow them to occupy the space of a fully human subject.

==Contemporary ideas and debate==
''Cultural imperialism'' can refer to either the forced acculturation of a subject population, or to the voluntary embracing of a foreign culture by individuals who do so of their own free will.  Since these are two very different referents, the validity of the term has been called into question.

Cultural influence can be seen by the "receiving" culture as either a threat to or an enrichment of its [[cultural identity]]. It seems therefore useful to distinguish between cultural imperialism as an (active or passive) attitude of superiority, and the position of a culture or group that seeks to complement its own cultural production, considered partly deficient, with imported products.

The imported products or services can themselves represent, or be associated with, certain values (such as [[consumerism]]). According to one argument, the "receiving" [[culture]] does not necessarily perceive this link, but instead absorbs the foreign culture passively through the use of the foreign goods and services. Due to its somewhat concealed, but very potent nature, this hypothetical idea is described by some experts as "''banal imperialism''." For example, it is argued that while "American companies are accused of wanting to control 95 percent of the world's consumers", "cultural imperialism involves much more than simple consumer goods; it involved the dissemination of American principles such as freedom and democracy", a process which "may sound appealing" but which "masks a frightening truth: many cultures around the world are disappearing due to the overwhelming influence of corporate and cultural America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations |year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|page=31|edition=2nd|author2=Cynthia King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that the newly globalised economy of the late 20th and early 21st century has facilitated this process through the use of new information technology.  This kind of cultural imperialism is derived from what is called "[[soft power]]". The theory of electronic colonialism extends the issue to global cultural issues and the impact of major multi-media conglomerates, ranging from [[Viacom]], [[Time-Warner]], [[Disney]], [[News Corp]], to [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] with the focus on the hegemonic power of these mainly United States-based communication giants.

===Cultural diversity===
One of the reasons often given for opposing any form of cultural imperialism, voluntary or otherwise, is the preservation of [[cultural diversity]], a goal seen by some as analogous to the preservation of [[biodiversity|ecological diversity]].  Proponents of this idea argue either that such diversity is valuable in itself, to preserve human historical heritage and knowledge, or instrumentally valuable because it makes available more ways of solving problems and responding to catastrophes, natural or otherwise.

===Ideas relating to African colonization===
Of all the areas of the world that scholars have claimed to be adversely affected by imperialism, Africa is probably the most notable. In the expansive "age of imperialism" of the nineteenth century, scholars have argued that European colonization in Africa has led to the elimination of many various cultures, worldviews, and [[Epistemology|epistemologies]], particularly through neocolonization of public education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/sabrin_mohammed_201305_phd.pdf|title=EXPLORING THE INTELLECTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF EGYPTIAN NATIONAL EDUCATION|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monga, C. 1996.  ''Anthropology of Anger: Civil Society and Democracy in Africa.'' Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =wa&gt;wa Thiongo, N. 1986. ''Decolonising the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature.'' London: James Curry.&lt;/ref&gt; This, arguably has led to uneven development, and further informal forms of social control having to do with culture and imperialism.&lt;ref name=Abdi&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abdi | first1 = Ali A | year = 2000 | title = Globalization, Culture, and Development: Perspectives on Africa | url = | journal = Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of factors, scholars argue, lead to the elimination of cultures, worldviews, and [[Epistemology|epistemologies]], such as "de-linguicization" (replacing native African languages with European ones), devaluing [[Ontology|ontologies]] that are not explicitly individualistic,&lt;ref name=Abdi /&gt; and at times going as far as to not only define Western culture itself as science, but that non-Western approaches to science, the Arts, indigenous culture, etc. are not even knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One scholar, [[Ali A. Abdi]], claims that imperialism inherently "involve[s] extensively interactive regimes and heavy contexts of identity deformation, misrecognition, loss of self-esteem, and  individual and social doubt in self-efficacy."(2000: 12)&lt;ref name=Abdi /&gt; Therefore, all imperialism would always, already be cultural.

===Ties to neoliberalism===
[[Neoliberalism]] is often critiqued by sociologists, anthropologists, and cultural studies scholars as being culturally imperialistic. Critics of neoliberalism, at times, claim that it is the newly predominant form of imperialism.&lt;ref name=Abdi /&gt; Other Scholars, such as Elizabeth Dunn and Julia Elyachar have claimed that [[neoliberalism]] requires and creates its own form of [[governmentality]].&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;Dunn, Elizabeth C. 2004. ''Privatizing Poland: Baby Food, Big Business, and the Remaking of Labor'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elyachar&gt;Elyachar, Julia. 2005. ''Markets of Dispossession: NGOs, Economic Development, and the State in Cairo'' US: Duke University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dunn's work, ''Privatizing Poland'', she argues that the expansion of the [[multinational corporation]], Gerber, into Poland in the 1990s imposed Western, neoliberal [[governmentality]], [[Ideology|ideologies]], and [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] upon the post-soviet persons hired.&lt;ref name=Dunn /&gt; Cultural conflicts occurred most notably the company's inherent [[Individualism|individualistic]] policies, such as promoting competition among workers rather than cooperation, and in its strong opposition to what the company owners claimed was [[bribery]].&lt;ref name=Dunn /&gt;

In Elyachar's work, ''Markets of Dispossession'', she focuses on ways in which, in [[Cairo]], [[NGO]]s along with [[International nongovernmental organization|INGO]]s and the state promoted neoliberal [[governmentality]] through schemas of economic development that relied upon "youth microentrepreneurs."&lt;ref name=Elyachar /&gt; Youth microentrepreneurs would receive small loans to build their own businesses, similar to the way that [[microfinance]] supposedly operates.&lt;ref name=Elyachar /&gt; Elyachar argues though, that these programs not only were a failure, but that they shifted cultural opinions of [[value (personal and cultural)]] in a way that favored Western ways of thinking and being.&lt;ref name=Elyachar /&gt;

===Ties to development studies===
Often, methods of promoting development and social justice to  are critiqued as being imperialistic, in a cultural sense. For example, Chandra Mohanty has critiqued Western [[feminism]], claiming that it has created a misrepresentation of the "third world woman" as being completely powerless, unable to resist male dominance.&lt;ref name=Mohanty&gt;Mohanty, Chandra. 1988. "Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses" ''Feminist Review'' no. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this leads to the often critiqued narrative of the "white man" saving the "brown woman" from the "brown man." Other, more radical critiques of [[development studies]], have to do with the field of study itself. Some scholars even question the intentions of those developing the field of study, claiming that efforts to "develop" the [[Global South]] were never about the South itself. Instead, these efforts, it is argued, were made in order to advance Western development and reinforce Western hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dossa | first1 = Shiraz | year = 2007 | title = Slicing Up 'Development': Colonialism, political theory, ethics | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 887–899 | doi=10.1080/01436590701371595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ties to media effects studies===
The core of cultural imperialism thesis is integrated with the political-economy traditional approach in media effects research. Critics of cultural imperialism commonly claim that non-Western cultures, particularly from the Third World, will forsake their traditional values and lose their cultural identities when they are solely exposed to Western media. Nonetheless, Michael B. Salwen, in his book ''Critical Studies in Mass Communication'' (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Salwen, Michael B. 1991. "Cultural Imperialism: A Media Effects Approach." Critical Studies In Mass Communication 8, no. 1: 29. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete, EBSCOhost&lt;/ref&gt; claims that cross-consideration and integration of empirical findings on cultural imperialist influences is very critical in terms of understanding mass media in the international sphere. He recognizes both of contradictory contexts on cultural imperialist impacts. 
The first context is where cultural imperialism imposes socio-political disruptions on developing nations. Western media can distort images of foreign cultures and provoke personal and social conflicts to developing nations in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, A.s., Tan, G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another context is that peoples in developing nations resist to foreign media and preserve their cultural attitudes. Although he admits that outward manifestations of Western culture may be adopted, but the fundamental values and behaviors remain still. Furthermore, positive effects might occur when male-dominated cultures adopt the “liberation” of women with exposure to Western media&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; and it stimulates ample exchange of cultural exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Sparkes, V. (1977). TV across the Canadian border: Does it matter? Journal of Communication,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of "cultural imperialism theory"===
Critics of scholars who discuss cultural imperialism have a number of critiques. ''Cultural imperialism'' is a term that is only used in discussions where [[cultural relativism]] and [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] are generally taken as true. (One cannot critique promoting Western values if one believes that said values are absolutely correct. Similarly, one cannot argue that Western epistemology is unjustly promoted in non-Western societies if one believes that those epistemologies are absolutely correct.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;) Therefore, those who disagree with cultural relativism and/or constructivism may critique the employment of the term, ''cultural imperialism'' on those terms.

John Tomlinson provides a critique of cultural imperialism theory and reveals major problems in the way in which the idea of cultural, as opposed to economic or political, imperialism is formulated. In his book ''Cultural Imperialism: A Critical Introduction'', he delves into the much debated “[[media imperialism]]” theory. Summarizing research on the Third World’s reception of American television shows, he challenges the cultural imperialism argument, conveying his doubts about the degree to which US shows in developing nations actually carry US values and improve the profits of US companies. Tomlinson suggests that cultural imperialism is growing in some respects, but local transformation and interpretations of imported media products propose that cultural diversification is not at an end in global society.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J. and Boli, John (2009). ''The Globalization Reader'' (4th ed), Wiley-Blackwell. p.341&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that one of the fundamental conceptual mistakes of cultural imperialism is to take for granted that the distribution of cultural goods can be considered as cultural dominance. He thus supports his argument highly criticizing the concept that [[Americanization]] is occurring through global overflow of American television products. He points to a myriad of examples of television networks who have managed to dominate their domestic markets and that domestic programs generally top the ratings. He also doubts the concept that cultural agents are passive receivers of information. He states that movement between cultural/geographical areas always involves translation, mutation, adaptation, and the creation of hybridity.

Other major critiques are that the term is not defined well, and employs further terms that are not defined well, and therefore lacks explanatory power, that ''cultural imperialism'' is hard to measure, and that the theory of a legacy of [[colonialism]] is not always true.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

===Rothkopf on dealing with cultural dominance===
[[David Rothkopf]], managing director of [[Kissinger Associates]] and an adjunct professor of [[international relations|international affairs]] at [[Columbia University]] (who also served as a senior [[US Commerce Department]] official in the [[Clinton Administration]]), wrote about cultural imperialism in his provocatively titled ''In Praise of Cultural Imperialism?'' in the summer 1997 issue of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. Rothkopf says that the United States should embrace "cultural imperialism" as in its self-interest. But his definition of cultural imperialism stresses spreading the values of [[Toleration|tolerance]] and openness to cultural change in order to avoid war and conflict between cultures as well as expanding accepted technological and legal standards to provide free traders with enough security to do business with more countries. Rothkopf's definition almost exclusively involves allowing individuals in other nations to accept or reject foreign cultural influences. He also mentions, but only in passing, the use of the [[English language]] and consumption of news and popular music and film as cultural dominance that he supports. Rothkopf additionally makes the point that [[globalization]] and the [[Internet]] are accelerating the process of cultural influence.&lt;ref name=rothkopf&gt;Rothkopf, David, [http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/globcult.htm "In Praise of Cultural Imperialism"], ''Foreign Affairs'', Summer 1997, Volume 107, pp. 38–53; all descriptions of Rothkopf's points and his quotes are from this article {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117105019/http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/globcult.htm |date=17 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture is sometimes used by the organizers of society—politicians, theologians, academics, and families—to impose and ensure order, the rudiments of which change over time as need dictates. One need only look at the 20th century's [[genocide]]s. In each one, leaders used culture as a political front to fuel the passions of their armies and other minions and to justify their actions among their people.

Rothkopf then cites genocide and [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]]s in [[Armenia]], Russia, the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Cambodia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Rwanda]] and [[East Timor]] as examples of culture (in some cases expressed in the ideology of "political culture" or religion) being misused to justify violence. He also acknowledges that cultural imperialism in the past has been guilty of forcefully eliminating the cultures of natives in the Americas and in Africa, or through use of the [[Inquisition]], ''"and during the expansion of virtually every [[empire]]."''.The most important way to deal with cultural influence in any nation, according to Rothkopf, is to promote tolerance and allow, or even promote, cultural diversities that are compatible with tolerance and to eliminate those cultural differences that cause violent conflict:

:Successful multicultural societies, be they nations, federations, or other conglomerations of closely interrelated states, discern those aspects of culture that do not threaten union, stability, or prosperity (such as food, holidays, rituals, and music) and allow them to flourish. But they counteract or eradicate the more subversive elements of culture (exclusionary aspects of religion, language, and political/ideological beliefs). History shows that bridging cultural gaps successfully and serving as a home to diverse peoples requires certain social structures, laws, and institutions that transcend culture. Furthermore, the history of a number of ongoing experiments in [[multiculturalism]], such as in the European Union, India, South Africa, Canada and the United States, suggests that workable, if not perfected, integrative models exist. Each is built on the idea that tolerance is crucial to social well-being, and each at times has been threatened by both intolerance and a heightened emphasis on cultural distinctions. The greater public good warrants eliminating those cultural characteristics that promote conflict or prevent harmony, even as less-divisive, more personally observed cultural distinctions are celebrated and preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = O'Meara | first1 = Patrick. | last2 = Mehlinger | first2 = Howard D. | last3 = Krain | first3 = Matthew. | title = Globalization and the challenges of a new century : a reader | year = 2000 | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington, Ind. | isbn = 978-0-253-21355-6 | pages = 445–446 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLwlnhq01RIC&amp;dq=Globalization+and+the+challenges&amp;q=445+chinese#v=snippet&amp;q=445%20chinese&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural dominance can also be seen in the 1930s in Australia where the Aboriginal Assimilation Policy acted as an attempt to wipe out the Native Australian people. The British settlers tried to biologically alter the skin colour of the Australian Aboriginal people through mixed breeding with white people. The policy also made attempts to forcefully conform the Aborigines to western ideas of dress and education.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Caruso, Australian Feminist Studies, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In history==
Although the term was popularized in the 1960s, and was used by its original proponents to refer to cultural hegemonies in a post-colonial world, cultural imperialism has also been used to refer to times further in the past.

===Ancient Rome===
The [[Roman Empire]] has been seen as an early example of cultural imperialism.

Early Rome, in its conquest of Italy, assimilated the people of [[Etruria]] by replacing the [[Etruscan language]] with Latin, which led to the demise of that language and many aspects of [[Etruscan civilization]].&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;Kolb, RW., [https://books.google.com/books?id=v751AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT607&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M-meVaXiFKe27Abz8K7QCA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20rome&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of Business Ethics and Society''], SAGE Publications, 2007, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] was imposed on many parts of Rome's empire by "many regions receiving Roman culture unwillingly, as a form of cultural imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Ermatinger, JW., [https://books.google.com/books?id=EdBEHD4XQ-0C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p-ieVZusJKnD7gbzloLQBQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20rome&amp;f=false ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when Greece was conquered by the Roman armies, Rome set about altering the culture of Greece to conform with Roman ideals. For instance, the Greek habit of stripping naked, in public, for exercise, was looked on askance by Roman writers, who considered the practice to be a cause of the Greeks' effeminacy and enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill, S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=rbwCTL507fsC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p-ieVZusJKnD7gbzloLQBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=snippet&amp;q=naked%20plutarch%20open%20air&amp;f=false ''Being Greek Under Rome: Cultural Identity, the Second Sophistic and the Development of Empire''], Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 2 &amp; 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman example has been linked to modern instances of European imperialism in African countries, bridging the two instances with Slavoj Zizek's discussions of 'empty signifiers'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/sabrin_mohammed_201305_phd.pdf|title=EXPLORING THE INTELLECTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF EGYPTIAN NATIONAL EDUCATION|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pax Romana]] was secured in the empire, in part, by the "forced acculturation of the culturally diverse populations that Rome had conquered."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

===British Empire===
British worldwide expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries was an economic and political phenomenon. However, "there was also a strong social and cultural dimension to it, which [[Rudyard Kipling]] termed the '[[white man's burden]]'." One of the ways this was carried out was by religious proselytising, by, amongst others, the [[London Missionary Society]], which was "an agent of British cultural imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Olson, JS.; Shadle, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=f0VnzMelzm8C&amp;pg=PA682&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5o6fVaTwEump7Ab4r4PoCQ&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20british%20empire%20-sport&amp;f=false ''Historical Dictionary of the British Empire, Volume 2''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, p. 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Another way, was by the imposition of educational material on the colonies for an "imperial curriculum". Morag Bell writes, "The promotion of empire through books, illustrative materials, and educational syllabuses was widespread, part of an education policy geared to cultural imperialism".&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=sGa7AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+curriculum#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20curriculum&amp;f=false ''Geography and Imperialism, 1820-1940''], Manchester University Press, 1995, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; This was also true of science and technology in the empire. Douglas M. Peers and Nandini Gooptu note that "Most scholars of colonial science in India now prefer to stress the ways in which science and technology worked in the service of colonialism, as both a 'tool of empire' in the practical sense and as a vehicle for cultural imperialism. In other words, science developed in India in ways that reflected colonial priorities, tending to benefit Europeans at the expense of Indians, while remaining dependent on and subservient to scientific authorities in the colonial metropolis."&lt;ref&gt;Peers, DM.; Gooptu, N., [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTYfAQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+science#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20science&amp;f=false ''India and the British Empire''], OUP Oxford, 2012. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of cultural imperialism carried out by Edward Said drew principally from a study of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbgNECex-mkC&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''The Debate on the Rise of British Imperialism''], Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Danilo Raponi, the cultural imperialism of the British in the 19th century had a much wider effect than only in the British Empire. He writes, "To paraphrase Said, I see cultural imperialism as a complex cultural hegemony of a country, Great Britain, that in the 19th century had no rivals in terms of its ability to project its power across the world and to influence the cultural, political and commercial affairs of most countries. It is the 'cultural hegemony' of a country whose power to export the most fundamental ideas and concepts at the basis of its understanding of 'civilisation' knew practically no bounds." In this, for example, Raponi includes Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Raponi, D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=gw5HBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+manifest#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20manifest&amp;f=false ''Religion and Politics in the Risorgimento: Britain and the New Italy, 1861-1875''], Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other pre-Second World War examples===
The [[New Cambridge Modern History]] writes about the cultural imperialism of [[Napoleonic France]]. Napoleon used the [[Institut de France]] "as an instrument for transmuting French universalism into cultural imperialism." Members of the Institute (who included Napoleon), descended upon Egypt in 1798. "Upon arrival they organised themselves into an Institute of Cairo. The Rosetta Stone is their most famous find. The science of Egyptology is their legacy."&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, CW. (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mfV7qQ_oiVEC&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+nazi+war&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+egypt+126#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20egypt%20126&amp;f=false ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 9, War and Peace in an Age of Upheaval, 1793-1830'']. Cambridge University Press, 1965, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[First World War]], Germans were worried about the extent of French influence in the annexed [[Rhineland]], with the French [[occupation of the Ruhr]] Valley in 1923. An early use of the term appeared in an essay by Paul Ruhlmann (as "Peter Hartmann") at that date, entitled ''French Cultural Imperialism on the Rhine''.&lt;ref&gt;Poley, J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=q__sRFdeKeIC&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+french&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+french+rhine+1923#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20french%20rhine%201923&amp;f=false ''Decolonisation in Germany: Weimar Narratives of Colonial Loss and Foreign Occupation''], Peter Lang, 2007, pp. 165 &amp; 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi colonialism===
''Cultural imperialism'' has also been used in connection with the expansion of German influence under the [[Nazis]] in the middle of the twentieth century. Alan Steinweis and Daniel Rogers note that even before the Nazis came to power, "Already in the Weimar Republic, German academic specialists on eastern Europe had contributed through their publications and teaching to the legitimization of German territorial [[revanchism]] and cultural imperialism. These scholars operated primarily in the disciplines Of history, economics, geography, and literature."&lt;ref&gt;Steinweis, AE; Rogers, DE., [https://books.google.com/books?id=RZ7igJKC6YQC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgKahUKEwj5n8CUo9_GAhUDPhQKHYxuAHk#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''The Impact of Nazism: New Perspectives on the Third Reich and Its Legacy']', U of Nebraska Press, 2003, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of music, Michael Kater writes that during the WWII German occupation of France, [[Hans Rosbaud]], a German conductor based by the Nazi regime in [[Strasbourg]], became "at least nominally, a servant of Nazi cultural imperialism directed against the French."&lt;ref&gt;Kater, MH., [https://books.google.com/books?id=JGSDC5w-pfMC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBzgKahUKEwj5n8CUo9_GAhUDPhQKHYxuAHk#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''Composers of the Nazi Era: Eight Portraits''], Oxford University Press, USA, 1999, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy during the war, Germany pursued "a European cultural front that gravitates around German culture". The Nazi propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] set up the European Union of Writers, "one of Goebbels's most ambitious projects for Nazi cultural hegemony. Presumably a means of gathering authors from Germany, Italy, and the occupied countries to plan the literary life of the new Europe, the union soon emerged as a vehicle of German cultural imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Ghiat, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=MBFe5v2ZTy4C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBWoVChMI6_-fgarfxgIVAVYUCh3gCgAb#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''Fascist Modernities: Italy, 1922-1945''], University of California Press, 2001, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

For other parts of Europe, [[Robert Gerwarth]], writing about cultural imperialism and [[Reinhard Heydrich]], states that the "Nazis' Germanization project was based on a historically unprecedented programme of racial stock-taking, theft, expulsion and murder." Also, "The full integration of the [Czech] [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]] into this New Order required the complete Germanization of the Protectorate's cultural life and the eradication of indigenous Czech and Jewish culture."&lt;ref&gt;Gerwarth, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yUz33XJnJOMC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgoahUKEwjr3IjAsd_GAhVKOhQKHdsQC1E#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''Hitler's Hangman: The Life of Heydrich''], Yale University Press, 2011, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actions by [[Nazi Germany]] reflect on the notion of race and culture playing a significant role in imperialism. The idea that there is a distinction between the Germans and the Jews has created the illusion of Germans believing they were superior to the Jewish inferiors, the notion of us/them and self/others.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek, Johnston, Ron, and Pratt, Geraldine, eds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7368">The '''Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology''' (1992–2006) was a research institute established at [[MIT]], and housed in a renovated building (E56) on campus at 38 [[Memorial Drive (Cambridge)|Memorial Drive]], overlooking the [[Charles River]].&lt;ref name="MIT_news"&gt;Charles H.

==Description==
At the heart of the Institute was the [[Burndy Library]] on the ground floor, initially containing 37,000 volumes on the [[history of science and technology]]  collected by the Dibner Fund.  The Library also possessed a large collection of antique scientific instruments, such as [[astrolabe]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, early [[spectrometer]]s, and a [[Wimshurst machine]], which were on public display in a dedicated gallery outside the library.  Also on display was a large collection of antique [[incandescent light]] bulbs, [[gas discharge tube]]s, electronic [[vacuum tube]]s, and other early examples of electrical and electronic technology.  The Library would mount occasional special exhibits, such as ''The Afterlife of Immortality: Obelisks Outside Egypt''.&lt;ref name=Obelisks&gt;{{cite web|title=Burndy Library exhibit examines obelisks over the centuries|url=http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/obelisk-0315.html|work=MIT Tech Talk|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Above the Library and display space, on the second and third floor were offices and lecture and seminar rooms.  The Institute held regular lectures, seminars, study programs, and an annual symposium in the history of science and technology.  Over the period of its existence, the Institute supported over 340 short- and longer-term fellowships.&lt;ref name="Roland2005" /&gt;

== History and development == 
The Institute was named in honor of [[Bern Dibner]] (1897–1988), who had conceived of it before his death. The Institute was developed and supported by the Dibner Fund he had established in 1957, directed by his son [[David Dibner]].&lt;ref name="Roland2005" /&gt;The institute, from its inception was run by executive director, Evelyn Simha. On the academic side, the Institute was supported by a consortium of MIT, [[Boston University]], [[Brandeis University]] and [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="MIT_news" /&gt;

In 1995, the 600-volume Babson Collection of historical material related to [[Isaac Newton]] was placed on permanent deposit with the Burndy Library.  The collection had been assembled by [[Roger Babson]], founder of [[Babson College]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], and was previously housed at the College.&lt;ref name=Babson&gt;{{cite web|title=Babson collection of Newtonia to be housed at Burndy Library|url=http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/1995/babson-0301.html|work=MIT Tech Talk|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the addition of the 7,000-volume Volterra Collection from Italy increased the Burndy Library collection by more than a third.&lt;ref name=DibnerVolterra&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Benjamin|title=Library marks major acquisition|url=http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/1999/dibner-1208.html|work=MIT Tech Talk|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004 MIT decided not to renew its affiliation, and the Dibner family began looking for a new location to house the collection.  David Dibner died unexpectedly in 2005.&lt;ref name=DibnerObit&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Sarah|title=David Dibner, philanthropist, dies at 78|url=http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/2005/obit-dibner.html|work=MIT Tech Talk|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Dibner Institute closed in 2006,&lt;ref name="Roland2005" /&gt; and the Burndy Library and associated collections were transferred to [[The Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California|San Marino]], [[California]], which now offers a Dibner History of Science Program to fund fellowships, a lecture series and annual conference.&lt;ref name=BurndyLibrary_Huntington&gt;[http://huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=568 Institutes at The Huntington Library]&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of the Burndy Library (by then numbering 67,000 volumes) transformed the Huntington Library's collections in the history of science and technology into one of the world's largest in that field.&lt;ref name=Huntington&gt;{{cite web|title=The Huntington's History of Science Collections|url=http://huntington.org/uploadedFiles/Files/PDFs/pr_dibner_collections.pdf|work=Huntington Library [website]|publisher=The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Huntington houses a permanent exhibition, ''Beautiful Science: Ideas that Changed the World'', in the {{convert|2800|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Dibner Hall of the History of Science that displays approximately 150 books, manuscripts, photographs and objects from both the Burndy Library and the Huntington's non-Burndy holdings in the history of science and medicine.&lt;ref name=BeautifulScience&gt;{{cite web|title=Beautiful Science: Ideas that Changed the World|url=http://huntington.org/uploadedFiles/Files/PDFs/pr_dibner_highlights.pdf|work=Huntington Library [website]|publisher=The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Approximately 200 antique light bulbs from the Burndy Collection are on display in the ''Beautiful Science'' exhibition. The light bulbs are not available for reference or research use, except by special arrangement. The status and accessibility of the Burndy collection of [[gas tube]]s, [[vacuum tubes]], and [[electronic components|electronic artifacts]] is not clear from the Huntington website.

The Dibner Institute's former building was demolished in early 2007 to make way for new buildings for the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/2006/dibner-trees-1220.html New home for Dibner trees], ''[[MIT Tech Talk]]'', December 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Dibner name remains at MIT, in the endowed Frances and David Dibner Professorship of the History of Engineering and Manufacturing.

{{one source|date=October 2018}}
An '''elicitation technique''' is any of a number of [[data collection]] techniques used in [[anthropology]], [[cognitive science]], counseling, [[education]], [[knowledge engineering]], [[linguistics]], [[management]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], or other fields to gather knowledge or information from people. Elicitation, in which knowledge is sought directly from human beings, is usually distinguished from indirect methods such as gathering information from written sources.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooke |first=Nancy J. |title=Varieties of knowledge elicitation techniques |journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies |volume=41 |year=1994 |pages=801–849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who interacts with [[Human subject research|human subjects]] in order to elicit information from them may be called an ''elicitor'', an ''analyst'', ''experimenter'', or ''knowledge engineer'', depending on the field of study.&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt;

Elicitation techniques include [[interview]]s, observation of either naturally occurring  behavior (including as part of [[participant observation]]) or behavior in a laboratory setting, or the analysis of assigned tasks.&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt;

An '''extravaganza''' is a literary or musical work (often [[musical theatre]]) characterized by freedom of style and structure and usually containing elements of [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], [[pantomime]], [[music hall]] and parody. It sometimes also has elements of cabaret, circus, [[revue]], variety, [[vaudeville]] and [[mime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-199143/extravaganza |title=Encyclopædia Britannica online |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Extravaganza'' may more broadly refer to an elaborate, spectacular, and expensive theatrical production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ewen, David|title=Panorama of American Popular Music|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was widely used to describe a type of 19th-century British drama made popular by [[James Planché]].  Planché defined it as "the whimsical treatment of a poetical subject."&lt;ref&gt;Planché.  ''The recollections and reflections of J.R. Planché (Somerset herald): a professional biography'' (1872), Vol. II, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from the Italian word ''stravaganza'', meaning extravagance.

'''Facilities engineering''' evolved from "[[Plant Engineering|plant engineering]]" in the early 1990s as U.S. workplaces became more complex. Practitioners preferred this term because it more accurately reflected the multidisciplinary demands for specialized conditions in a wider variety of indoor environments, not merely [[manufacturing plants]].

Today, a '''facilities engineer''' (vs. a facilities manager) typically has hands-on responsibility for the employer's [[Electrical engineering]], maintenance, environmental, health, safety, energy, controls/instrumentation, [[civil engineering]], and [[HVAC]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Facilities Engineer|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-facilities-engineer.htm|publisher=thinkGeek|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The need for expertise in these categories varies widely depending on whether the facility is, for example, a single-use site or a multi-use campus; whether it is an office, school, hospital, museum, processing/production plant, etc.

== History ==
[[File:Engineers_working_on_a_generator.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Engineers_working_on_a_generator.jpg|thumb|Working on a generator.&lt;ref&gt;Kühn, S. (Photographer). (2005). ''Nuclear Power Plant Cattenom.'' [Photograph], Retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nuclear_Power_Plant_Cattenom.jpg&lt;/nowiki&gt;   &lt;/ref&gt;]]The term '''Facilities Engineer''' emerged in the 1990s from the already existing vocation of the [[Plant Engineering|Plant Engineer]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hira, G. G. (2016, December). ''History of plant and facilities engineering in the united states and'' ''the afe''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.afe.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=244299&amp;module_id=170318&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution occurred in order to match the rapid advancements in technology at the time. There was a need for a more specialized and dynamic type of engineer, while still having the general background knowledge and experience of a plant engineer or a stationary engineer. These skills consisted of, but were not limited to: mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, environmental engineering, civil engineering, business management, statistical analysis, communications, and effective supervision skills.&lt;ref&gt;Mobley, R. K. (2001). ''Plant engineer’s handbook''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral.proquest.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this development was a jack-of-all-trades engineer who takes their specialization into a facility and helps it operate unhindered at its highest level of efficiency. That is to say that a facilities engineer is quite simply a plant engineer placed into a position where they must utilize a certain set of skills based upon the necessity of the employer. This need generally calls for hands-on maintenance but can also include managerial or even supervisorial responsibilities. While the purpose of a facilities engineer may seem straight forward, the large variety in facilities within different industries calls for a very broad range of training.

== Objectives ==
Facilities engineers have the responsibility of establishing different projects in support of the plant's design and operation needs to be able to ensure an efficient and all the different aspects of safety are met up to standard. The industries that Facilities engineers can go into are the one that would typically require different plant layout plans, need organizational needs, and require different equipment and purchasing needs such as Health Care, Aerospace/Defense, and Energy/Utilities industries. They can also seek employment position such as [[operating engineer]], a [[chief engineer]], a facilities manager, maintenance foreman, or as a building maintenance supervisor. (learn.org)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.org/articles/Facilities_Engineer_Career_and_Salary_FAQs.html|title=Facilities Engineer: Career and Salary Facts|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facilities Engineers may be given management positions in the plants that they are working on to supervise the other facilities engineers and their license requirements, equipment provided, and getting the rights vendors hired to be able to meet the needs for the plant or facility. When working on certain projects, facilities engineers must meet the appropriate amount of resources such as hands and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-facilities-maintenance-manager-do.htm|title=What does a Facilities Maintenance Manager do? (with pictures)|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Some of the objectives that Facilities engineers must face are ==

* Analyzing, designing, and developing basic systems and plants knowledge to be able to improve quality and production
* Lead/analyze projects and technical responsibilities that a typical facility would have to go through on a day-to-day basis
* Be able to be a leader and function well in professional teams and overlooking staff/workers in a project
* Being able to Communicate effectively with different methods such as speaking and writing, and be able to argue efficiently and compellingly when having the positions of a foreman, manager or a supervisor
* Knowing professional and ethical morals when pushing forward the safety and regulation of a system operating efficiently and having the maintenance skills to be able to solve any problems presented (Majors, csum.edu)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csum.edu/web/majors/majors|title=Majors - CSUM|website=www.csum.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training ==
[[File:Dirty_Jobs,_Power_Plant_120213-F-UP786-158.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dirty_Jobs,_Power_Plant_120213-F-UP786-158.jpg|thumb|Working in a power plant.&lt;ref&gt;Kühn, S.

[Photograph], Retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nuclear_Power_Plant_Cattenom.jpg&lt;/nowiki&gt;   &lt;/ref&gt;]]Due to a major advancement in industrial and commercial construction, in conjunction with a highly increased emphasis on energy efficiency, it is not uncommon for colleges and universities to have courses and degrees specifically allocated to facilities engineering. For example, in the late 1990s Purdue University created a graduate course with an emphasis on the various mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and control skills necessary to maintain and increase the efficiency of these facilities. These skills consist of: mechanical measurements, calculations, basics of [[HVAC]], the piping included in systems and associated equipment, efficiency in electricity and power, [[induction motor]]s and [[variable speed drives]], electrical systems, wiring, and lighting.&lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, W.E., Hutzel, W.J., &amp; Skvarenina, T.L. (1999, June) An Interdisciplinary Facilities Engineering Technology Graduate Course. ''ASEE Annual Conference 1999. [Proceedings]''. 733-739. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://peer.asee.org/an-interdisciplinary-facilities-engineering-technology-graduate-course&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Since facilities engineering has such a broad scope due to its wide array of necessary skills, courses tend to include education and hands-on training in virtually every aspect of engineering. This includes principles from [[software engineering]] and basic programming and coding in at least one language. However, the main focuses of these facilities engineering degrees tend to be on HVAC and energy efficiency. Other methods of training are certification courses sponsored and offered by the Association for Facilities Engineers. The Association for Facilities Engineers (AFE) was created by the American Institute of Plant Engineers, which was consisted of a highly regarded group of like-minded engineers or aspiring engineers who shared a common goal. This goal was to create new methods in which facilities engineers, plant engineers, facilities managers, and facility supervisors could become more efficient and productive in their various trades.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Hira, G. G. (2016, December). ''History of plant and facilities engineering in the united states and'' ''the afe''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.afe.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=244299&amp;module_id=170318&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn would not only benefit the prospective engineers and managers, but was also intended to help economically advance the industries in which these trainees work. These certifications help to train engineers, supervisors, and maintenance managers in accordance with the methods necessary to maintain and efficiently work in and/or run a plant operating based on modern technological standards. With all of this training facilities engineers are capable of working in just about any facility, which can come in some variety.

== Educational Requirements ==
Facilities engineers are not required to have at least a bachelor's degree but most of them do for experience and it is not unusual to see many facilities engineers with master's degrees in the given fields. They must have that degree in either structural engineering, mechanical engineering, or manufacturing engineering. Most employers require one to have 3-10 ten years of experience before they will consider someone as eligible for the given job. Depending on how skilled the job is. Licensure and certification are required by a lot of employers, consisting of a professional engineer license, an EPA certification and boiler operator license, and an EPA certification. EPA also was known as Environmental Protection Agency is in charge of protecting human health and the environment, and the certificate for Facilities engineer makes sure the person receiving the certificate is well aware of these dangers. Most importantly all Facilities engineers must be able to problem solve, be able to communicate there verbal and written skills, know the building process of the specific job, and know the specific code requirements for the given job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academicinvest.com/engineering-careers/industrial-engineering-careers/how-to-become-a-facilities-engineer|title=How to Become a Facilities Engineer {{!}} Academic Invest|website=www.academicinvest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some facilities engineers can the bachelors in science degree and required license but they can also receive an associate degree applied in science for Facilities engineering technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triton.edu/CollegeCatalog/facilities-engineering-technology.htm|title=Facilities Engineering Technology|website=www.triton.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Course Work Requirements ===
The subjects that a Facilities engineer is typically required to know is:

-Science courses FE should take are: Chemistry, Chemistry of Plant Processes, Engineering Physics, Properties of Materials, Strength of Materials, [[Thermodynamics]]

-Online courses: Engineering Graphics, Programming Applications, Electronics

-A full engineer course path should include: Plant operations, Boilers, Steam Plant Watch Team Management, Turbines, Statics, Facilities Engineering Diagnostics Lab, Electrical Circuits, Dynamics, Power Generation Plants, Fluid Mechanics, Engineering Management, Instrumentation and Measurement, Facilities Management, Automation, Power Engineering Technology, Engineering Ethics

-Mathematics particularly College Algebra and Trigonometry, Calculus

-Other classes they are supposed to take are: Welding, Manufacturing Processes, Steam Plant System Operations, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, Electrical Machinery, Heating, Ventilation, and A/C&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csum.edu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=bf5f536f-5018-44d1-8d37-12a2d391a523&amp;groupId=4036400|title=FET Curriculum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csum.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nuclear Power Plant Cattenom.'' [Photograph], Retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nuclear_Power_Plant_Cattenom.jpg&lt;/nowiki&gt;   &lt;/ref&gt;]]Due to the broad nature of a '''Facilities Engineer''', the responsibilities utilized in one facility could be drastically different than in another. For example, a facilities engineer working at [[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]] located at [[Moffett Federal Airfield|Moffet Field]], would be responsible for helping to oversee and assist specialists in building, renovating/modernizing, and preserving the facilities on the campus; the facilities engineering branch also includes [[architectural engineering]], [[civil engineering]], structural engineering, [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and pressure system safety.&lt;ref&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration. (2016). ''Facilities engineering &amp; real properties management division''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://jc.arc.nasa.gov/jceindex.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the responsibilities entail any type of engineering support that goes on at the facilities’ location in addition to the construction and renovation of the facilities themselves. While, a facilities engineer working for the [[Indian Health Service]] would be responsible to ensure that health care facilities and related support facilities are in a safe and functional condition. These skills entail civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering, as well as specialization in medical equipment, property management, and various aspects of engineering support.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Health Service. ''Facilities engineering.'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.ihs.gov/phoenix/programsservices/facilitiesengineering/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities lie in the maintenance of the physical structure of the facilities, while the differences are in regards to what machinery and systems are present within the facilities. This will differ based on the nature of the facility and its intended purpose. Other types of skills and projects can include inventive methods in order to increases in the energy efficiency of a facility. For example, a team of engineering and technical professionals and facilities engineers at [[Naval Base Coronado]] in San Diego, California successfully implemented a multipurpose [[solar power]] grid capable of providing enough power to sustain 935 homes per day, while also providing shade in their parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;Business Editors/Energy Writers. (2002, Nov 08). United states navy to deploy largest federal solar electric system in the nation; 750 kW photovoltaic system installed at naval base Coronado, California. ''Business Wire.'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://login.ezproxy.csum.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/444939381?accountid=10353&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This project ultimately provides greater energy efficiency, energy independence, and cost reduction for the facility in addition to contributing to and supporting renewable and sustainable energy.

Additionally the [[US Department of Defense]] (DoD) has created a Facilities Engineering career field as part of the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics workforce.  That career field is not limited to indoor environments.  In the DoD, the field also encompasses Real Estate, Ranges and the management of Linear Structures such as roadways, fences, and pipelines. DoD offers three levels of certification for professionals in this field.

A '''figure of speech''' or '''rhetorical figure'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWBgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA113 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508135920/https://books.google.com/books?id=YWBgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA113 |archivedate=2016-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[figurative language]] in the form of a single [[word]] or [[phrase]]. It can be a special repetition, arrangement or omission of words with literal meaning, or a phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words.{{dubious|date=July 2016}} Figures of speech often provide emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use, as figures of speech can introduce an ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretation.{{dubious|date=July 2016}}

== Four rhetorical operations ==
{{Main|Rhetorical operations}}

[[Classical rhetoric]]ians classified figures of speech into [[rhetorical operations|four categories]] or ''[[quadripartita]] ratio'':&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen, Jeroen (2008) ''[http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio Imitatio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714140654/http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio |date=2015-07-14 }}'' {{ISBN|978-90-8704-027-7}} [http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205211147/http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html |date=2008-12-05 }} translated to English by Kristine Steenbergh. Quote from the summary: &lt;blockquote&gt;Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils’ own writing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* addition (''adiectio''), also called repetition/expansion/superabundance
* omission (''detractio''), also called subtraction/abridgement/lack
* transposition (''transmutatio''), also called transferring
* permutation (''immutatio''), also called switching/interchange/substitution/transmutation

These categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', of unknown authorship, where they are called πλεονασμός (addition), ἔνδεια (omission), μετάθεσις (transposition) and ἐναλλαγή (permutation).&lt;ref&gt;Book V, 21.29, pp.303–5&lt;/ref&gt; Quintillian then mentioned them in ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Institutio Oratoria, Vol. I, Book I, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/1B*.html Chapter 5], paragraphs 6 and 38–41. And also in Book VI [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/6C*.html Chapter 3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philo of Alexandria]] also listed them as addition (πρόσθεσις), subtraction (ἀφαίρεσις), transposition (μετάθεσις), and transmutation (ἀλλοίωσις).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4B*.html Rhetorica ad Herennium]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Figures of speech come in many varieties. The aim is to use the language inventively to accentuate the effect of what is being said. A few examples follow:

* "Around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran" is an example of [[alliteration]], where the consonant ''r'' is used repeatedly.
:Whereas, "Sister Suzy sewing socks for soldiers" is a particular form of alliteration called [[sibilance]], because it repeats the letter ''s''.
:Both are commonly used in poetry.
* "She would run up the stairs and then a new set of curtains" is a variety of [[zeugma]] called a [[syllepsis]]. ''Run up'' refers to ascending and also to manufacturing. The effect is enhanced by the momentary suggestion, through a [[pun]], that she might be climbing up the curtains. The [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] or omission of the second use of the verb makes the reader think harder about what is being said.
* "Painful pride" is an [[oxymoron]] where two contradictory ideas are placed in the same sentence.
*"An Einstein" is an example of [[synecdoche]], as it uses a particular name to represent a class of people: geniuses.
* "I had butterflies in my stomach" is a [[metaphor]], referring to a nervous feeling as if there were flying insects in one's stomach.
:To say "it was like having some butterflies in my stomach" would be a [[simile]], because it uses the word ''like'' which is missing in the metaphor.
:To say "It was like having a butterfly farm in my stomach", "It felt like a butterfly farm in my stomach", or "I was so nervous that I had a butterfly farm in my stomach" could be a [[hyperbole]], because it is exaggerated.
*"That filthy place was really dirty" is an example of [[Tautology (grammar)|tautology]], as there are the two words ('filthy' and 'dirty') having almost the same meaning and are repeated so as to make the text more emphatic.

Scholars of classical Western rhetoric have divided figures of speech into two main categories: schemes and tropes. ''[[Scheme (linguistics)|Schemes]]'' (from the Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|schēma}}, 'form or shape') are figures of speech that change the ordinary or expected pattern of words. For example, the phrase, "John, my best friend" uses the scheme known as [[apposition]]. ''[[Trope (linguistics)|Tropes]]'' (from Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|trepein}}, 'to turn') change the general meaning of words. An example of a trope is irony, which is the use of words to convey the opposite of their usual meaning ("For Brutus is an honorable man; / So are they all, all honorable men").

During the [[Renaissance]], scholars meticulously enumerated and classified figures of speech. [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], for example, in his ''The Garden of Eloquence'' (1577), enumerated 184 different figures of speech. Professor Robert DiYanni, in his book "Literature – Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay"&lt;ref&gt;Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-557112-9}}, pp.451&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different ''figures of speech'', expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense."

For simplicity, this article divides the figures between schemes and tropes, but does not further sub-classify them (e.g., "Figures of Disorder"). Within each category, words are listed alphabetically. Most entries link to a page that provides greater detail and relevant examples, but a short definition is placed here for convenience. Some of those listed may be considered [[rhetorical device]]s, which are similar in many ways.

Similarly, saying "She is not a beauty queen," means "She is ugly" or saying "I am not as young as I used to be" in order to avoid saying "I am old".

The '''NRC Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics''' ('''NRC-HIA''') is the leading [[Canada|Canadian]] centre for [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]].

== History ==
Named for the [[Nobel laureate]] [[Gerhard Herzberg]], it was formed in 1975 as part of the [[National Research Council of Canada]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]]. The NRC-HIA headquarters were moved to [[Victoria, British Columbia]], in 1995 to the site of the [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]].

== Facilities ==
NRC-HIA also operates the [[Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory]] outside of [[Penticton, British Columbia|Penticton, BC]] and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre as well as managing Canadian involvement in the [[Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope]],  [[Gemini Observatory]], [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]], the [[Square Kilometre Array]], and the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]], as well as Canada's national astronomy data centre.&lt;ref name="NRCC-HAA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/rd/nsi/index.html |title=NRCC - NRC Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics |access-date=9 December 2014 |quote=We operate Canada's national observatories and a national astronomy data centre }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The institute is also involved in the development and construction of instruments and telescopes.
* Members of NRC-HIA are currently involved in [[The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey]].
* Members of NRC-HIA are currently involved with [[Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey]].

The current director, as of 2013,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iau.org/administration/membership/individual/3815/&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Gregory Fahlman]].

== Plaskett Fellowship ==
The Plaskett Fellowship is named after [[John Stanley Plaskett]] and is awarded to an outstanding, recent doctoral graduate in astrophysics or a closely related discipline. Fellows conduct independent research in a stimulating, collegial environment at the institute in Victoria, BC, Canada. Expertise in observational astrophysics is the norm, but some theoreticians were also among this distinguished group of astronomers. The past Plaskett Fellows are listed below.

[[File:Kagal book.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869) by Jacob Brafman, in the Russian language original.]]
'''Iakov Aleksandrovich Brafman''' (1825—28 December 1879), commonly known as '''Jacob Brafman''', was a [[Russian Jew]] from near [[Minsk]], who became notable for converting first to [[Lutheranism]] and then the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. He was a leading polemicist against the [[qahal|kahal]] (the communal Jewish theocratic government in Russia) and the [[Talmud]]. Brafman's works ''The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods'' (1868) and ''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869) were foundational texts in establishing a theoretical basis to modern [[anti-Jewish]] thought in Russia and established a framework for themes later covered in ''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]''.
==Background==
Brafman was born in 1825 and lived in [[Kletsk]], a ''[[shtetl]]'' near [[Minsk]] in the [[Pale of Settlement]]. His father was a [[rabbi]]. The Jews had lived in the town since the 16th century, when it was part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], but had in Brafman's fathers lifetime become part of the [[Russian Empire]] following the [[Second Partition of Poland]]. Brafman grew up in poor conditions and was orphaned at a young age, being raised by relatives. Despite being under age, local agents of the ''[[qahal|kahal]]'' (the communal Jewish government ran by rabbis in the Pale, which dealt with taxation and conscription), placed Brafman on a list of "volunteers" for the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. Not being particularly fond of this idea, Brafman fled the reach of the kahal and went to Minsk, where he tried to establish himself as a [[photographer]].

Once in Minsk, Brafman converted to [[Lutheranism]] for a time, before in 1858 converting to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. There was a state visit to Minsk in that year by Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] and Brafman submitted a memorandum on how Jews in Russia should best be proselytized into Orthodox Christianity and educated into "useful" subjects. The dichtomy of useful and usless Jews had been established by Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]]. Nicholas saw "use" in bourgeois Jews who were willing to assimilate into Russian society and could be utilised in academic and agricultural professions, while seeing as "useless" the poorer adherents of [[Orthodox Judaism]] who lived in the ''shtets'' and kept themselves apart from wider society. Brafman's writing was sent to [[St. Petersburg]] and subsequently earned him the chair of [[Hebrew]] Studies at the Russian Orthodox Seminary in Minsk in 1860.&lt;ref name="yivo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Brafman_Iakov_Aleksandrovich|publisher=YIVO Encyclopedia|title=Brafman, Iakov Aleksandrovich|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brafman vs. the Kahal==
Brafman moved to [[Vilna]] in 1866 and began writing vehemently against the ''kahal'' and Jewish organisations more generally. Brafman; who had his own personal conflict with the ''kahal'' as a young man; argued that the kahal existed as a tyranny against individual Jews, while also being a system which enabled the exploitation of their non-Jewish neighbours.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} He argued that the mentality of the ''kahal'' was the main barrier to [[Jewish assimilation]]. Brafman worked on studying Jewish community books of the ''kahal'' from Minsk from the years 1794 and 1833, with his own commentary added to try and prove his thesis; at the same time the Rabbinical Seminary of Vilna was providing their own Russian translation. Brafman published his findings as ''The Book of the Kahal: Materials for the Study of the Jewish Life'' (1869). Brafman joined the [[Imperial Russian Geographical Society]] in 1870 and became a respected figure in academia.&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt;

One of the main problems with Brafman's thesis was that the ''kahal'' system itself in the Russian Empire had been dissolved under Nicholas I in 1844.&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt; For Brafman he posited a [[conspiracy theory]] that the ''kahal'' in fact continued to exist as a secret [[State within a state|shadow government]] among Jews, with reactionary rabbis working to keep control over the "average Jew" and to undermine Christian business interests at the same time. Brafman's works chimed well with the [[Slavophiles]] then active in Russia and the political theory of ''[[Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality]]'', which sought to distance Russian civilisation from French and British [[liberalism]]. Brafman's other major work, ''The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods'' (1868), took aim at international Jewish organisations, particularly those based in [[France]]. His main object for criticism was the ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'' under prominent [[freemason]], [[Adolphe Crémieux]].{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} For Brafman this was the "kahal of kahals" and as part of an [[international Jewish conspiracy]] controlled the other ''kahals''.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} He saw this as the successor of the [[Grand Sanhedrin]] ([[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s Rabbinic Assembly of 1807).&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt;

==Influence==
Brafman also took aim at the [[Talmud]], claiming that the Jews, using Talmudic principles, would exclude adherents of other religions from trade and industry and themselves accumulate all capital and landed property.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}}&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt; Brafman's works, which included the idea of a secret Jewish shadow government and the aspects of an internationally orchestrated "conspiracy" against all Christian nations, crossing over with masonic involvement, provided an essential framework for what would become, ''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]'', authored by agents of the [[Okhrana]] at the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}}

Brafman was particularly well received by [[conservative]] Slavophiles in Russia. [[Vsevolod Krestovskii]], one of the most widely read Russian writers of the day, was inspired by Brafman to write a trilogy of novels; ''The Darkness of Egypt'', ''Tamara Bendavid'' and ''The Triumph of Baal''.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=61}} For Krestovskii, the "kahal of kahals" in Paris, with a network of Jewish spies was used to back up British-French militarism against Russia, causing defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] of the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] (British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] in particular is singled out as an "arch-villain").{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=61}}

[[Hal Draper]], an American Trotskyist, in his book ''Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution'' claimed that [[Mikhail Bakunin]]; one of the Russian founding figures of [[anarchism]]; was likely inspired by Brafman's writings on Jews.{{sfn|Draper|1989|p=296}} In the case of Bakunin, in a letter written in December 1871, he made the claim that Jews were a "collective parasite", and claimed that "this world is presently, at the disposal of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] on the one hand and the [[Rothschilds]] on the other," putting a conspiratorial spin on this theme as part of his rivalry with the Marxian socialists in the [[First International]].{{sfn|Draper|1989|p=296}}

One of Brafman's great-grandchildren was [[Vladislav Khodasevich]], the Russian literary critic

'''Kirklington Hall Research Station''' was a [[Exploration geophysics|geophysical]] research institute of [[BP]] in [[Kirklington, Nottinghamshire]].

==History==
As part of the [[East Midlands Oil Province]], oil was found in eastern Nottinghamshire. It was also known as the '''BP Research Centre''' or the Geophysical Centre, part of BP's Exploration Division. The research centre was established in 1950. Its first employee was [[Jack Birks]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1338608/Jack-Birks.html Jack Birks]&lt;/ref&gt; later Managing Director of BP. From 1950 it was the main research site of BP, until BP sold the site in 1957 for £12,000. Research moved to [[Sunbury-on-Thames]], in [[Surrey]], in 1957. Sunbury had been built around the same time as the Kirklington site, in the early 1950s.

Kirklington Hall today is a private school.

[[Image:Kirklington oil well - geograph.org.uk - 630844.jpg|file|thumb|200px|Oil well at Kirklington in April 2006, discovered by BP in 1985]]

==Structure==
The former site is situated north of the [[A617 road|A617]].

==Function==
It conducted [[Geophysics|geophysical]] research for [[Hydrocarbon exploration|exploration]] for BP. This part of BP is now known as [[BP Exploration]]. Work would be conducted on [[core sample]]s and with [[Reflection seismology|seismic methods]].

== History ==

=== Lake Erie Female Seminary ===
Founded as the Lake Erie Female Seminary in 1856, the institution toppled the belief that women were not capable of significant intellectual improvement. The only single-sex institution of higher education for women in the Western Reserve, it took after its sister seminary, [[Mount Holyoke Seminary|Mount Holyoke]].

The seminary was relocated in Painesville after Willoughby Seminary, founded in 1847, burned to the ground. Its founders include prominent local citizens Timothy Rockwell, general store owner Silas Trumbull Ladd, Judge William Lee Perkins, Mayor and Judge Aaron Wilcox, Charles Austin Avery and Judge Reuben Hitchcock, a president of the [[Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad|Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad]] and cousin of [[Edward Hitchcock]].

Scholarship was not a chief concern at the Seminary for many years, however. Educating future mothers through domestic work, physical education and etiquette ranked among the Seminary's chief aims. For a tuition of $160, seminarians trained as teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29442846|title=Dancing on the table : a history of Lake Erie College|last=Geissman.|first=Gross, Margaret|date=1993|publisher=Celo Valley Books|year=|isbn=0923687289|location=Burnsville, N.C.|pages=8–9|oclc=29442846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 40 years, the seminary raised standards, finally delivering a college degree. It took on the official name of Lake Erie College in 1908 when a charter was passed.

=== Expansion ===
The Arts took up a home in the halls of Lake Erie. Helen Rockwell Morley Memorial Music Building, opened in 1927, still shines – its classic Greek design, Corinthian pillars, seating for more than 1,000, and four-manual [[Ernest M. Skinner|E.M. Skinner]] organ with 5,000 pipes.

The Civil Aeronautics Authority approved Lake Erie for a civilian pilot program in 1939, several years after Amelia Earhart visited the campus to speak to its Aviators Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ninety-nines.org/99-news-magazine.htm|title=Resources {{!}} 99 NEWS Magazine (The Ninety-Nines, Inc.)|last=Inc.|first=The Ninety-Nines,|work=The Ninety-Nines, Inc.|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, President Dr. Helen D. Bragdon, a Harvard alumna, moved the College from more Victorian ideals toward an active, responsible citizenry.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Her successor, Dr. Paul Weaver, initiated a required general studies lecture series to demonstrate the interconnectivity of fields of study, three 10 week terms, and the establishment of study centers in many European cities. 

In 1954, Lake Erie College became the first institution of higher education in the United States to require a term abroad for its students.

In 1967, Lake Erie added a School of Equine Studies to its equestrian riding program developed by Laddie Andahazy, an influential horseman who founded the [http://chagrinhunterjumperclassic.org/facts/ Cleveland Grand Prix].

A special exhibit of Modern art signaled the opening of Royce Hall for the Fine and Performing Arts in 1970. Prints, sculpture, graphics and more by celebrated artists such as Dali, dekooning, Magritte, Miro and Picasso were on display. [[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]] spoke at the facility's ground-breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29442846|title=Dancing on the table : a history of Lake Erie College|last=Geissman.|first=Gross, Margaret|date=1993|publisher=Celo Valley Books|year=|isbn=0923687289|location=Burnsville, N.C.|pages=56–57|oclc=29442846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Lake Erie College became coeducational, merging Garfield Senior College with Lake Erie College for Women, and men were admitted officially as students.

== Academic Programs ==
Lake Erie College houses five academic schools: the School of Business, the School of Arts and Humanities, the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, the School of Education and Professional Studies, and the School of Equine Studies. Each maintains its own majors, minors, and programs under the direction of its respective dean.

A '''landfill liner''', or '''composite liner''', is intended to be a low permeable barrier, which is laid down under engineered [[landfill]] sites. Until it deteriorates, the liner retards migration of [[leachate]], and its toxic constituents, into underlying [[aquifer]]s or nearby rivers, causing spoliation of the local water.

Modern landfills generally require a layer of compacted [[clay]] with a minimum required thickness and a maximum allowable [[hydraulic conductivity]], overlaid by a [[high-density polyethylene]] [[geomembrane]].

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has stated that the barriers "will ultimately fail," while the site remains a threat for "thousands of years," suggesting that modern landfill designs delay but do not prevent ground and surface water pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfredlee.com/Landfills/NRC_EngrBarriers.pdf gfredlee.com] -
National Research Council of the National Academies (2007): ''Assessment of the Performance of Engineered Waste Containment Barriers''. Committee to Assess the Performance of Engineered Barriers. Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chipped or [[waste tires]] are used to support and insulate the liner.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, C. H., Olson, M. A. &amp; Bergstrom, W. R. (1996) [http://pubsindex.trb.org/document/view/default.asp?lbid=468017 Temperatures of Insulated Landfill Liner], p24-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are certain levels of harmfulness in which the different types of trash have; therefore, there are different types of liner systems which are required for these different types of disposal sites. The first type is single liner-systems. These systems usually are put within landfills which mostly hold construction rubble. These landfills are not meant to hold the disposal of harmful liquid wastes such as paint, tar, or any other type of liquid garbage that can easily seep through a single liner system. The second type is [[double-liner]] systems. These systems are usually found in municipal solid waste landfills as well all hazardous waste landfills. The first part is constructed to collect the leachate while the second layer is engineered to be a leak-detection system to ensure that no contaminates leak into the ground and contaminate everything.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Kerry L. "Ohio State University Fact Sheet." Landfill Types and Liner Systems, CDFS-138-05 (2005). Retrieved from the website: http://ohioline.osu.edu/cd-fact/0138.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Composite liners are required to be used in municipal solid waste systems for [[landfills]] and use a double liner system which is composed of a [[leachate]] system which is a liquid that collects solids from the substance this is passed through it. The leachate system is surrounded in a by a type of solid drainage layer such as gravel which is enclosed by a geomembrane and compressed clay, also known as a [[geosynthetic clay liner]]. This geosynthetic clay liner is usually made of sodium bentonite which is compacted in between two thick pieces of geotextile. The next material surrounding the composite liner would be a leak detection system composed of another material like gravel with an additional geomembrane or complex liner.&lt;ref&gt;Composite liners improve landfill performance. (1997). Civil Engineering (08857024), 67(12), 18.
&lt;/ref&gt; The geomembranes within the composite liner consist of a high-density polyethylene which provide an effective minimization for flow and deliver and helpful barrier which is used on inorganic contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, R., &amp; Rimal, S. S. (2008). Depletion of Antioxidants from an HDPE Geomembrane in a Composite Liner. Journal of Geotechnical &amp; Geoenvironmental Engineering, 134(1), 68-78. doi:10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2008)134:1(68)&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used as a substitute for sand or gravel and also has a very high transmissivity and low storage. The lower surface helps provide an effective leak test once correctly installed. It is also a low permeable vapor and liquid barrier. The geosynthetic clay liners are manufactured by factories and the purpose for it being made of sodium [[bentonite]] is that they regulate the movement of liquids in gases within the waste.&lt;ref&gt;Scalia, J., &amp; Benson, C. H. (2011). Hydraulic Conductivity of Geosynthetic Clay Liners Exhumed from Landfill Final Covers with Composite Barriers. Journal of Geotechnical &amp; Geoenvironmental Engineering, 137(1), 1-13. doi:10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000407
&lt;/ref&gt; The geocomposites which are a combination of the geomembranes and geosynthetic liner material also include a layer of bentonite between the middle of the layers of geotextile; however, airspace is allowed to be implemented. It is then topped off with a final cover.

==How it works==
The main role a composite liner has for a municipal solid waste system for landfills is that is reduces the amount of leakage through small seep holes that sometimes form in the geomembrane part of the composite liner. The protection layer part serves as a preventer from these holes from forming inside the geomembrane which would allow the waste to leak through the entire liner(awkward sentence consider rewording). It also takes away the pressure and stress which can cause cracking and holes from forming in the membrane as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, S. S., &amp; Brachman, R. I. (2008). Assessment of alternative protection layers for a [[geomembrane]] – geosynthetic clay liner (GM–GCL) composite liner. Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 45(11), 1594-1610.&lt;/ref&gt; An effective liner in a landfill system should be able to control water in terms of movement and protection on the environment. It should be able to regulate the flow away from the waste area and withhold the waste contents as it enters the actual landfill. Due to the effectiveness on how landfills are placed on top of slopes in order for the water to stream downhill and in an emergency, into the actual landfill. Water moves through the landfill and downward through the composite liner. The main purpose for all of this is so that the movement is lateral which lessens the probability for slope catastrophe and  the waste leaking down and freely contaminating whatever is in its path. The final cover functions as a way to keep the water out of the contaminate and to control the runoff from entering the system. This helps prevent plants and animals from being harmed by the waste contaminated water,leachate. Using gravity and pumps the leachate is able to be pushed to a [[sump]] where it is removed by a pump. When developing composite liners it is extremely important to take in risk factors such as earthquakes and other slope failure problems that could occur.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, P., &amp; Walsh, P. (2002). Landfill cover and liner systems for water quality protection. Waste Age, 33(4), 124-129. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/219247584&lt;/ref&gt; 
'''Composite liner'''s are used in [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) [[landfill]]s to reduce [[water pollution]].  A composite liner is made of a [[geomembrane]] along with a [[geosynthetic clay liner]].  Composite-liner systems are better at reducing [[leachate]] migration into the [[subsoil]] than either a clay liner or a single geomembrane layer.&lt;ref name="TITLE 40 part 258"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title40-vol26/xml/CFR-2012-title40-vol26-part258.xml |title=PART 258 - CRITERIA FOR MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE LANDFILLS |publisher=gpo.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanical properties ==
The primary forms of mechanical degradation associated with geomembranes result from insufficient tensile strength, tear resistance, impact resistance, puncture resistance, and susceptibility to environmental stress cracking (ESC).  The ideal method of assessing the amount of liner degradation would be by examining field samples over their service life.  Due to the lengths of time required for field sampling tests, various laboratory-accelerated ageing tests have been developed to measure the important mechanical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, R. Kerry, S Rimal, and S Rimal. 2008. Aging of HDPE Geomembrane in Three Composite Landfill Liner Configurations. Journal of Geotechnical &amp; Geoenvironmental Engineering. 134, no. 7: 906-916.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tensile strength ===
Tensile strength represents the ability for a geomembrane to resist tensile stress.  Geomembranes are most commonly tested for tensile strength using one of three methods; the uniaxial tensile test described in ASTM D639-94, the wide-strip tensile test described in ASTM D4885-88, and the multiaxial tension test described in ASTM D5617-94.  The difference in these three methods lies in the boundaries imposed into the test specimens.  Uniaxial tests do not provide lateral restraint during testing and thus tests the sample under uniaxial stress conditions.  During the wide-strip test the sample is restrained laterally while the middle portion is unrestrained.  The multiaxial tensile test provides a plane stress boundary condition at the edges of the sample.&lt;ref&gt;Wesseloo, J, AT Visser, and E Rust. 2004. A Mathematical Model for the Strain-rate Dependent Stress-strain Response of HDPE Geomembranes. Geotextiles and Geomembranes. 22, no. 4: 273-295.&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical range of tensile strengths in the machine direction are from 225 to 245&amp;nbsp;lb/in for 60-mil HDPE to 280 to 325&amp;nbsp;lb/in for 80-mil HDPE.&lt;ref name="sharma"&gt;Sharma, Hari and Reddy, Krishna. 2004. Geoenvironmental Engineering: Site Remediation, Waste Containment, and Emerging Waste Management Technologies. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tear resistance ===
Tear resistance of a geomembrane becomes important when it is exposed to high winds or handling stress during installation.  There are various ASTM methods for measuring tear resistance of geomembranes, with most common reports using ASTM D1004.  Typical tear resistances show a value of 40 to 45&amp;nbsp;lb for 60-mil HDPE and 50 to 60&amp;nbsp;lb for 80-mil HDPE.&lt;ref name="sharma"/&gt;

=== Impact resistance ===
Impact resistance provides an assessment of the effects of impacts from falling objects which can either tear or weaken the geomembrane.  As with the previous mechanical properties, there are various ASTM methods for assessment.  Significantly higher impact resistances are realized when [[geotextiles]] are placed above or below the [[geomembrane]].  Thicker geomembranes also display higher impact resistances.&lt;ref name="sharma"/&gt;

=== Puncture resistance ===
Puncture resistance of a geomembrane is important due to the heterogeneous material above and below a typical liner.  Rough surfaces, such as stones or other sharp objects, may puncture a membrane if it does not have sufficient puncture resistance.  Various methods beyond standard ASTM tests are available; one such method, the critical cone height test, measures the maximum height of a cone on which a compressed geomembrane, which is subjected to increasing pressure, does not fail.  HDPE samples typically have a critical cone height of around 1&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Kolbasuk, G. 1991. Coextruded Hdpe Vldpe Multilayer Geomembranes. Geotextiles and Geomembranes. 10, no. 5-6: 601-612.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental stress cracking ===
Environmental stress cracking is defined as external or internal cracking in plastic induced by applied tensile stress less than its short-term tensile strength.  ESC is a fairly common observation in HDPE geomembranes and thus needs to be evaluated carefully.  Proper polymeric properties, such as molecular weight, orientation, and distribution, aid in ESC resistance.  ASTM D5397 [standard test method for evaluation of stress crack resistance of polyolefin geomembranes using notched constant tensile load (NCTL)] provides the necessary procedure for measuring the ESC resistance of most HDPE geomembranes.  The current recommended transition time for an acceptable HDPE geomembrane is around 100 h.&lt;ref name="sharma"/&gt;

{{main|Vincent van Gogh}}
The events that befell the early '''paintings and drawings by Vincent van Gogh''' in the period prior to the posthumous recognition of [[Vincent van Gogh]] (1853 – 1890) as an innovative artist show how the appreciation of his legacy changed [[Posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh|his reputation]] in a relatively short time.

A part of the work that remained with his family when he left the Netherlands must be considered '''[[Lost artworks|lost]]''', and the remaining [[early works of Vincent van Gogh]] tell an incomplete story. Van Gogh himself wrote that he had stored some 70 painted studies in the attic of his studio when he left The Hague, but only some 25 of these are now known.&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker (1980) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Letter 391" &gt;{{cite web|title= Letter 391: To Theo van Gogh. Hoogeveen, Friday, 28 September 1883|url= http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let391/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|at= Note 8|quote= I have more than 70 painted studies lying in The Hague ...|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those involved in the early trade have been interviewed by journalists and art researchers, but the literature on Van Gogh relies and focuses largely on his [[List of works by Vincent van Gogh|known existing work]].

== To Breda ==
[[File:WLANL - artanonymous - Stilleven met bijbel.jpg|thumb|''Still Life with Bible'', 1885, Nuenen.]]
The father of Vincent van Gogh, the [[Nuenen]] pastor [[Van Gogh's family in his art#Theodorus van Gogh|Theo van Gogh]], died unexpectedly on 26 March 1885. Vincent moved to Antwerp on November 27. In the following months his mother, Anna-Cornelia van Gogh-Carbentus, decided to move to a smaller home for her and her daughter [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]]. They found an upper part of a house on the corner of the Nieuwe Ginnekenstraat and Wapenplein (nowadays Van Coothplein 33 A) in [[Breda]] and moved there on 30 March 1886 (coincidentally Vincent's 33rd birthday).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Vincent's mother had a part of the furniture, including Vincent's possessions, stored because the new house had insufficient space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jo van Gogh-Bonger's Memoir of Vincent van Gogh|url=http://www.vggallery.com/misc/archives/jo_memoir.htm|publisher=vggallery.com|quote=When in May his mother also left Nuenen, everything belonging to Vincent was packed in cases, left in the care of a carpenter in Breda and--forgotten! After several years the carpenter finally sold everything to a junk dealer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It ended up in a warehouse owned by a carpenter, Adrianus Schrauwen, living in the Ginnekenstraat. When the furniture and boxes were later retrieved, Vincent's sister Wil discovered traces of [[woodworm]] in the crates and it was decided to leave it with Schrauwen in the attic.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stockvis|first=Benno J.|title=Letter from Benno J. Stokvis to n/a Breda, 1926|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/15/etc-A13a.htm%20Lost%20works|publisher=WebExhibits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Rubbish" of Vincent ==
In the period from November 1885 until the end of February 1886, Vincent wrote from Antwerp to his brother Theo in Paris various letters about the upcoming move in March 1886 of his mother and sister. He wondered if he had to help with arrangements in Nuenen. Vincent went to Paris at the end of February 1886 and he did not help his family with packing. When the family moved, the things that Vincent had left behind when he went to Antwerp, including wood engravings and books, were stored in a carpenter's attic in Breda. The carpenter's name was Adrianus Schrauwen. In a letter from Arles to his sister Wil from June 1888 Vincent writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Willemien van Gogh. Arles, between Saturday, 16 and Wednesday, 20 June 1888|at= note 9|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let626/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Speaking of rubbish... It is perhaps worth saving what is good among the rubbish which, as Theo says, is still in an attic somewhere in Breda. I dare not ask, however, and perhaps it is lost, so do not worry about it.

According to specialist researcher [[Jan Hulsker]] in his book ''Van Gogh door Van Gogh'' (1973) the word rubbish refers not to Vincent's own work, but to books and woodcuts, illustrations which he had taken from magazines and such. In a postscript of a letter in early August 1888, Vincent asks Wil to bring him some wood engravings and prints that had remained in Breda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Theo van Gogh. Arles, Sunday, 15 July 1888|at= note 12|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let642/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of Schrauwen ==
This could mean that Vincent considered his work in the attic at Schrauwen lost. In any case, in 1888 Theo and Wil knew of belongings that had been left behind in Breda. In a letter from Vincent to Wil (end of October 1889) he says that Wil and her mother would move shortly thereafter to Leiden. The population register in Breda mentions that the move took place on November 2, 1889. On this basis, it is assumed that in the beginning of November 1889 his mother and Wil reclaimed their possessions from Schrauwen, but left Vincent's boxes because of the alleged woodworm.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"/&gt;

Stokvis writes in his ''Research about Vincent van Gogh in Brabant'' (Nasporingen omtrent Vincent van Gogh in Brabant, 1926) on page 27:

:At the request of the old Mrs Van Gogh one of the sisters Begemann (in Nuenen) had a part of what had been left behind in the studio, packed in boxes and sent to carpenter Schrauwen in Breda after the departure of the family.

Years later, Schrauwen considered himself the rightful owner of the boxes because nobody had ever picked them up, he broke them open, took the folders with drawings, sketches and watercolors, and used the wood for various other purposes.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"/&gt;

== Role of Couvreur ==
Seventeen years later, in 1903, Schrauwen invited a market merchant Mr. J.C. Couvreur to sell some belongings, such as a small can, a pot and other kitchen equipment. Couvreur offered 2.50 guilders and Schrauwen accepted on condition that he also take the rubbish which he had stored in his attic for so long. Couvreur agreed and stored the approximately sixty paintings, one hundred and fifty loose canvases, eighty pen drawings and between one hundred and two hundred chalk drawings in the basement of his house in the Stallingstraat in Breda.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie (2004) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peasant and peasant woman planting potatoes by Vincent Van Gogh.jpg|thumb|''Planting Potatoes'', April 1885, Nuenen.]]
[[File:Basket of Potatoes by Vincent Van Gogh.jpg|thumb|''Still Life with Potatoes'', September 1885, Nuenen.]]
He spoke of this in an article in the newspaper ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' on 25 April 1938:

:So I had those things in the basement, higgledy-piggledy, my wife looked there every now and then, flipped through the drawings and saw many nude studies. She said to me: That I do not want to have in my house, it must go. I said: you can never know what those things may turn out to be worth, but my wife said: those things go out the door or I go out the door. In such a case, things go out the door. So I went into my basement one day, picked up all drawings that were somewhat offensive, put them in a big bag and when that bag was full, I brought it to the paper factory of Tilburg to be ground to paper; I've had a few dimes for it. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

After clearing his basement of the bags with nude drawings, Couvreur wanted to get rid of the remaining pictures as well and he approached a Rotterdam paintings merchant, called De Winter, who thought it was worthless, according to Couvreur in an article on 18 February 1950 in the Breda newspaper ''De Stem''. Couvreur also delivered some paintings to Frans Meeuwissen, the owner of the café at the corner of Ginnekenstraat and Stallingstraat, who sold them or gave them away to customers. If someone offered Couvreur a beer, he could have a Van Gogh.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Van Gogh's for a dime ===
Couvreur was planning on selling the remaining canvases and drawings on the market, he tells in a ''Telegraaf'' newspaper article:

:I have stood on the market with a cart for thirty years. I pinned the drawings and paintings of Van Gogh on the cart and anyone could have one for ten cents. Sometimes I gave them to the children on the street to play with. One of those pieces I had to buy back later for seventy-five guilders. I was now gradually getting rid of the items in the basement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

According to his story one day on his way to the market in the Ginnekenstraat the tailor C. Mouwen approached him to buy some paintings. Couvreur sold him six canvases for ten cents each. Later in the day a maid of Mouwen came and asked if she could have another six for the same price.

:My wife says: now don't be silly, he does not do it for fun, those things are worth more that. You need to ask not one, but two dimes apiece. I said to the girl: thank Mr. Mouwen and tell him he can get six for two dimes apiece. The girl went away, came back and said that Mr. Mouwen would not go higher than 35 cents per piece. I quickly sold them for thirty-five cents per piece.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In a short time the amounts went tenfold, and then again:

:Then one morning comes which I shall never forget. Coincidentally I get a newspaper in my hands and I see that Van Gogh is a [[posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh|famous painter]]. Well, I thought, now I understand how that Mr. Mouwen could make me earn 25 cents on a painting! I spoke with him and we agreed that I would try to find the people to whom I had sold paintings for a dime and fifteen cents, and ask them to sell the pictures back. We have been busy with that for a while. For example, there was a farmer who had two pieces of me. I went to the man and said: can I have them back for a two and half guilders? And he gave them for 2.50 guilders. ... It was a strange story. To get them back I had to pay fifty, sixty, seventy guilders to the parents of the children to whom I had sold those paintings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The majority of the retrieved works was bought by C. Mouwen, who loaned some fifty paintings for an exhibition with [[art dealer]] Oldenzeel in Rotterdam in January 1903 and sold 25 paintings at an auction on 3 May 1904, and an unknown number went to his cousin W. van Bakel, lecturer at the Royal Military Academy in Breda. Because the names of the buyers have not all been recorded, traces of early works by Van Gogh continued to get lost until the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Breda Museum's ''Lost and Found'' exhibition ==

Breda Museum hosted an exhibition called ''Vincent van Gogh: Lost and Found'' between November 2003 and February 2004. The show-piece of the exhibition was a painting ''Houses near the Hague'',  which the museum claimed had been authenticated by their experts as painted by Vincent on the basis of x-ray analysis. The painting had come from the so-called Marijnissen collection of Barend den Houter, a tax official at Breda. This collection had formerly been examined by experts in 1940 and declared unimportant, consisting of forgeries or work by little known contemporaries. However, Breda Museum said they had uncovered a connection between den Houter and Vincent's mother. The [[Van Gogh Museum]] said they were sceptical about the authenticity of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alleged newly discovered van Gogh|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/3541333/ns/today-entertainment/t/alleged-newly-discovered-van-gogh/#.T1lRjXmO4rU|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=12 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement in response to questions raised by the exhibition 'Lost and Found' at the Breda's Museum|url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=8000&amp;lang=en|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|date=18 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie (2004) pp. 248-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''“Macondistas”''' refers to authors and members of the writing community who are alumni of the [[Macondo Writers Workshop]], which was founded by [[Sandra Cisneros]] in 1995.  The workshop is for writers whose work is socially engaged and who have addressed the needs of underrepresented communities via their writing.  For years, the workshop was made possible by the philanthropic endeavors of Cisneros and the Macondo Foundation, though currently the [[Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], administers and hosts the annual workshop.  The term "Macondo" was first used in [[Gabriel García Márquez]]' 1967 novel ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]''.

The '''''Maestà''''', or '''''Maestà of Duccio''''' is an [[altarpiece]] composed of many individual paintings commissioned by the city of [[Siena]] in 1308 from the artist [[Duccio|Duccio di Buoninsegna]].&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia'' by Christopher Kleinhenz (Nov 2003) [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0415939305}} page 310&lt;/ref&gt;  The front panels make up a large enthroned [[Madonna (art)|Madonna and Child]] with saints and angels, and a [[predella]] of the ''Childhood of Christ'' with prophets.  The reverse has the rest of a combined cycle of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' in a total of forty-three small scenes; several panels are now dispersed or lost. The base of the panel has an inscription that reads (in translation): "Holy Mother of God, be thou the cause of peace for Siena and life to Duccio because he painted thee thus." &lt;ref&gt;"Art History: Fourteenth to Seventeenth Century Art" by Marilyn Stokstad (2011) page 543&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it took a generation for its effect truly to be felt, Duccio's ''Maestà'' set Italian painting on a course leading away from the hieratic representations of [[Byzantine art]] towards more direct presentations of reality.

==History==

The painting was installed in the [[cathedral of Siena]] on 9 June 1311. One person who witnessed this event wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And on that day when it was brought into the cathedral, all workshops remained closed, and the bishop commanded a great host of devoted priests and monks to file past in solemn procession. This was accompanied by all the high officers of the Commune and by all the people; all honorable citizens of Siena surrounded said panel with candles held in their hands, and women and children followed humbly behind. They accompanied the panel amidst the glorious pealing of bells after a solemn procession on the [[Piazza del Campo]] into the very cathedral; and all this out of reverence for the costly panel… The poor received many alms, and we prayed to the Holy Mother of God, our patron saint, that she might in her infinite mercy preserve this our city of Siena from every misfortune, traitor or enemy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Besides the Virgin Mary and the Baby Jesus, saints depicted in the painting include [[John the Evangelist]] (to the left of the throne); [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]; [[Catherine of Alexandria]]; [[John the Baptist]] (to the right of the throne); [[Saint Peter]]; and [[Saint Agnes]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.abcgallery.com/D/duccio/maesta.html The Maestà by Duccio di Buoninsegna – Olga's Gallery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the foreground are Siena’s various [[patron saints]]: [[Saint Ansanus]]; [[Sabinus of Spoleto|Saint Sabinus]]; [[Crescentius of Rome|Saint Crescentius]]; and [[Victor and Corona|Saint Victor]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Creating this altarpiece assembled from many wood panels bonded together before painting was an arduous undertaking. The work was not only large, the central panel was 7 by 13 feet, but it had to be painted on both sides since it could be seen from all directions when installed on the main altar at the centre of the sanctuary.&lt;ref name=stockstad&gt;Stockstad, Marilyn. ''Art History'', 2011, 4th ed., {{ISBN|0-205-79094-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The altarpiece remained in place until 1711, when it was dismantled in order to distribute the pieces between two altars. The five-metre high construction was dismantled and sawn up, and the paintings damaged in the process. Partial restoration took place in 1956. The dismantling also led to pieces going astray, either being sold, or simply unaccounted for. Extant remains of the altarpiece not at Siena are divided among several other museums.

==Stylistic analysis==

*Deposition
Christ's followers, Joseph and John, remove him from the cross while Nicodemus removes nails from his feet. The Virgin Mary looks into his closed eyes while Mary Magdalene holds his arm, and you can see the painful expression in everyone’s eyes as they tend to the dead Christ. The background has the same gold texture as in the "Crucifixion" and the cross that held Christ has blood running onto the ground, increasing the sense of realism in the scene. This panel aroused the emotions of its audiences and the story helped to symbolize the birth of Christianity.

*Burial
Immediately following the "Deposition," is the depiction of Christ as he is prepared for burial, surrounded by his mourning followers. His mother leans in close to him and kisses him one last time and Mary Magdalene throws her arms towards the sky in anguish. The background retains the gold setting of the "Deposition" and "Crucifixion," and the mountains in the background are similar to the mountains portrayed in previous and subsequent panels. These mountains lead the viewer’s eye to Mary who is accompanying him, and then to Christ’s face. This scene also elicits an intense emotional response from its viewers and you can see the close connection that the burial party has to Christ, and especially to the Virgin Mary.

Meta Inc., formerly Sciencescape Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meta Launches Universal Machine Intelligence Platform to Unite the Fragmented Scientific Information Ecosystem|url = http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meta-launches-universal-machine-intelligence-platform-to-unite-the-fragmented-scientific-information-ecosystem-2015-11-03|website = MarketWatch |date=November 3, 2015 |accessdate = May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2010 by Sam and Amy Molyneux. Before co-founding Meta, Sam Molyneux studied [[cancer genomics]] at the [[Ontario Cancer Institute]] at [[Princess Margaret Cancer Centre|Princess Margaret Hospital]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name=four /&gt;&lt;ref name=nine /&gt; The service was developed with the intention of curating the millions of articles in the area of academic publishing.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;&lt;ref name=two /&gt;&lt;ref name=three /&gt;&lt;ref name=nine /&gt;&lt;ref name=seven /&gt;&lt;ref name=eight /&gt;

As of September 2016, Meta has analyzed over 26 million papers and profiled 14 million researchers.&lt;ref name=eleven&gt;{{citation|url=http://meta.com/about|title=About Meta|publisher=Meta|date=September 13, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has struck deals with publishers in science, technology and mathematics fields, which give the company access to full-text versions of more than 18,000 journals. Using [[natural language processing]], Meta scans articles - as well as the millions of articles stored in open-access repositories - collecting information about authors, citations and topics. Participating publishers receive exposure for their journals in return.&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/10/start-sees-data-analytics-information-overload-cure-researchers-publishers/|title=Predictive Analytics for Publishing|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|author=Carl Straumsheim|date=May 10, 2016|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the [[American Medical Association]], [[BioMed Central]], [[Elsevier]], [[Karger]], [[Sage Publishing]], [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], [[Wolters Kluwer]], and the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/70118-digital-solutions-in-india-2016-big-data-and-ai-with-meta.html|title=Digital Solutions in India 2016: Big Data and AI with Meta|publisher=Publishers Weekly|author=Teri Tan|date=April 29, 2016|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;{{citation|url=http://meta.com/partners|title=Partners|publisher=Meta|date=September 12, 2016|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology for the platform was developed via a joint partnership between Meta and SRI International.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2017/01/25/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-meta-ai.html|title=Chan Zuckerberg Initiative makes first buy, a Canadian artificial intelligence startup |website=www.bizjournals.com |date=January 26, 2017 |access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Weiner-Davis released a sequel to ''[[Divorce Busting]]'', ''The Divorce Remedy'':''The Proven 7-Step Program for Saving Your Marriage''.&lt;ref name="save"/&gt; After hearing from thousands of readers over the years who asked particular questions about their own marital circumstances, Weiner-Davis extracted the ideas from her experience and past books and then broke down the ideas into seven specific steps a person could follow. She also discusses some other key relationship issues such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[infidelity]], [[Internet addiction disorder|Internet obsession]], [[sexual problems]] &amp; [[midlife crisis]].

In 2003 Weiner-Davis released her book ''The Sex-Starved Marriage'': ''A Couple's Guide to Boosting Their Marriage Libido''.&lt;ref name="Savers"/&gt;  She found herself writing about this particular subject after she saw a pattern developing in her practice&lt;ref name="appetite"/&gt; and determined that a lack of physical intimacy between couples had been leading couples further apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''''Music Survey''''' was a short-lived [[academic journal]] covering [[classical music|classical]] and [[contemporary classical music|contemporary music]], which flourished in the [[United Kingdom]] for a brief period after [[World War II]]. Though it was published for only five years and in that time had only a small circulation, it had a remarkable impact on British musical and musicological life in the 1950s, and was instrumental in providing a home for the time's pro-[[Benjamin Britten]] and pro-[[Arnold Schoenberg]] writing, as well as launching the critical and editorial careers of [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]] and [[Hans Keller]].

The journal was established in 1947, while Mitchell was a teacher at Oakfield School, Dulwich, South London, by the headmaster W.W. (David) Livingston. Keller joined him as co-editor in 1949, when the journal was re-launched in the form of the so-called 'New Series'. Several articles were written by prominent composers such as [[Luigi Dallapiccola]], [[Mátyás Seiber]], and [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]].

''Music Survey'' ceased publication in 1952; in 1981 a single-volume reprint of the 'New Series' was produced.

The '''Netherlands Aerospace Centre''' (NLR) (former Nationaal Lucht- en Ruimtevaartlaboratorium)  is the National Aerospace Laboratory of the [[Netherlands]] and is one of its major technological institutes. These institutes perform a large part of the applied research in the Netherlands, each within its own specific field of technology. As an independent [[non-profit organisation]], the NLR is the aerospace-knowledge enterprise in the Netherlands and provides high-quality technical support to the aerospace sector (NLR is [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001:2000]]/AQAP-110 certified).

==Organisation==

NLR's activities are market-oriented, independent, socially relevant and without profit priority. By acting so, NLR can adequately respond to the need for scientific knowledge and technology in the field of aviation and space travel, which arises from the government, public and industry. Thus being the natural partner for aerospace research.
Work under research contracts (national and international, government and industry) amounts to 75 percent of NLR's activities, the remaining 25 percent is funded by the Dutch government for basic demand-oriented research programmes and development of research equipment. Depending on the project and the customer's preferences, NLR acts as a sole contractor or as a subcontractor co-operating with other institutes or partners from industry.
Research and development work is carried out on a project basis with great synergy between divisions and departments. Strong emphasis is laid on a customer oriented approach.

==History==

The RSL, the predecessor of NLR, was officially founded on 5 April 1919, shortly after the [[First World War]]. Although air power did not play a decisive role during this war, [[aeronautics]] had nevertheless progressed very rapidly during that period.
Aeronautics developed slowly in the Netherlands during the first two decades of this century when compared to the neighbouring countries, as for example France.
After the [[Armistice]], 11 November 1918, the aeronautical community started to concentrate on the application of the newly obtained skills and experience. The Government appointed a committee to review the possibilities of aerial applications. The year 1919 saw many new initiatives.
On Saturday 5 April 1919 (when Saturday was a normal working day), the new Laboratory of the RSL was officially opened in the presence of representatives of the Government in a building at the Navy Yard in [[Amsterdam]]. However, at this official opening there was already a laboratory in operation. The laboratory RSL was given an excellent start, although the human and material resources were limited.

In his opening speech Prof. L.A. van Royen emphasized that the RSL should develop free and open communications with the aeronautical world and in turn the RSL should be assisted to come into contact with those who are interested in the activities of RSL. The interested parts should also be able to influence the activities of RSL.
The RSL was originated at offices belonging to the Ministry of Defence mainly as a result of the aviation activities of the Army (since 1913) and the Navy (since 1917). The groundwork for the foundation of RSL started during World War I in 1917, when civil aviation in the Netherlands was non-existent. On 1 January 1920 the RSL was transfer from the Ministry of Defence to the Ministry of Public Works because after the war the defence spending was cut drastically and [[civil aviation]] appeared in the horizon.
As early as 1922, the Minister of Public Works proposed to terminate RSL. The main argument was that the annual funding was considered extravagant. Fortunately nothing happened immediately and the dispute continued for many years.
When in 1918 the RSL was planned, the location at the Navy Yard in Amsterdam was meant as a temporary site only. Prof. van Royen intended to establish a permanent laboratory in Delft, in close association with Delft University of Technology ([[TU Delft]]). However, the university apparently was not too eager to accommodate the RSL, probably because of the problems encountered in the 1920s after the RSL became part of the Ministry of Public Works. Also, flight testing had become an important part of the activities and several people felt that a location close to [[Schiphol]] and [[Fokker]] was more important than being close to TU Delft.
The RSL essentially developed along the lines as planned during 1918-1919, till it was converted in the independent Foundation NLL in 1937. The only major change in its formal task took place when a separate Department of Civil Aviation (RLD) was created to supervise [[airworthiness]] and aircraft operations in the Netherlands. However this did not have much effect on the technical content of the work of the RSL; it was a separation of responsibilities. This shift of responsibilities was related to the desire of the aircraft industry in the 1930s to have a national laboratory to which all interested parts would have access on an equal basis, according to Ir. A.J. Marx.

The centre piece of the laboratory was an Eiffel type [[wind tunnel]]. The construction of the wind tunnel was complicated because with only limited information available, Dr. Ir. E.B. Wolff managed to produce an operational tunnel by March 1919 and it was shown at the official opening of the RSL.

The tunnel – essentially a pipe with two open ends – had the air drawn from the room in which the tunnel was placed and it was exhausted into that same room at the other end. It must be assumed that he decided on an Eiffel type tunnel because of the size and limitations of the building and on the results published by Eiffel. Through this arrangement he achieved at least a facility of reasonable size and [[Reynolds Number]]. The tunnel had an open test section and, with a maximum power of 30 [[Horsepower]], the mean velocity at the 1.6 meter diameter test section was 25&amp;nbsp;m/s. However, the uniformity of the flow across the test section was quite unsatisfactory and large fluctuations in time occurred.
After investigations of the flow in the wind tunnel, several modifications were introduced. The result was that by July 1920 a fairly uniform and steady air flow of about 35&amp;nbsp;m/s in the test section was obtained. This tunnel was used extensively for a period of 20 years for a variety of aeronautical and non-aeronautical tests and, apart from smaller research facilities which were built at TU Delft, it was the only wind tunnel available for aeronautical development in the Netherlands till 1940.
In the meantime Wolff and Koning carried out studies for new wind tunnel facilities. As a result, two closed type wind tunnels were built in the new laboratory at Sloterweg in Amsterdam that became fully operational in 1940. One was the LST 3 x 2 m² which was large enough to simulate powered aircraft flight and a smaller, the LST 1.5 x 1.5 m² tunnel for research purposes and non-aeronautical wind tunnel testing. They were the main low speed aerodynamics facilities for over 40 years till the DNW (the joint venture with the German sister organisation [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]]) became operational in 1980, followed by the LST 3 x 2.25 m² of NLR, both in the [[Noordoostpolder]].

During the five years of the [[Second World War]] the total contract work-load of the laboratory decreased dramatically although the personnel increased by 40%.&lt;ref name="Reports4445"&gt;NLR Annual Reports of 1944 and 1945&lt;/ref&gt; However, it appears that a large number of subjects were studied in depth.&lt;ref name="Reports4445"/&gt; When the Allied Forces entered the Netherlands in September 1944 the situation changed very dramatically. The food and fuel supply, already at a bare minimum, practically stopped. Everybody at the laboratory was mentally occupied with the problems of war, survival, food and fuel. 
It took several months after the Liberation Day on 5 May 1945 for the normal operations of the laboratory to become re-established. Although the laboratory did not incur physical damage during the war, it was not in good condition after the war. Above that, until 1952 there was a political climate unfavourable to NLL especially in terms of financial support for the expansion plans of the NLL that included a HST, among other facilities.

The year 1950 marked the beginning of international co-operation and cross utilisation of facilities between NLL and [[ONERA]]. On 23 February 1955 a contract between AICMA-CIPS and NLL was signed which stipulated that NLL would make available the HST to members of AICMA for up to 50% of the available testing time. Later, in 1976, a two-nation aeronautical test facility, the DNW of Germany and the Netherlands, became a reality, and it took until 1988 when finally a four-nation (France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands) aeronautical test facility, the ETW, was opened.
In 1957, after a period of deliberations and negotiations, an area of 2 square kilometres was purchased in the Noordoostpolder (NOP). In 1958 the first NLR employees started working there. Since then there has been a gradual shift of activities from Amsterdam the NOP and several buildings were added.

==Sites==

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Sites NLR.jpg|thumb|Figure 7: NLR locations {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

A staff of approximately 650 people is employed at two sites, one located in Amsterdam, and the other in Marknesse (about 100&amp;nbsp;km north-east of Amsterdam). Over two-thirds of the staff are graduates from universities or technical colleges, with a large variety in specialised professions such as [[aerospace engineer]]s, [[psychologists]], [[mathematicians]] and [[physicist]]s. Such variety is necessary for ensuring the broad expertise that is needed for coping with the most challenging problems in the aerospace sector.

At its two sites NLR owns several sophisticated aerospace research facilities, including different wind tunnels, such as the Low Speed Wind tunnel, the Transonic and the Supersonic Wind Tunnel. Exploitation of these wind tunnels and the wind tunnels of DLR have been entrusted to the foundation German-Dutch wind tunnels (DNW), which also includes a large facility in the Noordoostpolder in which Germany and the Netherlands have a share of 50%.

==Facilities==

NLR has a laboratory airplane, a [[Cessna Citation II]] (PH-LAB), latter shared with Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).

NLR has developed different [[flight simulators]] for research on aircraft and helicopters.

NLR conducts research on future concepts in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) using its advanced proprietary simulation platform, the NLR ATC Research Simulator (NARSIM). NARSIM consists of two physical instantiations, one for en-route ATC (NARSIM-Radar) and one for airport tower controllers (NARSIM-Tower) with a 360-degrees field-of-view visual system. NARSIM is also used for performance of technology verification and validation activities as well as air traffic controller training.

NLR has installations in which airplane constructions on full scale, components and test samples can be tested. Equipment and software for development of construction of parts for airplanes and space vehicles are also available. For development and construction of composites a special laboratory has been arranged. Moreover, the NLR has instrumentation for flight tests, and several specialized apparatus for development of avionics. Facilities for testing antenna and conduction of so-called environmental tests are used to test several equipments. In the micromechanics workplace the NLR develops models and instruments for wind tunnel tests. The computer network of the NLR contains a supercomputer for the implementation of extensive aerodynamic and structural calculations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11172">The '''National Emissions Standards Act''', officially known as the '''Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act''' ({{USPL|89|272}}), is a 1965 amendment to the U.S. [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1963. The amendment set the first federal [[Automobile emissions control|vehicle emissions]] standards, beginning with the 1968 models. These standards were reductions from the 1963 emissions: 72% reduction for [[hydrocarbon]]s, 56% reduction for [[carbon monoxide]], and 100% reduction for crankcase hydrocarbons.  The impact the regulatory standards will have on air quality in the future, as well as the potential characteristics of the vehicle fleet can be analyzed with the use of [[roadway air dispersion model]]s.

The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is a department specific to the Clean Air Act. Its purpose is to make sure the amount of air pollution emitted stays inside the standards set by the U.S. Each state is required to have a state implementation plan (SIPs) that clearly indicates how it will enforce the regulations of the Clean Air Act. The states have to create regulations of their own that also adhere to the guidelines of the U.S. regulations; in order to do so, they must hold hearings so the public can contribute ideas and provide feedback.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/pdfs/peg.pdf The Plain English Guide to the Clean Air Act], U.S. EPA website, see pages 1-2 for explanation of the roles of the states and local governments as well as the role of the U.S. EPA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleaning up commonly found air pollutants==
The six common air pollutants of primary concern to the United States are particle pollution, [[ground-level ozone]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide|sulfur oxides]], [[nitrogen oxides]], and [[lead]].&lt;ref name="Cleaning"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/cleanup.html Cleaning Up Commonly Found Air Pollutants], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; These pollutants are detrimental to health, the environment, and a person's home and other belongings. The worst two of the six pollutants are particle pollution and ground-level ozone, which have to be regulated by the EPA. Particle pollution, or particle matter, consists of soot, smoke, and chemically formed "droplets".&lt;ref name="Cleaning"/&gt; These particles are very small and can bury themselves deep inside the lungs. Ground-level ozone is found in [[smog]] and can also negatively affect the lungs. Smog contains [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) and [[nitrogen oxides]] (NOx). VOCs come from cars burning gasoline, petroleum refineries, chemical manufacturing plants, etc., while NOx results from burning gasoline, coal, or oil.&lt;ref name="Cleaning"/&gt;

==Cars, trucks, buses, and non-road equipment==
Motor vehicles contribute a great deal to air pollution, so to reduce the amount of emissions released, the EPA placed restrictions on fuel and engine production. As a result, manufacturers are required to build cleaner engines and refiners are required to produce cleaner fuels. Gasoline used to include lead, which can cause damage to bodily functions and organs and sulfur was lowered over 90 percent in fuels because it doesn't allow a vehicle's [[catalytic converter]] to effectively clean up the exhaust.&lt;ref name="Vehicles"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/carstrucks.html Cars, Trucks, Buses, and "Nonroad" Equipment], U.S. EPA website. &lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most small cars, the majority of trucks, buses, and [[non-road equipment]] use diesel engines because they are more fuel efficient. However, they are also more harmful to the environment. In order to cut the emissions, the EPA issued rules to combine strict emissions standards for diesel engines and to lower sulfur diesel fuel.&lt;ref name="Vehicles"/&gt;

[[Alternative fuels]] such as natural gas, [[propane]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], electricity, and [[biodiesel]], are a major area of interest for the Clean Air Act. It is also important to find renewable fuels that can come from resources such as wood, waste paper, grasses, vegetable oils, and corn.&lt;ref name="Vehicles"/&gt;

==Interstate and international air pollution==
Air pollution is not contained and is carried by the wind all over the world. Industries contribute air pollution in the form of smog and [[haze]] in "downwind states".&lt;ref name="Interstate"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/interstate.html Interstate and International Air Pollution], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes pollution from "upwind states" blows into the downwind states, which can affect their air quality standards. These states can ask the EPA to enforce "a federal plan" to make sure that the standards are met. The Clean Air Act also requires that national parks maintain clear air; therefore, the EPA must collaborate with states to diminish the "regional haze" in national parks and wilderness areas.&lt;ref name="Interstate"/&gt;

==Reducing acid rain==
Acid precipitation comes in more forms than just rain. Snow, fog, mist, gas, and dust are also formed in the atmosphere and have the ability to become acid precipitation.&lt;ref name="Acid"&gt;[http://epa.gov/air/caa/peg/acidrain.html Reducing Acid Rain], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; These types of precipitation are formed when certain types of air pollutants mix with the moisture in the air to form an acid. Each type is  potentially dangerous to humans' health, can cause haze and problems in the environment, and can cause damage to people's properties. The two main pollutants that cause acid precipitation are [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Power plants that burn coal and "heavy oil" are accountable for over two-thirds of SO2 emissions annually in the U.S., while automobiles emit about fifty percent NOx and power plants emit about forty percent. The remaining percentages are from industrial and commercial boilers.&lt;ref name="Acid"/&gt; 

Any toxin is harmful to life on Earth. Acid rain and snow can increase the acidity in lakes and streams long enough to harm fish and other forms of life. Sulfur dioxide can be dangerous to children and the elderly by causing serious damage to lung tissue. In 1990, the Clean Air Act was changed to include a "nationwide approach" to lowering SO2 and NOx emissions. A cap was placed on the total SO2 emissions from electric power plants across the U.S.&lt;ref name="Acid"/&gt;

==Reducing toxic air pollutants==
Toxic air pollutants are the suspected cause of major illnesses and issues with reproductive problems. These pollutants stay in the environment for long periods, which can affect all living things and start a chain of negative events. In particular, smokestacks and automobiles are the two main sources of toxic air pollutants. When refueling, the gases turn into vapor that leak into the air. "Before the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, EPA regulated air toxics one chemical at a time." &lt;ref name="Toxic"&gt;[http://epa.gov/air/caa/peg/toxics.html Reducing Toxic Air Pollutants], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA now regulates pollutants by categories of industries because they release more than one chemical at a time. Some of the categories are, chemical plants, [[incinerators]], dry cleaners, and manufacturers of wood furniture. Since the 1990 Clean Air Act, air toxics from large industries have already been reduced by 70 percent.&lt;ref name="Toxic"/&gt;

==Protecting the stratosphere ozone layer==
Ozone can be harmful if it is ground-level, but if it is in the [[stratosphere]], it protects the Earth from [[ultraviolet]] rays from the sun. The stratosphere blocks some of the light called ultraviolet B, which can cause skin cancer and eye damage. It can also damage plant life on land and in the ocean.&lt;ref name="Ozone"&gt;[http://epa.gov/air/caa/peg/stratozone.html Protecting the Stratospheric Ozone Layer], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the main pollutants that are harmful to the stratosphere are called [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs). They come from aerosols such as hairspray, air conditioners, and some other types. They were banned in the 1970s. In the 1980s, scientists found that there were holes in the ozone around the South Pole. As a result, over 190 countries, including the United States, signed the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]]. This agreement is designated to eliminating chemicals that harm the stratosphere.&lt;ref name="Ozone"/&gt; The 1990 Clean Air Act "phased out" the most harmful chemicals and in 1996, production of CFCs, [[halons (disambiguation)|halons]], and [[methyl chloroform]] ended in the United States. There are still holes in the ozone that will take approximately 60 years to close up because of the chemicals that are already in the stratosphere.&lt;ref name="Ozone"/&gt;

==Permits and enforcement==
Congress added an operating permit program to the 1990 Clean Air Act for larger industries and commercial sources that release toxins into the air.&lt;ref name="Permits"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/permits.html Permits and Enforcement], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; These permits have information about which pollutants are emitted, how much may be emitted, and what actions the person in charge is taking to minimize the pollution. Permits must also state plans to measure and report the air pollution produced. The EPA is also responsible for making sure each state and tribe abides by the permits.&lt;ref name="Permits"/&gt; For businesses that qualify for more than one thing under the Clean Air Act, operating permits are helpful because the information is all there. These permits tell them exactly what they need to do to prevent pollution. Now the EPA is more powerful in being able to enforce the rules instead of having to handle everything in court. The EPA can either "issue an order requiring the violator to comply, issue and administrative penalty order, or bring a civil judicial action".&lt;ref name="Permits"/&gt;

==Public participation==
Since the 1990 Clean Air Act, the public has the opportunity to give input on "how a law is carried out".&lt;ref name="Public"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/public.html Public Participation], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; Hearings are held in different cities in the United States by the EPA. Anyone who attends is allowed to participate or written comments can be sent to the EPA. These hearings are open to the public when a "major rule" is about to be discussed.&lt;ref name="Public"/&gt; The more public input is recorded, the better the outcome will be for communities around the country. Reports from the Clean Air Act are made available to the public and they include information about the amount of pollution that is emitted by industries and other sources.&lt;ref name="Public"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11579">{{for|the record label|Nature Sounds}}
'''Natural sounds''' are sounds produced by natural sources in their normal [[soundscape]]. It is a category whose definition is open for discussion, see the section below. The category includes the sounds of any living organism, from insect larvae to the largest living mammal on the planet, whales, and those generated by natural, non-biological sources.  In most respects, the natural habitats from which these acoustic sources emanate, are defined as not heavily impacted by human intervention. With all these sounds, it creates an [[acoustic space]]

The historical background of natural sounds as they have come to be defined, begins with the recording of a single bird, by Ludwig Koch, as early as 1889. Koch's efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries set the stage for the universal audio capture model of single-species—primarily birds at the outset—that subsumed all others during the first half of the 20th century and well into the latter half and into the early 21st, as well. In late 1968, influenced by acoustic efforts in the fields of music and film, this model began to evolve into a much more holistic effort with attention paid to the acoustic experience of entire habitats, inclusive of all the wild animal voices. Expressed as wild soundscapes, these phenomena included sounds primarily from two main sources, non-human and non-domestic wild ones, and non-biological sources in relatively undisturbed habitats. In the early years of the 21st century, the definition of the soundscape was broken down into three components: the [[geophony]], non-biological natural sounds that include the effects of water by a stream or waves at the ocean, the effects of wind in the trees or grasses, and sound generated by the earth, itself, for example, glaciers, avalanches and earthquakes; the [[biophony]], all the non-human, non-domestic sounds that emanate from a relatively undisturbed habitat; and [[anthrophony]], all sound generated by human endeavor, whether music, theatre, or electromechanical.

== Definition ==
Humans are a product of nature this could be considered part of nature. Except that humans have long-considered themselves to be separate and in conflict. For that reason, a special category of the soundscape has been set aside for human, alone. Called anthrophony, it includes all of the sound that humans produces, whether structured (i. e. music, theatre, film, etc.), or entropic, as in the electromechanical chaotic and uncontrolled signals we generate by whatever means. Anthrophony has a profound effect on the natural soundscape and the featured organisms who play seminal roles in those habitats. But the nature of that effect varies with the types and families of sound and their relative intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Krause 1998, 2002, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Anatomy of the Soundscape," Bernie Krause, Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, Number 56, 1/2 2008, January/February.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernie Krause, "Wild Soundscapes: Discovering the Voice of the Natural World," Wilderness Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0899972961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernie Krause, "The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places," Little Brown, New York, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-316-08687-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural sounds are restricted to natural sources in their normal [[soundscape]] because clips of isolated natural sources are like [[sound bites]]: without context the sounds are prone to be misinterpreted.

== Humans ==
Humans can benefit from [[natural environment]]s to restore from stress and directed attention fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan 1995&lt;/ref&gt; A human can endure high levels of stress for short time periods as long as these periods are interrupted by restoration moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ai.rug.nl/~tjeerd/publications/Botteldooren_2011.pdf |title=Botteldooren et al. 2011 |access-date=2012-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224646/http://www.ai.rug.nl/~tjeerd/publications/Botteldooren_2011.pdf |archive-date=2013-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a natural environment provides more sensory input than the soundscape there are indications that the soundscape alone also affords restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarsson et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of humans indicate that they find natural sounds pleasurable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ai.rug.nl/~tjeerd/publications/Andringa_2011S1.pdf |title=Andringa |access-date=2012-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232942/http://www.ai.rug.nl/~tjeerd/publications/Andringa_2011S1.pdf |archive-date=2013-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animals ==

===Territory sounds===

These are sounds, calls, or audible signals made by any one species to its own or any other species, establishing boundaries so like or unlike species will not transgress those boundaries.

Male baboons make sounds heard for miles by other baboons, communicating to those other male baboons, the [[territory (animal)|territory]] of that male [[baboon]]. The strength, volume, and [[timbre]], inherent in that "call", determine whether or not rival males attempt to invade that male baboon's territory.

They do this to make them sound impressive and then to attract the female to them.

===Courtship and/or mate attracting sounds===

These are sounds made by the male baboon to attract females to his territory for courtship and mating. Again, the strength, quality, and timbre of those sounds, often determine the ability of that species to attract females for reproduction.  These mating calls, often low and guttural, are the main criteria, used by the female baboon to determine which male she mates with.

== Cultural references ==
{{Main|Imitation of natural sounds in various cultures}}
The imitation of natural sounds in various cultures is a diverse phenomenon. and can fill in various functions. In several instances, it is related to the belief system, for example, [[Imitation of natural sounds related to various shamanistic beliefs or practice|imitation of natural sounds can be linked to various shamanistic beliefs or practice]] (e.g. [[yoik]]s of the [[Sami people|Sami]],&lt;ref&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yoikbel&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 74&lt;/ref&gt; some other shamanic songs and rituals,&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=calf&gt;Hoppál 2005: 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clean&gt;[http://haldjas.folklore.ee/~aado/tent.htm Lintrop]&lt;/ref&gt; [[overtone singing]] of some cultures).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5111">'''Nestedness''' is a measure of structure in an [[ecosystem|ecological system]], usually applied to species-sites systems (describing the distribution of species across locations), or species-species interaction networks (describing the interactions between species, usually as bipartite networks such as hosts-parasites, plants-pollinators, etc.).

A system (usually represented as a matrix) is said to be nested when the elements that have a few items in them (locations with few species, species with few interactions) have a subset of the items of elements with more items. Imagine a series of islands that are ordered by their distance from the mainland. If the mainland has all species, the first island has a subset of mainland's species, the second island has a subset of the first island's species, and so forth, then this system is perfectly nested.

==Measures of nestedness==
One measurement unit for nestedness is a system's '[[temperature]]' offered by Atmar and Patterson in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Patterson and Atmar |year=1993 |title=The measure of order and disorder in the distribution of species in fragmented habitat |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=96 |pages=373–382 |doi=10.1007/BF00317508 |last2=Patterson |first2=Bruce D. |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measures the order in which species' extinctions would occur in the system (or from the other side - the order of colonizing a system). The 'colder' the system is, the more fixed the order of extinction would be. In a warmer system, extinctions will take a more random order. Temperatures go from 0°, coldest and absolutely fixed, to 100° absolutely random.

For various reasons, the Nestedness Temperature Calculator is not mathematically satisfying (no unique solution, not conservative enough).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rodríguez-Gironés MA, Santamaría L |year=2006 |title=A new algorithm to calculate the nestedness temperature of presence–absence matrices |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=33|pages=924–935 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01444.x|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Guimarães, P. R. , P. Guimarães |year=2006 |title=Improving the analyses of nestedness for large sets of matrices |journal=Environmental Modelling and Software |volume=21|pages=1512–1513 |doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.04.002|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A software (BINMATNEST) is available from the authors on request and from the Journal of Biogeography to correct these deficits &lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01444.x#suppl.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ANINHADO solves problems of large matrix size and processing of a large number of randomized matrices; in addition it implements several null models to estimate the significance of nestedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.04.002 | volume=21 | title=Improving the analyses of nestedness for large sets of matrices | journal=Environmental Modelling | pages=1512–1513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iemss.org/shortcom/software/software.php?aid=201&lt;/ref&gt;

Bastolla ''et al.'' introduced a simple measure of nestedness based on the number of common neighbours for each pair of nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bastolla U, Fortuna MA, Pascual-García A, Ferrera A, Luque B, Bascompte J |year=2009 |title=The architecture of mutualistic networks minimizes competition and increases biodiversity |journal=Nature |volume=458 |pages=1018–1020 |doi=10.1038/nature07950 |pmid=19396144}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that this can help reduce the effective competition between nodes in certain situations. For instance, two insect species might "help" each other by pollinating the same subset of plants, thereby reducing the extent to which they are harmful to each other. The authors suggest that this effect is behind a correlation between nestedness and diversity in plant-pollinator ecosystems. However, Johnson ''et al.'' have shown that this measure does not, in fact, properly account for the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Domínguez-García V, Muñoz MA |year=2013 |title=Factors Determining Nestedness in Complex Networks |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |pages=e74025 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0074025}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors propose a refined version of the measure, and go on to show how certain network properties affect nestedness.

'''Nyayakusumanjali''' ('' A Handful of Flowers of Logic'') is a treatise in [[Sanskrit]] composed by 10th century CE Indian logician and philosopher [[Udayana]]. The work has been described as codification of the Hindu proof for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edward Byles Cowell , Udayaṇācārya , Haridāsa Bhaṭṭācāryya|title=The Kusumānjali; Or, Hindu Proof of the Existence of a Supreme Being|date=1864|publisher=Printed at the Baptist Mission Press|url=https://archive.org/details/kusumnjaliorhin00bhagoog|accessdate=23 November 2016|ref=proof}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ben-Ami Scharfstein|title=A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant|date=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791436837|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that this treatise is the most elaborate and the most fundamental work of the Nyaya-Vaiseshika school on the Isvara doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=George Chemparathy|title=An Indian rational Theology: Introduction to Udayana's Nyakusumanjali|date=1972|publisher=Indologisches Institut der Universität Wien, Sammlung De Nobili|location=Druck: Ernst Becvar, A-1130 Wien|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An outline of Nyaya-kusumanjali==
In [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical]] writings a ''prakarana'' refers to a genre of work that may be considered as roughly equivalent to the Western concept of a [[monograph]]. Nyayakusumanjali is a treatise belonging to this genre.  Since the work consists of verses (known as ''karika''s) interspersed with prose, it can be considered as a work of the genre Misra-prakarana (meaning "mixed-''prakarana''").

There are seventy-three verses in Nyayakusumanjali. These verses are distributed unevenly in five chapters (called  ''Stabaka''s, that is, "cluster of blossoms" or  "bunch of flowers"). These chapters contain respectively twenty, four, twenty-three, six and twenty verses. These verses form the core of the work, the prose passage that accompanies each being an elaborate explanation of it.

After a few introductory lines,  Udayana enumerates five principal arguments which are said to invalidate the [[Existence of God|existence of Isvara]]: "With regard to this there are five erroneous opinions (which assert that there exists no Isvara) on the ground that: 
# there is no other-worldly means (of attaining) a world beyond; 
# even without assuming an Isvara the performance of the means of (attaining) the world beyond is possible; 
# there are arguments that make known the non-existence of Isvara; 
# even if Isvara existed, he would not be a source of valid cognition; and 
# there are no arguments that can validly establish his (existence)".&lt;ref name=chem&gt;{{cite book|last1=George Chemparathy|title=An Indian rational Theology: Introduction to Udayana's Nyakusumanjali|date=1972|publisher=Indologisches Institut der Universität Wien, Sammlung De Nobili|location=Druck: Ernst Becvar, A-1130 Wien|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various chapters of the Nyayakusumanjali deal with and refute these five erroneous opinions in the order in which they have been enunciated. However, some scholars are of the opinion that the first Stabaka refutes the view of the [[Carvaka]]s, the second the view of the [[Mimamsa]]kas, the third that of the [[Buddhist]]s, the fourth that of the [[Jainism|Jains]] and the fifth the view of the [[Samkhya|Samkhyins]].&lt;ref name=chem/&gt; Of the five chapters, the first four chapters have a negative tone in the sense that their main intention is to refute the objections of the different schools against the existence of Isvara. The last chapter has a positive tone in the sense that it tries to produce arguments and proofs for the existence of Isvara.

===Stabaka 1===

The first Stabaka begins with a dedicatory verse and it is followed with a statement regarding the theme dealt with in the book, namely the Supreme Soul. The author then summarises the reason for the logical discussion on Isvara: Despite the fact that Isvara is acknowledged by all philosophical schools and religious sects under some name or other, this study which is to be designated as reflection is made as an act of worship (upäsanä) that comes after the listening to the scriptures (sravanam). Then the  five objections against the existence of Isvara are listed.

Udayana lists five arguments for the existence of a supra-mundane means for attaining the other world. There is a supra-mundane cause because of the following reasons:

# This world is dependent on causes.
# The stream of causes is beginning-less.
# There is diversity of effects.
# There is universal practice  of sacrificial rites etc.
# The experience (of pleasure and pain) is confined to each individual soul.

The discussion of these five arguments forms the subject matter of the first Stabaka.

===Stabaka 2===

In this Stabaka, Udayana tries to refute the argument that the transmission of Dharma or religious duties is possible without an Isvara.
Udayana argues that the transmission of Dharma or religious duties is possible, because of the following reasons:

# Validity of cognition is not intrinsic, but extrinsic.
# There are creations and dissolutions of the universe.
# There can be no confidence in the transmission of Dharma by a person other than Isvara.
# There is no other way of explaining the transmission of Dharma except through Isvara.

The explanation of these four themes forms the content of the second Stabaka.

===Stabaka 3===

Taking one by one the different means of valid cognition admitted by the opponents, Udayana shows in this Stabaka that none of them can disprove the existence of Isvara.

# Direct perception cannot disprove the existence of Isvara.
# Inference cannot disprove the existence of Isvara.
# Comparison cannot disprove the existence of Isvara.
# Verbal testimony cannot disprove the existence of Isvara.
# Implication cannot disprove the existence of Isvara.
# Non-perception cannot disprove the existence or Isvara.

===Stabaka 4===

The major portion of this Stabaka is devoted to the refutation of the Mimamsaka theory that valid cognition must be of an object not previously cognised. Udayana then shows that the cognition of Isvara cannot be said to be invalid even according to the definition of valid cognition given by the opponents.

===Stabaka 5===

Udayana brings forward in this Stabaka a number of proofs to establish the existence of Isvara. The various proofs can be summarized as follows. Isvara's existence is established from:

# ''käryatvät'': the fact that the earth etc., being effects, presuppose a cause that produces them.
# ''ayojanat'': the necessity of a conscious agent to impel the atoms to combine themselves and form the universe.
# ''dhrteh'': the necessity of a supporting agent of the universe preventing it from falling down.
# ''samharanat'': the necessity of a being endowed with the quality of effort in order to cause the dissolution of the universe into its ultimate components.
# ''padat'': the fact that at the time of the new creation an instructor is required to teach the living beings the different usages.
# ''pratyaydt'': the authoritativeness of the Vedic tradition.
# ''sruteh'': the fact that the Vedic nature of the Veda requires an omniscient author.
# ''anvayatah'': the fact that the Vedic sentences require a person as author.
# ''samkhyävisesat'': the necessity of a relating cognition, at the time of the origin of the universe, in order to produce the plural number which in turn causes magnitude in the triads.

==Other works by Udayana==
Seven works have been ascribed to Udayana. The following are the titles of the works in the chronological order in which they are believed to have been composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=George Chemparathy|title=An Indian rational Theology: Introduction to Udayana's Nyakusumanjali|date=1972|publisher=Indologisches Institut der Universität Wien, Sammlung De Nobili|location=Druck: Ernst Becvar, A-1130 Wien|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{globalize|article|USA|date=December 2010}}
{{Onesource|date=February 2015}}

'''Onsite''' (or '''on-site''') '''sewage facilities''' ('''OSSF''') are [[wastewater]] systems designed to treat and dispose of effluent on the same property that produces the wastewater.

A [[septic tank]] and [[Septic drain field|drainfield]] combination is a fairly common type of on-site sewage facility in the United States. OSSFs account for approximately 25% of all domestic [[wastewater treatment]] in the United States. Onite sewage facilities may also be based on small-scale [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[biofilter]] units, [[Membrane bioreactor|membrane bioreactors]] or [[Sequencing batch reactor|sequencing batch reactors]]. These can be thought of as scaled down versions of municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants.

==Process description==
[[File:Septic field.jpg|thumb|Septic field (background) in public park at [[Wallendbeen]], Australia]]
The primary mechanism of biological waste recycling in the natural environment is performed by other organisms such as animals, insects, soil microorganisms, plants, and fungi, which consume all available nutrients in the waste, leaving behind fully decomposed solids that become part of [[topsoil]], and pure [[drinking water]] that has been stripped of everything that can possibly be consumed and utilized. This natural biological purification requires time and space to process wastes.

In virtually all engineered onsite sewage facilities, recycling and decomposition by natural organisms is still the primary mechanism of sewage disposal. Giving the organisms the time they need to decompose wastes is accomplished by establishing minimum sewage retention and settling times, and minimum liquid flow distances between sewage disposal sites and [[surface water]] or [[water well]]s.

===Differences===
It is normal for animals such as mice, rats, flies, and parasites to participate in the fully natural biological waste recycling process. Engineered facilities typically attempt to exclude them to prevent out of control population explosions and [[infestation]], and prevent spread of [[vermin]] and [[disease]].

Although the solids collected by onsite sewage facilities can potentially be used as compost to build topsoil, these solids are often incompletely decomposed due to either a lack of onsite storage space to wait for decomposition (municipal facilities), or because the solids are being stacked in a layered structure of new waste solids on top of previously decomposed solids (septic tanks and outhouses). Due to the incomplete state of decomposition, when removed from an onsite sewage facility, these solids are typically referred to as ''sludge'' rather than ''compost'', and have powerful offensive odors arising from the microorganisms still consuming nutrients in the sludge. 

Engineered facilities that use water suspension to transport solids (private septic systems and municipal facilities) typically form a floating layer in their primary settling tank, consisting of low-density liquids such as oils, buoyant solids, and soap foam. This is referred to as ''scum'' and is slowly decomposed by microorganisms, eventually falling to the bottom of the settling tank as part of the sludge. When private septic tanks are emptied of solids, the tank is typically vacuumed empty and the incompletely digested scum is added to the incompletely digested sludge, further adding to its aroma and bioactivity.

If left completely undisturbed and exposed to the open air through a vent, the sludge and scum in a settling tank will eventually be turned completely into low-odor compost. By building two tanks side by side, and diverting sewage between them, one tank can be allowed to rest while the other is in use, and the resting tank can be safely and easily cleaned out by hand before it is used again. This has been proposed as a solution for onsite sewage facilities in subsistence agriculture economies where hand labor is the most abundant.

Although human body waste is no different from the waste of any other animal, municipal facilities may be required to bury the collected solids in landfills, due to the risk of toxic contaminants placed into the shared communal sewage system, by humans unaware of the harm they are causing. Municipal facilities may also collect runoff from roadways, which contains traces of all the various chemicals used in vehicles such as brake fluid and engine oil, and those used in melting ice and snow.  Private septic systems typically do not experience these issues, as the homeowner is directly aware that they must not pour toxic chemicals down the drain.

==Improving treatment through performance requirements==

Most onsite wastewater treatment systems are of the conventional type, consisting of a septic tank and a subsurface wastewater infiltration system (SWIS). Site limitations and more stringent performance requirements have led to significant improvements in the design of wastewater treatment systems and how they are managed. Over the past 20 years the onsite wastewater treatment system (OWTS) industry has developed many new treatment technologies that can achieve high performance levels on sites with size, soil, ground water, and landscape limitations that might preclude installing conventional systems. New technologies and improvements to existing technologies are based on defining the performance requirements of the system, characterizing wastewater flow and pollutant loads, evaluating site conditions, defining performance and design boundaries, and selecting a system design that addresses these factors.

Performance requirements can be expressed as numeric criteria (e.g., pollutant concentration or mass loading limits) or narrative criteria (e.g., no odors or visible sheen) and are based on the assimilative capacity of regional ground water or surface waters, water quality objectives, and public health goals. Wastewater flow and pollutant content help define system design and size and can be estimated by comparing the size and type of facility with measured effluent outputs from similar, existing facilities. Site evaluations integrate detailed analyses of regional hydrology, geology, and water resources with site specific characterization of soils, slopes, structures, property lines, and other site features to further define system design requirements and determine the physical placement of system components.

Most of the alternative treatment technologies applied today treat wastes after they exit the septic tank; the tank retains settleable solids, grease, and oils and provides an environment for partial digestion of settled organic wastes. Post-tank treatment can include aerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (with no or low oxygen) biological treatment in suspended or fixed-film reactors, physical/chemical treatment, soil infiltration, [[trickling filters|fixed-media filtration]], and/or disinfection. The application and sizing of treatment units based on these technologies are defined by performance requirements, wastewater characteristics, and site conditions.

==Usage==
===United States===
In the United States, on site sewage facilities collect, treat, and release about {{convert|4|e9USgal|m3}} of treated effluent per day from an estimated 26 million homes, businesses, and recreational facilities nationwide (U.S. Census Bureau, 1997). Recognition of the impacts of onsite systems on ground water and surface water quality (e.g., nitrate and bacteria contamination, nutrient inputs to surface waters) has increased interest in optimizing the systems' performance. [[Public health]] and environmental protection officials now acknowledge that onsite systems are not just temporary installations that will be replaced eventually by centralized sewage treatment services, but permanent approaches to treating wastewater for release and reuse in the environment. Onsite systems are recognized as viable, low-cost, long-term, decentralized approaches to wastewater treatment if they are planned, designed, installed, operated, and maintained properly (USEPA, 1997). NOTE: In addition to existing state and local oversight, decentralized wastewater treatment systems that serve more than 20 people might become subject to regulation under the USEPA's Underground Injection Control Program, although EPA has proposed not to include them (64FR22971:5/7/01).

Although some onsite wastewater management programs have functioned successfully in the past, problems persist. Most current onsite regulatory programs focus on permitting and installation.

Few programs address onsite system operation and maintenance, resulting in failures that lead to unnecessary costs and risks to public health and water resources. Moreover, the lack of coordination among agencies that oversee land use planning, zoning, development, water resource protection, public health initiatives, and onsite systems causes problems that could be prevented through a more cooperative approach. Effective management of onsite systems requires rigorous planning, design, installation, operation, maintenance, monitoring, and controls.

====Public health and water resource impacts====
State and tribal agencies report that onsite septic systems currently constitute the third most common source of [[groundwater pollution]] and that these systems have failed because of inappropriate siting or design or inadequate long-term maintenance (USEPA, 1996a). In the 1996 Clean Water Needs Survey (USEPA, 1996b), states and tribes also identified more than 500 communities as having failed septic systems that have caused public health problems. The discharge of partially treated sewage from malfunctioning onsite systems was identified as a principal or contributing source of degradation in 32 percent of all harvest-limited shellfish growing areas. Onsite wastewater treatment systems have also contributed to an overabundance of nutrients in ponds, lakes, and coastal estuaries, leading to the excessive growth of algae and other nuisance aquatic plants (USEPA, 1996b). In addition, onsite systems contribute to contamination of drinking water sources. USEPA estimates that 168,000 viral illnesses and 34,000 bacterial illnesses occur each year as a result of consumption of drinking water from systems that rely on improperly treated ground water. Malfunctioning septic systems have been identified as one potential source of ground water contamination (USEPA, 2000).

=== Europe ===
The potential market volume of on-site treatment is suggested to be about 35 million [[Population equivalent|population equivalents]] for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eggimann S., Truffer, B., Feldmann, U., Maurer, M.|year=2018|title=Screening European market potentials for small modular wastewater treatment systems – an inroad to sustainability transitions in urban water management?|journal=Land use Policy|volume=78|pages=711-725|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.07.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Painting of the Six Kings''''' is a [[fresco]] found on the wall of [[Qasr Amra]], a [[desert castles|desert castle]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] located in modern-day [[Jordan]]. It depicts six rulers standing in two rows of three.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} Four of the six have inscriptions in [[Arabic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] identifying them as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor, King [[Roderic]] of [[Hispania]], the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] emperor, and the [[Negus]] of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]].&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=205}} The painting, now substantially damaged, is thought to be from between 710 and 750,{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=121}} commissioned by the Umayyad [[caliphate|caliph]] or someone in his family.{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=187}} It is one of the most famous frescoes in the Qasr Amra complex.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=197}}

==Location and history==
[[File:Qusayr Amra.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Qasr Amra]] complex, the site of the painting]]
[[File:AloisMusil1901.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Alois Musil, the first Westerner who encountered the painting.{{sfn|Khouri|1990}}]]
The painting is located in [[Qasr Amra]] (also transcribed "Quseir Amra", literally "little palace of Amra"), an Umayyad desert structure and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Quseir Amra|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/327|author=UNESCO|work=World Heritage List}}&lt;/ref&gt; about {{convert|85|km|mi}} east of [[Amman]] and {{convert|21|km|mi}} southwest of the [[Azraq Wetland Reserve]], [[Jordan]].{{sfn|Khouri|1990}} The complex has several frescoes painted on its walls.{{sfn|Khouri|1990}} The remoteness and size of the structure suggest that it served as a desert retreat for Umayyad rulers at the time.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

The painting is on the southern end of the west portion of the main wall.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=197}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} Along with other works in the complex, it was cleaned and preserved in the 1970s by a team from the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]].{{sfn|Khouri|1990}}

Historian Elizabeth Drayson estimated the earliest possible date for the painting to be 710, the year of the accession of Roderic{{snd}}one of the kings portrayed in the painting{{snd}}and the latest to be 750, the year of [[Abbasid Revolution]] that overthrew the Umayyads.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=121}} The artist who painted the fresco is unknown. The patron who commissioned the building, including the painting, was likely one of the caliphs [[al-Walid I]] (reigned 705–715), [[al-Walid II]] ({{r.}}{{nbsp}}743–744) or [[Yazid III]] ({{r.}}{{nbsp}}744).{{sfn|Baker|1980}} It might have been commissioned after the patron became caliph, or before, when the patron was a member of the caliph's family and held the position of governor or heir.{{sfn|Baker|1980}}

The complex, long familiar to local nomads, was discovered (to the West) by the Czech scholar [[Alois Musil]] in 1898.{{sfn|Khouri|1990}} Musil and his companion, Austrian artist [[Alphons Leopold Mielich]], tried to remove the painting from the site, causing permanent damage.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}} A fragment of the painting, containing labels and partial crowns of two of the figures, is now in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Museum of Islamic Art (Berlin)|de|3=Museum für Islamische Kunst (Berlin)|lt=Museum of Islamic Art}}, [[Berlin]].{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=12}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=203}}&lt;ref&gt;Museum für Islamische Kunst, Berlin, inv. no. I.1265&lt;/ref&gt;

Musil's 1907 publication ''Kusejr 'Amra''{{sfn|Musil|1907}} included a [[tracing (art)|tracing]] made by Mielich on the spot, Musil's interpretative copy made on the spot, Mielich's later reproduction, and Mielich's written description of the painting.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=12}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|pp=203–204}} This publication included their observations made before much of the damage to the painting was done.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}}

==Description==
[[File:Amra5.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A 1907 reproduction of the damaged painting&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;]]
The painting is badly damaged, partly due to the efforts by Alois Musil to remove it.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}} Large portions of the figures and their garments are not clearly visible. There are six rulers, or kings, standing facing the viewer in two rows of three.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} Each king stretches out both hands with palms turned upwards. Inscriptions in Greek and Arabic above four of the figures, written in white letters on a blue background,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=203}} identify them as:&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}
* ''Kaisar''/''Qaysar'' ("[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]"), the Byzantine emperor, face not visible, wearing imperial robes and tiara,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} 
* ''Rodorikos''/''Ludhriq'', [[Roderic]], the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king of Hispania, barely visible, except for the tip of his helmet and robes,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}
* [[Khosrow (word)|''Khosroes''/''Kisra'']], the Sasanian emperor, appearing young with curly hair, wearing a crown, a cloak, and shoes,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|pp=204–205}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} and
* ''[[Armah|Najashi]]'', the Negus of the Kingdom of Aksum, in a light garment with red [[stole (shawl)|stole]].{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=205}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

The labels were already fragile when Musil found it, and many of the labels were lost when he and Mielich tried to clean the painting and remove it from the site.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=203}} However, Musil's 1907 publication provided his reproduction of the labels before the damage.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}} Apart from the four rulers, no identification remains visible for the other two rulers. Possible identities speculated for them include the [[emperor of China]],&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; a [[Khan (title)|Turkic leader]],&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; and an Indian ruler.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

Alongside the painting of the six kings, on the same wall, is a painting of a woman with the Greek word [[Nike (mythology)|ΝΙΚΗ]] ''Nikē'' "Victory" above her.{{sfn|Baker|1980}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=119}} Opposite the painting, towards which the six rulers are gesturing, is a painting of a man seated on a throne. Above this man is an inscription containing a blessing on a person whose name is now invisible.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=119}}

==Interpretation==
The intent and meaning of the painting are unclear, and disputed by scholars.{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=185}} The highly diverse interpretations of the painting are partly due to the loss of information from the damage.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

According to Islamic art consultant Patricia Baker, the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "victory" appearing nearby suggests that the image was meant to suggest the caliph's supremacy over his enemies.{{sfn|Baker|1980}} Betsy Williams of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] suggested that the six figures are depicted in supplication, presumably towards the caliph who would be seated in the hall.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; Other scholars, including Arabic [[epigraphist]] [[Max van Berchem]] and architectural historian [[K. A. C. Creswell]], argued that the six rulers are a representation of the defeated enemies of Islam.{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=185}} [[Iranologist]] and archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld]] argued that the painting is an Umayyad copy or version of the Sassanian "Kings of the Earth" located at [[Kermanshah]], as recorded by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] in his work ''[[Mu'jam al-Buldan]]'' (''Dictionary of Countries'').{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=185}} Art historian [[Oleg Grabar]] interpreted the painting as an attempt to convey the idea that the Umayyad dynasty was the descendant and heir of the dynasties it had defeated.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=121}}{{sfn|Grabar|1954}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of charity''' or '''charitable interpretation''' requires interpreting a speaker's statements in the most rational way possible and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Normand Baillargeon: ''Intellectual Self-Defense''. Seven Stories Press 2007, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In its narrowest sense, the goal of this methodological principle is to avoid attributing irrationality, [[logical fallacies]], or falsehoods to the others' statements, when a coherent, rational interpretation of the statements is available. According to [[Simon Blackburn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Blackburn |first=Simon
|year=1994
|title=''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]''
|location=Oxford
|publisher=Oxford University Press
|page=62
}}&lt;/ref&gt; "it constrains the interpreter to maximize the truth or rationality in the subject's sayings."

==Application==
Neil L. Wilson gave the principle its name in 1958–59. Its main area of application, by his lights, is determining the referent of a proper name:
&lt;blockquote&gt;How should we set about discovering the significance which a person attaches to a given name? […] Let us suppose that somebody (whom I am calling "Charles") makes just the following five assertions containing the name "Caesar." […]&lt;br/&gt;
(1) Caesar conquered Gaul. (Gc) &lt;br/&gt;
(2) Caesar crossed the Rubicon. (Rc) &lt;br/&gt;
(3) Caesar was murdered on the Ides of March. (Mc) &lt;br/&gt;
(4) Caesar was addicted to the use of the ablative absolute. (Ac)&lt;br/&gt;
(5) Caesar was married to Boadicea. (Bc)&lt;br/&gt;
[…] And so we act on what might be called the Principle of Charity. We select as designatum that individual which will make the largest possible number of Charles' statements true. […] We might say the designatum is that individual which satisfies more of the asserted matrices containing the word "Caesar" than does any other individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide other formulations of the principle of charity. Davidson sometimes referred to it as ''the principle of rational accommodation''. He summarized it: ''We make maximum sense of the words and thoughts of others when we interpret in a way that optimises agreement''. The principle may be invoked to make sense of a speaker's utterances when one is unsure of their meaning. In particular, Quine's use of the principle gives it this latter, wide domain.

Since the time of Quine ''et al.'', other philosophers{{Who|date=August 2011}} have formulated at least four versions of the principle of charity. These alternatives may conflict with one another, so which principle to use may depend on the goal of the conversation. The four principles are:

#The other uses words in the ordinary way;
#The other makes true statements;
#The other makes valid arguments;
#The other says something interesting.

A related principle is the [[principle of humanity]], which states that we must assume that another speaker's beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances" ([[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in ''The Intentional Stance'', p.&amp;nbsp;343).

'''Quantitative psychological research''' is defined as [[psychology|psychological]] research which performs [[mathematical modeling]] and [[statistical estimation]] or [[statistical inference]] or a means for testing objective theories by examining the relationship between variables.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last=Creswell|first=J.|title=Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches|year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first definition distinguishes it from [[qualitative psychological research]]; however, there has been a long debate on the difference between quantitative and qualitative research. It has been argued that because this debated has not found an end, the differences are enough that both quantitative and qualitative research is valuable in ways that both should be used in the gathering of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=K.|title=Quantitative versus Qualitative Research: An Attempt to Clarify the Issue|journal=Educational Researcher|date=March 1983|volume=12|issue=3|pages=6–13|jstor=1175144|doi=10.3102/0013189x012003006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[Statistics]] is widely used in quantitative psychological research. Typically a project begins with the collection of data based on a theory or hypothesis, followed by the application of descriptive or inferential statistical methods. Often it is necessary to collect a very large volume of data, which require validating, verifying and recording. Software packages such as [[SPSS]] and [[R (programming language)|R]] are typically used for this purpose, and for subsequent analysis. Causal relationships are studied by manipulating factors thought to influence the phenomena of interest while controlling other variables relevant to the experimental outcomes. Researchers might measure and study the relationship between education and measurable psychological effects, whilst controlling for other key variables. Quantitatively based surveys are widely used by psychologists, and statistics such as the proportion of respondents who display one or more psychological traits reported. In such surveys, respondents are asked a set of structured questions and their responses are tabulated. The software can then perform correlation analysis or other procedures on the data. Surveys are a common example of how statistics and quantitative research are utilized to gather data.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

{{Rape}}
A '''rape fantasy''' (sometimes referred to as '''rapeplay''') or a '''ravishment''' is a [[sexual fantasy]] involving imagining or pretending being coerced or coercing another into [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. In [[sexual roleplay]], it involves acting out roles of [[Rape|coercive sex]]. [[Rape pornography]] is literature or images associated with rape and sometimes [[Stockholm syndrome]] as a means of [[sexual arousal]].

== Fantasy ==
Studies have found rape fantasy is a common sexual fantasy among both men and women. The fantasy may involve the fantasist as either the one being forced into sex or being the perpetrator. A 1974 study by Hariton and Singer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Specific Sexual Fantasy Themes: A Multidimensional Study |author1=William B. Arndt, Jr. |author2=John C. Foehl |author3=F. Elaine Good |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.48.2.472 |date=1985 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=472–480 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that being "overpowered or forced to surrender" was the second most frequent fantasy in their survey; a 1984 study by Knafo and Jaffe ranked being overpowered as their study's most common fantasy during intercourse. In 1985, Louis H. Janda who is an associate professor of psychology at [[Old Dominion University]]&lt;ref&gt;no author. (2005, April 6) Louis H. Janda Associate Professor of Psychology. Retrieved on August 9, 2015, from [http://ww2.sci.odu.edu/psychology/directory/janda.shtml link]&lt;/ref&gt; said that the sexual fantasy of being raped is the most common sexual fantasy for women.&lt;!-- This is in the middle of page 334.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janda, L.H. (1985). How to live with an imperfect person. USA: Wellness Institute, Inc. {{ISBN|1-58741-007-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1988 study by Pelletier and Herold found that over half of their female respondents had fantasies of forced sex.&lt;!--This is in the left-middle of page 125.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. (2001). Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings. Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press. {{ISBN|1-84169-018-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most frequently cited hypothesis for why women fantasize of being forced and coerced into some sexual activity is that the fantasy avoids societally induced guilt—the woman does not have to admit responsibility for her sexual desires and behavior. A 1978 study by Moreault and Follingstad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://uknowledge.uky.edu/crvaw_facpub/53/ |title=Sexual Fantasies of Females as a Function of Sex Guilt and Experimenta |author1=Denise Moreault |author2=Diane R. Follingstad |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.46.6.1385 |date=1978 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1385–1393 |pmid=730888 |accessdate=2014-06-16 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; was consistent with this hypothesis, and found that women with high levels of sex guilt were more likely to report fantasy themed around being overpowered, dominated, and helpless. In contrast, Pelletier and Herold used a different measure of guilt and found no correlation. Other research suggests that women who report forced sex fantasies have a more positive attitude towards sexuality, contradicting the guilt hypothesis.{{sfn|Strassberg|Lockerd|1998|p=405}} A 1998 study by Strassberg and Lockerd found that women who fantasized about force were generally less guilty and more [[erotophilia|erotophilic]], and as a result had more frequent and varied fantasies. However, it said that force fantasies are not the most common or the most frequent.{{sfn|Strassberg|Lockerd|1998|p=416}}

45.8% of men in a 1980 study reported fantasizing during heterosexual [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] about "a scene where [they had] the impression of being raped by a woman" (3.2% often and 42.6% sometimes), 44.7% of scenes where a seduced woman "pretends resisting" and 33% of raping a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crépault C, Couture M |title=Men's erotic fantasies |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=565–81 |year=1980 |pmid=7458662 |doi=10.1007/BF01542159 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male sexual fantasy of raping a woman may bring sexual arousal either from imagining a scene in which first a woman objects but then comes to like and eventually participate in the intercourse, or else one in which the woman does not like it and arousal is associated with the idea of hurting the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Arousal: The Secret Logic of Sexual Fantasies |last=Bader |first=Michael J. |year=2003 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |location= |isbn=0-312-30242-8 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of college-age women in 1998 found over half had engaged in fantasies of rape or coercion which, another study suggests, are simply "open and unrestricted" expressions of [[female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Force in Women's Sexual Fantasies |last=Strassberg |first=Donald S. |last2=Locker |first2=Lisa K. |year=1998 |journal=Arch Sex Behav |issn=1573-2800 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=403–414 |doi=10.1023/A:1018740210472 |pmid=9681121 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roleplay ==
One form of [[sexual roleplay]]ing is the rape fantasy, also called ravishment or forced sex roleplay. In [[BDSM]] circles (and occasionally outside these circles as well), some people choose to roleplay rape scenes—with communication, consent and safety being especially crucial elements. Though consent is a crucial component of any sexual roleplay, the illusion of non-consent (i.e. rape) is important to maintaining this type of fantasy. Due to this, the usage of a [[safeword]] is a logical safety measure, given that words that would normally halt sexual activity (i.e. stop) are often disregarded in these scenes. Continuing with the sexual roleplay after a safeword has been used constitutes [[sexual assault|assault]], as the use of a safeword indicates the withdrawal of consent.

{{inconsistent citation style|date=August 2013}}
'''Reverence''' ({{IPA|/ˈrɛvərəns/}}) is "a feeling or attitude of deep [[respect]] tinged with [[awe]]; veneration".&lt;ref&gt;Reverence | Define Reverence at Dictionary.com. (n.d.). Dictionary.com | Free Online Dictionary for English Definitions. Retrieved April 28, 2011, from http://dictionary.reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "reverence" in the modern day is often used in relationship with [[religion]].  This is because religion often stimulates the emotion through recognition of [[God]], the [[supernatural]], and the [[ineffability|ineffable]].  Reverence involves a humbling of the self in respectful recognition of something perceived to be greater than the self.  Thus religion is commonly a place where reverence is felt.

However, similar to [[awe]], reverence is an emotion in its own right, and can be felt outside of the realm of [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gibbons|first= Kendyl   |date=  May 15, 2012 |title= Primal reverence |journal= UU World |volume=   XXVII No. 2 |issue= Summer 2012 |pages=  |publisher= [[Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations]] |id=   |doi= |url=  http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/199598.shtml |quote= Reverence is an organic human experience that requires no supernatural explanations.'|accessdate= July 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas awe may be characterized as an overwhelming "[[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] to greatness," reverence is seen more as "acknowledging a [[subjectivity|subjective]] response to something [[excellence|excellent]] in a personal ([[moral]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]]) way, but qualitatively above oneself" &lt;ref&gt;Roberts, R. C. (2003). Emotions: An essay in aid of moral psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon describes awe as passive, but reverence as active, noting that the [[feeling]] of awe (i.e., becoming awestruck) implies [[paralysis]], whereas feelings of reverence are associated more with active [[engagement]] and responsibility toward that which one reveres.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, R. C. (2002). Spirituality for the skeptic: The thoughtful love of life. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nature]], [[science]], [[literature]], [[philosophy]], great [[philosophers]], [[leaders]], [[artists]], [[art]], [[music]], [[wisdom]], and [[beauty]] may each act as the stimulus and focus of reverence.

== Religion and music ==
David Pugmire’s article, "The Secular Reception of Religious Music" explores the unique experience of reverence through music.  In particular he looks at how religious music has the capacity to instill emotions of reverence, awe, wonder, and veneration in secular people who lack the context to fully understand the transcendent through religion.  "Sacred music seems to have a surprising power over unbelievers not just to quicken or delight them as other music does, but also to ply them, as little else can, with what might be called devotional feelings".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"&gt;Pugmire, D. (2006). The Secular Reception of Religious Music. Philosophy, 81(315), 65-79. {{doi|10.1017/S0031819106000040}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with this though, Pugmire argues that the secularist cannot fully comprehend the nature of sacred art including sacred music.  "Its undoubted expressiveness can lead him at most to accesses of feeling, not to emotion in the fullest sense, i.e., emotion with appropriate objects sustained by appropriate judgments".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;

Pugmire believes that reverence belongs to the range of emotions that can be classified in their devotional or [[sacred]] forms, "Emotions of reverence, solemnity, agape, hope, serenity, and ecstasy".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But this classification of emotions poses an interesting question: can any emotion be purely religious?  "A central candidate for a distinctively religious emotion would be reverence".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But it is not entirely distinct from the rest of the emotions that are not related to transcendence or religion.  "Reverence is indeed graver, and an attitude in which one is more given over, than its secular approximations in the shape of approval or esteem or respect".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But this does not make it purely religious.  In fact, "[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] was able to claim reverence as our principal moral emotion without invoking any grounding theological basis for this".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  "Similarly for its bracing sibling, awe: it figures in our experience of the sublime, of which Kant purports to find an entirely secular account".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  To connect the secular and the sacred emotions Pugmire looks at the emotions which can be experienced equally in both contexts.  These are, "Love, humility, sorrow, pity, joy, serenity, ecstasy".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  Pugmire then suggests that devotional emotion is: "The transfiguring of mundane emotion into what one might call emotion of the last instance, to the reception and expression of which religious imagery is especially well-suited, and not accidentally".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  The emotion of the last instance refers to the capacity of the emotional imagination to lose the sense of self and engage in the infinite and the ineffable.  Pugmire is suggesting that religion, "Provides a strikingly apt vocabulary for the expression of emotion of the last instance".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  Reverence is perhaps the most critical of these "emotions of the last instance" and can be adequately accessed through religious music.

==Major Theorists of Reverence ==

=== Paul Woodruff ===
[[Paul Woodruff]] in his book, ''Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue'', assesses the current understanding of the emotion reverence in the modern era.  He assesses that a true understanding of reverence is missing from both modern society and the "modern discussions of the ancient cultures that prized it" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;3).  Specifically these ancient cultures include [[Greece]] and [[China]].  Woodruff’s best definition of Reverence is, "The well-developed capacity to have the feelings of [[awe]], [[respect]], and [[shame]] when these are the right feelings to have" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;8).  Thus Woodruff’s definition of reverence includes the combination of three other emotions: respect, shame, and awe.  "Respect is for other people, shame is over one’s own shortcomings, and awe is usually felt toward something transcendent" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;65).
Although Woodruff acknowledges the relationship between reverence and religion he argues that, "Reverence has more to do with politics than with religion" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;4).  Woodruff in his book is trying to separate the common misunderstanding that reverent emotions can only be related to religion.

Woodruff sees [[ceremony]] and [[ritual]] as key elements in meaningful human life when practiced with reverence.  "Without reverence, rituals are empty" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;19).  Ceremony and ritual are found at home, in meetings, in voting, and in religion and these acts provide the context for feeling reverence.  But often these situations are so common the emotion reverence disappears from human consciousness. "Ritual and reverence in common life are so familiar that we scarcely notice them until they are gone" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;35).  Woodruff argues that, "Reverence, ceremony and respect do not disappear, they cannot disappear from a functioning society" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;36).  He states that "What we are losing is not reverence, but the idea of reverence" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;36).  It is his hope that the importance of reverence will be recognized in society again and that this recognition will better humanity. He proposes to "Restore the idea of reverence to its proper place in ethical and political thought" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;38).

Woodruff understands true reverence to be for things beyond human control.  "The object of reverence is the ideal of unity, because that transcends politics altogether" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;28).  Thus reverence focuses on an ideal that transcends the scope of humankind.  This ideal can vary from God, to unity, to anything else that transcends human capacity.  "Reverence sets a higher value on the truth than on any human product that is supposed to have captured the truth" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;39). He goes on to say that, "The principal object of reverence is Something that reminds us of human limitations" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;65).  Reverence therefore is related to truth and the recognition that mankind cannot acquire absolute truth and that human life is finite.

Woodruff describes how reverence is often activated through [[music]].  Woodruff claims that "Reverence cannot be expressed in a creed; its most apt expression is in music" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;123).  He gives the analogy of a quartet of varying skill levels playing a piece by [[Mozart]].  They embody reverence because: "(1) The musicians have been engaged, more or less harmoniously, on a project as a group; (2) their project involved ceremony; (3) they have felt themselves largely without ego; (4) they have felt themselves to be part of a clearly defined hierarchy that was painless for all of them; and (5) they have achieved in the end a shared feeling of inarticulate awe" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;48-49).  This coincides with his belief that "Art speaks the language of reverence better than philosophy does, and speak(s) it to the reverence that is already in the town" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;25).  By "in the town" Woodruff is referring to the recognition of reverence that is already present.

"In the presence of death we expect ourselves and others to be reverent; the expectation feels natural, and yet the ceremonies through which we express reverence at such times take very different forms in different cultures" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;50).  In his conversation on funerals as times of reverence he makes the point that reverence transcends faith and that it is constant throughout human history even when religions change (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;54.).  "You need not believe in God to be reverent, but to develop an occasion for reverence you must share a culture with others, and this must support a degree of ceremony" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;50).  Reverence is not dependent on religion, but true religious experience is dependent on the emotion reverence.

Paul Woodruff builds his case on reverence by analyzing the historical significance of reverence as a virtue.  In Ancient Greek and Chinese civilizations, "Both cultures celebrate reverence in the belief that it is reverence above all that maintains social order and harmony" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;60).  For the Greeks reverence was rooted in [[mythology]]. "[[Protagoras]] invented a myth in which the highest god gave reverence and justice to human beings as means for the survival of society" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;57).  This foundation was critical because "Emotions affect action; they are motivators" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;62).  Reverence in classical Greek society then motivated the populous to act rightly and be humble to improve society.  "We feel awe for what we believe is above us all as human beings, and this feeling helps us to avoid treating other human beings with contempt" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;63).

Woodruff uses the Greek heroes and Athenian tragedies to illustrate his conception of reverence.  He uses the story of [[Croesus]] by [[Herodotus]] to help shape an understanding of reverence that includes respect for those lower in hierarchical status.  "A reverent soul listens to other people even when they are inferior; that is a large part of remembering that you are human together with them" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;83).  He also illustrates reverence with the [[Iliad]], [[Antigone]], [[Pentheus]], [[Pericles]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Oedipus]], and the [[Odyssey]].  Through these figures he shows that reverence was quite significant in Greek culture.  In Oedipus, Woodruff asserts that, "[[Hubris]] is best understood simply as the opposite of reverence, in action or attitude" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;91).

After building his case with a look at classical Greek culture he looks at classical Chinese [[Confucian]] society.   "[[Filial piety]] expresses reverence within the family" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;103).  The most important part of his connection between reverence and the Chinese is his understanding of [[Li (Confucian)|li]].  "Li refers also to civility or reverence" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;105).  One interesting connection between Greek and Chinese societies is that, "Both conceptions of reverence blossom with the passing away of polytheism and the rise of agnosticism.  Reverence survives and flourishes in these circumstances because it is something that human beings need in order to face the most obvious, common, and inevitable facts of human life – [[family]], [[hierarchy]], and [[death]]" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;110).  Most of his information on reverence in Chinese culture derives from the [[Analects]]. Woodruff believes that a break in tradition is not necessarily irreverent and that [[relativism]] is flawed.  People should be critical of all cultures and forms of reverence (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;155).

=== Abraham Maslow ===

[[Abraham Maslow]] in his significant work, ''Religions, Values, and Peak-Experiences'', deals extensively with reverence.  Reverence is critical in having a peak-experience.  He makes the case that peak-experiences happen for the religious and non-religious alike and that they are critical to having a fulfilling life.  For Maslow the distinction between the secular and the profane is unfortunate.  Maslow points out that, "Religionizing only one part of life secularizes the rest of it".&lt;ref name="MAH"&gt;Maslow, A. H. (1964). Religions, values, and peak-experiences, . Columbus: Ohio State University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Maslow contends that religion seeks to make the emotion reverence possible through ritual, but that the familiarity of it often negates any reverent feelings.&lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt;  In defining peak-experiences Maslow states that, "Such emotions as wonder, awe, reverence, humility, surrender, and even worship before the greatness of the experience are often reported".&lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt;  Reverence therefore is a key ingredient in the peak-experiences that make life worth living and make mankind feel fully human.

=== Albert Schweitzer ===

[[Albert Schweitzer]], winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and holder of four PhD degrees, sought for years for the basis of a new worldview. One day, while in a boat on the river in Gabon, it struck him with great force and clarity: "Reverence for life" (In German: Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben).

== Empirical Studies ==

=== Reverence and Patient Recovery ===
Empirical studies on reverence are scarce.  However, one intriguing study on reverence is, "Prayer and reverence in naturalistic, aesthetic, and socio-moral contexts predicted fewer complications following coronary artery bypass," conducted by Ai ''et al.'' (2009).&lt;ref name="AAL et al."&gt;Ai, A. L., Wink, P., Tice, T. N., Bolling, S. F., &amp; Shearer, M. (2009). Prayer and reverence in naturalistic, aesthetic, and socio-moral contexts predicted fewer complications following coronary artery bypass. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 32(6), 570-581. {{doi|10.1007/s10865-009-9228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These researchers looked at reverence following a coronary artery bypass.  Ai ''et al.'' (2009) examined a "sense of reverence in religious and secular contexts" by interviewing 177 patients.&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  Specifically they were investigating the faith-health relationship and seeking to find if religious forms of reverence practiced through faith and prayer yielded similar results to secular forms of reverence in patient recovery.  Ai ''et al.'' (2009)state that, "Because reverence includes an affective as well as a cognitive component, we see it as a form of positive feeling/emotion associated with injection of the sacred into various worldviews".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  These positive emotions were believed to help in patient recovery.  The first finding of Ai ''et al.'' (2009) was consistent with other research that found "Positive influences of traditional religious involvement on health outcomes".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  The second finding of Ai ''et al.'' (2009) was the "Positive effect of secular reverence on postoperative no-complication".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  From this Ai ''et al.'' (2009) inferred that, "The capacity to sense reverence in significant naturalistic, moralistic, and aesthetic contexts seems to enhance recovery following bypass".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  Strangely, "Religious reverence did not have the same beneficial effect as secular reverence on bypass recovery".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  This inconsistency suggests that more research needs to be done on reverence in patient recovery.

=== Awe ===
Keltner and Haidt’s extensive study on awe focuses on the importance of vastness and accommodation in experiencing awe.  "Vastness refers to anything that is experienced as being much larger that the self".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"&gt;Keltner, D., &amp; Haidt, J. (2003). Approaching awe, a moral, spiritual, and aesthetic emotion. Cognition and Emotion, 17(2), 297-314. {{doi|10.1080/02699930302297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accommodation refers to the "Process of adjusting mental structures that cannot assimilate a new experience".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"/&gt;  Their research on awe, which is a part of reverence, and how it is experienced through moral, spiritual, and aesthetic means, sheds light on the greater understanding of reverence.  Their study also consists of a comprehensive summary on what has been "Written about awe in religion, philosophy, sociology, and psychology" and their own addition of "Related states such as admiration, elevation, and the epiphanic experience".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"/&gt;

Haidt (2000) &lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2000). The positive emotion of elevation. Prevention and Treatment, 3 Article 3. p 287. Available online at: http://journals.apa.org/prevention/volume3/pre0030003c.html&lt;/ref&gt; notes that since Maslow (1964) &lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt; studied the changes that [[actualizing]] experiences can bring about in people's identities and in their [[moral]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] lives, little [[empirical research]] has been done to examine the peak experiences and moral transformations associated with positive moral emotions such as [[gratitude]], [[elevation]], [[awe]], admiration, and reverence.  Haidt’s own work in these areas suggests that potent feelings of reverence may be associated with the peak experiences accompanying moral transformations, where, "Powerful moments of elevation sometimes seem to push a mental ‘reset button,’ wiping out feelings of [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] and replacing them with feelings of [[hope]], [[love]], and [[optimism]], and a sense of moral inspiration." &lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2000), p 287&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art and Mortality ===
Great artists in the creation of their art sometimes give concrete form to the culturally derived [[beliefs]], [[values]], and group identities that provide meaning and purpose to [[existence]]. Moreover, reverence for artwork that instantiates these central aspects of [[culture]] can provide a means of buffering the [[existential]] [[anxiety]] that follows from reminders of the inevitability of human mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, M. J., Sullivan, D., &amp; Solomon, S. (2010) On graves and graven images: A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of art. European Review of Social psychology, 21, 114-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Across history, cultures have revered art as a "forum for representing in an enduring medium those individuals who are held up as embodiments of [[virtue]] and lasting significance." &lt;ref&gt;Landau et al. (2010), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transpersonal Reverence ===
Thomas and Schlutsmeyer in, "A Place for the Aesthetic in Experiential Personal Construct Psychology," look at reverence through the lens of experiential personal construct psychology (EPCP).   Leitner &amp; Pfenninger, in 1994, theorized this form of psychology in "Sociality and optimal functioning."  Under this umbrella of psychology, "Reverence felt in meaningful interpersonal connectedness is one starting point for the development of a larger sense of connection with the world and the many others (human and nonhuman) in it".&lt;ref name="TJC &amp; SMW"&gt;Thomas, J. C., &amp; Schlutsmeyer, M. W. (2004). A place for the aesthetic in experiential personal construct psychology. Journal of Constructivist Psychology, 17(4), 313-335. {{doi|10.1080/10720530490483239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is referred to as transpersonal reverence.
Thomas and Schlutsmeyer make the case for reverence in therapy: "In EPCP, reverence, as we stated earlier, is a goal of therapy, a sign of optimal functioning".&lt;ref name="TJC &amp; SMW"/&gt;  The therapist must revere the patient and the patient must learn to revere others and themselves in order for the therapy to be effective.

[[File:Plane Table surveying 2014-08-17 12-56.jpg|thumb|Students in survey camp doing "[[Plane table]] survey" during July 2014 in Haridwar, India]]
'''Survey Camp''' is an army tradition that was discontinued in the later part of twentieth century but was reinstated in 2002 across the universities of the world with a whole new structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://engineering.tamu.edu/civil/academics/survey-camp Survey camp] on the Texas A&amp;M University website&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[civil engineering]] training course for two weeks usually after completion  four semesters of [[bachelor of technology]]&lt;ref name='toro'&gt;[http://www.civil.engineering.utoronto.ca/programs/courses/cme358h1.htm Civil engineering department of University of Toronto]&lt;/ref&gt; that consists of 8 days working in the field and 6 days of map preparation in the [[computer lab]]. Experts say that survey camp provides necessary foundation for [[civil engineer]]s. Each day in the course there are at least 8 hours of working in the field. Students are divided into groups and they get out with practising [[surveying|surveyors]] and use their equipment out in the field. A camp incharge teacher appoints group leaders for each group; the leaders are responsible for all the works of his particular group and the equipment. In the computer lab, students learn [[Application software|applications]] such as [[AutoCAD]] and Carlson Survey. The students use these programs to take data collected from the field to develop [[topographic maps]] of the particular area. The basic aim of the survey camp is to know various works carried out in the industrial field by [[surveying]], which includes determining the [[topography]] of particular area with the help of survey work, map study and reconnaissance work. The methods used for surveying are [[traverse (surveying)|traversing]], [[levelling]] and [[contouring]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://knswmc.com Survey camp at Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary Park], Gurgaon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surveying, Volume 1 by C. L. Kochher&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
The instruments used include:
* Auto Level
* [[Total station]]
* [[Theodolite]] (transit)
* [[Compass]] (prismatic and surveyor)
* [[Ranging rod]]s
* [[Tape (surveying)|Measuring Tape]]
* Levelling Staff
* [[Plane table]] and all its accessories (in case drawing is prepared with hand)
* Tripod stand (for [[optical instruments]])&lt;ref name='pun'&gt;[http://www.civilsimplified.com Surveying] by B. C. Punmia and Ashok Kumar Jain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practicals==
The survey practicals generally performed in Survey camp are listed below:
#Simple levelling
#Fly levelling
#Trignometric levelling
#To determine and draw RL's of longitudinal and cross section of road.
#Measuring horizontal angles by Ordinary, [[Repetition method|Repetition]] and Reiteration methods
#Compass traversing
#Gale traverse
#Topographic map preparation

==Procedure==
The working rule used in survey camp is quite simple, all the groups of students are allotted different stations for survey work. For first couple of days, the students carry out traversing work to determine length of different sides of traverse and included angles between them. Coordinates of each side are also determined by formulas, '''Latitude= L×&lt;math&gt; \cos \theta\!&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''Departure= L×&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta\ &lt;/math&gt;''', where '''L''' is the length of the side and &lt;math&gt; \theta\ &lt;/math&gt; is the angle which the side makes with North or South directions (the instruments used in traversing include Total Station or Theodolite with stand, Compass with stand, ranging rods and measuring tape). Then in next step [[Reduced Level|RL]] (reduced level) of each station is determined with reference to permanent [[surveying|benchmark]] (the instruments used to determine reduced level include Auto Level with stand and Levelling Staff). Then RL of different points keeping specified spacing between them with reference to each station is determined. The points having same RL are joined to form [[contour lines]] and thus a topographic map of an area is prepared using AutoCAD or with the help of plane table survey.&lt;ref name='pun'/&gt;

==Results==
In Survey camp, students obtain extensive hands-on experience in the use of [[land surveying]] instruments and in the essentials of survey practice. Measurements of distances and angles, calculation and correction of errors are introduced. Concepts of higher order surveys and [[satellite navigation]] are reviewed and illustrated. Thus students learn surveying practically, this gives them confidence to work (with good precision and accuracy) in Industrial fields in the future.&lt;ref name="toro" /&gt;

'''Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop''' is a [[workshop]] for [[science fiction]] writers. Since its origin in 1985, it has been held in Raleigh, [[North Carolina]]; Bryn Mawr, [[Pennsylvania]]; and most recently in Little Switzerland, North Carolina.

Currently organized by Richard Butner, Sycamore Hill was started by [[John Kessel]] and [[Mark L. Van Name]]. It is an invitation-only workshop for established SF, fantasy, and slipstream writers. Attendees have included [[Kelly Link]], [[Carol Emshwiller]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Connie Willis]], [[Karen Joy Fowler]], [[Jonathan Lethem]], [[James Patrick Kelly]], [[Robert Frazier (writer)|Robert Frazier]], [[Ted Chiang]], [[Benjamin Rosenbaum]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/blog/archives/000278.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Don Webb (writer)|Don Webb]], among many others.

A collection of original stories from the 1994 workshop was published as the anthology ''Intersections: The Sycamore Hill Anthology'', edited by John Kessel, Mark L. Van Name and Richard Butner ([[Tor Books]], 1996). It includes works by Richard Butner, Carol Emshwiller, Karen Joy Fowler, Robert Frazier, Gregory Frost, Alexander Jablokov, James Patrick Kelly, John Kessel, Nancy Kress, Jonathan Lethem, Maureen F. McHugh, Michaela Roessner, Bruce Sterling, and Mark L. Van Name.

[[Orson Scott Card]] wrote about his experience at the Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop in the essay "On Sycamore Hill." Scholars such as Michael Collins identify Card's Sycamore Hill experience as marking a critical "turning point" in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toward Other Worlds: Perspectives on John Milton, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1963">A '''termbase''', or '''term base''' (a contraction of [[terminology]] and [[database]]), is a database consisting of concept-oriented terminological entries (or ‘concepts’) and related information, usually in multilingual format. Entries may include any of the following additional information:
* a definition; 
* source or context of the term; 
* subject area, domain, or industry; 
* grammatical information (verb, noun, etc.); 
* notes; 
* [[usage label]] (figurative, American English, formal, etc.); 
* author (‘created by’), 
* creation/modification date (‘created/modified at’);
* verification status (‘verified’ or ‘approved’ terms), and
* an ID. 

A termbase allows for the systematic management of approved or verified terms and is a powerful tool for promoting consistency in terminology.

Each book has a different protagonist, but is set in the same futuristic era.

==Plot overview==
===''The Giver''===
{{Main article|The Giver}}
''The Giver'' is a 1993 American children's novel (generally young adult or older) set in a society that is at first presented as a utopian society but gradually appears more and more dystopian. The novel follows a boy, Jonas, through the twelfth and thirteenth years of his life. The society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to "Sameness," a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of Receiver of Memory, the person who stores all the past memories of the time before Sameness in case the memories that others lack are ever needed to aid decisions. Jonas learns the truth about his Utopian society and struggles with its weight. The Community lacks any color, memory, climate, and terrain; that Sameness emphasizes the utopian qualities of the Community.

''The Giver'' won the 1994 Newbery Medal and has sold more than 10 million copies. In Australia, Canada, and the United States, it is a part of many middle school reading lists, but it is also on many challenging book lists and appeared on the [[American Library Association]]'s list of most challenged books of the 1990s.

The novel forms a loose quartet with three other books set in the same future era: ''Gathering Blue'' (2000), ''Messenger'' (2004), and ''Son'' (2012).

===''Gathering Blue''===
{{Main article|Gathering Blue}}
''Gathering Blue'' is a 2000 children's dystopian novella. It is set in the same future time period and treats some of the same themes.

The central character, Kira, who has a deformed leg, is orphaned and must learn to survive in a society that normally leaves the weak or disabled exposed to die in the fields. Kira's father was apparently mauled by the Beasts at the Field. Kira's mother had died recently from an illness.

Since she is an orphan, Kira needs a reason for the Council of Edifice to keep her in the village, rather than send her to the Field, which is certain death at the hands of The Beast. Kira's mother used to do embroidery for the Council and taught Kira some of her talents. Kira's gift for embroidery convinces the Council to keep her around to mend and update a beautiful robe, which shows the history of their society. In the course of the book, she begins to learn the art of dyeing thread different colors from except for blue, which nobody in her community knows how to make. But only Annabella knows, Kira's mentor. She also learns more about the truth of her village and the terrible secrets it holds. She then finds her father, who tells the truth of what happened to him and about the Village he now lives in.

===''Messenger''===
{{Main article|Messenger (novel)}}
''Messenger'' takes place about eight years after the events of ''The Giver'' and about six years after the events of ''Gathering Blue''. Set in an isolated community, known simply as Village, it focuses on a boy, Matty, who serves as message-bearer through the ominous and lethal Forest, which surrounds the community. This book also tells of the fate of Jonas and Gabe, from 'The Giver''.

===''Son''===
{{Main article|Son (novel)}}
''Son'' follows Claire, the birth mother of Gabriel from ''The Giver'' and her journey to locate her son. Then she finds him.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main article|The Giver (film)}}
A film adaptation of the first book was produced by [[The Weinstein Company]] and [[Walden Media]]. It was released on August 15, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title='The Giver' Film Adaptation to Hit Theaters August 2014|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/giver-film-adaptation-hit-theaters-634759|accessdate=July 10, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starred [[Jeff Bridges]] as The Giver, [[Brenton Thwaites]] as Jonas and [[Meryl Streep]] as the Chief Elder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bahr|first=Lindsey|title='The Giver': First Look at Jeff Bridges and Brenton Thwaites in Lois Lowry's classic|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/01/23/the-giver-first-look/|accessdate=July 10, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Procuress''''' is the name given to a number of similar paintings by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] painter [[Dirck van Baburen]]. The painting is in the [[Caravaggio|Caravaggiesque]] style of the [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Utrecht school]].

==The painting==
The painting shows three figures, a prostitute on the left, the client in the middle and the procuress on the right pointing to her palm to indicate that she is expecting payment. The client is holding a coin between his fingers as he puts his arm around the prostitute, who is playing a [[lute]]. The painting is an example of the popular genre known as ''Bordeeltjes'', or brothel scenes (see also the overlapping genre of [[Merry company]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Schneider, ''Vermeer, 1632–1675: veiled emotions'', Taschen, 2000, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cropped, close-up figures close to the [[picture plane]] against a flat blank background are typical of [[Utrecht Caravaggism]].&lt;ref name = "jmm"/&gt;

There are at least three versions of the painting. The versions in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121011141312/http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/collectie/zoeken/asset.jsp?id=SK-C-612&amp;lang=en Rijksmuseum catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-procuress-33414 |title=MFA catalogue |publisher=Mfa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; are attributed to [[Dirck van Baburen]] or his studio. One copy of the painting was owned by [[Maria Thins]], mother-in-law of [[Johannes Vermeer]], who reproduced it in the background of two of his own paintings.  A copy owned by the [[Courtauld Institute]] in London has been identified as the work of the forger [[Han van Meegeren]]. This was featured in the third episode of the BBC TV series, ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''.&lt;ref name="FoF3"&gt;{{Cite episode

==Vermeer==

[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Zittende Klavecimbelspeelster (1673-1675).jpg|thumb|Vermeer's ''[[Lady Seated at a Virginal]]'', in which ''The Procuress'' hangs on the wall behind the figure]]

One of these paintings was owned by [[Vermeer]]'s mother-in-law, and it may have been an influence on one of his own early paintings on a similar subject, also known as ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656).&lt;ref name = "jmm"&gt;John Michael Montias, ''Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History'', Princeton University Press, 1991, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in the background of two of Vermeer's later paintings, ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' (c.1664) and ''[[Lady Seated at a Virginal]]'' (c.1670). In both of these later paintings the blatant lust depicted by Baburen is contrasted with the genteel, but erotically charged, middle-class world occupied by Vermeer's women. The contrast between the images may also imply "a more general association between music and love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/johannes-vermeer-a-young-woman-seated-at-a-virginal |title=National Gallery |publisher=National Gallery |date=2013-09-08 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermeer sets up a series of contrasts between his own delicate, restrained style and Baburen's vulgar realism. According to Michael Wayne Cole and Mary Pardo this represents Vermeer's own move away from such low-life subjects. The older, cruder style of Baburen is relegated to the background, "eclipsing it with the more modern kind of genteel subject that Vermeer would soon paint exclusively".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wayne Cole, Mary Pardo, ''Inventions of the studio, Renaissance to Romanticism'', UNC Press Books, 2005, p.206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Courtauld Institute version==
[[File:The_Procuress_forgery_by_Han_van_Meegeren_from_the_Courtauld_Gallery.jpg|left|thumb|The Courtauld Institute copy, believed to be a van Meegeren forgery]]
In 1960, [[Geoffrey Webb]] presented a version of the painting to the Courtauld Institute. At the end of the [[Second World War]], he had been an allied officer in Europe investigating art works looted by the Nazis. He believed it was a fake painted by [[Han van Meegeren]], and he presented it to the Courtauld as such. In his own defense, van Meegeren claimed that the painting had been bought in an antique shop by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8612890/Master-forgery-17th-century-work-exposed-as-a-fake.html |title=report in the Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2011-07-02 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the painting was initially believed to be a fake, its authenticity remained controversial, and in 2009 a scientific study indicated that the painting was likely to be genuine, as no modern pigments were found. A spokesperson for the gallery stated that they were "surprised" by the results, but that the evidence indicated that it was "likely to be a 17th-century painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Akbar |first=Arifa |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/fake-painting-revealed-as-dutch-masterpiece-1794254.html |title=Independent article |publisher=Independent article |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following this, the BBC TV programme ''Fake or Fortune?'' conducted a further investigation.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; The resulting film was first shown July 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; [[Philip Mould]] and [[Fiona Bruce]] traveled to Amsterdam where they obtained samples of the paints used by van Meegeren.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; These included an artificial resin which turned out to be [[Bakelite]].&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; The use of Bakelite had the effect of hardening the paint and thus making it difficult to detect that it was new.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; Chemical analysis showed Bakelite in the Courtauld painting, thus confirming that it was a modern forgery.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; Van Meegeren is the only forger known to have used this technique, so the painting was attributed to him.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; It was probably intended to be used as a prop in Vermeer forgeries.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; It is more valuable as a van Meegeren forgery than as a 17th-century studio copy.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt;

"'''The Birds and the Bees'''" is an [[English language|English-language]] [[idiom|idiomatic expression]] and [[euphemism]] that refers to [[courtship]] and [[sexual intercourse]]. The "Birds and the Bees talk" (sometimes known simply as "The Talk"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boynton|first1=Petra|title=How to talk about the 'birds and bees' with your child in the 21st century|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10291383/Sex-education-How-to-talk-about-the-birds-and-bees-with-your-child-in-the-21st-century.html|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Susan|title=Birds and Bees: Tips for Having ‘The Talk’ With Kids|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2011/09/22/birds-and-bees-tips-for-having-the-talk-with-kids-2/|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=[[ABC News]]|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is generally the event in most children's lives in which the parents explain what sexual relationships are.

According to tradition, the birds and the bees is a metaphorical story sometimes told to children in an attempt to explain the mechanics and good consequences of sexual intercourse through reference to easily observed natural events. For instance, bees carry and deposit pollen into flowers, a visible and easy-to-explain parallel to male [[fertilisation]]. Another example, birds lay eggs, a similarly visible and easy-to-explain parallel to female [[ovulation]].

The bees are stirring—birds are on the wing ... and I the while, the sole unbusy thing, not honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Samuel Taylor |last= Coleridge |date= February 21, 1825 |url= http://poetry.eserver.org/work.html |title= Work without Hope |work= EServer |publisher= Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even earlier instances of this idiomatic expression appear in the [[Cavalier poet]], [[Thomas Carew]]'s work, "The Spring" (c.1640), in which Carew uses earth and its change of seasons as a metaphorical depiction of women and their sensuality (The Norton Anthology of English Literature 1696).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Norton Anthology of English Literature |edition= 6th |volume= vol. 1 |location= New York |publisher= W.W. Norton &amp; Company |date= 1993 |page= 1696}}&lt;/ref&gt; To abet his ends, Carew alludes to the "birds and the bees" in lines 7-8 with the use of "swallow", "cuckoo", and "humble-bee" as seen here (lines included are 5-8): "But the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth/And makes it tender; gives a sacred birth/To the dead ''swallow''; wakes in hollow tree/The drowsy ''cuckoo'' and the ''humble-bee''/Now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring" (emphasis added; lines 5-9 from "The Spring").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Vincent |editor-first= Arthur |title= The Poems of Thomas Carew |location= London |publisher= George Routledge &amp; Sons |date= n.d. |page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Emma Frances Angell Drake (b. 1849) wrote a section of a publication called ''The Story of Life'' which was published in 1909. This piece was later picked up and included in Safe Counsel, a product of the [[Eugenics]] movement in the late 19th and early 20th century. The author tells her daughters "when you discovered the tiny blue eggs in the robin's nest and I told you that wrapped in each shell was a baby robin that was growing there, kept warm by the mamma bird..." the narrative continues on in vague terms without actually describing sexual intercourse. Later she describes the father's role in reproduction like this; "Sometimes it is the wind which blows the pollen dust from one plant to the other, and sometimes it is the bees gathering honey from the flowers. As they suck the honey from the blossoms some of the plant dust sticks to their legs and bodies, and as they go to another plant in search of sweets this is rubbed off and so the parts of the father and mother plant get together and the seed is made fertile." Safe counsel was reprinted at least 40 times from 1893 through 1930 and may have been widely enough repeated to have contributed to the euphemism, "the birds and the bees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= The Story of Life |first1= Ozora S. |last1= Davis |first2= Emma F.A. |last2=Drake |title= Safe Counsel or Practical Eugenics |editor1-last= Jeffries |editor1-first= B.G. |editor2-last= Nichols |editor2-first= J.L. |editor3-first= Emma F.A. |editor3-last= Drake |editor4-first= Ozora Stearns |editor4-last= Davis |last-author-amp=yes |edition= 40th |year= 1930 |location= Naperville, IL |publisher= J.L.

Several sources give credit to [[Cole Porter]] for coining the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ask.yahoo.com/20060329.html |title=Where did the phrase 'the birds and the bees' come from? |work=Yahoo!

In Porter's publication from 1928, the opening line for the chorus carried derogatory racial references like "[[Chink]]s" and "[[Jap]]s", later changed following [[CBS]] recommendation and [[NBC]] adaptation:&lt;ref name="Inc.1954"&gt;{{cite news |first= June |last= Bundy |title= Mr. J.Q.

:''See also [[Titulus (Roman Catholic)]] for Roman churches called tituli, or [[titulus (disambiguation)]] for more meanings.''

'''''Titulus''''' (Latin "inscription" or "label", the plural ''tituli'' is also used in English) is a term used for the labels or captions naming figures or subjects in art, which were commonly added in classical and [[medieval art]], and remain conventional in [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s.  In particular the term describes the conventional inscriptions on stone that listed the honours of an individual&lt;ref&gt;[[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith, William]] (1875). [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Nobiles.html "Nobiles"]. ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''. London. Reprinted by [[The University of Chicago]].&lt;/ref&gt; or that identified boundaries in the [[Roman Empire]].  A [[Titulus pictus]] is a [[merchant's mark]] or other commercial inscription.

The sense of "title", as in "book title", in modern English derives from this artistic sense, just as the [[Title (property)|legal sense]] derives from plainer inscriptions of record.&lt;ref&gt;"Title", ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous titulus was "IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM" inscribed on the placard hanging above [[Jesus]]' head on the [[Cross]]. 

==Use in Western art==
The increasing reluctance of the art of the West to use ''tituli'' was perhaps because so few people could read them in the [[Early Medieval]] period, and later because they reduced the illusionism of the image. Instead a system of [[Emblem|attributes]], objects identifying popular saints, was developed, but many such figures in Western art are now unidentifiable.  This reluctance affected the choice of scenes shown in art; only those [[miracles of Jesus]] that were easily identifiable visually tended to be shown in cycles of the ''[[Life of Christ]]''.  Thus the ''[[Raising of Lazarus]]'' and ''[[Wedding at Cana]]'' are by far the most commonly shown miracles, and the healing miracles, visually easy to confuse, are neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, 152–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mâle, 177&lt;/ref&gt;  The problems can clearly be seen in the small scenes of the [[Saint Augustine Gospels]] (late 6th century), where about 200 years after the manuscript was written ''tituli'' were added, which according to some art historians misidentify some scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Lewine, Carol F.; [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3049296 JSTOR] ''Vulpes Fossa Habent or the Miracle of the Bent Woman in the Gospels of St. Augustine'', Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Banderole (speech scroll)|Banderole]]s were a solution that became popular in the later [[Middle Ages]], and in Northern Europe in the 15th century were sometimes used very extensively for speech, rather as in modern comics, as well as ''tituli''.  These were abandoned as old-fashioned in the [[Renaissance]], but increased respect for classical traditions led to continued use of Ancient Roman-style ''tituli'' where they were considered necessary, including on portraits.

==Examples of tituli==
*In the context of the [[Crucifixion]], the ''titulus'' "{{sc2|IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM}}" (and its translations) is believed to have been affixed to Jesus' cross. ''INRI'' is the abbreviation for the above-mentioned Latin translation.  See [[INRI]] and [[Titulus Crucis]].
*At the recovery of the coffin of [[King Arthur]] at [[Glastonbury Abbey]], at an opportune moment after a devastating fire in the 12th century, a lead cross of Arthur was alleged to have borne the explicit ''titulus'' "{{sc2|HIC JACET SEPULTUS INCLITUS REX ARTHURUS IN INSULA AVALONIA}}". The well-publicized discovery described by [[Giraldus Cambrensis]], redoubled the pilgrimages to the Abbey.

'''Turbidity''' is the cloudiness or [[haze|haziness]] of a [[fluid]] caused by large numbers of individual [[Particle (ecology)|particles]] that are generally invisible to the [[naked eye]], similar to [[smoke]] in [[air]]. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of [[water quality]].

[[Fluids]] can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the [[Settling|settable solids]]), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are [[colloid]]al. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.

'''Turbidity''' (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic. In plastic production, haze is defined as the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5° from the incoming light direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermallaminatingfilms.com/haze.php Haze technical definition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822002852/http://www.thermallaminatingfilms.com/haze.php |date=August 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Turbidity in open water may be caused by growth of [[phytoplankton]]. Human activities that disturb land, such as [[construction]], [[mining]] and [[agriculture]], can lead to high [[sediment]] levels entering water bodies during rain storms due to [[storm water]] [[surface runoff|runoff]]. Areas prone to high bank erosion rates as well as [[urbanized]] areas also contribute large amounts of turbidity to nearby waters, through stormwater [[water pollution|pollution]] from [[Pavement (material)|paved]] surfaces such as roads, bridges and parking lots.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/urbanmm/index.html "National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Urban Areas."] Chapters 7 and 8. Document No. EPA 841-B-05-004. November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some industries such as [[quarry]]ing, [[coal mine|mining]] and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from colloidal rock particles.

In drinking water, the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that people may develop [[gastrointestinal diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Mann, C.C. Tam, C.D. Higgins, &amp; L.C. Lodrigues. (2007). The association between drinking water turbidity and gastrointestinal illness: a systematic review. ''BMC Public Health''. 7(256): 1 - 7&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially problematic for immunocompromised people, because contaminants like [[virus]]es or [[bacteria]] can become attached to the suspended solids. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with [[chlorine]] because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly, suspended solids can protect bacteria from [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|ultraviolet (UV) sterilization]] of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civilengineerbuddy.com/turbidity-water-its-measurment-environmental-engineering/|title=Turbidity of water and its measurment &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; – disinfection not possible without removing suspended particles|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In water bodies such as [[lake]]s, rivers and [[reservoirs]], high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged [[aquatic plants]] and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as [[fish]] and [[shellfish]]. High turbidity levels can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. This phenomenon has been regularly observed throughout the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Annapolis, MD. [http://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/savpage.htm "Decline of Submerged Plants in Chesapeake Bay."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Chesapeake Bay Program. Annapolis, MD. [http://www.chesapeakebay.net/sediments.aspx "Sediments."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073649/http://www.chesapeakebay.net/sediments.aspx |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many [[mangrove]] areas, high turbidity is needed in order to support certain species, such as to protect juvenile fish from predators. For most mangroves along the eastern coast of [[Australia]], in particular [[Moreton Bay]], turbidity levels as high as 600 [[Nephelometer|Nephelometric]] Turbidity Units (NTU) are needed for proper [[ecosystem]] health.

==Measurement==
[[Image:Runoff torbidity.jpg|thumb|right|Turbid creek water caused by heavy rains.]]

The most widely used measurement unit for turbidity is the [[Formazine|Formazin]] Turbidity Unit (FTU). [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] refers to its units as FNU (Formazin Nephelometric Units). [[ISO 7027]] provides the method in water quality for the determination of turbidity. It is used to determine the [[concentration]] of suspended particles in a sample of water by measuring the incident light scattered at right angles from the sample. The scattered light is captured by a [[photodiode]], which produces an electronic signal that is converted to a turbidity. [[Open source hardware]] has been developed following the ISO 7027 method to measure turbidity reliably using an [[Arduino]] microcontroller and inexpensive [[LED]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bas Wijnen, G. C. Anzalone and Joshua M. Pearce, Open-source mobile water quality testing platform. Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, 4(3) pp. 532–537 (2014). doi:10.2166/washdev.2014.137 [https://www.academia.edu/8319858/Open-source_mobile_water_quality_testing_platform open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several practical ways of checking water quality, the most direct being some measure of [[attenuation]] (that is, reduction in strength) of light as it passes through a sample column of water. The alternatively used Jackson Candle method (units: Jackson Turbidity Unit or '''JTU''') is essentially the inverse measure of the length of a column of water needed to completely obscure a candle flame viewed through it. The more water needed (the longer the water column), the clearer the water. Of course water alone produces some attenuation, and any substances dissolved in the water that produce color can attenuate some wavelengths. Modern instruments do not use candles, but this approach of attenuation of a light beam through a column of water should be calibrated and reported in JTUs.

The propensity of particles to scatter a light beam focused on them is now considered a more meaningful measure of turbidity in water. Turbidity measured this way uses an instrument called a [[nephelometer]] with the detector set up to the side of the light beam. More light reaches the detector if there are lots of small particles scattering the source beam than if there are few. The units of turbidity from a calibrated nephelometer are called Nephelometric Turbidity Units ('''NTU'''). To some extent, how much light reflects for a given amount of particulates is dependent upon properties of the particles like their shape, color, and reflectivity. For this reason (and the reason that heavier particles settle quickly and do not contribute to a turbidity reading), a correlation between turbidity and [[total suspended solids]] (TSS) is somewhat unusual for each location or situation.

Turbidity in lakes, reservoirs, channels, and the ocean can be measured using a [[Secchi disk]]. This black and white disk is lowered into the water until it can no longer be seen; the depth (Secchi depth) is then recorded as a measure of the transparency of the water (inversely related to turbidity). The Secchi disk has the advantages of integrating turbidity over depth (where variable turbidity layers are present), being quick and easy to use, and inexpensive. It can provide a rough indication of the depth of the [[euphotic zone]] with a 3-fold division of the ''Secchi depth'', however this cannot be used in shallow waters where the disk can still be seen on the bottom.

An additional device, which may help measuring turbidity in shallow waters is the turbidity tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2013}}Waterwatch Australia, Module 4 - physical and chemical parameters [https://web.archive.org/web/20060513024523/http://www.waterwatch.org.au/publications/module4/turbidity.html "Methods Turbidity"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myre, E, Shaw, R.

[http://watsanmissionassistant.wikispaces.com/file/view/Turbidity-Myre_Shaw.pdf/360203097/Turbidity-Myre_Shaw.pdf "The Turbidity Tube"]&lt;/ref&gt; The turbidity tube condenses water in a graded tube which allows determination of turbidity based on a contrast disk in its bottom, being analogous to the Secchi disk.

Turbidity in air, which causes solar attenuation, is used as a measure of pollution. To model the attenuation of beam irradiance, several turbidity parameters have been introduced, including the Linke turbidity factor (T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;HelioClim (Center for Energy and Processes).

==Standards and test methods==
[[File:Turbidimeters.JPG|thumb|[[Turbidimeter]]s used at a water purification plant to measure turbidity (in NTU) of raw water and clear water after filtration.]]

===Drinking water standards===
Governments have set standards on the allowable turbidity in drinking water. In the United States, systems that use conventional or direct filtration methods turbidity cannot be higher than 1.0 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) at the plant outlet and all samples for turbidity must be less than or equal to 0.3 NTU for at least 95 percent of the samples in any month. Systems that use filtration other than the conventional or direct filtration must follow state limits, which must include turbidity at no time exceeding 5 NTU. Many drinking water utilities strive to achieve levels as low as 0.1 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/safewater/contaminants/index.html#3 "Drinking Water Contaminants."] 2009-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The European standards for turbidity state that it must be no more than 4 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/advice-leaflets/standards.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]], establishes that the turbidity of drinking water should not be more than 5 NTU, and should ideally be below 1 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenntech.com/turbidity.htm#ixzz3R3yPreK7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambient water standards===
The U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has published water quality criteria for turbidity.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/criteria/goldbook.pdf "Quality Criteria for Water."] (Commonly known as the "Gold Book.") 1986. Document No. EPA-440/5-86-001.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are scientific assessments of the effects of turbidity, which are used by states to develop [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|water quality standards]] for water bodies. (States may also publish their own criteria.) Some states have [[Promulgation|promulgated]] water quality standards for turbidity, including:
* [[Louisiana]]. 25, 50 or 150 NTU, or background plus 10 percent, depending on the water body.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. Baton Rouge, LA.[http://epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/la/la_6_wqs.pdf "Surface Water Quality Standards."] ''Louisiana Administrative Code (LAC).'' Title 33, Part IX, Chapter 11. August 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Vermont]]. 10 NTU or 25 NTU, depending on water body classification.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Water Resources Board. Montpelier, VT. [http://www.nrb.state.vt.us/wrp/publications/wqs.pdf "Vermont Water Quality Standards."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231093748/http://www.nrb.state.vt.us/wrp/publications/wqs.pdf |date=2013-12-31 }} January 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. 5 NTU over background (when background is 50 NTU or less), or 10 percent increase when background is over 50 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Department of Ecology. Olympia, WA.[http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/wa/wa_10_chapter173-201a.pdf "Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of the State of Washington."] ''Washington Administrative Code (WAC).'' Chapter 173-201A. November 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also available on CD-ROM and [http://www.standardmethods.org/ online] by subscription.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
'''Turbidity''' is commonly treated using either a settling or filtration process. Depending on the application, chemical reagents will be dosed into the wastewater stream to increase the effectiveness of the settling or filtration process. [[Potable water]] treatment and municipal wastewater plants often remove turbidity with a combination of sand filtration, settling tanks, and clarifiers.

[[In-situ water treatment]] or direct dosing for the treatment of turbidity is common when the affected water bodies are dispersed (i.e. there are numerous water bodies spread out over a geographical area, such as small drinking water reservoirs), when the problem is not consistent (i.e. when there is turbidity in a water body only during and after the wet season) or when a low cost solution is required. In-situ treatment of turbidity involves the addition of a reagent, generally a [[flocculant]], evenly dispensed over the surface of the body of water. The flocs then settle at the bottom of the water body where they remain or are removed when the water body is drained. This method is commonly used at [[coal mine]]s and coal loading facilities where stormwater collection ponds have seasonal issues with turbidity. A number of companies offer portable treatment systems for in-situ water treatment or direct dosing of reagents.

===Reagents===
There are a number of [[chemical reagent]]s that are available for treating turbidity. Reagents available for treating turbidity include [[aluminium sulfate]] or [[alum]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[ferric chloride]] (FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[gypsum]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), poly-[[aluminium chloride]], long chain [[acrylamide]]-based [[polymer]]s and numerous proprietary reagents.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Systems, Clear Solutions newsletter - Focus on Turbidity [http://www.earthsystems.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ClearSolutions_No1_2003.pdf] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The water chemistry must be carefully considered when chemical dosing as some reagents, such as alum, will alter the [[pH]] of the water.

The dosing process must also be considered when using reagents as the [[Flocculation|flocs]] may be broken apart by excessive mixing.

'''''The Venice Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites''''' is a set of guidelines, drawn up in 1964 by a group of conservation professionals in Venice, that provides an international framework for the [[conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] and [[Building restoration|restoration]] of historic buildings.&lt;ref name="Erder" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/erder.pdf |title=Erdem, C. The Venice Charter under Review. (1977). Ankara. |format=PDF |date= March 1977 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the document is now seen as outdated, representing Modernist views opposed to reconstruction. Reconstruction is now cautiously accepted by UNESCO in exceptional circumstances if it seeks to reflect a pattern of use or cultural practice that sustains cultural value, and is based on complete documentation without reliance on conjecture. The change in attitude can be marked by the reconstruction in 2015 of the Sufi mausoleums at the Timbuktu World Heritage Site in Mali after their destruction in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Christina''Reconstruction: changing attitudes'', UNESCO[https://en.unesco.org/courier/july-september-2017/reconstruction-changing-attitudes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic background==

===Athens Charter===
The development of new conservation and restoration techniques have threatened the historic buildings in a general sense.&lt;ref name="hx" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/history.pdf |title=ICOMOS. (2004). The History of the Venice Charter. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the International Museum Office organized a meeting of specialists about the conservation of historic buildings. The conference resulted with the [[Athens Charter (Preservation)|Athens Charter]] for the Restoration of Historic Monuments. This consisted of a manifesto of seven points:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icomos.org/index.php/en/charters-and-texts?id=167:the-athens-charter-for-the-restoration-of-historic-monuments&amp;catid=179:charters-and-standards |title=The Athens Charter for the Restoration of Historic Monuments.

* to establish organizations for restoration advice
* to ensure projects are reviewed with knowledgeable criticism
* to establish national legislation to preserve historic sites
* to rebury excavations which were not to be restored.
* to allow the use of modern techniques and materials in restoration work.
* to place historical sites under custodial protection.
* to protect the area surrounding historic sites.

The Athens Charter proposed the idea of a common world heritage, the importance of the setting of monuments, and the principle of the integration of new materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/research_resources/charters/charter02.html|title= The GETTY Conservation Institute. Cultural Heritage Policy Documents: General Conclusions of the Athens Conference 1931 |format=Web page |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter had very progressive suggestions for its period, influencing the creation of conservation institutions, as well as the eventual Venice Charter.

===First International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings===
With the concern that listing and safeguarding historic buildings was not enough, in 1957 architectural specialists arranged a congress in Paris called The First International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings. At its conclusion, the congress published seven recommendations:&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;
# the countries which still lack a central organization for the protection of historic buildings provide for the establishment of such an authority,
# the creation of an international assembly of architects and specialists of historic buildings should be considered,
# a specialized professional training of all categories of personnel should be promoted so as to secure highly qualified workmanship and that remuneration should be commensurate with such qualifications,
# the hygrometric problems relating to historic buildings should be discussed in a symposium,
# contemporary artists should be requested to contribute to the decoration of monuments,
# close cooperation should be established among architects and archeologists,
# architects and town-planners cooperate so as to secure integration of historic buildings into town planning.

The Congress agreed to have its second meeting in Venice and Piero Gazzola, who was to serve as the chairman of the Venice Charter, was invited to hold the Venice Congress.&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;

===Second International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings===
In 1964, at the Second International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings, 13 resolutions were adopted of which the first was the Venice Charter and the second was creation of [[ICOMOS|ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites)]].&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;

The Venice Charter consisted of seven main titles and sixteen articles. The concept of historic monuments and sites was interpreted as the common heritage, therefore safeguarding them for the future generations with authenticity was defined as the common responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/publications/hommedecin.pdf|title= IInd International Congress of Architects and Technicians of Historic Monuments Committee. (1964). Decisions and Resolutions. Venice. |format=PDF |date= 1964-03-31|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following text is the original 1964 text agreed on by the representatives of the participating [[nation]]s mentioned at the end of the [[Charter]].

==Venice Charter Text==

===Definitions===
'''Article 1.''' The concept of a historic monument embraces not only the single architectural work but also the urban or rural setting in which is found the evidence of a particular civilization, a significant development or a historic event. This applies not only to great works of art but also to more modest works of the past which have acquired cultural significance with the passing of time.

'''Article 2.''' The conservation and restoration of monuments must have recourse to all the sciences and techniques which can contribute to the study and safeguarding of the architectural heritage.

===Aim===
'''Article 3.''' The intention in conserving and restoring monuments is to safeguard them no less as works of art than as historical evidence.

===Conservation===
'''Article 4.''' It is essential to the conservation of monuments that they be maintained on a permanent basis.

'''Article 5.''' The conservation of monuments is always facilitated by making use of them for some socially useful purpose. Such use is therefore desirable but it must not change the lay-out or decoration of the building. It is within these limits only that modifications demanded by a change of function should be envisaged and may be permitted.

'''Article 6.''' The conservation of a monument implies preserving a setting which is not out of scale. Wherever the traditional setting exists, it must be kept. No new construction, demolition or modification which would alter the relations of mass and color must be allowed.

'''Article 7.''' A monument is inseparable from the history to which it bears witness and from the setting in which it occurs. The moving of all or part of a monument cannot be allowed except where the safeguarding of that monument demands it or where it is justified by national or international interest of paramount importance.

'''Article 8.''' Items of sculpture, painting or decoration which form an integral part of a monument may only be removed from it if this is the sole means of ensuring their preservation.

===Restoration===
'''Article 9.''' The process of restoration is a highly specialized operation. Its aim is to preserve and reveal the aesthetic and historic value of the monument and is based on respect for original material and authentic documents. It must stop at the point where conjecture begins, and in this case moreover any extra work which is indispensable must be distinct from the architectural composition and must bear a contemporary stamp. The restoration in any case must be preceded and followed by an archaeological and historical study of the monument.

'''Article 10.''' Where traditional techniques prove inadequate, the consolidation of a monument can be achieved by the use of any modern technique for conservation and construction, the efficacy of which has been shown by scientific data and proved by experience.

'''Article 11.''' The valid contributions of all periods to the building of a monument must be respected, since unity of style is not the aim of a restoration. When a building includes the superimposed work of different periods, the revealing of the underlying state can only be justified in exceptional circumstances and when what is removed is of little interest and the material which is brought to light is of great historical, archaeological or aesthetic value, and its state of preservation good enough to justify the action. Evaluation of the importance of the elements involved and the decision as to what may be destroyed cannot rest solely on the individual in charge of the work.

'''Article 12.''' Replacements of missing parts must integrate harmoniously with the whole, but at the same time must be distinguishable from the original so that restoration does not falsify the artistic or historic evidence.

'''Article 13.''' Additions cannot be allowed except in so far as they do not detract from the interesting parts of the building, its traditional setting, the balance of its composition and its relation with its surroundings.

===Historic Sites===
'''Article 14.''' The sites of monuments must be the object of special care in order to safeguard their integrity and ensure that they are cleared and presented in a seemly manner. The work of conservation and restoration carried out in such places should be inspired by the principles set forth in the foregoing articles.

===Excavations===
'''Article 15.''' Excavations should be carried out in accordance with scientific standards and the recommendation defining international principles to be applied in the case of archaeological excavation adopted by UNESCO in 1956.
Ruins must be maintained and measures necessary for the permanent conservation and protection of architectural features and of objects discovered must be taken. Furthermore, every means must be taken to facilitate the understanding of the monument and to reveal it without ever distorting its meaning.

All reconstruction work should however be ruled out "a priori." Only anastylosis, that is to say, the reassembling of existing but dismembered parts can be permitted. The material used for integration should always be recognizable and its use should be the least that will ensure the conservation of a monument and the reinstatement of its form.

===Publication===
'''Article 16.''' In all works of preservation, restoration or excavation, there should always be precise documentation in the form of analytical and critical reports, illustrated with drawings and photographs. Every stage of the work of clearing, consolidation, rearrangement and integration, as well as technical and formal features identified during the course of the work, should be included.

== Outcome ==
The Venice Charter is the most influential document on conservation since 1964. However the following aspects are not covered in the Venice Charter:&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;
* The concept of site which also applies to historic landscapes and gardens
* The concept of reversibility in restoration
* The social and financial issues

In the years after the publishing, the purpose of the charter a number of symposiums took place in order to improve common understandings and awareness of it by those involved in the conservation and restoration works of the historic buildings. How it was applied in different countries varied according to their social, economic and cultural conditions, as well as the technical qualifications of those applying it.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt; Translation mistakes and misunderstandings of the Charter also led to differences in its application.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The Venice Charter and its subsequent interpretations have attracted criticism, especially by those who perceive it was built upon the Modernist biases of its creators. Professor of architecture Samir Younés has written: "The Charter’s abhorrence of restoration and reconstruction – with its implicit fear of "false history" – reflects the Modernist theory of [[historical determinism]], rather than the idea of a living architectural tradition. Major advances over the last 40 years in traditional design fluency and building crafts skills have undercut and outmoded many of the assumptions implicit in the Venice Charter. As a result, many now believe that visual harmony, aesthetic balance and the essential character of a place are of greater importance than abstract Modernist theories."&lt;ref name="Revisit"&gt;Hardy, Matthew (Ed.) ''The Venice Charter Revisited: Modernism, Conservation and Tradition in the 21st Century'', foreword by HRH The Prince of Wales, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK; 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue is taken particularly with the words in Article 9: "Any extra work which is indispensable must be distinct from the architectural composition and ''must bear a contemporary stamp."''  This declaration has had a major impact on the management of historic buildings globally. In the U.S., for example, it shaped the Secretary of the Interior’s Standard #9 so it stated "...new work shall be differentiated from the old". It has been commonly interpreted to mean that interventions and additions have to be in Modernist styles, rather than being discreetly indicated by such devices as dated cornerstones and descriptive plaques. Many popular reconstructions now considered intrinsic to their locations, such as the 1912 rebuilding of the [[St Mark's Campanile|Campanile di San Marco]] in Venice, would violate the Venice Charter’s dictum: “All reconstruction work should however be ruled out "a priori".&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

Because of concern over the damage being to historic settings by the Venice Charter's misapplication, in 2006 another conference was held in Venice under the auspices of INTBAU (the [[International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture &amp; Urbanism]]). Its principal objective was to provide a theoretical framework that would enable new buildings and additions to be in greater harmony with their historic surroundings.&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

Critics of the Venice Charter point to the 2005 Charleston Charter as providing preferred guidelines for dealing with historic areas. It states: “New construction in historic settings, including alterations and additions to existing buildings, should not arbitrarily impose contrasting materials, scales, or design vocabularies, but clarify and extend the character of the place, seeking always continuity and wholeness in the built environment.”&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

==Revisions==

Beginning with the [[World Heritage Convention]] (1972), some of the limited explanations in the Venice Charter were revised. The understanding of cultural heritage, which was expressed as historic monuments, was categorized as monuments, groups of buildings and sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/|title=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. (1972).

In the Naples ICOMOS meeting on 7 November 1995; the question  [http://www.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/lemaire2.pdf ‘Should there be a review of the Venice Charter?’] was discussed with participation of Raymound Lemaire, the reporter of the Venice Charter in 1964. Thirty years after the Venice Charter, Lemaire declared that: "Charters are fashionable. They are considered to contribute to directing action. However they never contain more than the minimum on which the majority has agreed. Only exceptionally do they cover the whole of the issue which concerns them. This is the case with the Venice Charter."&lt;ref name="Lemaire"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/lemaire2.pdf|title= ICOMOS Scientific Journal: Raymond Lemaire: ICOMOS - un regard en arrière, un coup d'oeil en avant. (1995). Paris. |format=PDF |date=1995-11-07|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated his opinions about the present understanding of monuments and their restoration. He pointed out the necessity of a new document, or an effective adaptation, with consideration of the need "to be addressed with caution and wisdom, with respect for all cultures and above all with ethical and intellectual discipline."&lt;ref name="Lemaire" /&gt;

The Venice Charter has itself become an historic document. While some of its guidelines are considered to have proven their worth by both its supporters and critics, there are now plans for it to be rewritten.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt;

'''Washback effect''' refers to the impact of testing on curriculum design, teaching practices, and learning behaviors.&lt;ref name="McKinley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinley &amp; Thompson|title=Washback Effect in Teaching English as an International Language|journal=TESOL Encyclopedia of English Language Teaching|date=Feb 2018|volume=1|url=http://www.englishappliedlinguistics.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419477/washback_effect_in_teaching_english_as_an_international_language_author_version.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influences of testing can be found in the choices of learners and teachers: teachers may teach directly for specific test preparation, or learners might focus on specific aspects of language learning found in assessments. Washback effect in testing is typically seen as either negative, or positive (sometimes referred to as ''washforward'').&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt; Washback may be considered harmful to more fluid approaches in [[language education]] where definitions of language ability may be limited; however, it may be considered beneficial when good teaching practices result. Washback can also be positive or negative in that it either maintains or hinders the accomplishment of educational goals. In positive washback, teaching the curriculum becomes the same as teaching to a specific test. Negative washback occurs in situations where there may be a mismatch between the stated goals of instruction and the focus of assessment; it may lead to the abandonment of instructional goals in favor of test preparation.&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt;

The effect of a test on learning and teaching is a concept discussed as early as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt; Research into washback can be traced back to the early 1980s, when the influence of tests on teaching and learning was first seen as a potential source of [[bias]] due to the accountability of test [[feedback loop|feedback loops]]. As the results of tests became more important to students ([[gatekeeper|gatekeepers]] to future prospects), teachers (evaluation), schools (funding), and states (lawsuits), test preparation as a function of teaching became essential. Tests were made to be economical, using [[multiple choice|multiple-choice questions]] and focusing on [[psychometrics|psychometric]] validity, but perhaps not measuring more complex abilities. Schools and teachers were accountable for student test performance, and thus focused on the skills and outcomes that the tests measured. Given the dynamic interaction between testing and education, the term systematic validity was used to refer to the ways in which a test leads to changes in instruction intended to develop cognitive skills that are being measured by a test.&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Research has shown the variable extent to which washback influences different individuals in different ways, and the difficulty of targeting washback. Significant variability has been noted in the ways that teachers respond to test changes and classroom assessments. Effects may be superficial, indirect, and unpredictable due to individual differences in the way that learning is mediated by teachers, textbook writers, and publishers.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrews, Fullilove, &amp; Wong|title=Targeting washback—a case study|journal=System|date=2002|volume=30|issue=2|pages=207-223|doi=10.1016/S0346-251X(02)00005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Washback effect in English language assessment==
With [[globalization]], the world has witnessed an increase in [[Internationalization of Higher Education]], which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of international students in the last 25 years. The prominence of English alongside this internationalization process has also seen the use of international tests of English such as [[TOEIC|Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC)]], [[TOEFL|Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)]], and [[IELTS|International English Language Testing System (IELTS)]] as standard tools in the wider learning community. The increasing weight of these tools in education raises questions about the impact of such tests on teaching and learning, with suggestions that language skills are suffering due to the impact of tests. As English as an International Language (EIL) continues to become more stable through the establishment of clearer features of context-driven English, it is inevitable that there will be significant debate on language norms and proficiency regarding teaching and assessment. The field of applied linguistics should expect to see more specific discussion on the recognition of the way language norms are influenced by use and context,&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt; but this remains an unsolved problem in the area of [[language assessment]].

'''Wiel Arets''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈʋil ˈaːrəts}}, born {{Birth date|1955|05|06|df=y}}) is a Dutch [[architect]], [[architectural theory|architectural theorist]], [[urbanist]], [[industrial designer]] and the former [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the College of Architecture at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in [[Chicago]], in the [[United States of America]]. Arets was previously the 'Professor of Building Planning and Design' at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] (UdK), Germany, and studied at the [[Eindhoven University|Technical University of Eindhoven]], graduating in 1983.One year later he founded [[Wiel Arets Architects]], a multidisciplinary [[architecture]] and [[design]] studio (moved to Maatrich in 1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mchmaster.com/faculty/wiel-arets/|title=Wiel Arets|website=www.mchmaster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nowadays with offices located throughout [[Europe]]. From 1995-2002 he was the Dean of the [[Berlage Institute]] in [[Rotterdam]], where he introduced the idea of 'progressive-research' and co-founded the school's architectural journal named ''HUNCH''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Life and career==
Wiel Arets was born on 6 May 1955 in [[Heerlen]], [[Netherlands]] to Wiel Arets (1929) and Mia Heuts (1931). His father was a book printer and his mother was a [[fashion designer]], both from whom he learned respect for the tradition of [[craft]] and a love of books and reading.&lt;ref name=STILLS&gt;{{cite book
  | title = STILLS: A Timeline of Ideas, Articles and Interviews 1983-2010

  | date= December 2010 |isbn=978 90 6450 764 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly studied [[engineering]], and then [[physics]], before ultimately deciding on architecture. He divides his time between [[Chicago]], [[Maastricht]], [[Berlin]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[Zürich]], living and working in each city. He is married and has two children. Arets' work is generally characterized by a [[minimalist]], geometric and austere approach that responds to local contingencies in a flexible way, with Arets explaining: &lt;blockquote&gt;'We want our buildings to fit into the existing context, yet remain flexible and open to change'.&lt;ref&gt;Arets, Wiel. "AA Files No. 21". Architectural Association London, 1991, pp.16-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his studies at the Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e) Arets became fascinated by the works and words of [[Paul Valéry]], [[Giorgio Grassi]] and Cesare Cattaneo, quickly developing his admiration for 'the dialogue' as an operative method, best exemplified by [[Paul Valéry|Valéry's]] 'Eupalinos' and Cattaneo's 'Giovanni e Giuseppe'.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; While studying Arets co-founded the architectural journal ''Wiederhall'' and organized a series  of visiting lecturers at the TU/e that included the architects [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Tadao Ando]] and [[Peter Eisenmann]], among others. Subsequently, Arets organized the first European exhibition of [[Tadao Ando|Tadao Ando's]] work.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; It was during this period that Arets 'rediscovered' the work of Dutch architect [[Frits Peutz]], who transformed the city of Heerlen from an industrial coal mining hub and into a modern city through his many built commissions funded by the [[coal]] industry, most recognizably the [[Glaspaleis]]. With the decline of industry the city lost most of its status as an industrial area in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and Frits Peutz faded from architectural prominence.

As a student Arets undertook extensive research in the archives of Peutz's office, eventually producing the monograph 'F.P.J Peutz Architekt 1916-1966' (1981) and an accompanying traveling exhibition.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; After graduating from the TU/e in 1983 Arets travelled extensively throughout Russia, the United States and Japan. While in Japan Arets visited and interviewed several prominent architects including [[Fumihiko Maki]], [[Kazuo Shinohara]], [[Itsuko Hasegawa]] and [[Tadao Ando]], later publishing these interviews and articles in the Dutch architecture magazine ''de Architect''.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; Arets first garnered international architectural attention with the completion of the [[Academie Beeldende Kunsten Maastricht|Maastricht Academy of Art and Architecture]] in 1993, described by [[Kenneth Frampton]] as: &lt;blockquote&gt;'Revitalizing an existing institution within the old urban core in such a way as to transform both the institution and the urban fabric...All of this was achieved without abandoning for the moment the minimalist expression of an architecture degree zero, derived in part from [[Sol LeWitt]] and in part from [[Tadao Ando]].'&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Utrecht University library.jpg|thumb|{{Interlanguage link multi|Utrecht University Library|nl|3=Universiteitsbibliotheek Utrecht}}]]
In 2004 Arets completed the [[library]] of [[Utrecht University]], situated in the [[Uithof]] area of the campus designed by [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|OMA]] which dictated a strict orthogonal requirement for all buildings. The library's exterior glazing is screen printed with an image of bamboo shoots created by the photographer [[Kim Zwarts]], returning as a tactile imprinted surface pattern on the library's interior prefabricated concrete panel walls, which are painted black. This 'tactility' has since returned to more of Arets' projects in the form of imprinted-concrete or screen printed glass exteriors.&lt;ref name=LivingLibrary/&gt; [[Kazuyo Sejima]] of [[SANAA]] remarks of the library:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'The building is fascinating in many ways, but most of all I feel some warm humanism from it. Within its crisp black envelope Wiel Arets has carved out an arsenal of different spaces&amp;nbsp;– some low, some high, some wide, some spacious, some compressed, some bright, some dark. This is a building that would never appear dull. It offers a moment for everyone.'&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011 Arets' studio won an international competition to design the IJhal at [[Amsterdam Centraal railway station|Amsterdam Centraal Station]], part of the city's plan to revitalize the waterfront by reconnecting it to the river [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Theoretical position==
In 1991 Arets published his first theoretical text, 'An Alabaster Skin', in a monograph of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;Arets, Wiel. ''An Alabaster Skin''. 010 Publishers, 1991, pp. 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The text merged Arets' fascinations of his studies and early career, including: [[cinematography]], [[photography]], the '[[city]]', technology of the 20th century, the membrane or [[skin]] of a building, [[biology]] and the act of [[cutting]] and [[editing]] (in regards to cinematography), as well as the [[Postmodern architecture]] of the 1980s. [[Greg Lynn]] interprets the piece as so:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'A precedent for this [[alabaster]] [[urbanism]] is [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill|Skidmore Owings and Merrill’s]] [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|Beinecke Rare Book Library]] at [[Yale University]] that utilizes an alabaster curtain wall that breaks down the boundary between the interior and exterior without transparency. Light is admitted from the outside during the day and the interior emanates a glowing light at night. The polished surface of the blank curtain wall reflects the adjacent buildings while allowing permeability. Likewise, in Arets’ work there is the stealth of a [[chameleon]].'&lt;ref name="autogenerated40"&gt;Lynn, Greg. ''Maastricht Academy for the Arts and Architecture''. 010 Publishers, 1994, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Teaching==
Arets was Dean of the [[Berlage Institute]] from 1995-2002 where he changed the school to a research based institute focusing on 'progressive-research', public lectures, publications, field trips, and intensive debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlage-institute.nl/persons/wiel_arets |title=Wiel Arets / Persons / The Berlage |publisher=Berlage-institute.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that position he was and is a professor or guest professor at many architecture schools, mostly within [[Europe]] and the United States, and was until 2012 the 'Professor of Building Planning and Design' at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] (UdK), Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.udk-berlin.de/arets ] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the UdK 'Tokyo Utopia/TOUT',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mastercollectivehousing.com/tag/wiel-arets/ |title=Wiel Arets - Master of Architecture MCH |publisher=Mastercollectivehousing.com |date=2014-04-13 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was Arets' research theme, and he has previously used other research themes, such 'Double Dutch', to structure output and debate while teaching; they often return to give content and context to publications such as ''HUNCH''.&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, Robert. ''Wiel Arets: Autobiographical References''. Birkhäuser, 2012, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the importance of such a 'progressive-research' based theme Arets states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'That's why, when I became Dean, I changed the name to the [[Berlage Institute|Berlage Institute Laboratory for Architecture]], I wanted to invite people to come do their research alongside students and to publish their work with the studios. The research, the production of the students, the publication, the seminars, the field trips, the lectures that were happening&amp;nbsp;– all had to be part of one thing. I think laboratory simply means you have a theme, and you collectively do investigations and research. And then, at the end of the year, you have a result, which is presented in the school's publication, ''HUNCH'', which was originally edited by [[Jennifer Sigler]]. This was, and still is, not just a publication of only student work; rather, ''HUNCH'' was where we also published the work of guest lecturers, the important research of the trips, and everything we thought belonged to the year theme.'&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, Robert. ''Wiel Arets: Autobiographical References''. Birkhäuser, 2012, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* On his idea of the emerging global metropolis: "To understand the world we are living in at this moment, we have to redefine the 'Map of the world', a mental construct which at least since 1492 has undergone many reinperpretations. We could read the world anno 2020 as a collective living space for us all, in which all the continents are in reach within 288 minutes, and the maximum travel distance at each continent will be 72 minutes, the time in which every city on each continent will be able to be reached."&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt;
*"Sometimes in spring there are beautiful trees that bloom, and suddenly, there are white blossoms everywhere. You don't look at one particular spot. And I personally think that's also true in architecture."&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, Robert. ''Wiel Arets: Autobiographical References''. Birkhäuser, 2012, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;
