'''Absolute pitch''' (AP), widely referred to as '''''perfect pitch''''', is a rare auditory phenomenon characterized by the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given [[musical note]] without the benefit of a reference tone.&lt;ref name="phil-494"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch In D.

AP can be demonstrated via linguistic labeling ("naming" a note), auditory imagery,{{clarify|reason=This is puzzling. How does the auditory imagery get out of the person's brain?|date=October 2016}} or sensorimotor responses. For example, an AP possessor can accurately reproduce a heard tone on a musical instrument without "hunting" for the correct pitch.&lt;ref name="Zatorre, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Zatorre |year=1989 |title=Multiple coding strategies in the retention of musical tones by possessors of absolute pitch|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume= 17 |issue=5 |pages=582–589 |doi=10.3758/BF03197081 |last2=Beckett |first2=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zatorre, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Zatorre |date=July 2003 |title=Absolute pitch: a model for understanding the influence of genes and development on neural and cognitive function |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=692–695 |doi=10.1038/nn1085 |pmid=12830161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers estimate the occurrence of AP to be 1 in 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="Sacks1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oliver Sacks |date=May 1995 |title=Letters: Musical Ability |journal=Science |volume=268 |issue=5211 |pages=621–622 |doi=10.1126/science.7732360 |pmid=7732360|bibcode=1995Sci...268..621S |last2=Schlaug |last3=Jancke |last4=Huang |last5=Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, absolute pitch implies some or all of the following abilities, achieved without a reference tone:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Parncutt, R. |author2=Levitin, D. J. |year=2001 |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |chapter=Absolute Pitch |editor=Sadie, S. |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=1-56159-239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify by name individual [[pitch (music)|pitches]] (e.g. F{{music|sharp}}, A, G, C) played on various instruments.
* Name the [[key (music)|key]] of a given piece of tonal music.
* Reproduce a piece of tonal music in the correct key days after hearing it.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* Identify and name all the tones of a given [[chord (music)|chord]] or other tonal mass.
* Accurately sing a named pitch.
* Name the pitches of common everyday sounds such as [[vehicle horn|car horns]] and [[Alarm device|alarms]].
* Name the frequency of a pitch (e.g. that G{{music|#}}4  is 415Hz) after hearing it.

People may have absolute pitch along with the ability of [[relative pitch]], and relative and absolute pitch work together in actual musical listening and practice, but strategies in using each skill vary.&lt;ref name="Miyazaki, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken'ichi |last=Miyazaki |date=June 2004 |title=How well do we understand absolute pitch? |journal=Acoustical Science and Technology |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=270–282 |doi=10.1250/ast.25.426 |url=http://psyche.ge.niigata-u.ac.jp/Psyche/Miyazaki/Papers/Miyazaki2004.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816070421/http://psyche.ge.niigata-u.ac.jp/Psyche/Miyazaki/Papers/Miyazaki2004.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with absolute pitch may train their relative pitch and there has been a reported case of 6 adults in China (with previous musical training) acquiring absolute pitch through specific tonal training.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/03/355933&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, two studies by Harvard and the University of Chicago have shown Valproate, a medication used to treat epilepsy and severe depression, may re-open the "critical period" of learning making the acquisition of absolute pitch, as well as languages, potentially as efficient for adults as for children.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.uchicago.edu/story/acquiring-perfect-pitch-may-be-possible-some-adults&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.uchicago.edu/story/acquiring-perfect-pitch-may-be-possible-some-adults&lt;/ref&gt; Adults who possess relative pitch but do not already have absolute pitch can also learn "pseudo-absolute pitch" and become able to identify notes in a way that superficially resembles absolute pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Levitin, D.J. |year=2008 |title=Music Meets Medicine, Proceedings of the Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation |chapter=Absolute pitch: Both a curse and a blessing |editor1=Clockars, M. |editor2=Peltomaa, M. |pages=124–132 |publisher=Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation |location=Helsinki, Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, training absolute pitch can require considerable motivation, time, and effort, and learning is not retained without constant practice and reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meyer, M |title=On memorizing absolute pitch |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=28 |year=1956 |pages=718–719 |doi=10.1121/1.1908465 |issue=4|bibcode = 1956ASAJ...28..718M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific studies==

===History of study and terminologies===
Scientific study of absolute pitch appears to have commenced in the 19th century, focusing on the phenomenon of musical pitch and methods of measuring it.&lt;ref name=Ellis1876&gt;{{Cite journal |date=November 6, 1876 |author=Ellis, Alexander J |title=On the Sensitiveness of the Ear to Pitch and Change of Pitch in Music |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |pages=1 |series=(published until 1945 as Proceedings of the Musical Association)|volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/jrma/3.1.1 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/ellis76.pdf |accessdate=24 August 2010 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have been difficult for any notion of absolute pitch to have formed earlier because pitch references were not consistent. For example, the note now known as 'A' varied in different local or national musical traditions between what would now be considered as G sharp and B flat before the standardisation of the late 19th century. While the term ''absolute pitch'', or ''absolute ear'', was in use by the late 19th century by both British&lt;ref name=Bosanquet1876&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1876 |author=Bosanquet, R.H.M |title=An Elementary Treaties on Musical Intervals and Temperament |series=with an Account of an Enharmonic Harmonium Exhibited in the Loan Collection of Scientific Instruments |place=London |publisher=Macmillan and Co |page=xiv (n17 in electronic page field) |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924022233088#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=24 August 2010 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German researchers,&lt;ref name=vonKries&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1892 |author=von Kries, J |title=Über das absolute Gehör (About the perfect pitch) |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Psychologie |volume=3 |pages=257–79 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/kreis92.htm |accessdate=24 August 2010 |postscript=}} [http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/kreis92e.htm Translation by Christopher Aruffo, www.acousticlearning.com]&lt;/ref&gt; its application was not universal; other terms such as ''musical ear'',&lt;ref name=Ellis1876/&gt; ''absolute tone consciousness'',&lt;ref name=Otto07&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1907 |author=Abraham, O |title=Das absolute Tonbewußtsein und die Musik (Absolute tone consciousness and music) |language=German |journal=Sammelbände der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft |volume=8 |pages=486–91 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/abraham07.htm |accessdate=25 August 2010 |postscript=}} [http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/abraham07e.htm Translation by Christopher Aruffo, www.acousticlearning.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''positive pitch''&lt;ref name="Copp 1916"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Copp, E.F. |year=1916 |title=Musical Ability |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=7 |pages=297–305 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/fletcher/copp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also used to refer to the ability. The skill is not exclusively musical, or limited to human perception; absolute pitch has been demonstrated in animals such as bats, wolves, gerbils, and birds, for whom specific pitches facilitate identification of mates or meals.&lt;ref name=Brown1999&gt;{{Cite journal |date=4 December 1999 |author=Brown, Kathryn |title=Striking the Right Note |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume= 164 |issue=2215 |pages=38–41 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference in cognition, not elementary sensation===
Physically and functionally, the auditory system of an absolute listener does not appear to be different from that of a non-absolute listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sergeant, D. |title=Experimental investigation of absolute pitch |journal=Journal of Research in Music Education |volume=17 |year=1969 |pages=135–143 |doi=10.2307/3344200 |issue=1 |publisher=Journal of Research in Music Education, Vol. 17, No. 1 |jstor=3344200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "it reflects a particular ability to analyze frequency information, presumably involving high-level cortical processing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregersen, P. K. |title=Instant Recognition: The Genetics of Pitch Perception |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | volume=62 |year=1998 |pages=221–223 |doi=10.1086/301734 |pmid=9463341 |issue=2 |pmc=1376907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute pitch is an act of cognition, needing memory of the frequency, a label for the frequency (such as "B-flat"), and exposure to the range of sound encompassed by that categorical label. Absolute pitch may be directly analogous to recognizing [[color]]s, [[phoneme]]s (speech sounds), or other categorical perception of sensory stimuli. Just as most people have learned to recognize and name the color ''blue'' by the range of frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that are perceived as [[light]], it is possible that those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life will be more likely to identify, for example, the note C.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Takeuchi, A. H. |author2=Hulse, S. H. |title=Absolute pitch |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=113 |year=1993 |pages=345–361 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.2.345 |pmid=8451339 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute pitch may also be related to certain genes, possibly an [[autosomal]] [[dominant gene]]tic trait,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Profita, J. |author2=Bidder, T. G. |title=Perfect pitch |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=29 |year=1988 |pages=763–771 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320290405 |pmid=3400722 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baharloo, S. |author2=Johnston, P.

===Influence by music experience===
Absolute pitch sense appears to be influenced by cultural exposure to music, especially in the familiarization of the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] [[musical scale|C-major scale]]. Most of the absolute listeners that were tested in this respect identified the C-major tones more reliably and, except for B, more quickly than the five "black key" tones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=The speed of musical pitch identification by absolute-pitch possessors |journal=Music Perception |volume=8 |year=1990 |pages=177–188 |doi=10.2307/40285495}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to the higher prevalence of these tones in ordinary musical experience. One study of Dutch non-musicians also demonstrated a bias toward using C-major tones in ordinary speech, especially on syllables related to emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braun, M. |title=Absolute pitch in emphasized speech |journal=Acoustics Research Letters Online |volume=3 |year=2002 |pages=77–82 |doi=10.1121/1.1472336 |issue=2| url=http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=ARLOFJ000003000002000077000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;prog=normal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
Absolute pitch is more common among speakers of [[tonal language]]s, such as most dialects of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which often depend on pitch variation as the means of distinguishing words that otherwise sound the same—e.g., [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] with four possible tonal variations, [[Cantonese]] with six, [[Southern Min]] with seven or eight (depending on dialect), and Vietnamese with six.&lt;ref name=jasa138th&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Dolson | first3 = M. | title = Tone Language Speakers Possess Absolute Pitch | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |year=1999 | volume = 106 | issue = | page = 2267 |laysummary=http://www.acoustics.org/press/138th/deutsch.htm|laysource=Acoustics.org | doi=10.1121/1.427738|bibcode = 1999ASAJ..106.2267D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jasa148th&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Marvin | first3 = E. | last4 = Xu | first4 = H. | title = Perfect Pitch in Tone Language Speakers Carries Over to Music | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |year= 2005 | volume = 116 | issue = | page = 2580 |laysource=AIP|laysummary=http://www.aip.org/148th/deutsch.html | doi = 10.1121/1.4808626 |bibcode = 2004ASAJ..116.2580D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] have been reported to speak a word in the same absolute pitch (within a quarter-tone) on different days; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they learn to speak a tonal language&lt;ref name="deu-2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Henthorn T. |author3=Dolson, M. |title=Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework |journal=Music Perception |volume=21 |pages=339–356 |year=2004 |doi=10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339 |issue=3|url=http://philomel.com/pdf/MP-2004-21_339-356.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and possibly also by infants when they learn to speak a [[Pitch accent|pitch-accent language]]). However, the brains of tonal-language speakers do not naturally process musical sound as language;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gandour, J |author2=Wong, D. |author3=Hutchins, G. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Pitch processing in the human brain is influenced by language experience |journal=NeuroReport |volume=9 |year=1998 |pages=2115–2119 |doi=10.1097/00001756-199806220-00038 |pmid=9674604 |issue=9 |url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gandour/publications/neurp_98.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912000200/http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gandour/publications/neurp_98.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps such speakers are more likely to acquire absolute pitch for musical tones when they later receive musical training. Many native speakers of a tone language, even those with little musical training, are observed to sing a given song consistently with regard to pitch. Among music students of East Asian ethnic heritage, those who speak a tone language very fluently have a much higher prevalence of absolute pitch than those who do not speak a tone language.&lt;ref name="phil-jasa-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Deutsch, D. |author2=Henthorn, T. |author3=Marvin, E. |author4=Xu H-S |last-author-amp=yes|title=Absolute pitch among American and Chinese conservatory students: Prevalence differences, and evidence for a speech-related critical period |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=119 |pages=719–722 |year=2006 |doi=10.1121/1.2151799 |pmid=16521731 |issue=2|bibcode = 2006ASAJ..119..719D | url=http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2006_119_719-722.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deu-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Dooley, K. |author3=Henthorn, T. |author4=Head, B. |title=Absolute pitch among students in an American music conservatory: Association with tone language fluency |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=125 |pages=2398–2403 |year=2009 |doi=10.1121/1.3081389 |pmid=19354413 |issue=4|bibcode = 2009ASAJ..125.2398D | url=http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2009_125_2398-2403.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-588"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Li, X. |author3=Shen, J. |last-author-amp=yes | title=Absolute pitch among students at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music: A large-scale direct-test study | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=134 | pages=3853–3859 | year=2013 | doi=10.1121/1.4824450 |url=http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA_2013_134_3853-3859.pdf|format=PDF |bibcode = 2013ASAJ..134.3853D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that African level-tone languages—such as [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Connell, B. |author2=Ladd, D. R. |title=Aspects of pitch realization in Yoruba |journal=Phonology |volume=7 |year=1990 |pages=1–29 |doi=10.1017/S095267570000110X}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three pitch levels, and [[Mambila language|Mambila]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Connell, B. |title=The perception of lexical tone in Mambila |journal=Language and Speech |volume=43 |year=2000 |pages=163–182 |doi=10.1177/00238309000430020201 |pmid= 11064955 |issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with four—may be better suited to study the role of absolute pitch in speech than the pitch and contour tone languages of East Asia.

Speakers of European languages have been found to make subconscious use of an absolute pitch memory when speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braun, M. |title=Speech mirrors norm-tones: Absolute pitch as a normal but precognitive trait |journal=Acoustical Society of America: Acoustics Research Letters Online |volume=2 |year=2001 |pages=85–90 |doi=10.1121/1.1376728 |issue=3 |url=http://ojps.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=ARLOFJ000002000003000085000001&amp;idtype=cvips |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception===
Absolute pitch is the ability to perceive [[pitch class]] and to mentally categorize sounds according to perceived pitch class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rakowski, A. |title= Categorical perception in absolute pitch |journal=Archives of Acoustics Quarterly |volume=18 |year=1993 |pages=515–523}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[pitch class]] is the set of all pitches that are a whole number of octaves apart. While the boundaries of musical pitch categories vary among human cultures, the recognition of octave relationships is a natural characteristic of the mammalian auditory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morest, D.K. |title=The laminar structure of the medial geniculate body of the cat |journal=J.

This phenomenon is apparently unrelated to musical training. The skill may be associated more closely with vocal production. Violin students learning the [[Suzuki method]] are required to memorize each composition in a fixed key and play it from memory on their instrument, but they are not required to sing. When tested, these students did not succeed in singing the memorized Suzuki songs in the original, fixed key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Saah, Victoria |author2=Marvin, Elizabeth West |year=2004 |title=Absolute memory of learned melodies in children trained by the Suzuki violin method |journal=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition |pages=736–739 |url=http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810004816/http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |archivedate=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible problems===
Musicians with absolute perception may experience difficulties which do not exist for other musicians. Because absolute listeners are capable of recognizing that a musical composition has been transposed from its original key, or that a pitch is being produced at a nonstandard frequency (either sharp or flat), a musician with absolute pitch may become distressed upon perceiving tones believed to be "wrong" or hearing a piece of music "in the wrong key." This can especially apply to Baroque music that is recorded in Baroque tuning (usually A = 415&amp;nbsp;Hz as opposed to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, ''i.e.'', roughly a half step or semitone lower than standard concert pitch).&lt;ref name="Sacks, O. 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sacks, O. |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |isbn=1-4000-4081-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An absolute listener may also use absolute strategies for tasks which are more efficiently accomplished with [[relative pitch|relative strategies]], such as transposition&lt;ref name="miy_1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=Absolute pitch as an inability: Identification of musical intervals in a tonal context |journal=Music Perception |volume=11 |year=1993 |pages=55–72 |doi=10.2307/40285599|jstor=40285599}}&lt;/ref&gt; or producing harmony for tones whose frequencies do not match standard [[equal temperament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, G. B. |year=1974 |title=Categorical perception and absolute pitch |publisher=University of Western Ontario |location=Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible for some musicians to have displaced absolute pitch, where all notes are slightly flat or slightly sharp of their respective pitch as defined by a given convention.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This may arise from learning the pitch names from an instrument that was tuned to a concert pitch convention other than the one in use, ''e.g.'', A = 435&amp;nbsp;Hz (the [[Paris Opera]] convention of the late 19th and early 20th centuries) as opposed to the Anglo-American modern standard A = 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. When playing in groups with other musicians, this may lead to playing in a tonality that is slightly different from that of the rest of the group.

===Synesthesia===
Absolute pitch shows a genetic overlap with [[synesthesia]]/[[ideasthesia]],&lt;ref name=gregersen_2013/&gt;{{clarify|reason=This contradicts with earlier statements in the article, which imply that the genetic status of perfect pitch is not verified. Which is it?|date=October 2016}} and some individuals with music-related synesthesia also have perfect pitch.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} They may associate certain notes or keys with different colors, enabling them to tell what any note or key is. It is unknown how many people with perfect pitch are also synesthetes.

==Correlation with musical talent==
Absolute pitch is not a prerequisite for skilled musical performance or composition. However, musicians with absolute pitch tend to perform better on musical transcription tasks (controlling for age of onset and amount of musical training) compared with those without absolute pitch.&lt;ref name="phil-446"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dooley, K. |author2=Deutsch, D. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Absolute pitch correlates with high performance on musical dictation | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume= 128 | issue=2| pages= 890–3| year=2010 | pmid=20707458 | doi=10.1121/1.3458848 |bibcode = 2010ASAJ..128..890D}} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2010_128_890-893.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that musicians with absolute pitch perform worse than those without absolute pitch on recognition of musical intervals.&lt;ref name="miyazaki"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Miyazaki K. | title=Perception of relative pitch with different references: Some absolute-pitch listeners can't tell musical interval names | journal=Perception and Psychophysics | volume=57 | issue=7 | pages= 962–970 | year=1995 | doi=10.3758/bf03205455| pmid=8532499}} [http://www.springerlink.com/content/d11h926866110564/fulltext.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; However, experiments on which this conclusion was based contained an artifact{{Clarify|reason=How defined and of what kind?

Owing to uncertainty in the historical record, it is often impossible to determine whether notable composers and musicians of the past had absolute pitch. Since absolute pitch is rare in European musical culture,&lt;ref name="deu_2006b"/&gt; claims that any particular musician possessed it are difficult to evaluate. Among composers of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical music era|Classical]] eras, evidence is available only for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who is documented to have demonstrated the ability at age 7.&lt;ref name="phil-45"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1121/1.2961141 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=The Enigma of Absolute Pitch | journal=Acoustics Today | volume=2 | pages=11–18 | year=2006 | issue=4}} [http://philomel.com/pdf/AT-2006_2_2.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have only surmised that [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] had it, as indicated from some excerpts from his letters. By the 19th century, it became more common for the presence of absolute pitch to be recorded, identifying the ability to be present in musicians such as [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[John Philip Sousa]].&lt;ref&gt; Naxos.

==Relative pitch==
{{Main article|Relative pitch}}
Many musicians have quite good [[relative pitch]], a skill that can be learned through [[ear training]]. With practice, it is possible to listen to a single known pitch once (from a [[pitch pipe]] or a [[tuning fork]]) and then have stable, reliable pitch identification by comparing the notes heard to the stored memory of the tonic pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brady, P. T. |title=Fixed-scale mechanism of absolute pitch |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=48 |year=1970 |pages=883–887 |doi=10.1121/1.1912227 |pmid=5480385 |issue=4|bibcode = 1970ASAJ...48..883B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike absolute pitch, this skill is dependent on a recently perceived [[tonal center]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48329">'''American civil religion''' is a [[sociological theory]] that a nonsectarian quasi-[[religious]] faith exists within the [[United States]] with sacred symbols drawn from national history. Scholars have portrayed it as a cohesive force, a common set of values that foster social and cultural integration. The very heavy emphasis on nondenominational religious themes is quite distinctively American and the theory is designed to explain this. The concept goes back to the 19th century, but in current form, the theory was developed by sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] in 1967 in his article, "Civil Religion in America". The topic soon became the major focus at [[sociology of religion|religious sociology]] conferences and numerous articles and books were written on the subject. The debate reached its peak with the [[American Bicentennial]] celebration in 1976.&lt;ref name = "RB"&gt;{{cite journal

|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/american.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a viewpoint that some Americans have come to see the document of the [[United States Constitution]], along with the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as cornerstones of a type of civic or [[civil religion]] or [[political religion]]. Political sociologist Anthony Squiers argues that these texts act as the sacred writ of the American civil religion because they are used as authoritative symbols in what he calls the politics of the sacred. The Politics of the Sacred, according to Squiers are "the attempt to define and dictate what is in accord with the civil religious sacred and what is not. It is a battle to define what can and cannot be and what should and should not be tolerated and accepted in the community, based on its relation to that which is sacred for that community."&lt;ref&gt;Squiers, A. (2018). The Politics of the Sacred in America: The Role of Civil Religion in Political Practice. New York: Springer. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-3-319-68870-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bellah, Americans embrace a common "civil religion" with certain fundamental beliefs, values, holidays, and rituals, parallel to, or independent of, their chosen religion.&lt;ref name = "jew" /&gt; Presidents have often served in central roles in civil religion, and the nation provides quasi-religious honors to its martyrs—such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the soldiers killed in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Harry S. Stout, ''Upon the Altar of the Nation: A Moral History of the Civil War'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have noted presidential level use of civil religion rhetoric in profoundly moving episodes such as [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael A. Genovese|title=Encyclopedia of the American Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BaVozO5RyNwC&amp;pg=PA89|year=2010|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|page=89|isbn=9781438126388}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Civil Rights Movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Michael Manis|title=Southern Civil Religions in Conflict: Civil Rights and the Culture Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oq2d_TFALAEC&amp;pg=PA184|year=2002|publisher=[[Mercer University Press]]|page=184|isbn=9780865547858}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[September 11th attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=George C. Edwards|author2=Desmond S. King|title=The Polarized Presidency of George W. Bush|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ahH0DRaFw0C&amp;pg=PA152|year=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=152|isbn=9780199217977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of more than fifty years of American civil religion scholarship, Squiers identifies fourteen principal tenets of the American civil religion:

# Filial piety
# Reference to certain sacred texts and symbols of the ACR (The Constitution, The Declaration of independence, the flag, etc.)
# The sanctity of American institutions 
# The belief in God or a deity
# The idea that rights are divinely given
# The notion that freedom comes from God through government
# Governmental authority comes from God or a higher transcendent authority 
# The conviction that God can be known through the American experience
# God is the supreme judge
# God is sovereign 
# America’s prosperity results from God’s providence 
# America is a ‘city on a hill’ or a beacon of hope and righteousness 
# The principle of sacrificial death and rebirth 
# America serves a higher purpose than self-interests

In an examination of over fifty years of political discourse, Squiers finds that Filial piety, Reference to certain sacred texts and symbols of the ACR, The belief in God or a deity, America is a ‘city on a hill’ or a beacon of hope and righteousness, and America serves a higher purpose than self-interests are the most frequently referenced. He further found that there are no statistically significant differences in the amount of American civil religious language between Democrats and Republicans, incumbents and non-incumbents nor Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Squiers, A. (2018). The Politics of the Sacred in America: The Role of Civil Religion in Political Practice. New York: Springer. p. 51-74. {{ISBN|978-3-319-68870-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This belief system has historically been used to reject nonconformist ideas and groups.&lt;ref name = "RB" /&gt; Theorists such as Bellah hold that American civil religion can perform the religious functions of integration, legitimation, and prophecy, while other theorists, such as Richard Fenn, disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Gehrig, "The American Civil Religion Debate: A Source for Theory Construction," ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', (March 1981) 20#1 pp. 51–63 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1385338 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of concept==
{{See also|Political religion|Civil religion}}
[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] believed that Christianity was the source of the basic principles of liberal democracy, and the only religion capable of maintaining liberty in a democratic era. He was keenly aware of the mutual hatred between Christians and [[French liberalism|liberals]] in 19th-century France, rooted in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution]]. In France, Christianity was allied with the Old Regime before 1789 and the reactionary [[Bourbon Restoration]] of 1815-30. However he said Christianity was not antagonistic to democracy in the United States, where it was a bulwark against dangerous tendencies toward [[individualism]] and [[materialism]], which would lead to [[atheism]] and tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford Kessler, "Tocqueville on Civil Religion and Liberal Democracy," ''[[Journal of Politics]],'' 39#1 (1977), pp. 119–46 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2129689 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important were the contributions of French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778) and French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917).

===The American case===
Most students of American civil religion follow the basic Bellah/Durkheimian interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Marcela Cristi, ''From civil to political religion: the intersection of culture, religion and politics'' (2001) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of this idea include philosopher [[John Dewey]] who spoke of "common faith" (1934); sociologist Robin Murphy Williams' ''American Society: A Sociological Interpretation'' (1951) which stated there was a "common religion" in America; sociologist [[Lloyd Warner]]'s analysis of the [[Memorial Day]] celebrations in "Yankee City" (1953 [1974]); historian [[Martin Marty]]'s "religion in general" (1959); theologian [[Will Herberg]] who spoke of "the [[American Way of Life]]" (1960, 1974); historian [[Sidney Mead]]'s "religion of the Republic" (1963); and British writer [[G. K. Chesterton]], who said that the United States was "the only nation ... founded on a creed" and also coined the phrase "a nation with a soul of a church".&lt;ref name="from" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "e" /&gt;

In the same period, several distinguished historians such as Yehoshua Arieli, [[Daniel Boorstin]], and Ralph Gabriel "assessed the religious dimension of '[[nationalism]]', the 'American creed', 'cultural religion' and the 'democratic faith'".&lt;ref name="from" /&gt;

Premier sociologist [[Seymour Lipset]] (1963) referred to "Americanism" and the "American Creed" to characterize a distinct set of values that Americans hold with a quasi-religious fervor.&lt;ref name="from" /&gt;

Today, according to social scientist Ronald Wimberley and William Swatos, there seems to be a firm consensus among social scientists that there is a part of Americanism that is especially religious in nature, which may be termed civil religion. But this religious nature is less significant than the "transcendent universal religion of the nation" which late eighteenth century French intellectuals such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] wrote about.&lt;ref name = "e" /&gt;

===Evidence supporting Bellah===
Ronald Wimberley (1976) and other researchers collected large surveys and factor analytic studies which gave support to Bellah's argument that civil religion is a distinct cultural phenomenon within American society which is not embodied in American politics or denominational religion.&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;

Examples of civil religious beliefs are reflected in statements used in the research such as the following:
* "America is God's [[New Jerusalem#Puritan|chosen nation]] today."
* "A president's authority ... is from God."
* "Social justice cannot only be based on laws; it must also come from religion."
* "God can be known through the experiences of the American people."
* "Holidays like the [[Fourth of July]] are religious as well as patriotic."&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;
* "God Bless America"
Later research sought to determine who is civil religious. In a 1978 study by James Christenson and Ronald Wimberley, the researchers found that a wide cross section of American citizens have civil religious beliefs. In general though, college graduates and political or religious liberals appear to be somewhat less civil religious. [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[Catholicism|Catholics]] have the same level of civil religiosity. Religions that were created in the United States, the [[Latter Day Saints movement]], [[Adventism|Adventists]], and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], have the highest civil religiosity. Jews, Unitarians and those with no religious preference have the lowest civil religion. Even though there is variation in the scores, the "great majority" of Americans are found to share the types of civil religious beliefs which Bellah wrote about.&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;

Further research found that civil religion plays a role in people's preferences for political candidates and policy positions. In 1980 Ronald Wimberley found that civil religious beliefs were more important than loyalties to a political party in predicting support for Nixon over McGovern with a sample of Sunday morning church goers who were surveyed near the election date and a general group of residents in the same community. In 1982 James Christenson and Ronald Wimberley found that civil religion was second only to occupation in predicting a person's political policy views.&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;

Coleman has argued that civil religion is a widespread theme in history. He says it typically evolves in three phases: undifferentiation, state sponsorship in the period of modernization, differentiation. He supports his argument with comparative historical data from Japan, Imperial Rome, the Soviet Union, Turkey, France and The United States.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Coleman, "Civil Religion," ''Sociological Analysis,'' Summer 1970, 31#2 pp. 67–77 {{doi|10.2307/3710057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil religion in practice==

===American Revolution===

The [[American Revolution]] was the main source of civil religion. It produced a [[Moses]]-like leader ([[George Washington]]), prophets ([[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]]), apostles ([[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]]) and martyrs ([[Boston Massacre]], [[Nathan Hale]]), as well as devils ([[Benedict Arnold]]), sacred places ([[Valley Forge]]), rituals (raising the [[Liberty Tree]]), flags (the [[Betsy Ross flag]]), sacred holidays ([[Independence Day (United States)|July 4th]]) and a holy scripture (The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]).&lt;ref&gt;Catherine L. Albanese, ''Sons of the Fathers: The Civil Religion of the American Revolution'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonies in the early Republic===
[[File:Apotheosis of George Washington.jpg|right|thumbnail|upright=1.3|''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'', as seen looking up from the capitol rotunda]]
The elitists who ran the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] were conscious of the need to boost voter identification with their party.&lt;ref&gt;David Waldstreicher, ''In the midst of perpetual fetes: The making of American nationalism, 1776–1820'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Elections remained of central importance but for the rest of the political year celebrations, parades, festivals, and visual sensationalism were used. They employed multiple festivities, exciting parades, and even quasi-religious pilgrimages and "sacred" days that became incorporated into the American civil religion. George Washington was always its hero, and after his death he became a sort of [[demigod]] looking down from heaven to instill his blessings on the party.&lt;ref&gt;John Ferling, ''The ascent of George Washington: The hidden political genius of an American Icon'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the Federalists focused on commemoration of the ratification of the Constitution;  they organized parades to demonstrate widespread popular support for the new Federalist Party. The parade organizers, incorporated secular versions of traditional religious themes and rituals, thereby fostering a highly visible celebration of the nation's new civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Heideking, "The federal processions of 1788 and the origins of American civil religion." ''[[Soundings (journal)|Soundings]]'' (1994): 367–87. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41178897 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth of July became a semi-sacred day—a status it maintains in the 21st century. Its celebration  in Boston proclaimed national over local patriotism, and included orations, dinners, [[Militia (United States)|militia]] musters, parades, marching bands, floats and fireworks. By 1800, the Fourth was closely identified with the Federalist party. Republicans were annoyed, and stage their own celebrations on the fourth—with rival parades sometimes clashing with each other. That generated even more excitement and larger crowds. After the collapse of the Federalists starting in 1815, the Fourth became a nonpartisan holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Len Travers, "Hurrah for the Fourth: Patriotism, Politics, and Independence Day in Federalist Boston, 1783–1818." ''[[Essex Institute]] Historical Collections'' 125: 129–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Coe, et al. ''The Rhetoric of American Civil Religion: Symbols, Sinners, and Saints'' ([[Lexington Books]], 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===President as leader of civil religion===
Since the days of George Washington presidents have assumed one of several roles in American civil religion, and that role has helped shape the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Richard G., Hutcheson, Jr., ''God in the White House: How Religion Has Changed the Modern Presidency'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James David Fairbanks, "The Priestly Functions of the Presidency: A Discussion of the Literature on Civil Religion and Its Implications for the Study of Presidential Leadership," ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' (1981) 11:214–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Linder argues that:

{{quote|Throughout American history, the president has provided the leadership in the public faith. Sometimes he has functioned primarily as a national prophet, as did Abraham Lincoln. Occasionally he has served primarily as the nation's pastor, as did Dwight Eisenhower. At other times he has performed primarily as the high priest of the civil religion, as did Ronald Reagan. In prophetic civil religion, the president assesses the nation's actions in relation to transcendent values and calls upon the people to make sacrifices in times of crisis and to repent of their corporate sins when their behavior falls short of the national ideals. As the national pastor, he provides spiritual inspiration to the people by affirming American core values and urging them to appropriate those values, and by comforting them in their afflictions. In the priestly role, the president makes America itself the ultimate reference point. He leads the citizenry in affirming and celebrating the nation, and reminds them of the national mission, while at the same time glorifying and praising his political flock.&lt;ref name="Robert D. Linder 1996, pp 733-49"&gt;Robert D. Linder, "Universal pastor: President Bill Clinton's civil religion," ''[[Journal of Church and State]],'' Autumn 1996, 38#4 pp 733–49&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Charles W. Calhoun]] argues that in the 1880s the speeches of [[Benjamin Harrison]] display a rhetorical style that embraced American civic religion; indeed, Harrison was one of the credo's most adept presidential practitioners. Harrison was a leader whose application of Christian ethics to social and economic matters paved the way for the [[Social Gospel]], the [[Progressive Movement]] and a national climate of acceptance regarding government action to resolve social problems.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Calhoun, "Civil religion and the gilded age presidency: The case of Benjamin Harrison," ''Presidential Studies Quarterly,'' Fall 1993, 23#4 pp. 651–67&lt;/ref&gt;

Linder argues that President Bill Clinton's sense of civil religion was based on his [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] background in [[Arkansas]]. Commentator [[William Safire]] noted of the 1992 presidential campaign that, "Never has the name of God been so frequently invoked, and never has this or any nation been so thoroughly and systematically blessed."&lt;ref&gt;Barry A. Kosmin and Seymour Lachman, ''One Nation Under God: Religion in Contemporary American Society'' (1994) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton speeches incorporated religious terminology that suggests the role of pastor rather than prophet or priest. With a universalistic outlook, he made no sharp distinction between the domestic and the foreign in presenting his vision of a world community of civil faith.&lt;ref name="Robert D. Linder 1996, pp 733-49"/&gt;

Brocker argues that Europeans have often mischaracterized the politics of President [[George W. Bush]] (2001–2009) as directly inspired by [[Protestant fundamentalism]]. However, in his speeches Bush mostly actually used civil religious metaphors and images and rarely used language specific to any Christian denomination. [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|His foreign policy]], says Bocker, was based on American security interests and not on any fundamentalist teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Brocker, "Civil Religion, Fundamentalism, and the Politics and Policies of George W. Bush," ''Journal of Political Science,'' Jan 2004, Vol. 32, pp. 95–124&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammer says that in his 2008 campaign speeches candidate [[Barack Obama]] portrays the American nation as a people unified by a shared belief in the American Creed and sanctified by the symbolism of an American civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Stefanie. Hammer, "The role of narrative in political campaigning: An analysis of speeches by Barack Obama," ''[[National Identities]],'' Sept 2010, 12#3, pp. 269–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Would-be presidents likewise contributed to the rhetorical history of civil religion. The speeches of [[Daniel Webster]] were often memorized by student debaters, and his 1830 endorsement of "Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable" was iconic.&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Smith, ''Daniel Webster and the Oratory of Civil Religion'' (2005) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism of the American flag===
According to Adam Goodheart, the modern meaning of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]], and the reverence of many Americans towards it, was forged by Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]]'s fight in defense of the flag at the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], which opened the [[American Civil War]] in April 1861. During the war the flag was used throughout the Union to symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism. Goodheart explains the flag was transformed into a sacred symbol of patriotism:

{{quote|Before that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory ... and displayed on special occasions like the Fourth of July. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flew ... from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. ... [T]hat old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Goodheart|title=1861: The Civil War Awakening|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCPbnsUPhB0C&amp;pg=PA22|year=2011|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|page=22|isbn=9781400032198}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Soldiers and veterans===
An important dimension is the role of the soldiers, ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. They are memorialized in many monuments and semi-sacred days, such as [[Veterans Day]] and [[Memorial Day]]. Historian Jonathan Ebel argues that the "soldier-savior" is a sort of Messiah, who embodies the synthesis of civil religion, and the Christian ideals of sacrifice and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan H. Ebel, ''G.I. Messiahs: Soldiering, War, and American Civil Religion'' (2015) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, there are numerous cemeteries exclusively for American soldiers who fought in world wars. They have become American sacred spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan H. Ebel, "Overseas military cemeteries As american sacred space: mine eyes have seen la gloire." ''Material Religion'' 8#2 (2012): 183–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacifists have made some sharp criticisms. For example, Kelly Denton-Borhaug, writing from the [[Moravian College|Moravian]] peace tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Denton-Borhaug,  "Sharing Peace: Mennonites and Catholics in Conversation eds. by Gerald W. Schlabach and Margaret Pfeil," ''American Catholic Studies'' 125#2 (2014): 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  argues that the theme of "sacrifice" has fueled the rise of what she calls "U.S. war culture." The result is a diversion of attention from what she considers the militarism and the immoral, oppressive, sometimes barbaric conduct in the global American war on terror.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Denton-Borhaug, ''U.S. War-Culture, Sacrifice and Salvation'' (2011) pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Protestant denominations such as the [[Churches of Christ]], have largely turned away from [[pacifism]] to give greater support to patriotism and civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Casey, "From Pacifism to Patriotism: The Emergence of Civil Religion in the Churches of Christ During World War I." ''[[Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'' 66#3 (1992): 376–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pledge of Allegiance===
Kao and Copulsky argue the concept of civil religion illuminates the popular constitutional debate over the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. The function of the pledge has aspects: preservationist, pluralist, priestly, and prophetic. The debate is not between those who believe in God and those who do not, but it is a dispute on the meaning and place of civil religion in America.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Y. Kao and Jerome E. Copulsky, "The Pledge of Allegiance and the Meanings and Limits of Civil Religion," ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]],'' March 2007, 75#1, pp. 121–49 {{doi|10.1093/jaarel/lfl065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloud explores political oaths since 1787 and traces the tension between a need for national unity and a desire to affirm religious faith. He reviews major [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions involving the Pledge of Allegiance, including the contradictory ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'' (1940) and ''[[West Virginia v. Barnette]]'' (1943) decisions. He argues that the Pledge was changed in 1954 during the Cold War to encourage school children to reject communism's atheistic philosophy by affirming belief in God.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew W. Cloud, "'One Nation, Under God': Tolerable Acknowledgement of Religion or Unconstitutional Cold War Propaganda Cloaked in American Civil Religion?" ''[[Journal of Church and State]],'' Spring 2004, 46#2 pp. 311–40, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jchs46&amp;div=27&amp;id=&amp;page= online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===School rituals===
[[Adam Gamoran]] (1990) argues that civil religion in public schools can be seen in such daily rituals as the pledge of allegiance; in holiday observances, with activities such as music and art; and in the social studies, history and English curricula. Civil religion in schools plays a dual role: it socializes youth to a common set of understandings, but it also sets off subgroups of Americans whose backgrounds or beliefs prevent them from participating fully in civil religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Gamoran, "Civil Religion in American Schools," ''SA: Sociological Analysis,'' Fall 1990, 51#3 pp. 235–56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic minorities===
The Bellah argument deals with mainstream beliefs, but other scholars have looked at minorities outside the mainstream, and typically distrusted or disparaged by the mainstream, which have developed their own version of U.S. civil religion.

====White Southerners====
Wilson, noting the historic centrality of religion in [[Southern United States|Southern]] identity, argues that when the [[White Southerners|White South]] was outside the national mainstream in the late 19th century, it created its own pervasive common civil religion heavy with mythology, ritual, and organization. Wilson says the "[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]"—that is, defeat in a holy war—has left some southerners to face guilt, doubt, and the triumph of what they perceive as evil: in other words, to form a tragic sense of life.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Reagan Wilson, "The Religion of the Lost Cause: Ritual and the Organization of the Southern Civil Religion, 1865–1920," ''Journal of Southern History,'' May 1980, 46#2 pp. 219–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Reagan Wilson, ''Baptized in Blood: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865–1920'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Black and African Americans====
Woodrum and Bell argue that [[African Americans|black people]] demonstrate less civil religiosity than [[White Americans|white people]] and that different predictors of civil religion operate among black and white people. For example, conventional religion positively influences white people's civil religion but negatively influences black peoples' civil religion. Woodrum and Bell interpret these results as a product of black American religious ethnogenesis and separatism.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Woodrum, and Arnold Bell, "Race, Politics, and Religion in Civil Religion Among Blacks," ''SA: Sociological Analysis,'' Winter 1989, 49#4 pp. 353–67&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese Americans====
Iwamura argues that the pilgrimages made by [[Japanese Americans]] to the sites of World War II-era [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] have formed a Japanese American version of civil religion. Starting in 1969 the Reverend Sentoku Maeda and Reverend Soichi Wakahiro began pilgrimages to [[Manzanar|Manzanar National Historic Site]] in California. These pilgrimages included poetry readings, music, cultural events, a roll call of former internees, and a nondenominational ceremony with Protestant and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ministers and Catholic and [[Shinto]] priests. The event is designed to reinforce Japanese American cultural ties and to ensure that such injustices will never occur again.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Naomi Iwamura, "Critical Faith: Japanese Americans and the Birth of a New Civil Religion," ''[[American Quarterly]],'' Sept 2007, 59#3, pp. 937–968, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/aq/summary/v059/59.3iwamura.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hispanic and Latino Americans====
[[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] labor leader [[César Chávez]], by virtue of having holidays, stamps, and other commemorations of his actions, has practically become a "saint" in American civil religion, according to León. He was raised in the Catholic tradition and using Catholic rhetoric. His "sacred acts," his political practices couched in Christian teachings, became influential to the burgeoning Chicano movement and strengthened his appeal. By acting on his moral convictions through nonviolent means, Chávez became sanctified in the national consciousness, says León.&lt;ref&gt;Luis D. León, "Cesar Chavez in American Religious Politics: Mapping the New Global Spiritual Line." ''[[American Quarterly]],'' Sep 2007, 59#3 pp. 857–81, {{doi|10.1353/aq.2007.0060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enshrined texts==
[[File:Archives of the United States of America 1.jpg|thumb|The [[National Archives Building]] in [[Washington, DC]].]]

Christian language, rhetoric, and values helped colonists to perceive their political system as superior to the corrupt British monarchy. Ministers' sermons were instrumental in promoting patriotism and in motivating the colonists to take action against the evils and corruption of the British government. Together with the semi-religious tone sometimes adopted by preachers and such leaders as George Washington,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Scott Smith, "The American Moses," ''Christian History and Biography,'' Summer 2008, Issue 99, pp. 8–13&lt;/ref&gt; and the notion that God favored the patriot cause, this made the documents of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] suitable as almost-sacred texts.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kidd, ''God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution'' (2010) pp. 4, 37, 59, 112, 115,&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Archives Building]] in Washington preserves and displays the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. [[Pauline Maier]] describes these texts as enshrined in massive, bronze-framed display cases.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Gordon S. Wood, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/aug/14/dusting-off-the-declaration/ "Dusting off the Declaration]," ''The New York Review of Books,'' Aug 14, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; While political scientists, sociologists, and legal scholars study the Constitution and how it is used in American society, on the other hand, historians are concerned with putting themselves back into a time and place, in context. It would be anachronistic for them to look at the documents of the "Charters of Freedom" and see America's modern "civic religion" because of "how much Americans have transformed very secular and temporal documents into sacred scriptures".&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; The whole business of erecting a shrine for the worship of the Declaration of Independence strikes some academic critics looking from point of view of the 1776 or 1789 America as "idolatrous, and also curiously at odds with the values of the Revolution." It was suspicious of religious iconographic practices. At the beginning, in 1776, it was not meant to be that at all.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Gordon S., op.cit., Aug 14, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 1782 [[Great Seal of the United States]], the date of the Declaration of Independence and the words under it signify the beginning of the "new American Era" on earth. Though the inscription, ''Novus ordo seclorum'', does not translate from the Latin as "secular", it also does not refer to a new order of heaven. It is a reference to generations of society in the western hemisphere, the millions of generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatseal.com/mottoes/seclorum.html Great Seal] webpage. Viewed August 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even from the vantage point of a new nation only ten to twenty years after the drafting of the Constitution, the Framers themselves differed in their assessments of its significance. Washington in his Farewell Address pleaded that "the Constitution be sacredly maintained."' He echoed Madison in "[[Federalist No. 49]]", that citizen "veneration" of the Constitution might generate the intellectual stability needed to maintain even the "wisest and freest governments" amidst conflicting loyalties. But there is also a rich tradition of dissent from "Constitution worship". By 1816, Jefferson could write that "some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the [[ark of the covenant]], too sacred to be touched." But he saw imperfections and imagined that potentially, there could be others, believing as he did that "institutions must advance also".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=115}}

Regarding the [[United States Constitution]], the position of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is that it is a [[divinely inspired]] document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/ensign/1992/02/the-divinely-inspired-constitution?lang=eng |title=The Divinely Inspired Constitution |author=Dallin H. Oaks |date=Feb 1992 |publisher=''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.77-80#p76 D&amp;C 101:77–80]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventh-Day Adventists===
While the civil religion has been widely accepted by practically all denominations, one group has always stood against it. [[Seventh-day Adventism|Seventh-Day Adventists]] deliberately pose as "heretics", so to speak, and refuse to perform in the sacred ceremonies like the Pledge of Allegiance or saluting the flag or treating Sundays as special. Indeed, says Bull, the denomination has defined its identity in contradistinction to precisely those elements of the host culture that have constituted civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Bull, "The Seventh-Day Adventists: Heretics of American Civil Religion'' ''Sociological Analysis,'' April 1989, 50#2, pp. 177–87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Making a nation==
The American identity has an ideological connection to these "Charters of Freedom". [[Samuel P. Huntington]] discusses common connections for most peoples in nation-states, a national identity as product of common ethnicity, ancestry and experience, common language, culture and religion. Levinson argues:

{{quote|It is the fate of the United States, however, to be different from "most peoples," for here national identity is based not on shared Proustian remembrances, but rather on the willed affirmation of what Huntington refers to as the "American creed," a set of overt political commitments that includes an emphasis on individual rights, majority rule, and a constitutional order limiting governmental power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sanford Levinson|title=Constitutional Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VhWFCJ4sQa8C&amp;pg=PA95|year=2011|publisher=Princeton UP|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The creed, according to Huntington,  is made up of (a) individual rights, (b) majority rule, and (c) a constitutional order of limited government power. American independence from Britain was not based on cultural difference, but on the adoption of principles found in the Declaration. Whittle Johnson in ''[[The Yale Review]]'' sees a sort of "covenanting community" of freedom under law, which, "transcending the 'natural' bonds of race, religion and class, itself takes on transcendent importance".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=118}}

Becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States requires passing a test covering a basic understanding of the Declaration, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, and taking an oath to support the U.S. Constitution. [[Hans Kohn]] described the United States Constitution as "unlike any other: it represents the lifeblood of the American nation, its supreme symbol and manifestation. It is so intimately welded with the national existence itself that the two have become inseparable." Indeed, abolishing the Constitution in Huntington's view would abolish the United States, it would "destroy the basis of community, eliminating the nation, [effecting] ... a return to nature."{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=119}}

As if to emphasize the lack of any alternative "faith" to the American nation, Thomas Grey in his article "The Constitution as scripture", contrasted those traditional societies with divinely appointed rulers enjoying heavenly mandates for social cohesion with that of the United States. He pointed out that Article VI, third clause, requires all political figures, both federal and state, "be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution, but no religious test shall ever be required ..." This was a major break not only with past British practice commingling authority of state and religion, but also with that of most American states when the Constitution was written.{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=120}}

'''Escape clause.''' Whatever the oversights and evils the modern reader may see in the original Constitution, the Declaration that "all men are created equal"—in their rights—informed the Constitution in such a way that [[Frederick Douglass]] in 1860 could label the Constitution, if properly understood, as an antislavery document.&lt;ref name="slavenorth1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Harper |first=Douglas |url=http://www.slavenorth.com/massemancip.htm |title=Emancipation in Massachusetts |work=Slavery in the North |date=January 2004 |accessdate=January 28, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040128112051/http://www.slavenorth.com/massemancip.htm |archivedate=January 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that "the constitutionality of slavery can be made out only by disregarding the plain and common-sense reading to the Constitution itself. [T]he Constitution will afford slavery no protection when it shall cease to be administered by slaveholders," a reference to the Supreme Court majority at the time.&lt;!-- ref name=autogenerated6 --&gt;{{sfn|Levinson|1987|pp=129–30, 133}} With a change of that majority, there was American precedent for judicial activism in Constitutional interpretation, including the Massachusetts Supreme Court, which had ended slavery there in 1783.&lt;ref name="slavenorth1"/&gt;

Accumulations of Amendments under Article V of the Constitution and judicial review of Congressional and state law have fundamentally altered the relationship between U.S. citizens and their governments. Some scholars refer to the coming of a "second Constitution" with the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], we are all free, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]], we are all citizens, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]], men vote, and the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth]], women vote. The Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted so as to require States to respect citizen rights in the same way that the Constitution has required the Federal government to respect them. So much so, that in 1972, the U.S. Representative from Texas, [[Barbara Jordan]], could affirm, "My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total ...".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|pp=129–30, 133}}

After discussion of the [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] provision for change in the Constitution as a political stimulus to serious national consensus building, [[Sanford Levinson]] performed a thought experiment which was suggested at the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution in Philadelphia. If one were to sign the Constitution today,&lt;ref&gt;The visitor to the National Archives website today is invited to sign the Constitution online. Viewed September 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; whatever our reservations might be, knowing what we do now, and transported back in time to its original shortcomings, great and small, "signing the Constitution commits one not to closure but only to a process of becoming, and to taking responsibility for the political vision toward which I, joined I hope, with others, strive."{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=144}}

Anegundi, believed to be the ''monkey kingdom'' of [[Kishkindha]] (''Kishkinta'' means in local language ''a forest where the monkeys lived'') in the epic of [[Ramayana]], is at a distance of 5&amp;nbsp;km from the historical site of Hampi. Anjanadri hill, the birthplace of monkey-god [[Hanuman]], and the mountain Rishimuka are the other places near Anegundi associated with Ramayana. It is said to have one of the oldest plateaus on the planet, estimated to be 3,000 million years old. So, only local story-tellers refer to Anegundi as the maternal home of Bhoodevi (Mother Earth).

The village, located on the northern side bank of River Tungabhadra, was said to be the legendary Kishkindha, a kingdom of the monkey Prince Sugriva and the cradle place of the historic Krishnadevaraya dynasty of the glorious Vijayanagar empire and falls in the core zone of Hampi.

Several Neolithic dwellings still bear paintings that are clear and intact even to this day at 'Onke Kindi'. This is the rare human settlement where we will find traces of Microlithic, Megalithic and Neolithic age of human life at one same spot. Anegundi area is older than the Vijayanagar empire, and as is old as the planet. As per geologists the Anegundi area is about four billion years old. Till date, this village is a living heritage site in its true sense. The nearest Pre-historic sites are [[Hirebenkal|HireBenekal]], Chikkarampur, Mallapur, Venkatapur and Anjanahalli.
''Pre-historic rock shelters and paintings'' are found in [[Tungabhadra river]] valley.

Anegundi was ruled by various dynasties like [[Shatavahana]]s, [[Kadambas]], [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Vijayanagara Empire]] and [[Bahamani]]s. Now this place is well-known tourism place.

===Vijayanagara period===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first capital of [[Vijayanagar Empire]] and capital of several other dynasties. In 1334, Deva Raya the Chief Minister of Anegundi became ruler of Anegundi. When [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultans]] invaded [[Warangal]], ''Harihara and Bukka'' escaped and came to Anegundi, later founded the [[Vijayanagar Empire]] at [[Hampi]]. The Tallarighatta gate(Talwar Ghatta) (erstwhile toll gate) is the entrance to Anegundi from Hampi side, the collapsed modern day bridge under construction between Hampi and Anegundi across the [[Tungabhadra river]]. Crossing the river in a coracle (boat) which is circular basket shaped made of cane, bamboo and wrapped in a plastic sheet. "Coracle was used to ferry people in the Vijayanagar time also", it is mentioned by ''Dominoes Paes'' the Portuguese traveller in the 16th century, there is mention of carrying "about twenty persons and horses and oxen to cross the river."

During 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Anegundi was ruled by Bijapur Sultans, Moghuls, Marathas and Tipu Sultan. According to ''1824 treaty with the British and Hyderabad Nizam'', the king of Vijayanagar who was ruled from Hampi lost his kingdom, provided a monthly pension of Rs 300, forced to leave Hampi and make Anegundi as official residence, ''Rani Lalkumari Bai'' last descendant who received monthly pension.

===Rural tourism scheme===
Realising that to appreciate and be involved in conserving ancient lineage and historic surroundings, the villagers of Anegundi must be self-sufficient with sustainable economic support, the Union government under its ''rural tourism'' scheme, formed a trust named Kishkindha to build capacity in the villagers to maintain business incubators.{{original research inline|date=April 2017}}

The main activities taken up engaging the locals, were improving the village surroundings through landscaping, developing parks and gardens, putting up fences and constructing compound walls, laying roads within the panchayat limits, fixing street lights, managing solid waste and sewerage, procuring equipment required for water sports and adventure sports, introducing eco-friendly modes of transport for moving within the tourism zone and setting up reception centres.

To meet contemporary needs of tourists, traditional houses in the village were converted into guest houses without disturbing their ancient looks. The villagers are earning a handsome amount by renting out these houses to the tourists.

They have also set up a craft shop offering a range of items made locally using banana fibre, an Internet cafe to help visitors keep in touch with the outer world and a restaurant to treat their taste buds. Local art forms have also been revived to entertain the visitors.

'''Bordels Mobiles de Campagne''' or '''Bordel Militaire de Campagne''' (both abbreviated to '''BMC''') is a [[French language|French]] term for the mobile [[brothel]]s which were used during [[World War I]], [[Second World War]], and [[First Indochina War]] to supply [[prostitution]] services to [[France|French]] [[soldier]]s who were facing combat in areas where brothels were unusual, such as at the [[front line]] or in isolated [[garrison]]s.&lt;ref&gt;World Association of International Studies [http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612081843/http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 |date=2007-06-12 }}, retrieved on March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tlv"&gt;''The Last Valley'' [[Martin Windrow]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The BMCs gradually generated regulation of prostitution within the French army.

These mobile brothels were in some cases officially organized by the army. They consisted of large trailer trucks in which up to ten women would work.&lt;ref name="iesv"&gt;''The International Encyclopaedia of Sexuality: Vietnam'', retrieved on March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The first references to these BMC's were in World War I, and they are noted particularly in the Indochina War and the [[Algerian War]]. 

Almost absent in France after World War II, there were many during the Indochina War and the war in Algeria. Subsequently, only the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] still used them. The BMC in [[Djibouti]] was still operating until 2003.&lt;ref name="canard"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= 24 September 2003 |title= C'est le bordel à Djibouti  |trans-title= This is the brothel in Djibouti |url= |language=French |work= [[Le Canard enchaîné]] |location= |access-date= |ISSN=0008-5405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kedor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kedor|first1=Roman|title=Todeskampf im tropischen Regenwald|date=2016|publisher=Books on Demand|isbn=9783739235547|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbp6CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT19&amp;lpg=PT19&amp;dq=last+bordel+militaire+de+campagne+Djibouti#v=onepage&amp;q=last%20bordel%20militaire%20de%20campagne%20Djibouti&amp;f=false|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

==History==
The tradition of bringing "brothels to soldiers" was started during the [[Third Crusade]] by [[Philip II of France]]. He was so shocked by the extent of sodomy and rapes committed by the Crusaders, he arranged for a full boat of "girls of joy" to be sent from France.&lt;ref name="reynaert"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reynaert|first1=François|title=Dans les bordels de l'armée française|url=https://bibliobs.nouvelobs.com/essais/20140424.OBS5078/dans-les-bordels-de-l-armee-francaise.html|website=Bibliobs|accessdate=15 April 2018|language=fr-FR|date=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first BMCs probably appeared during the period of military control of Algeria (1830-1870), following its conquest by the French army.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; The BMCs remained confined to the army in Africa until the [[First World War]]. BMCs then arrived in France with the arrival of indigenous units from the colonies. The military command not wanting indigenous soldiers to have sex with local women,&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; but especially to try to limit the infection of the troops by [[venereal diseases]], especially [[syphilis]] which was hardly curable at the time. ([[Penicillin]] was only available from 1944). Despite this, four years of war saw the infection of 400,000 men.&lt;ref name="benoit"&gt;{{cite interview |last= Benoit |first= Lieutenant-Colonel Christian  |subjectlink= |interviewer= |title=L'armée a fermé son dernier bordel en 1995 |trans-title= The army closed its last brothel in 1995 |work= |publisher=Guerres &amp; Histoire |location= |date=13 June 2013|language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, no official designation is given to the BMCs. The acronym first appeared in the 1920s with the regulation of signs in the French army, and from then BMCs are mentioned in military documents.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;

Military officials actively provided prostitutes for their troops.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; The "association des maitres et maitresses d'hôtels meublés de France et des colonies" plays an almost official coordinating role. It was governed by a law of 1 July 1901, and located at 73 rue de Nazareth, [[Paris]]. The prostitutes were volunteers.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Bordel militaire de campagne ferma en 1995|url=http://www.journalducanada.com/le-bordel-militaire-de-campagne-ferma-en-1995-2424-2014/|website=Journal Du Canada|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=fr-FR|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military brothels multiplied during the interwar period,&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; almost every town has a garrison or a regiment with a BMC.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; During the colonial wars, the organisation and attendance of BMC was public knowledge and encouraged by the army, especially in [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]] ("the candy box").&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;  In France brothels were prohibited by "Loi Marthe Richard" in 1946. However, in 1947, the Ministry of the Armed Forces authorised the maintenance of BMC for North African units while stationed in Metropolitan France,&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; the prostitutes for these BMCa coming from Algeria.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;

BMCs, were generally mobile and temporary and should be distinguished from "reserved areas" close to permanent garrisons, such as [[Bousbir|Bousbir de Casablanca]].

French literature has several times mentioned the "Buffalo Park", a BMC in [[Saigon]]. In the Indochina War, the French used women from the [[Ouled Naïl]] tribe of the highlands of [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard B. Fall]], ''[[Street Without Joy#The book|Street Without Joy]]: The French Debacle in Indochina'', Pen &amp; Sword, 1961, p.133, {{ISBN|978-0811732369}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMC's were known to have a significant role in the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s&lt;ref name="iesv"/&gt; and were an avenue of attack by female [[Viet Minh]] sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;''Vietnam, a war lost and won'', Nigel Cawthorne&lt;/ref&gt; There was a vast BMC in [[Saigon]] known as "the park of the buffaloes", and in January 1954, a BMC containing [[Vietnam]]ese and Algerian prostitutes&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;IHT [http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/04/01/edpringle_ed3_.php article], retrieved on March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; was flown to [[Dien Bien Phu]].&lt;ref name="tlv"/&gt; Here, the prostitutes became [[nursing assistant]]s for the French garrison during the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|siege]],&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; though they were sent for reeducation by the Viet Minh after the French garrison fell.&lt;ref name="iht"/&gt;

==Closure==
The last BMC in France, that of the Foreign Legion [[2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment]] in [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]], [[Corsica]] was closed in 1978.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; The last BMC in [[French territory]], that of the Legion in [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]] closed in 1995&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="france24"&gt;{{cite web|title=France's military brothels: Hidden history of the First World War - France 24|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20141212-france-military-brothels-hidden-history-first-world-war-prostitution|website=France 24|accessdate=27 December 2017|date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kedor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;  (following a complaint by a [[Brazil]]ian [[pimp]] for unfair competition).&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trouillard|first1=Stéphanie|title=Prostituées et soldats, le couple indissociable de la Grande Guerre|url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20141213-sexe-prostitution-xxx-grande-guerre-bordel-militaire-poilus-soldat-putain-bmc-proxenete-syphilis|website=France 24|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=fr-FR|date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the French territories, the Foreign Legion still had a BMC in the Republic of Djibouti in 2003.&lt;ref name="canard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kedor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

==In film==
* In the film ''RAS'' (1973), directed by [[Yves Boisset]], about the war in Algeria, a sequence shows the arrival of a BMC and its use by the soldiers.
* Stéphane Benhamou's 2013 documentary film, ''Putains de guerre'', contains many sequences and testimonials on BMC, especially in Indochina.

'''Cantlop Bridge''' is a single span cast-iron road bridge over the [[Cound Brook]], located to the north of [[Cantlop]] in the parish of [[Berrington, Shropshire|Berrington]], [[Shropshire]]. It was constructed in 1818 to a design possibly by [[Thomas Telford]], having at least been approved by him,&lt;ref name=EH &gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/cantlop-bridge/ |title=English heritage Website: Cantlop Bridge |accessdate=29 August 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced an unsuccessful cast iron coach bridge constructed in 1812.&lt;ref name=EHD /&gt; The design of the bridge was innovative for the period, using a light-weight design of cast-iron lattice ribs to support the road deck in a single span, and appears to be a scaled-down version of a Thomas Telford bridge at [[Meole Brace]], Shropshire. The bridge is the only surviving Telford-approved cast-iron bridge in Shropshire,&lt;ref name=EH /&gt; and is a Grade II* listed building and scheduled monument. It originally carried the [[turnpike road]] from Shrewsbury to [[Acton Burnell]].

==History and Description==
Thomas Telford worked as the County Surveyor of Shropshire between 1787 to 1834, and the bridge is reported to have once held a cast iron plate above the centre of the arch inscribed with ''"Thomas Telford Esqr - Engineer - 1818"'', which is apparently visible in historic photographs, but has not been in place since at least 1985.&lt;ref name=EHD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=70128&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=cantlop&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10 |title=English Heritage Pastscape website |accessdate=29 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009014139/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=70128&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=cantlop&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10 |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge design incorporates dressed red and grey sandstone [[abutment]]s with [[ashlar]] dressings, these are slightly curved and ramped, with chamfered ashlar quoins, string courses, and moulded cornices.&lt;ref name=EHD /&gt; The structural cast-iron consists of a single segmental span with four arched lattice ribs, braced by five transverse cast-ironmembers. The road deck is formed from cast-iron metal deck plates, tarmacked over, and now finished with gravel. The original parapets have at some point been replaced with painted cast-iron railings with dograils, dogbars and shaped end balusters.&lt;ref name=EHD /&gt;

===Present-day===
The bridge today remains as a monument only, being closed to vehicular traffic. It was bypassed by a more modern adjacent concrete bridge built in the 1970s. It is in the care of [[English Heritage]] and is freely accessible to pedestrians. A layby exists for visitors to park and there is an information board.

A '''capital improvement plan''' ('''CIP'''), or '''capital improvement program''', is a short-range plan, usually four to ten years, which identifies capital projects and equipment purchases, provides a planning schedule and identifies options for financing the plan. Essentially, the plan provides a link between a
[[municipality]], [[school district]], [[municipal parks|parks and recreation department]] and/or other local government entity and a comprehensive and [[strategic plan]] and the entity's annual [[budget]].

==Benefits==
A CIP provides many benefits including: 
* Allows for a systematic evaluation of all potential projects at the same time. 
* The ability to stabilize debt and consolidate projects to reduce borrowing costs. 
* Serve as a public relations and economic development tool. 
* A focus on preserving a governmental entity's [[infrastructure]] while ensuring the efficient use of [[public funds]]. 
* An opportunity to foster cooperation among departments and an ability to inform other units of government of the entity's priorities. For example, it is not uncommon for a large city or county to incorporate into its CIP the capital needs of a school district, parks and recreation department and/or some other public service structure.

==Features==
The CIP typically includes the following information:

* A listing of the capital projects or equipment to be purchased
* The projects ranked in order of preference
* The plan for financing the projects
* A timetable for the construction or completion of the project
* Justification for the project
* Explanation of expenses for the project

==Overall process==
Prior to undertaking the development of the CIP, the government entity will want to define the criteria for what kind of projects or equipment are to be included and organize a process for developing the plan. What is defined as a capital project or capital purchase may vary from city to county to district to state depending on the size of the local government provisioning the plan. Generally, they will be tangible items that have a life expectancy greater than one year.

A local government will also need to forecast where it believes it will face future demands and growth, which will involve an inventory of existing facilities, infrastructure and equipment. In addition, a local government will want to develop basic policies for implementing the plan. Because the CIP includes financing issues, the municipality may want to seek advice from their financial advisor and/or bond counsel. A review of the municipality's current finances is also vital.

Once the CIP is finalized, the local government may be required to hold a [[town meeting|public hearing]] before the plan is adopted by a [[city council]], a board of regents and/or a bond review commission.

==Specific steps==
# Establish a capital planning committee with bylaws
# Take inventory of existing capital assets
# Evaluate previously approved, unimplemented or incomplete projects
# Assess financial capacity
# Solicit, compile and evaluate new project requests
# Prioritize projects
# Develop a financing plan
# Adopt a capital improvement program
# Monitor and manage approved projects within the CIP
# Update existing/ongoing capital programs

[[File:Glassy carbon and a 1cm3 graphite cube HP68-79.jpg|thumbnail|A large sample of [[glassy carbon]], and a nearby 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[graphite]] cube.]]

'''Carbon chauvinism''' is a [[neologism]] meant to disparage the assumption that the chemical processes of hypothetical [[extraterrestrial life]] must be constructed primarily from [[carbon]] ([[organic compound]]s) because carbon's chemical and [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties render it far superior to all other elements.&lt;ref name = darling /&gt;

==Concept==
The term was used as early as 1973, when scientist [[Carl Sagan]] described it and other human [[chauvinism]]s that limit imagination of possible extraterrestrial life. It suggests that [[human being]]s, as carbon-based life forms who have never encountered any life that has evolved outside the Earth’s environment, may find it difficult to envision [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|radically different biochemistries]].&lt;ref name = sagan /&gt;

In a 1999 ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine article discussing the theory of a [[fine-tuned universe]], Kenneth Silber quotes [[astrophysicist]] [[Victor J. Stenger]] using the term:&lt;ref name = kenneth /&gt;
{{quote|There is no good reason, says Stenger, to "assume that there's only one kind of life possible" – we know far too little about life in our own universe, let alone "other" universes, to reach such a conclusion. Stenger denounces as "carbon chauvinism" the assumption that life requires carbon; other chemical elements, such as silicon, can also form molecules of considerable complexity. Indeed, Stenger ventures, it is "molecular chauvinism" to assume that molecules are required at all; in a universe with different properties, atomic nuclei or other structures might assemble in totally unfamiliar ways.|Victor J. Stenger|''Reason'', July 1999}}

==Carbon alternatives==
[[File:Silicon-unit-cell-3D-balls.png|thumbnail|Silicon in a diamond cubic crystal structure]]
Like carbon, [[silicon]] can form four stable bonds with itself and other elements, and long chemical chains known as [[silane]] polymers, which are very similar to the [[hydrocarbon]]s essential to life on Earth.  Silicon is more reactive than carbon, which could make it optimal for extremely cold environments.&lt;ref name=silanes&gt;{{cite news | title = Target: Titan &amp; Silicon-based life | date = 18 March 2010 | url = http://astrowright.wordpress.com/2010/03/18/target-titan/ | work = Astrowright | accessdate = 5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, silanes spontaneously burn in the presence of oxygen at relatively low temperatures, so an oxygen atmosphere may be deadly to silicon-based life. On the other hand, it is worth considering that [[alkanes]] are as a rule quite flammable, but carbon-based life on Earth does not store energy directly as alkanes, but as sugars, lipids, alcohols, and other hydrocarbon compounds with very different properties. Water as a solvent would also react with silanes, but again, this only matters if for some reason silanes are used or mass-produced by said organisms.

Hydrocarbons and organic compounds are abundant in meteorites, comets, and interstellar clouds, while their silicon analogs have never been observed in nature. Silicon does, however, form complex one-, two- and three-dimensional polymers in which oxygen atoms form bridges between silicon atoms. These are termed [[silicates]]. They are both stable and abundant under terrestrial conditions, and have been proposed as a basis for a pre-organic form of evolution on Earth (see [[Graham Cairns-Smith#Clay hypothesis|clay hypothesis]]).

The '''[http://ridl.cfd.rit.edu/ Center for Detectors (CfD)]''' is a [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] College of Science academic research center. The CfD was founded in 2010 by [[Donald Figer|Dr. Donald Figer.]] Located in the [http://www.rit.edu/research/itc/ IT Collaboratory at RIT], the CfD designs, develops, and implements new advanced sensor technologies through collaboration with academic researchers, industry engineers, government scientists, and university students. The mission of the CfD is to enable scientific discovery, national security, better living, and commercial innovation through the design and development of advanced photon detectors and associated technology in a broad array of applications (e.g. [[astrophysics]], biomedical imaging, [[Earth system science]], and [[Interplanetary spaceflight|inter-planetary travel]]).

== Research ==
[[File:M13Final merged small CfD.jpg|left|thumb|Color image of M13, the Great Cluster in [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], taken by CfD personnel using the Teledyne Hawaii 4RG SiPIN detector (HyViSI). This was the first demonstration of this device in an astronomical application.]]
The CfD uses a multi-disciplinary approach, spanning the many branches of engineering, imaging science, physics and astronomy. Some projects, such as the “Cosmic Ray Damaged Image Repair” project, incorporate astronomy and imaging science. Others, like the NASA-funded Phase II: New Infrared Detectors for Astrophysics project, unite microelectronic engineers, astronomy experts, imaging scientists, and various other professionals in science fields. The Center for Detectors benefits from employees that come from a diverse range of academic programs and professional occupations. The CfD staff includes professors, engineers, and students (undergraduate, masters, and PhD). Many student researchers apply CfD research to their current academic programs at RIT. Students pursue various degrees such as [[Microelectronics|Microelectronic]], [[Computer engineering|Computer]], and [[Electronic Engineering|Electrical Engineering]]. Many undergraduate student researchers choose to pursue master's degrees based on the research that they conduct at CfD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rit.edu/research/srs/news/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=450:center-for-detectors&amp;catid=142:labs-equipment-and-services&amp;Itemid=229/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rit.edu/news/athenaeum_story.php?id=48266&lt;/ref&gt;

CfD is [[Grant (money)|grant-funded]] and has been awarded more than $16M in external funding since 2006. Primary sponsors include [[NASA]], [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]]. Additional sources of funding include [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory]],  [[Exelis Inc.|ITT Excelis]], and [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]].

==Outreach and Communications==
Education supplements to two of the CfD grants have funded projects involving students from local high schools. Students mapped the “Journey of a Photon,” and presented their work at venues nationwide. A second group of high school students used an RIT-developed 3D projection system dubbed the “Planeterrainium” to explore planetary surfaces in 3D.

The Center has been featured at several conferences and in press venues. CfD researcher Kim Kolb presented her MS thesis at the [http://spie.org/op SPIE Optics and Photonics Conferences]. The [http://www.rbj.net Rochester Business Journal] and [http://www.rit.edu/news/ RIT University News] have published articles summarizing the foundations of the Center for Detectors to the public, and informing the RIT community about the purpose of the facilities.

CfD has hosted a variety of distinguished speakers as well. Some presenters include Dr. Donald Hall of the [[University of Hawaii]], Dr. Chris Packham of the [[University of Florida]], Dr. Joss Bland-Hawthorn of the [[University of Sydney]], [[Bruce J. Tromberg|Bruce Tromberg]], of the University of California, Irvine, and Dr. Shouleh Nikzad, Dr. Michael Hoenk, and [[Bedabrata Pain]] of the [[California Institute of Technology|California Institute of Technology’s]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].

==Equipment and Facilities==
[[File:RIT CfD Dewar System.JPG|right|thumb|The Center's detector testing system uses custom-built cylindrical vacuum cryogenic dewars.]] The Center has four research labs: the [http://ridle.cis.rit.edu Rochester Imaging Detector Laboratory]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, the [[Quantum Dot]] Detector Laboratory, the [[Cleanroom|Clean Room]] Probe Testing Laboratory, and the [[LIDAR]] Laboratory. Three test systems were designed at the CfD, which are essential to the lab’s detector-testing capabilities.

'''Civil Aerospace Medical Institute''' ('''CAMI''') is the medical certification, education, research, and occupational medicine wing of the Office of Aerospace Medicine (AAM) under the auspices of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] Office of Aviation Safety.  The Institute’s primary goal is to enhance aviation safety.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/cami/  The Civil Aerospace Medical Institute on the FAA Web site, retrieved October 22, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="two"&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/cami/media/CAMIBrochure.pdf Brochure: The Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (11/2009).]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
America’s first successful flight was in 1903, but amazingly, five years would pass before the first fatal aviation accident. Since then, safety has been an important concern. In 1926, the Civil Aeronautics Act marshaled the talents of the medical profession to certify that all aviators are physically fit to fly. In August 1958, the Federal Aviation Act, which created an independent federal agency, was passed.  As part of the organizational changes that followed the FAA Act of 1958, an Office of the Civil Air Surgeon was established. On 31 October 1959 plans were announced to create the Civil Aeromedical Research Institute (CARI) which was established in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Air Progress|date=August 1989|page=66|author=Nick Komons}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new CARI building was opened at the Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City.

In 1965 the Institute’s organizational scope and structure were enlarged and CARI was renamed the Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI).  The organizational changes designated all research laboratories as an aeromedical research branch along with aeromedical certification, aeromedical education, and a medical clinic branch.  The Institute’s people— scientists, engineers, physicians, medical specialists, educators, pilots, technicians, communicators, and others&amp;nbsp;— all merged as a team.  In 2001, CAMI was expanded to incorporate commercial space transportation, and its name was changed to the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/library/reports/medical/oamtechreports/2000s/media/1000_composite.pdf Aeromedical Research in Civil Aviation, DOT/FAA/AM-05/3 (3/2005).]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal concern at CAMI is the human element in flight—pilots, passengers, air traffic controllers, and the entire human support system that embraces civil aviation. Researchers study the factors that influence human performance in the aerospace environment, find ways to understand them, and communicate that understanding to the aviation community.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;
[[File:Very Light Jet Simulator.jpg|thumb|''Very Light Jet Simulator'']]

Over 280 scientists, physicians, educators, pilots, technicians, and administrative personnel work at CAMI, which is located at the [[Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center]] (MMAC) in [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma, at the corner of Southwest 66th Street and MacArthur Boulevard. On static display in front of the CAMI building is a [[LearAvia Lear Fan|Lear Fan]], one of only three ever produced.
[[File:The Civil Aerospace Medical Institute.jpg|thumb|alt= The CAMI Building in Oklahoma City.| ''The Civil Aerospace Medical Institute building, showing the prior static display aircraft a Lancair Tigress with Orenda V8 [[Lancair Tigress]]'']]
CAMI is organized into five divisions:

==Aerospace Medical Certification==
Develops, recommends, administers, and evaluates standards and procedures for all FAA airmen medical certification activities and associated recordkeeping systems. By federal law, all aviators must be medically certified.  Airman medical certificates are issued by the division on the basis of physical examinations performed by Aviation Medical Examiners (AMEs); approximately 3,500 physicians who are authorized to conduct aviation medical examinations of civil airmen throughout the United States and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/medical_certification/faq/response11/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Division manages a national repository of airmen medical records and a system for processing such records; it administers review systems for the professional evaluation and disposition of applications for medical certification; and makes recommendations to the Federal Air Surgeon on the disposition of requests for special issuance certification.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="four"&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/AM%201100.3H.pdf Aerospace Medicine Organization, FAA Order 1100.3H (9/15/2010).]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator (AGARS).jpg|thumb|Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator (AGARS)]]

==Aerospace Medical Education==
Plans and develops standard criteria and administers a centralized program for the selection, designation, training, and management of AMEs. CAMI education personnel also operate and maintain CAMI’s altitude chambers, thermal chamber, spatial disorientation trainers, emergency ditching simulators, and other facilities. These facilities are used in support of physiological and global survival training programs as well as research projects. They also plan, develop, and conduct nationwide training activities to disseminate aerospace medical information and scientific data to FAA personnel, AMEs, airmen, aviation industry, aviation organizations, and the general public in support of the agency’s mission of promoting aviation safety.  The division also manages and maintains the CAMI ''Aerospace Medical Library'' and supports international exchange programs that facilitate interaction between aerospace medicine professionals, enable the exchange of scientific information, and promote the FAA’s goal of international leadership in aerospace medicine.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;

[[File:Aircraft Environmental Research Facility.jpg|thumb|''Aircraft Environmental Research Facility'']]

==Aerospace Human Factors Research==
Conducts an integrated program of field and laboratory research in human factors aspects of aviation work environments. Research includes assessments of human performance under various conditions of impairment, human error analysis and remediation, agency work force optimization, assessing the impact of advanced automated systems on personnel requirements and performance, human factors evaluations of performance changes associated with advanced multifunction displays and controls in general aviation and air traffic control, and the psychophysiological effects of workload and shift work on job proficiency and safety in aviation-related human-machine systems. This research is accomplished within two laboratories in support of the FAA [[Air Traffic Organization]], the ''Flight Deck Human Factors Research Laboratory'' and the ''National Airspace System (NAS) Human Factors Safety Research Laboratory''. Research facilities within these laboratories include head-mounted display systems and numerous aircraft control, general aviation, and unmanned aircraft simulators.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="five"&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/nextgen/research_tech_dev/research_planning/rd_news/media/pdf/rdreview_fall_03.pdf The Civil Aerospace Medical Institute in: FAA R&amp;D In Review, Fall, 2003;2(3).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="six"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Human-Factors-Impacts-Traffic-Management/dp/0754635023 Human Factors Impacts in Air Traffic Management, Kirwan B. et al., 2005.

[[File:Forensic Toxicology Research Laboratory.jpg|thumb|''Forensic Toxicology Research Laboratory'']]

==Aerospace Medical Research==
Aerospace Medical Research conducts a cross-functional research program concerned with issues ranging from the molecular to the cosmic level of aerospace medicine so as to improve the safety of humans in civilian aerospace operations.  In support of this research, databases of medical and aircraft accident data are maintained.  The division is composed of two research laboratories: ''Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory'' and ''Protection &amp; Survival Research Laboratory''.

=== Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory ===
At the ''Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory'', personnel study and analyze chemical, physiological, and medical factors in aircraft accidents/incidents and define relationships between those findings and the safe, secure, and healthy operation of aerospace craft. The laboratory’s research areas are: forensic toxicology, biochemistry, functional genomics, radiobiology, and bioinformatics.&lt;ref name="FAA - Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory|url=https://www.faa.gov/data_research/research/med_humanfacs/aeromedical/|publisher=FAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

=== Protection &amp; Survival Research Laboratory ===
At the ''Protection &amp; Survival Research Laboratory'', personnel provide state-of-the-art information, procedures, and equipment evaluations relative to aircraft accident investigation, survivability, health, and security of passengers and crewmembers during normal operations and emergency events. The laboratory’s research areas are: cabin safety, biodynamics, environmental physiology, medical review of accidents, and vision.  This laboratory also supports the FAA and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] in the collection and disposition of autopsy data resulting from aircraft accident investigations.  Research facilities within these laboratories include a [[Hypobaric chamber|hypobaric test chamber]], protective breathing equipment and water survival test facilities, a dynamic impact test facility, and aircraft evacuation/cabin environment simulators.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123301773654017857 Crash Courses for the Crew, The Wall Street Journal, January 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;[http://dailynightly.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2008/12/21/4373507-seats-upright-please Seats Upright, Please.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10057">The '''Clean Air Society of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]''' ('''CASANZ''') is a non-governmental, non-profit organization formed in the 1960s to bring together people with an interest in clean air and the study of [[air pollution]]. Its focus has since grown to include broader [[environmental management]] affairs, but with special emphasis on air quality and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.casanz.org.au/ Official CASANZ website]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2005, the society had 836 members (683 in Australia, 140 in New Zealand, and 13 in other countries). In September 2007, CASANZ hosted the 14th [[International Union of Air Pollution Prevention and Environmental Protection Associations|IUAPPA]] World Congress in Brisbane, Australia.

==Activities promoting environmental protection==
CASANZ promotes the protection of the environment by a variety of activities, including:
*Advancement of knowledge and practical experience of [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[air quality]] management. 
*Providing an organization which gathers and distributes the experience and knowledge of its members. 
*Providing lectures, exhibitions, public meetings and conferences that expand knowledge of environmental matters and, in particular,  air quality — including causes, effects, measurement, legislative aspects and control of [[air pollution]]. 
*Liaison with organizations having similar interests in other countries. 
*Providing scholarships, monetary grants, awards and prizes to encourage the study of relevant subjects.

==The operation and governing of CASANZ==
CASANZ operates through autonomous branches which determine their own programs of activities, including technical meetings, seminars, workshops, conferences, training courses, etc. Details of these activities are circulated to branch members and posted on the society's online web site.

CASANZ is governed by an Executive Committee consisting of:
*An elected Executive Director
*Other officers and representatives nominated by the branches.

The Executive Committee manages the day-to-day activities of the society and directs the work of the Executive Director.

==Special Interest Groups (SIGS)==
As of September 2013, CASANZ has eight Special Interest Groups (commonly referred to as SIGs), each of which is briefly discussed in the following subsections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Default.aspx The eight SIGs of CASANZ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614033919/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modelling Special Interest Group===
The objective of the '''''Modelling Special Interest Group''''' is to bring together CASANZ members who have an interest in the development and/or application of [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to exchange ideas, identify common problems, inform members of new developments, and establish, as appropriate, a 'ModSIG view' on issues of relevance.

Dispersion modelling is becoming more and more a part of licensing emissions to the atmosphere throughout Australia, and there is growing awareness of the role that air quality modelling can play in areas such as air resource management, [[risk assessment]] and land-use planning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/modelling.aspx The Modelling SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035243/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/modelling.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Odour Special Interest Group===
The '''''[[Odour Special Interest Group]]''''' is an important forum for the exchange of information, and in encouraging improved practices in [[odour]] measurement, modelling, assessment, control, management and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/odour.aspx The Odour SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614031539/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/odour.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor Air Special Interest Group===
The '''''Indoor Air Special Interest Group''''' promotes discussion and debate on the state of knowledge and the quality of indoor air, and on related environmental health concerns. The group encourages research, education, community awareness and management of issues related to this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035113/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/indoorair.aspx The Indoor Air SIG page on the Casanz website].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenhouse Special Interest Group===
The purpose of the '''''Greenhouse Special Interest Group''''' is threefold:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035109/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/greenhouse.aspx The Greenhouse SIG page on the CASANZ website].&lt;/ref&gt;

*To identify the research and development work being done at national and international levels on the science of greenhouse and global climate modelling as well as the developments being undertaken to assess and quantify the impact of climate change.
*To inform CASANZ members and the broader community on greenhouse gas emissions, emission scenarios, regional contributions and economic and technological developments.
*To provide response to government policies and initiatives in the area of energy reform and greenhouse abatement so as to stimulate debate amongst members and the broader community.

===Measurement Special Interest Group===
The primary objective of the '''''Measurement Special Interest Group''''' is to ensure that atmospheric pollutants in the ambient air and industrial source emissions are measured utilising methods that are fit for that purpose.

The objective is to be achieved by: conducting workshops, developing decision trees to assist in selecting appropriate air pollution measurement test methods and developing source emission and ambient air quality test methods in cooperation with Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/measurement.aspx The Measurement SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035227/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/measurement.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport Special Interest Group===
The '''''Transport Emissions and Fuel Consumption Modeling Special Interest Group''''' (or simply the '''''Transport Special Interest Group''''') focuses on the quantification and modelling of air pollutant and greenhouse gas impacts from all forms of transport and their support equipment. The Transport Special Interest Group is intended to be a platform for information sharing, discussion of emerging issues and coordination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Transport/Default.aspx The Transport SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035221/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Transport/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk Assessment Interest Group===
The '''''Risk Assessment Interest Group''''' exists to be knowledgeable and supportive of governmental policy developments involving risk assessment, such as:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035058/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Riskassessment/Default.aspx The Risk Assessment SIG page on the Casanz website].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''National Air Quality Standards (Air NEPM)'' which were developed with the help of risk assessment.
* Variations to the State of Victoria's ''Environment Protection Policy for Air Quality Management'' to incorporate formalised risk assessments. 
* The ''National Environmental Health Strategy'', which includes risk assessment as a basis for decision making.
* The Australian Standard for ''Risk Management (AS4360-1999)''.
* The proposal to develop a coordinated national strategy for ''air toxics''.

===Air Policy Special Interest Group===
The purpose of the '''''Air Policy Special Interest Group''''' is to bring together CASANZ members interested in advancing air policy development and contributing to responsible air quality related risk communication by:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/airpolicy/Default.aspx The Air Policy SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035103/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/airpolicy/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clinical clerkships''' encompass a period of [[medical education]] in which students – [[medical student|medical]], [[nursing school|nursing]], [[dentistry school|dental]], or otherwise – practice medicine under the supervision of a health practitioner.&lt;ref name="unm-glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unm.edu/~unmreg/Curriculum/ScheduleTypeGlossary1-9-06.htm |title=Clinical clerkship |work=UNM Course Type Glossary |accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical clerkships ==
In [[medical education]], a '''clerkship''', or '''rotation''', refers to the practice of [[medicine]] by [[medical students]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine|D.P.M]]) during their final year(s) of study. Traditionally, the first half of [[medical school]] trains students in the classroom setting, and the second half takes place in a [[teaching hospital]]. Clerkships give students experiences in all parts of the hospital setting, including the [[operating room]], [[emergency department]], and various other departments that allow learning by viewing and doing.

During this training, students are required to rotate through different [[medical specialties]] and treat [[patient]]s under the supervision of [[physicians]].  Students elicit [[medical history|patient histories]], complete [[physical examination]]s, write [[progress note]]s, and assist in [[surgery|surgeries]] and [[medical procedure]]s. The work hours are that of a full-time job, generally similar to that of [[residency (medicine)|residents]]. Students may also be required to work on weekends and to be on call.
For [[medical student]]s, [[Clerkship (medicine)|clerkships]] occur after the [[basic science]] curriculum, and are supervised by medical specialists at a [[teaching hospital]] or [[medical school]]. Typically, certain clerkships are required to obtain the [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree or the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree in the United States (e.g., [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]]), while others are elective (e.g., [[dermatology]], [[pathology]], and [[neurology]]).

The intent of the clinical clerkship is to teach the medical student the fundamentals of clinical examination, evaluation, and care provision, and to enable the student to select the course of further study. During the clinical clerkship, the medical student will interact with real patients much as a [[physician]] does, but their evaluation and recommendations will be reviewed and approved by more senior physicians.

===United States===
In the United States, [[Medical school in the United States|medical school]] typically lasts four years.  Medical students spend the third and fourth years rotating through a combination of required clerkship and electives.  Most medical schools require rotations in [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]], [[psychiatry]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], [[family medicine]], [[radiology]], and [[neurology]].  Some schools additionally require [[emergency medicine]] and [[intensive-care medicine]].  Furthermore, a common graduation requirement is to complete a [[sub-internship]] in a specialty, where the medical student acts as an [[internship (medicine)|intern]].

'''''Corpus Mysticum: Essai sur L'Eucharistie et l’Église au moyen âge''''' was a book written by [[Henri de Lubac]], published in [[Paris]] in 1944. The book aimed to, in de Lubac's words, retrieve the doctrine that "the Church makes the [[eucharist]] and the eucharist makes the church".&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth-Century Catholic Theologians'' (2007), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book traces patristic and medieval uses of the Latin phrase ''corpus mysticum'' ("mystical body"). In de Lubac's time, especially as evidenced in [[Pope Pius XII]]'s 1943 encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'', this phrase was typically used to refer to the Church as the "mystical body" of Christ.

From his historical study, however, de Lubac argued that the phrase ''corpus mysticum'' referred initially to Christ's ''eucharistic'' body, and not to the visible Church as an institution. This association had been lost in the late medieval period. De Lubac argued that it was important to recover the pre-modern understanding of ''corpus mysticum'', according to which Christ should be regarded as mystically present and at work where and when the eucharist was being celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth-Century Catholic Theologians'' (2007), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Lubac's argument did not have great immediate impact, but was hugely influential in the eucharistic ecclesiology developed (or rehabilitated) at [[Vatican II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2886">'''Critical hours''' for radio stations is the time from [[sunrise]] to two hours after sunrise, and from two hours before [[sunset]] until sunset, local time. During this time, certain American radio stations may be operating with reduced power as a result of Section 73.187 of the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s rules.&lt;ref name="FCCamtext"&gt;{{cite web | title =AM Engineering Data Base for Public Release | work =AM Engineering Data Base  | publisher=FCC Mass Media Bureau, Audio Services Division (United States Government) | date =1997-04-21 | url =http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/MB/Databases/pre-cdbs-before-2000/amtext.txt | format=TEXT |dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930094523/http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/MB/Databases/pre-cdbs-before-2000/amtext.txt | archivedate=2007-09-30 | accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadian restricted hours''' are similar to critical hours, except that the restriction results from the January 17, 1984, U.S.-Canadian AM Agreement. Canadian restricted hours are called "critical hours" in the U.S.-Canadian Agreement, but in the AM Engineering database, the FCC calls them "Canadian restricted hours" to distinguish them from the domestically defined critical hours. Canadian restricted hours is that time from sunrise to one and one-half hours after sunrise, and from one and one-half hours before sunset until sunset, local time. U.S. stations operate with restricted hours because of Canadian stations, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="FCCamtext"/&gt;

Those radio stations that must lower their power during the critical hours are required to do so because this is when the propagation of radio waves changes from [[groundwave]] to [[skywave]] (at sunset) or vice versa (at sunrise).  This can cause radio stations to be picked up much farther away, possibly causing interference with other stations on the same frequency or adjacent frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Edmunds | first=Russ | title=Sunrise &amp; Sunset | publisher=National Radio Club | url=http://www.nrcdxas.org/articles/sunriseset.html | dead-url=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104235902/http://www.nrcdxas.org/articles/sunriseset.html | archivedate=2006-11-04 | accessdate=2016-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually stations operating under the restrictions of Critical Hours must sign off the air between the end of the evening critical hours and the beginning of the morning critical hours.  In effect, permission to operate during critical hours gives daytime-only stations a few more hours in their broadcast day.  This is especially important in autumn and winter, when these stations might otherwise need to be off the air during the important morning and afternoon drive times, when AM radio listening is at its highest.

'''Declamation''' (from the Latin: '''''declamatio'''''  for "declaration") is an artistic form of public speaking. It is a dramatic oration designed to present through articulation, emphasis and gesture the full sense of the message being imparted.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}}

==History==
In Ancient Rome, declamation was a genre of ancient [[rhetoric]] and a mainstay of the [[Education in Ancient Rome|Roman higher education]] system. It was separated into two component subgenres, the ''[[controversia]]'', speeches of defense or prosecution in fictitious court cases, and the ''[[suasoria]]'', in which the speaker advised a historical or legendary figure as to a course of action. Roman declamations survive in four corpora: the compilations of [[Seneca the Elder]] and [[Calpurnius Flaccus]], as well as two sets of ''controversiae'', the ''Major Declamations'' and ''Minor Declamations'' spuriously attributed to [[Quintilian]].

Declamation had its origin in the form of preliminary exercises for Greek students of rhetoric: works from the Greek declamatory tradition survive in works such as the collections of [[Sopater]] and [[Choricius of Gaza]]. Of the remaining Roman declamations the vast majority are ''controversiae''; only one book of ''suasoriae'' survive, that being in Seneca the Elder's collection. The ''controversia'' as they currently exist normally consist of several elements: an imaginary law, a theme which introduced a tricky legal situation, and an argument which records a successful or model speech on the topic. It was normal for students to employ illustrative ''exempla'' from Roman history and legend (such as were collected in the work of [[Valerius Maximus]]) to support their case. Important points were often summed up via pithy epigrammatic statements (''sententiae''). Common themes include ties of fidelity between fathers and sons, heroes and tyrants in the archaic city, and conflicts between rich and poor men.

As a critical part of rhetorical education, declamation's influence was widespread in Roman elite culture. In addition to its didactic role, it is also attested as a performative genre: public declamations were visited by such figures as [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Asinius Pollio]], [[Maecenas]], and the emperor [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sussmann|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Ovid]] is recorded by Seneca the Elder as being a star declaimer, and the works of the satirists [[Martial]] and [[Juvenal]], as well as the historian [[Tacitus]], reveal a substantial declamatory influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sussmann|1994|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later examples of declamation can be seen in the work of the sixth century AD bishop and author [[Ennodius]].

==Classic revival==
In the eighteenth century, a classical revival of the art of public speaking, often referred to as [[elocution|The Elocution Movement]] occurred in Britain. While elocution focused on the voice—articulation, diction, and pronunciation—declamation focused on delivery. Rather than a narrow focus on [[rhetoric]], or persuasion, practitioners involved in the movement focused on improving speech and gesture{{sfn|Goring|2014}} to convey the full sentiment of the message.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}} Traditionally, practitioners of declamation served in the clergy, legislature or law, but by the nineteenth century, the practice had extended to theatrical and reformist venues.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}}{{sfn|Goring|2014}} Initially, the aim was to improve the standard of oral communication, as high rates of illiteracy made it imperative for churches, courts and parliaments, to rely on the spoken word.{{sfn|Goring|2014}} Through modification of inflection and phrasing, along with appropriate gestures, speakers were taught to convey the meaning and persuade the audience, rather than deliver monotonous litanies.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}} 

By the mid-nineteenth century, reformers were using the "art of declamation" to publicly address vice and provide moral guidance. In the Americas, missionary-run schools focused on teaching former slaves the art of public speaking to enable them to elevate others of their race as teachers and ministers.{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=7}} Using drama as a tool to teach, reformers hoped to standardize the spoken word, while creating a sense of national pride.{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=7}}{{sfn|Harrington|2010|p=68}} Studies and presentation of declamation flourished in Latin America and particularly in the African-American and Afro-Caribbean communities through the first third of the twentieth century. Practitioners attempted to interpret their orations to convey the emotions and feeling behind the writer's words to the audience, rather than simply recite them.{{sfn|Kuhnheim|2008|p=137}} In the twentieth century, among black practitioners, topical focus often was on the irony of their lives in a post-slavery world, recognizing that they had gained freedom but were not free to express themselves. Presentation involved utilization of African rhythms from dance and music,{{sfn|''ABC Color''|2006}} and local dialect, as a form of social protest.{{sfn|Kuhnheim|2008|p=141}}

[[File:Getreide.jpg|thumb|250px|Unripe ears of [[barley]], [[wheat]], and [[rye]].]]

An '''ear''' is the [[grain]]-bearing tip part of the [[plant stem|stem]] of a [[cereal]] plant, such as [[wheat]] or [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=121|title=A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent|last=Jackson|first=Benjamin Daydon|edition=fourth|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|year=1928|url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofbotani1928jack}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also refer to "a prominent lobe in some leaves".&lt;ref name="Swartz"&gt;{{cite book|page=162|title=Collegiate Dictionary of Botany|last=Swartz|first=Delbert|publisher=The Ronald Press Company|location=New York|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ear is a [[Spike (botany)|spike]], consisting of a central stem on which tightly packed rows of [[flower]]s grow.  These develop into [[fruit]]s containing the edible [[seed]]s. In corn, it is protected by leaves called husks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lerner|first=Rosie|title=Corn - Ears|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/senior/vegetabl/corn1.htm|work=Senior Study Vegetables|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some species (including wheat), un[[ripening|ripe]] ears contribute significantly to photosynthesis, in addition to the [[leaf|leaves]] lower down the plant.

A parasite known as ''[[Anguina tritici]]'' (Ear Cockle) specifically affects the ears on wheat and rye by destroying the tissues and stems during growth. With the exception of North Africa and West Asia, the parasite has been eradicated in all countries by using the 
[[crop rotation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ear Cockle Disease of Wheat|url=http://agrihunt.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=364|publisher=Agrihunt|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecological assessment''' (EA) implies the monitoring of [[Natural resource|ecological resources]], to discover the current and changing conditions. EAs are required components of most [[hazardous waste]] site investigations. Such assessments, in conjunction with contamination and human health risk assessments, help to evaluate the [[List of environmental health hazards|environmental hazards]] posed by contaminated sites and to determine remediation requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept?cp=2440 ecological assessment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ecological assessment many abiotic and biotic indicators, reflecting the pluralistic components of [[ecosystem]]s, are used. Reporting on the state of the [[Natural environment|environment]] requires that information on separate indicators are integrated into comprehensive yardsticks or indices. EA is extremely complex because of regional and temporal variation in vulnerability of ecosystems and because of limited understanding of ecosystem functioning and health.&lt;ref name=Latour1994&gt;{{Citation |last=Latour |first=J. |first2=C. |last2=Groen |title=Ecological assessment of natural resources in agroecosystems of Dutch Lowland Peat area |journal=Environmental Management |year=1994 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=141–145 |doi=10.1007/BF02393873|bibcode = 1994EnMan..18..455L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicators==
[[File:Indicator 3.0.JPG|thumb|Indicators of ecological assessment]]
Ecological indicators are able to
* assess the condition of the environment
* provide an early warning signal of changes in the environment, or
* diagnose the cause of an environmental problem.
Ideally the suite of indicators should represent key information about structure, function, and composition of the ecological system.&lt;ref name="Dale"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dale |first=V. H. |last2=Beyeler|first2=S. C. |title= Challenges in the development and use of ecological indicators |journal= Ecological Indicators |year=2001 |volume=1|issue=1 |pages=3–10 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X01000036 |doi=10.1016/S1470-160X(01)00003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general EA indicators can be divided into abiotic and biotic indicators. Due to the complexity of ecosystems and environmental processes, a set of indicators reflecting the many facets of ecosystems is needed. Chemical, physical, and biological indicators each have specific advantages and disadvantages for monitoring and assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zonneveld |first=I.S. |title=Principles of bio-indication |journal=Environmental Monitoring and Assessment |publisher= Springer Netherlands |year=1983 |volume=3|issue=3 |pages=207–217 |doi=10.1007/BF00396213
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Abiotic component|Abiotic]]''' indicators, which may give information on the risks or threats from stressors to ecosystems &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Rapport | first=D. J. | year=1989 | title=What constitutes ecosystem health? | journal=Perspectives in Medicine and Biology | volume=30 | pages=120–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; are comparatively well correlated with sources of [[Pollution|pollutants]] and disturbances but may not reflect ecological end points in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Suter |first=G. |title=Endpoints for regional ecological risk assessments |journal= Environmental Management |publisher= Springer New York |year=1990|volume=14|issue=1 |pages=9–23 |doi=10.1007/BF02394015
|bibcode = 1990EnMan..14....9S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Biotic component|Biotic]]''' indicators may reflect end points &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kelly |first=J. |last2=Harwell |first2=M. |title=Indicators of ecosystem recovery |journal=Environmental Management |year=1990 |volume=14|issue=5 |pages=527–545 |doi=10.1007/BF02394708|bibcode = 1990EnMan..14..527K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be used to differentiate "healthy" from "sick" ecosystems. Correlation of biotic indicators with sources of pollutants and other disturbances is relatively difficult due to the complexity of environmental processes and the multitude of potential stressors.&lt;ref name=latour&gt;{{Citation |last=Latour |first=J. |last2=Groen |first2=C. |title= Ecological assessment of natural resources in agroecosystems of Dutch Lowland Peat area |journal=Environmental Management |year=1994 |volume=18|issue=3 |pages=455–464 |doi=10.1007/BF02393873|bibcode = 1994EnMan..18..455L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical appraisal:
* small number of indicators lead to fail considering the full complexity of the ecological system
* choice of ecological indicators depends on management programs that have vague long-term goals and objectives
* monitoring programs miss predominantly the scientific demand (lack of defined protocol for identifying ecological indicators)&lt;ref name="Dale"/&gt;

==Types of ecological assessment==
'''Strategic ecological assessment (SEcA)''' is required to ensure that proposed new developments are compatible with international obligations to conserve protected habitats and their associated species. In common with all forms of Environmental Impact Assessment, the effectiveness of SEcA depends on the ability to define the proposed action or set of actions and to characterize the receiving environment (baseline conditions). The ability to quantify potential impacts and to estimate their risk of occurrence is strongly dependent on the
* availability
* accuracy
* reliability and
* resolution
of national data on the distributions of habitats, species and development proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Muchoney |first=D.M. |last2=Grossman |first2=D. H. |first3=R. |last3=Solomon |title=Rapid Ecological Assessment for conservation planning |journal=Technical papers ACSM-ASPRS annual convention |year=1991 |volume=4 |pages=141–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[The Nature Conservancy|Nature Conservancy]] has developed '''Rapid Ecological Assessment (REA)''', an integrated methodology to provide the multiple scale, up-to-date information required to guide conservation actions. REA relies on analysis of aerial photography, videography, and satellite image data to identify conservation sites and to direct field sampling and research for cost-effective biological and ecological data acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Krotscheck |first=C. |last2=König |first2=F. H. |first3=I. |last3=Obernberger |title=Ecological assessment of integrated bioenergy systems using the Sustainable Process Index |journal=Biomass and Bioenergy |year=2000 |volume=18 |pages=341–368 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953499000963 |doi=10.1016/S0961-9534(99)00096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The goal of EA is to understand the structure and function of ecosystems in order to develop improved management options. Furthermore, developing models to predict the response of ecosystems to changes contributes to finding a particular management strategy.
The results of the EA will be used to suggest possible improvements of the pollutant´s properties to reduce the potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref name=geldermann&gt;{{Citation |last=Geldermann |first=J. |last2=Gabriel |first2=R. |first3=O. |last3=Rentz |title=Ecological assessment of the environmental impacts of the kerosene burning in jet turbines and its improvement assessment |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research |year=1999 |volume=6 |pages=115–121 |doi=10.1007/BF02987564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological assessment in the U.S.==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has set a definition for EA. Ecological assessment is a “qualitative or quantitative assessment of the actual or potential effects of a hazardous waste site on plants and animals other than people and domesticated species”. The methodologies used for EA noted down in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)are only vaguely defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |title=Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act |year=1980 |url=http://epw.senate.gov/cercla.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, assessment methods applied by both consultants and regulatory agencies range from qualitative approaches, such as listings of potential biotic receptors at a contaminated site, to fully quantitative approaches that include detailed exposure estimations, quantitative toxicity comparisons, and supplementary biota sampling to evaluate uptake estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lemont |first=S. |last2=Eaton |first2=W.

'''Environmental ethics''' is the part of [[environmental philosophy]] which considers extending the traditional boundaries of ethics from solely including humans to including the non-human world. It exerts influence on a large range of disciplines including [[environmental law]], [[environmental sociology]], [[ecotheology]], [[ecological economics]], [[ecology]] and [[Integrated geography|environmental geography]].

There are many ethical decisions that human beings make with respect to the environment. For example:

*Should humans continue to [[clearcutting|clear cut]] forests for the sake of human consumption?
*Why should humans continue to propagate its species, and life itself? &lt;ref name = "Bioethics"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title =  Life-centered ethics, and the human future in space | journal = Bioethics | volume = 23 | pages = 433–440 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x | pmid=19077128 | url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Should humans continue to make [[internal combustion engine|gasoline-powered vehicles]]?

*What role can Planetary Boundaries play in reshaping the human-earth relationship?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tratarde.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Science-2015-Steffen-PLANETARY-BOUNDARIES.pdf|title=Planetary boundaries: Guiding human development on a changing plant|last=Steffen|first=Will|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic field of environmental ethics grew up in response to the work of scientists such as [[Rachel Carson]] and events such as the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970, when environmentalists started urging philosophers to consider the philosophical aspects of environmental problems. Two papers published in ''Science'' had a crucial impact: [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.|Lynn White]]'s "The Historical Roots of our Ecologic Crisis" (March 1967)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science| title=The Historical Roots of our Ecologic Crisis| first=Lynn| last=White|date=March 1967| doi =  10.1126/science.155.3767.1203|volume=155|issue=3767|pages=1203–1207|pmid=17847526 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Garrett Hardin]]'s "The Tragedy of the Commons" (December 1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also influential was Garett Hardin's later essay called "Exploring New Ethics for Survival", as well as an essay by [[Aldo Leopold]] in his ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'', called "The Land Ethic," in which Leopold explicitly claimed that the roots of the ecological crisis were philosophical (1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sand County Almanac| first=Aldo| last=Leopold| year=1949| chapter=The Land Ethic|isbn=1-59726-045-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first international academic journals in this field emerged from North America in the late 1970s and early 1980s – the US-based journal ''[[Environmental Ethics (journal)|Environmental Ethics]]'' in 1979 and the Canadian-based journal ''[[The Trumpeter: Journal of Ecosophy]]'' in 1983. The first British based journal of this kind, ''[[Environmental Values]]'', was launched in 1992.

== Marshall's categories ==
Some scholars have tried to categorise the various ways the natural environment is valued. [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]] and [[Michael A. Smith|Michael Smith]] are two examples of this, as cited by [[Peter Vardy (theologian)|Peter Vardy]] in "The Puzzle of Ethics".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Vardy, Paul Grosch: The Puzzle of Ethics. New York: Harper Collins 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marshall, three general ethical approaches have emerged over the last 40 years: Libertarian Extension, the Ecologic Extension and Conservation Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and the Extraterrestrial Environment. In: Journal of Applied Philosophy, Vol. 10, No. 2, 1993, pp. 227-236.| first=Alan| last=Marshall|issn=1468-5930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libertarian extension ===
Marshall’s Libertarian extension echoes a civil liberty approach (i.e. a commitment to extend equal rights to all members of a community). In environmentalism, though, the community is generally thought to consist of non-humans as well as humans.

Andrew Brennan was an advocate of ecologic humanism (eco-humanism), the argument that all ontological entities, animate and in-animate, can be given ethical worth purely on the basis that they exist. The work of [[Arne Næss]] and his collaborator Sessions also falls under the libertarian extension, although they preferred the term "[[deep ecology]]". Deep ecology is the argument for the intrinsic value or inherent worth of the environment – the view that it is valuable in itself. Their argument, incidentally, falls under both the libertarian extension and the ecologic extension.

[[Peter Singer]]'s work can be categorized under Marshall's 'libertarian extension'. He reasoned that the "expanding circle of moral worth" should be redrawn to include the rights of non-human animals, and to not do so would be guilty of [[speciesism]]. Singer found it difficult to accept the argument from intrinsic worth of a-biotic or "non-sentient" (non-conscious) entities, and concluded in his first edition of "Practical Ethics" that they should not be included in the expanding circle of moral worth.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer: Practical Ethics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is essentially then, bio-centric. However, in a later edition of "Practical Ethics" after the work of Næss and Sessions, Singer admits that, although unconvinced by deep ecology, the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible, but at best problematic. Singer advocated a humanist ethics.

=== Ecologic extension ===
Alan Marshall's category of ecologic extension places emphasis not on
human rights but on the recognition of the fundamental interdependence 
of all biological (and some abiological) entities and their essential 
diversity. Whereas Libertarian Extension can be thought of as flowing 
from a political reflection of the natural world, ecologic extension is 
best thought of as a scientific reflection of the natural world. 
Ecological Extension is roughly the same classification of Smith's 
eco-holism, and it argues for the intrinsic value inherent in collective
ecological entities like ecosystems or the global environment as a 
whole entity. Holmes Rolston, among others, has taken this approach.

This category might include [[James Lovelock]]'s [[Gaia hypothesis]]; the theory that the planet earth alters its geo-physiological structure over time in order to ensure the continuation of an equilibrium of evolving organic and inorganic matter. The planet is characterized as a unified, [[Holism|holistic]] entity with ethical worth of which the human race is of no particular significance in the long run.

=== Conservation ethics ===
Marshall's category of 'conservation ethics' is an extension of use-value into the non-human biological world. It focuses only on the worth of the environment in terms of its utility or usefulness to humans. It contrasts the intrinsic value ideas of 'deep ecology', hence is often referred to as 'shallow ecology', and generally argues for the preservation of the environment on the basis that it has extrinsic value – instrumental to the welfare of human beings. Conservation is therefore a means to an end and purely concerned with mankind and inter-generational considerations. It could be argued that it is this ethic that formed the underlying arguments proposed by Governments at the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto summit]] in 1997 and three agreements reached in Rio in 1992.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

== Humanist theories ==
Peter Singer advocated the preservation of "world heritage sites," unspoilt parts of the world that acquire a "scarcity value" as they diminish over time. Their preservation is a bequest for future generations as they have been inherited from human's ancestors and should be passed down to future generations so they can have the opportunity to decide whether to enjoy unspoilt countryside or an entirely urban landscape. A good example of a world heritage site would be the tropical rainforest, a very specialist ecosystem that has taken centuries to evolve. Clearing the rainforest for farmland often fails due to soil conditions, and once disturbed, can take thousands of years to regenerate.

== Applied theology ==

[[File:One Earth one family - Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action.webm|thumb|thumbtime=05:53|upright=1.2|Pope Francis’s environmental encyclical [[w:Laudato si'|Laudato si']] has been welcomed by many environmental organisations of different faiths  - Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action]]

The Christian world view sees the universe as created by God, and humankind accountable to God for the use of the resources entrusted to humankind. Ultimate values are seen in the light of being valuable to God.  This applies both in breadth of scope -  caring for people (Matthew 25) and environmental issues, e.g. environmental health (Deuteronomy 22.8; 23.12-14) - and dynamic motivation,  the love of Christ controlling (2 Corinthians 5.14f) and dealing with the underlying spiritual disease of sin, which shows itself in selfishness and thoughtlessness. In many countries this relationship of accountability is symbolised at harvest thanksgiving. (B.T. Adeney : Global Ethics in New Dictionary of Christian Ethics and Pastoral Theology 1995 Leicester)

Abrahamic religious scholars have used theology to motivate the public. [[John L. O'Sullivan]], who coined the term [[Manifest destiny]], and other influential people like him used Abrahamic ideologies to encourage action. These religious scholars, columnists and politicians historically have used these ideas and continue to do so to justify the consumptive tendencies of a young America around the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In order to solidify the understanding that God had intended for humankind to use earths natural resources, environmental writers and religious scholars alike proclaimed that humans are separate from nature, on a higher order.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Peter. Ecology: Religious or Secular? Heythrop Journal. Jan 1997, Vol. 38 Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Those that may critique this point of view may ask the same question that John Muir asks ironically in a section of his novel ''A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf'', ''why are there so many dangers in the natural world in the form of poisonous plants, animals and natural disasters'', The answer is that those creatures are a result of [[Adam and Eve]]'s sins in the garden of Eden.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, John. From A Thousand-mile Walk to the Gulf. American Earth: Environmental Writing Since Thoreau. Ed. Bill McKibben. N.p.: The Library of America, 2008. 85-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the turn of the 20th century, the application of theology in environmentalism diverged into two schools of thought. The first system of understanding holds religion as the basis of environmental stewardship. The second sees the use of theology as a means to rationalize the unmanaged consumptions of natural resources. [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.|Lynn White]] and Calvin DeWitt represent each side of this dichotomy.

[[John Muir]] personified nature as an inviting place away from the loudness of urban centers. "For Muir and the growing number of Americans who shared his views, Satan's home had become God's Own Temple."&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, ed., Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature, New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995, 69-90;&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Abrahamic religious allusions assisted Muir and the [[Sierra Club]] to create support for some of the first public nature preserves.

Authors like Terry Tempest Williams as well as John Muir build on the idea that "...God can be found wherever you are, especially outside. Family worship was not just relegated to Sunday in a chapel."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Terry T. Refuge : an unnatural history of family and place. New York: Vintage Books, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; References like these assist the general public to make a connection between paintings done at the [[Hudson River School]], [[Ansel Adams]]' photographs, along with other types of media, and their religion or spirituality. Placing intrinsic value upon nature through theology is a fundamental idea of [[Deep ecology]].

== Anthropocentrism ==
{{main article|Anthropocentrism}}

Anthropocentrism is the position that humans are the most important or critical element in any given situation; that the human race must always be its own primary concern. Detractors of anthropocentrism argue that the Western tradition biases homo sapiens when considering the environmental ethics of a situation and that humans evaluate their environment or other organisms in terms of the utility for them (see [[speciesism]]). Many argue that all environmental studies should include an assessment of the intrinsic value of non-human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. "''Environmental Values.'' ''The Oxford Book of Travel Stories''. Ed. Ian Marsh. Melbourne, Australia: Longman Cheshire, 1991. 12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, based on this very assumption, a philosophical article has explored recently the possibility of humans' willing extinction as a gesture toward other beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol7no3_2008/kochiordan_argument.pdf Tarik Kochi &amp; Noam Ordan, "An Argument for the Global Suicide of Humanity". ''Borderlands'', 2008, Vol. 3, 1-21].&lt;/ref&gt; The authors refer to the idea as a [[thought experiment]] that should not be understood as a call for action.

[[Baruch Spinoza]] reasoned that if humans were to look at things objectively, they would discover that everything in the universe has a unique value. Likewise, it is possible that a human-centred or anthropocentric/androcentric ethic is not an accurate depiction of reality, and there is a bigger picture that humans may or may not be able to understand from a human perspective.

[[Peter Vardy (theologian)|Peter Vardy]] distinguished between two types of anthropocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Vardy and Paul Grosch (1999), ..The Puzzle of Ethics.., p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; A strong anthropocentric ethic argues that humans are at the center of reality and it is right for them to be so. Weak anthropocentrism, however, argues that reality can only be interpreted from a human point of view, thus humans have to be at the centre of reality as they see it.

Another point of view has been developed by Bryan Norton, who has become one of the essential actors of environmental ethics by launching environmental pragmatism, now one of its leading trends. Environmental pragmatism refuses to take a stance in disputes between defenders of anthropocentrist and non-anthropocentrist ethics. Instead, Norton distinguishes between ''strong anthropocentrism'' and ''weak-or-extended-anthropocentrism'' and argues that the former  must underestimate the diversity of instrumental values humans may derive from the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.openedition.org/sapiens/88 Afeissa, H. S. (2008). "The Transformative value of Ecological Pragmatism. An Introduction to the Work of Bryan G. Norton". ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''1''' (1).]&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent view relates anthropocentrism to the future of life. [[Biotic ethics]] are based on the human identity as part of gene/protein organic life whose effective purpose is self-propagation. This implies a human purpose to secure and propagate life.&lt;ref name = "Bioethics"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Seeding Book"/&gt; Humans are central because only they can secure life beyond the duration of the Sun, possibly for trillions of eons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner |first = Michael N. | title = Life in the cosmological future: Resources, biomass and populations  | journal = Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | year = 2005 | volume = 58 | pages = 167–180 | url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFCosmologyJBIS2005Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biotic ethics]] values life itself, as embodied in biological structures and processes. Humans are special because they can secure the future of life on cosmological scales. In particular, humans can continue sentient life that enjoys its existence, adding further motivation to propagate life. Humans can secure the future of  life, and this future can give human existence a cosmic purpose.&lt;ref name = "Bioethics" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Seeding Book" /&gt;

== Status of the field ==

Only after 1990 did the field gain institutional recognition at programs such as [[Colorado State University]], the [[University of Montana]], [[Bowling Green State University]], and the [[University of North Texas]]. In 1991, [[Schumacher College]] of [[Dartington]], England, was founded and now provides an MSc in Holistic Science.

These programs began to offer a master's degree with a specialty in environmental ethics/philosophy. Beginning in 2005 the Department of Philosophy and Religion Studies at the [[University of North Texas]] offered a PhD program with a concentration in environmental ethics/philosophy.

In Germany, the [[University of Greifswald]] has recently established an international program in Landscape Ecology &amp; Nature Conservation with a strong focus on environmental ethics. In 2009, the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] and [[Deutsches Museum]] founded the [[Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society]], an international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities.

'''Evangelist portraits''' are a specific type of [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] included in ancient and [[mediaeval]] [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Gospel Book]]s, and later in [[Bible]]s and other books, as well as other media. Each [[Gospel]] of the [[Four Evangelists]], the books of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]], may be prefaced by a portrait of the Evangelist, usually occupying a full page.  [[Evangelist's symbol#Evangelists.27 symbols|Their symbols]]  may be shown with them, or separately.  Often they are the only figurative [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|illumination]] in the manuscript.  They are a common feature in larger Gospel Books from the earliest examples in the 6th century until the decline of that format for illustrated books in the High Middle Ages, by which time their conventions were being used for portraits of other authors.  
[[File:07 constantius2Chrono354.png|thumb|210px|Portrait of [[Constantius II]], dispensing largesse, from the [[Chronography of 354]], 354]]

==Author portraits==
They originate in the classical secular tradition of the author portrait, which was often the only illustration in a classical manuscript, also used as a [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] (not unlike the contemporary author photo, though this is usually shown on the back cover or wrapper). A very few examples of Late Antique secular author portraits survive, and rather more later copies.  Some examples also draw on the conventions of the [[Late Antique]] consular portrait, much used for the Emperors, who were also [[consul]]s.  Examples of these, copied from the original, can be seen in the [[Chronography of 354]] (see also the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]] of 30 years later).  The Evangelist may be holding a book, but is not writing in it, and he faces the front on a large throne, surrounded by an elaborate frame, usually domed or pedimented.  These frameworks are thought to draw from the style of the [[Scaenae frons]], or elaborate [[proscenium]] structures of [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatre]]s.

==The Evangelists' symbols==
[[File:Karolingischer Buchmaler um 820 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] miniature portraying the Evangelists with their symbols, from the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]], c. 820]]

The traditional symbols of the Evangelists were often included in the images, or especially in the [[Insular art|Insular]] tradition, either given their own additional images on a separate page, or used instead of an evangelist portrait.  The symbols are: the [[Lion]] of Mark, the [[Eagle]] of John, the [[Ox]] or [[Calf]] of Luke and the [[Angel]] or Man of Matthew.  Often all are shown with wings, as in the familiar winged lion used in the coat of arms of [[Venice]], whose [[patron saint]] was Mark.  Sometimes, as in the example from Lorsch, the symbols are shown dictating the text to the evangelist.

==Depictions and other media==
[[Late Antique]] evangelist portraits often show standing figures, as in the ivory panels of the Throne of [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Maximianus]] in [[Milan]], but from the [[Insular art]] of the 7th to 10th centuries, evangelist portraits in manuscripts nearly always closely followed the seated classical models, showing the Evangelists at full-length, either looking out at the viewer or writing at a table or desk and seen at an oblique angle.  These were derived from unknown classical prototypes, similar to those in the [[Codex Amiatinus]] and [[Saint Augustine Gospels]], though both of these types are rather different from the general types.&lt;ref&gt;The portrait of Mark in the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] seems taken directly from the single portrait, usually thought to be of [[Ezra]], in the Codex Amiatinus.&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually a setting is provided for the figure.  Details of the classical models, such as anachronistic [[scroll]]s and scroll-boxes, and a small writing-stand with a single dolphin-shaped support (see gallery below), survive well into the Middle Ages, sometimes clearly misunderstood by the artists concerned. Perhaps because of the secular origins of the typology, [[halo (religious iconography)|haloes]] are less likely to be worn than in other types of image.  The level of detail shown in the furniture and fittings is unusual for Early Medieval art.  An arch behind the author, often with curtains hanging across it, in some examples close to the classical models, gradually is turned into a decorative framing device for the whole scene.

Early Gospel Books often had a very elaborate and costly [[treasure binding]] or cover in metalwork, often with jewels and ivories.  These most often featured a central panel with [[Christ in Majesty]], often including the Evangelists and/or their symbols in the corners.  Versions of the same composition appear in all media used for Early Medieval religious art, including wall paintings.  The [[Tassilo Chalice]] is an 8th-century example of pure metalwork with five oval medallion portraits of Christ and the Evangelists (with symbols) round the cup.

==Insular variants and decline==
[[File:Irischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Insular, 8th century, now St Gall. Unusually, a single unspecified Evangelist with all four symbols]]
The early artists of the Insular period often show evangelists from the front who appear to be standing, although a chair is drawn behind them; the human figure was not a focus of interest or skill for these artists.  Later Insular depictions seem to show figures without chairs, who are standing.  Most of Europe continued to use the seated model however, usually seen in a three-quarters on view, and usually with a cushion behind.  Sometimes all four evangelists were combined on a page, sometimes around a [[Christ in Majesty]].  Standing portraits were usual, however, for wall and later panel paintings (and in the [[Tree of Jesse]] composition) with the Evangelists often treated as, and mixed with, other saints.  
 
The Gospel book as a medium for heavily illustrated manuscripts declined in the West from the Romanesque period, and with it the use of the Evangelist portrait. In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] world, the Gospel Book remained a primary focus for illumination, and Evangelist portraits, derived from contemporary Byzantine versions, are heavily represented among the earliest illuminations from the new Slav national traditions, such as the 11th-century [[Ostromir Gospels]] and the [[Khitrovo Gospels]] of about 1390 from [[Muscovy]].   In the West the portraits continued to be found in Bibles, more often as the picture within a [[historiated initial]] at the start of each Gospel.  Other books sometimes contained them as well.  Similar compositions began to be used for other saint-authors, especially for St [[Jerome]], who is often shown in a book-lined study, often with his symbol, a lion, dozing at his feet. Similarly [[St Gregory the Great]] may be shown with a dove, representing his inspiration from the Holy Spirit, whispering in his ear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5095">The '''[[expander graph|expander]] mixing lemma''' states that, for any two [[subsets]] &lt;math&gt;S, T&lt;/math&gt; of a d-regular [[expander graph]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, the number of edges between &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is approximately what you would expect in a [[random graph|random]] ''d''-[[regular graph]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;d|S| |T| / n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt; be a ''d''-regular graph on ''n'' vertices with &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in(0,d)&lt;/math&gt; the second-largest eigenvalue (in absolute value) of the adjacency matrix.  For any two subsets &lt;math&gt;S, T \subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;e(S, T) = |\{(x,y) \in S \times T : xy \in E(G)\}|&lt;/math&gt; be the number of edges between ''S'' and ''T'' (counting edges contained in the intersection of ''S'' and ''T'' twice).
Then

:&lt;math&gt;\left|e(S, T) - \frac{d |S| |T|}{n}\right| \leq \lambda  \sqrt{|S| |T| (1 - |S|/n)(1 - |T|/n)}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For [[biregular graph]]s, we have the following variation.&lt;ref&gt;See Theorem 5.1 in "Interlacing Eigenvalues and Graphs" by Haemers&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;G = (L, R, E)&lt;/math&gt; be a bipartite graph such that every vertex in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is adjacent to &lt;math&gt;d_L&lt;/math&gt; vertices of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and every vertex in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is adjacent to &lt;math&gt;d_R&lt;/math&gt; vertices of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq L, T \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|S| = \alpha|L|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|T| = \beta |R|&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;e(G) = |E(G)|&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{e(S, T)}{e(G)} - \alpha \beta\right| \leq \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{d_Ld_R}}  \sqrt{\alpha \beta (1 - \alpha) (1 - \beta)} \leq \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{d_Ld_R}} \sqrt{\alpha \beta}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{d_L d_R}&lt;/math&gt; is the largest absolute value of the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof==

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the adjacency matrix for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.  For a vertex subset &lt;math&gt;U \subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;|U\rangle = \sum_{v \in U} |v\rangle \in \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.  Here &lt;math&gt;|v\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the standard basis element of    &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with a one in the &lt;math&gt;v^{th}&lt;/math&gt; position.   Thus in particular &lt;math&gt;A |V\rangle = d |V\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and the number of edges between &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;E(S, T) = \langle S | A | T \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

Expand each of &lt;math&gt;|S\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|T\rangle&lt;/math&gt; into a component in the direction of the largest-eigenvalue eigenvector &lt;math&gt;|V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and an orthogonal component:

:&lt;math&gt;|S\rangle = \frac{|S|}{n} |V\rangle + |S'\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|T\rangle = \frac{|T|}{n} |V\rangle + |T'\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; \langle S' | V \rangle = \langle T' | V \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This orthogonality implies that &lt;math&gt;\| | S \rangle \|^2 = \| \frac{|S|}{n} |V\rangle \|^2 + \| |S'\rangle \|^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\| | T \rangle \|^2 = \| \frac{|T|}{n} |V\rangle \|^2 + \| | T' \rangle \|^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Moreover

:&lt;math&gt;\langle S | A | T \rangle = \frac{|S| |T|}{n^2} \langle V | A | V \rangle + \langle S' | A | T' \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The conclusion follows, since &lt;math&gt;\langle V | A | V \rangle = d \| |V\rangle \|^2 = d n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;| \langle S' | A | T' \rangle | \leq \| | S' \rangle \| \cdot \|A | T' \rangle \| \leq \lambda \| | S' \rangle \| \| | T' \rangle \|  = \lambda \sqrt{ \| |S \rangle \|^2 - \| \frac{|S|}{n} |V\rangle \|^2 } \sqrt{ \| |T \rangle \|^2 - \| \frac{|T|}{n} |V\rangle \|^2} = \lambda \sqrt{|S|(1 - |S|/n)|T|(1-|T|/n)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Converse==
Bilu and [[Nati Linial|Linial]] showed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~nati/PAPERS/raman_lift.pdf Expander mixing lemma converse]&lt;/ref&gt; that the converse holds as well: if a graph satisfies the conclusion of the expander mixing lemma, that is, for any two subsets &lt;math&gt;S, T \subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;|E(S, T) - \frac{d |S| |T|}{n}| \leq d \lambda \sqrt{|S| |T|}&lt;/math&gt;

then its second-largest eigenvalue is &lt;math&gt;O(d \lambda (1+\log(1/\lambda)))&lt;/math&gt;.

Since 2009 the faculty headquarters the National Center of Excellence for International Security Studies&lt;ref name="projekty1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projekty.umb.sk/OPVaV/2.1/26220120010/umbbd.nsf |title=Centrum Excelentnosti Úvod |language=sk |publisher=Projekty.umb.sk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013190757/http://www.projekty.umb.sk/OPVaV/2.1/26220120010/umbbd.nsf |archivedate=2011-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; funded through the RD Program of the [[European Union|EU]].

==Campus==
[[File:Courtyard of FPVMV.jpg|thumb|right|Courtyard of The Faculty of Political Science and International Relations, UMB]]
The faculty campus is located in the historical city downtown of [[Banská Bystrica]], bordering the branch office of the [[National Bank of Slovakia]] and the Matej Bel University Rector´s department. The campus consists of two buildings, which are set in a 4-acre urban park overlooking the river [[Hron]]. The main building is an early 17th-century [[chateau]], which was completely reconstructed in 1995 and 2010. The second building is an early 17th-century servant's house, which served for many years as a headquarters for the faculty's various student organizations. Partially reconstructed by the Euro-Atlantic Center, it had been the headquarters for the Slovak Atlantic Commission and the Centre of Nations, until 2011 when the newly established Slovak-French university institute moved into this object.

==Academics==
The faculty has had a distinctive international reputation since it was founded in 1995. The faculty's graduates have, on average, one of the largest salaries in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vs.iedu.sk/sk/profil/-/-/fakulta=f714060000 |title=Informácie o vysokých školách - Profil |publisher=Vs.iedu.sk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admission===
The Faculty of Political Science and International Relations maintains a highly selective admission standard for its undergraduate programs. Applicants must have a completed secondary school education, reached the age of 17 or more and possess excellent knowledge in History, Geography, Economics, Current Global Issues and two foreign languages.

Applications for undergraduate programs must be sent before the end of February of the year the applicant would like to enroll. The application has to include a PVSS form, CV, and a certificated Report card from grade 9-12. In order to qualify for the applicant status, the school requires to pass the [[Maturita]]  which is held nationwide in May. After the Maturita, students have to take an admission test at the faculty. The questions are postulated in Slovak, English and a second foreign language (German, Spanish, French, Russian.

The content of the questions for programs offered by the department of "International Relations" is from the areas of: Politics, World and Slovak History, [[International Relations]] and Diplomacy, Geography, Culture, Economic theory and current Slovak and World News. The content of the questions for programs offered by the department of "Political Science" is from the areas : Politics, World and Slovak History, Sociology, Culture, Economic theory, Slovak and International Law and current Slovak and World News.

The main factor for admission is the average percentage from the admission test, assistant factors are not including.&lt;ref&gt;{{sk icon}} http://www.umb.sk/umb/umbbb.nsf/DD247A50D6D8D111C1257A00002AF0AE/$File/VS_o_cinnosti_UMB_za_rok_2011_tabulkova_cast.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's undergraduate admission rate in 2011 was 34,9%

===Academic departments===

The faculty consists of the following departments:

* '''Department of International Relations and Diplomacy'''

The Department of International Relations and Diplomacy deals with teaching activities related to the following subjects: Diplomacy, Diplomatic and Consular Law, European Studies, Geopolitics of the Slovak Republic, Humanitarian Law, Integration Processes and Basic Principles of European Law, Canadian Studies, etc. The department also offers a [[doctoral degree]] program in [[international relations]] and [[diplomacy]].

[[File:Conference at FPVMV.jpg|thumb|Conference with HE Jean-Marie BRUNO - ambassador of France to Slovakia and HE Axel Hartmann - ambassador of Germany to Slovakia]]

* '''Department of Politics'''

The Department of Politics provides full-time bachelor's and master’s programs in "International Relations" and "Political Science" as well as a full-time doctoral program in "Theory of politics".

* '''Department of Security Studies'''

The Department of Security Studies focuses on applied political issues for example, [[globalization]] and regional problems, socioeconomic geography of regions in the world, geography of the Slovak republic and [[political geography]].

* '''Department of Foreign Languages and International Communication'''

===Center of excellence===
The Faculty of Political Science and International Relations headquarters the National Center of Excellence for International Security Studies.&lt;ref name="projekty1"/&gt; The Center is funded by the Operational Program for Science and Research of the [[European Regional Development Fund]]. Its main goals are to
* Produce cutting-edge academic research by encouraging integrated, multidisciplinary approaches to traditional and emerging challenges to security
* Develop the next generation of academics and practitioners by providing high quality postgraduate education in international security

===Academic Publishing===
The faculty publishes the ''Politické vedy'' journal which was run from 1998-2000 in cooperation with the Institute of Political Sciences at the [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]], but since 2000 it has been exclusively administrated by the Faculty of Political Science and International Relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upv.sav.sk/index.php?ID=118 |title=Politické vedy - 1998 - 2000 |publisher=Upv.sav.sk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===
As a part of its internationally focused education, it encourages students to add an international component to their studies by living in a foreign country. The school believes that the experience is a key part of an education in international affairs because it increases understanding of the world by providing students with a variety of new and unexpected perspectives. The program functions as bilateral partnerships with a number of schools.

Some of these include [[The London School of Economics]] in UK, [[Indiana University]] in US, [[University of Bologna]] in Italy, [[University of Cologne]] in Germany, [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] in Belgium, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Serbia)]] - Diplomatic Academy, [[Complutense University of Madrid]] in Spain etc. The faculty constantly looks for new partners and schools are added on a yearly basis.

In 2011, the faculty established the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120518200110/http://www.iufs.sk/lang/fr Slovak-French University Institute], in partnership with the [[French Embassy]] in Slovakia and two French Universities. The institute is headquartered on the school's campus and its main goal is to support [[scientific]] [[cooperation]] and [[academic mobility]] between French and Slovakian universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esn.sk/article/international-day-matej-bel-university?page=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804013731/http://www.esn.sk/article/international-day-matej-bel-university?page=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-04 |title=International Day at Matej Bel University &amp;#124; ESN Slovakia |publisher=Esn.sk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flower induction''' is the physiological process in the plant by which the [[meristem|shoot apical meristem]] becomes competent to develop [[flower]]s. Biochemical changes at the apex, particularly those caused by [[cytokinins]], accompany this process. Usually flower induction is followed by [[flower differentiation]], with some notable exceptions such as in [[kiwifruit]], where the two processes are separated. Flower induction can be reversed, but flower differentiation is irreversible, because anatomical changes are in place.

The '''German Institute of Food Technologies''' (ger. ''Deutsches Institut für Lebensmitteltechnik e.V.'' - DIL) is a [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] and self-financing research institute supported by more than 120 members from fields of food production, [[mechanical engineering]], [[process engineering]] and [[metrology]].
The DIL was founded in 1983 and is situated in the [[Osnabrück (district)|county of Osnabrück]], one of the regions with the highest numbers of full-time employees and highest density of food industry enterprises in Germany.&lt;ref name="eng"&gt;DIL Business [http://www.dil-ev.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/dil-eng.pdf Statistics] Accessed on 22 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research focus of the DIL is to develop innovative methods for [[food production]], [[quality assurance]] and [[process optimization]]. Beneficiaries of new insights in food technology are small and medium-sized enterprises. Stated as main objective is the improvement of efficiency and increase of competitiveness of companies from the food industry.

According to own sources, the institute finances itself by 90% through external funds, out of which 55% are used to cooperate directly with members of the DIL.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071128134744/http://www.dil-ev.de/staticsite/staticsite.php?menuid=4&amp;topmenu=4&amp;keepmenu=inactive DIL Introduction] Accessed on 22 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In May 1985, a new building was planned for the DIL in the [[Klaus von Klitzing|Professor-von-Klitzing]] Street, where the foundation stone was laid on September 1985 by [[Birgit Breuel]], who was Secretary of Commerce then. The [[Minister-President of Lower Saxony]] at that time, [[Ernst Albrecht (politician)|Ernst Albrecht]], inaugurated the new building at the turn of the year 1986/1987.

In 1988, the institute was renamed into its present name, "''German Institute of Food Technologies''", and its legal form was changed from membership cooperation to registered association.&lt;ref name="PDF"&gt;CDL Lower Saxony [http://cdl.niedersachsen.de/blob/images/C28785004_L20.pdf Scientific Commission of Lower Saxony about the DIL]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Accessed on 22 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 Mai 2009, the foundation stone for the expansion of the DIL building was laid by Friedrich-Otto Ripke, the Secretary of State for agriculture, nutrition, and consumer protection.
The former Minister-President of Lower Saxony [[Christian Wulff]] and Hans-Heinrich Ehlen were thanked for their personal contribution to the grant which enables the German Institute of Food Technologies to cooperate and link itself with further research institutes in the county.&lt;ref name="PDF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="15euro"&gt;DIL Investment [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/servicemenucontainer/servicemenu/news-detail/article/15-millionen-euro-investition-im-artland/16.html - € 15 million investment for Artland municipality] Accessed on 22 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of DIL's agenda for 2015, the current building had to be expanded.  The state of Lower Saxony had agreed to support the [[Artland|Artland municipality]] with a subsidy of €15 million to enable local agribusinesses and food production companies to develop their international competitiveness.&lt;ref name="PDF"/&gt;

==Business divisions==

===Product innovation===
New trends in markets and direct orders from companies serve as drive and guideline to develop appealing, healthy food products for all market segments: confectionery, baked goods, dairy and meat products, snacks and convenience products. The development process is also governed by a comprehensive analytical characterization of the structure of ingredients. Physical analysis in thermal, rheological and physiochemical tests enable possibilities to identify and characterize microstructures such as foams, emulsions and suspensions.&lt;ref name="dil2"&gt;DIL Business [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/business-fields/product-development.html Business Fields Product development] Accessed on 23 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process technology===
The focus of this business field is set to investigate in more efficient methods to process food production. Main goals include energy reduction, automation of technical processes and the use of new technologies to transform materials.
The following areas are highlights of the process development:
* [[Pulsed Electric Field Processing]]
* [[Food extrusion|Extrusion]]
* [[High pressure food preservation|High Pressure Processing]]
* [[Ultrasound]]/Shockwave Technology
* Application of [[supercritical fluid]]s &lt;ref name="dil3"&gt;DIL Business [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/business-fields/process-development.html Business Fields Process development] Accessed on 23 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food safety===
Products are tested upon their safety to avoid unforeseen incidents such as contamination of food. Raw material but also final products are being tested according to legal requirements and regulations in order to be safe for the consumer.
Main areas of focus are [[quality management]], chemical- and microbiological analysis. Although the food producer alone carries the responsibility for the production of safe food and the implementation of the necessary measures, the DIL can support food producers through quality controls and seminars about hygiene management.&lt;ref name="comp32"&gt;DIL Business Fields [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/business-fields/safety.html Business Fields Food safety] Accessed on 23 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center of Food Physics===
The Center of Food Physics (ZLP) is the latest business division of the DIL ; it started operation in mid-2011. On behalf of its customers, the ZLP investigates the relationship between structure and function and transfers its findings on structure formation mechanisms into process technology. The scale-up of technical and industrial applications is conducted in cooperation with other DIL divisions in order to be able to process complex R&amp;D tasks for its customers effectively and to a high level. While chemical analysis is concerned with the determination of the quality and quantity of substances and material systems, physical analysis applies expert knowledge, advanced measuring and examination methods and tailormade
analysis concepts to characterize materials and material systems. Since structures are the key to understanding properties, this area is of particular importance. The work of the ZLP is methodology-oriented, which means that the central elements are the development and application of measuring techniques for physical characterization. The measuring methods will then be adapted to the respective material systems. The existing expertise and the available measuring and examination systems of the industry and other research institutes can thereby be offered as a service to minimize the gap between research and application.&lt;ref name="service"&gt;DIL Annual Report [http://www.dil-ev.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pics/mitgliedschaft/Downloads/Jahresbericht_2011/DIL_Jahresbericht_Annual_report_2011.pdf]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Accessed on 11 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Bioeconomy===
Since 2012, the Bio-Economy division has been a new research focus at DIL. It serves as an interface between research platforms and business divisions. Cross-thematic and cross-sectoral research activities have been established to promote the structural change from an oil-based to a bio-based industry along with major opportunities for growth and employment. At the same time, international responsibility needs to be taken on the issues of the global food supply, the biomass-based supply of raw materials and energy, and climate and environmental protection. DIL is continually working to pave the way for bio-based food production. As part of these efforts, natural resources shall be used and new ways of using renewable raw materials are to be developed. This will be made possible through the development of new, bio-based production processes. This objective not only serves to preserve our living space, but also improves product quality and is good for our health. The division has its own research projects planned for 2013.

===Structure and functionality===
The quality of food is determined by their structure. Therefore, an optimization of food structures leads an improvement of long-term quality of food. Based on test on structure generation and the interdependency with the quality of food the DIL tries to increase the shelf-life of products.&lt;ref name="compe"&gt;DIL Research [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/expertise/structure-and-functionality.html Structure &amp; Functionality] Accessed on 23 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proteintechnology===
When the Bio-Economy division was founded in 2012, it was accompanied by an extensive realignment and expansion of the research platforms. As a result, meat technology was removed from the Process Technology business division, the biotechnology focus was placed on enzyme and raw material research, and a new research platform was founded for feed technology. Together, these three areas comprise the Protein Technology research division. These newly created capacities are the key to an integrated approach to global problems in the area of Bio-Economy.

===Robotics===
New application areas for robotics are being researched, far away from the traditional image of robotics where robots are mostly used for packing processes. Safe and hygienic handling of unpacked and packed food products are main highlight in this field. Through cooperation with food producers, robotics engineers and manufacturers the DIL establishes new functions for robotics.&lt;ref name="compe2"&gt;DIL Research [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/expertise/robotics.html Robotics] Accessed on 23 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process analysis===
The optimization of existing (production) processes always increases the competitiveness of the entrepreneur. The implementation of advanced process analysis into existing systems allows the performance of the plants to be optimized further. On a daily basis sensor technology provides new and improved options for the collection of measuring data. Processing data can consequently be compiled with much higher precision and at shorter intervals. This allows the optimization of production parameters such as quality, pieces/minute, reject rate – no matter whether it's anticipatory (e.g. by assessing the products introduced into the process) or downstream (e.g. control at the end of each process stage). This is where the value of the information becomes most visible. Many production plants are still not yet operating to their performance capabilities. There are many possibilities for process analysis to further improve the quality achieved so far.&lt;ref name="service"/&gt;

==Cooperations==

===Germany===

The ''Lower Saxonian competency center for the food industry'' (NieKE) is a network of cooperation between the German Institute of Food Technologies, ''The Institute of Spatial Analysis and Planning in Areas of Intensive Agriculture'' (ISPA) of the [[University of Vechta]], DIALOG - ''The Center for Transfer of Information and Technology'' at the [[University of Oldenburg]], ''the Competency Center Functional Food'' (KKF)  and ''The Research and Technology Contact Center'' (unitransfer) at the [[University of Hanover]].
The aims of this cooperative network are knowledge sharing between the members and the support of small and medium-sized enterprises.&lt;ref name="brochure"&gt;DIL Brochure [http://www.dil-ev.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/dil-eng.pdf About DIL] Accessed on 24 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nieke"&gt;NieKE [http://www.ernaehrungswirtschaft.de/index.php?con_cat=1&amp;con_lang=1&amp;sid=tjobhkkso3ipbpnq141jgagml5 About NieKE] Accessed on 24 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009 the University of Applied Sciences in Osnabrück and the DIL signed an agreement for a long-term cooperation for future research and education. As result of this cooperation a statewide new academic course was established for the fall semester 2008; the Bachelor of Engineering “Food Production Engineering and Business”. The German Institute of Food Technologies functions as one of the main coordinating bodies.&lt;ref name="fhosna"&gt;University of Applied Sciences Osnabrück [http://www.fh-osnabrueck.de/722+M5ade6d7b14f.html New cooperation with DIL] Accessed on 24 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
Along with the [[University of Groningen]], the Netherlands and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] (TNO), the DIL founded the ICCF (International Competence Center Food and Research Development) as research collaboration. This project was established to link closer cooperation and integration between the German and Dutch parts of the [[Ems Dollart Region]].&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;
The German Institute of Food Technologies operates worldwide with customers from Japan, China, India, Australia and the USA. Among DIL's customers are [[Multinational corporation|global players]] such as [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]], [[General Mills]] and [[Barilla Group|Barilla]].&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;

===HighTech Europe===
[[Image:Hightech Europe logo.png|thumb|right|200px|Official logo of HighTech Europe]]
HighTech Europe is an initiative of European research organizations, industrial associations and enterprises with the goal of setting up a European Institute of Food Technology in order to share competences and knowledge of research available in Europe and to strengthen the resident industry for global competition. Long-term goal of the network of excellence is to achieve a long-lasting integration of the European R&amp;D activities into high-tech food processing.

The network is coordinated by the DIL and sponsored by the 7th EU Framework Programme EU research sponsoring. Currently, the network counts 22 members, 21 being from Europe and one from Oceania. Project aims have been implemented by creating and applying various knowledge transfer tools. Network partners identified potential innovations from the biotechnology, nanotechnology, information- and communication technology and other areas to be used by food industry especially small and medium enterprises. Result is a unique database for the food processing sector, the Food Technology Innovation Portal (www.foodtech-portal.eu). Further results and network activities are available on the project website.&lt;ref name="dilhichtech"&gt;HighTech Europe {{cite web |url=http://www.hightecheurope.eu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160108072229/http%3A//www.hightecheurope.eu/ |archivedate=8 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}.

'''Gold glass''' or '''gold sandwich glass''' is a luxury form of [[glass]] where a decorative design in [[gold leaf]] is fused between two layers of glass.  First found in [[Hellenistic Greece]], it is especially characteristic of the [[Roman glass]] of the [[Late Roman Empire|Late Empire]] in the 3rd and 4th century AD, where the gold decorated roundels of cups and other vessels were often cut out of the piece they had originally decorated and cemented to the walls of the [[catacombs of Rome]] as grave markers for the small recesses where bodies were buried.  About 500 pieces of gold glass used in this way have been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204-5; Lutraan, iii and 2 (note also); 8–9 Corning video&lt;/ref&gt;  Complete vessels are far rarer.  Many show religious imagery from Christianity, traditional Greco-Roman religion and its various cultic developments, and in a few examples Judaism. [[List of gold-glass portraits|Others show portraits of their owners]], and the finest are "among the most vivid portraits to survive from Early Christian times. They stare out at us with an extraordinary stern and melancholy intensity".&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, Pt 2, "The Catacombs" at illustration 7.7&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 1st century AD the technique was also used for the gold colour in [[mosaic]]s.

Various different techniques may sometimes also be described as "gold glass". [[Zwischengoldglas]] is very similar but the two layers of glass are cemented, not fused. It mostly comes from Germany and [[Bohemia]] from the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Verre églomisé]] properly covers a single layer of glass which is [[gilding|gilded]] (or coated with other types of metal leaf) on the back, as used in 19th century shop signs and the like. One process was revived by Jean-Baptise Glomy (1711–1786), hence the name. Both of these processes were also used in ancient times, and the German and French languages often use their native terms for what is called "gold glass" in English. [[Gold ruby glass]] or "cranberry glass" is actually red, coloured by the addition of [[gold(III) oxide|gold oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.cmog.org/research/glass-dictionary/g#gold-glasses Corning Museum "Glass glossary"] entries for all these terms&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Gold-band glass''' is another ancient technique covered below.

==Technique==
The manufacturing process for gold glass was difficult and required great skill.  For a Late Roman glass, first a small round flat disc, typically about three to five inches across, was cut away from a [[glass-blowing|blown]] sphere with a flattened bottom, either made of coloured or plain glass.  A piece of gold leaf was then glued to this with [[gum arabic]].  The design was created by scraping away gold leaf.  The main vessel, a cup or bowl, was formed by blowing and cutting, with a flat bottom the same size as the first disc.  This was then heated again and carefully lowered onto the disc with the design, superimposing the flat bottom with the disc with the design so that they fused together.  The complete vessel was then heated a final time to complete the fusing.  Different accounts of different periods vary somewhat as to the precise sequence of stages and other details, but the process is essentially the same.&lt;ref&gt;Corning video; see also the [http://www.cmog.org/research/glass-dictionary/g#gold-glasses Corning Museum "Glass glossary"], which appears to somewhat contradict the video.&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger [[Hellenistic glass]] bowls are thought to have been formed using [[moulds]] rather than blown, as the whole bowl is doubled and the inner and outer vessels must fit together exactly.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 190&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of gold-glass portraits|Some of the finer later medallions]] seem to have been made as such from the start, and some contain pigments other than the gold.&lt;ref&gt;Example from the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] showing both features; also Gennadios and the Brescia portrait&lt;/ref&gt;  These smoother-edged medallions exploited the medium of glass as a matrix for [[portrait miniature]]s, and it has proved to be a very effective one, outlasting all alternatives except for precious metal and [[engraved gem]]s. They were probably initially made to be hung for display, or set in jewellery in smaller examples like that of Gennadios, but were also used for funerary purposes, and often use a base of blue glass.  They are a few Roman examples of vessels from Cologne of a different style where several of what have been called "sidewall blobs", small gold glass medallions about 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm across, with images, are fused into the walls of a vessel&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204; Lutraan, 3–4 and note, now British Museum; Vickers, 612–613 has the best photos of "blobs"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roman - Bowl - Walters 4784 - View A.jpg|thumb|left|Roman bowl with gold band glass]]

Apart from roundels with figurative images the fused sandwich technique was used to create the [[tesserae]] for gold in [[mosaic]]s, and for beads and the like. Gold glass tesserae, at least by Byzantine times, had a very thin top layer of glass, which was probably poured onto the lower glass with the gold leaf glued to it. Tesserae were made in blocks or "cakes" and then cut into cubes, which are relatively large in the case of gold backgrounds.  Gold backgrounds were laid over earth red or [[yellow ochre]] backgrounds which enhanced their visual effect.  Most colours of tesserae seem to have been made locally to the mosaic, but there is some discussion as to whether this was true for gold glass ones.  In the 11th century the relatively new Christian centre of [[Kiev]] seems to have used gold tesserae made in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, 388–391; Grove, 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman gold glass beads were made by using an inner tube or rod to which the gold leaf was stuck.  A larger tube was slid over that and the beads crimped off.  Easily transported and very attractive, Roman gold glass beads have been found as far outside the Empire as the [[Wari-Bateshwar ruins]] in [[Bangladesh]], and sites in China, [[Korea]], [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 91–93&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gold-band glass''' is a related Hellenistic and Roman technique, where strips of gold leaf, sandwiched between colourless glass, are used as part of the marbling effect in [[onyx glass]].  It is mostly found in small perfume bottles and the like.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rgld/hd_rgld.htm Trentinella, Rosemarie.

==Grave-markers==
[[File:Dougga Banquet.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Dougga]] banquet scene, 3rd century (see text)]] 
The most common form of vessel in late Roman examples was a bowl or drinking cup, which are thought to have been originally family gifts for weddings, anniversaries, New Year, the various religious festivals and the like, in some cases perhaps presented at birth or Christian baptism.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 25; Weitzmann no. 396; Rudgers, 85&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the type of gold glass vessels cut down as grave-markers has survived complete, though about 500 of the cut-off bottoms are known,&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204; Lutraan, iii and 2 (note also), 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; but since so many have inscriptions encouraging the owner to drink, they are usually referred to as "cups" or "glasses".  However Roman drinking cups and glasses were often very wide and shallow, though tall straight-sided or slightly flared shapes like modern [[List of glassware#Tumblers|tumblers]] are also found.  A mosaic in the North African ruins of [[Dougga]] shows two hefty slaves pouring wine from ''[[amphorae]]'' into two shallow bowls held by slaves waiting on the banquet. The two ''amphorae'' are inscribed with "ΠΙΕ" and "ΣΗϹΗϹ" the Greek originals of the toasting formulae "pie zeses" ("Drink, may you live", discussed below) so common on Roman glasses, and it has been suggested that the mosaic shows the shape a complete cup would have had.&lt;ref&gt;by Smith, see Lutraan, 75 and note 197&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:KHM Wien Zwischengoldglas Ehepaar XIa 35.jpg|thumb|300px|4th century married couple, inscribed "PIE ZESES" ("Drink, may you live")]]
[[File:Gold-glass portrait of husband and wife (Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Museo Sacro, Inv. no. 743).jpg|thumb|3rd-century quality portrait of a couple]]

At what was probably a much later date, perhaps after decades of use, on the death of the owner the main vessel of undecorated glass was cut away and trimmed to leave only the gold glass roundel, which was then used in the catacombs as a grave marker.  Presumably in many cases the cup had already broken in the normal course of use, and the thick bottom with the decoration had been preserved for later use in this way.  Bodies were buried in the catacombs in small recesses called ''loculi'', stacked one above another mostly along narrow corridors hollowed out from the soft rock, and no doubt some form of marker was necessary for visitors to locate the right spot.  They may also have functioned as a seal on the grave, as they were pressed into the mortar or [[stucco]] forming the final surface of the wall of the ''loculus''; other classes of small decorative objects were also used in the same way.  They may also have been regarded as capable of warding off evil spirits, especially in the later part of the period, when portraits of saints become most common.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 84–85; Grig, 204–209, and throughout; Beckwith, 25; Honour and Fleming, Pt 2, "The Catacombs" at illustration 7.6; Lutraan, 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;  The very untidy trimming of many examples may be explained by this; an example in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] is still attached to a chunk of mortar round much of its edge, showing that the mortar overlapped the edge of the glass.  Rough edges would mostly have been hidden by the mortar and also provided a firmer key for the mortar to hold the glass in place (as it happens the edges of the New York piece are unusually neatly trimmed).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170003396# Bowl Base with Christ Giving Martyrs’ Crowns to Saints Peter and Paul], MMA online, accn. 11.91.4; see also Lutraan, 5 and note 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pieces of gold glass had portraits of private individuals, mostly married couples, who may have included the deceased, while others had portraits of religious figures such as saints, or religious symbols. This custom was followed by Christian, Jewish (13 identifiably Jewish examples are known) and pagan Romans. The different sets of imagery, apart from the increased number of private portraits, are typical of the paintings also found in the catacombs and other [[Early Christian art]] and its Jewish equivalent from the period.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 25–26; For Jewish material, Rudgers, 81–85 (13 examples on 81); Weitzmann p. 371 and numbers 347 ff.; Lutraan, 12 and throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  As Christian art developed in the late 4th and 5th centuries, its changes are reflected in the subjects and their treatment in gold glass, before the catacombs ceased to be used and the supply of examples ends.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 503, 507–8, 510 are late examples&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hellenistic period==
The technique was used in [[Hellenistic]] times, and Hellenistic examples are generally both more technically ambitious than Roman ones, with wide bowls or drinking cups decorated all round their curved sides in gold glass, and executed with more artistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/130011897?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=%22gold+glass%22&amp;pos=1 Gold-glass skyphos (drinking cup) fragment], Metropolitan Museum of Art (23.160.76)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Museum]] has a virtually complete bowl (broken but repaired) 19.3&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 11.4&amp;nbsp;cm high, one of two from a tomb in [[Canosa]] in [[Apulia]] dating to around 270–160 BC. It has most of the interior very finely decorated with [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] and [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] motifs, which are more typical of gold glass in this period than designs with human figures.  There are a handful of other near complete examples, and rather more fragments.  These pieces are usually assigned to [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, which is often seen as the originating centre for luxury Hellenistic glass, and is mentioned as the source of over-elaborate glass by the 1st century [[satirist]] [[Martial]] and other sources; one seems to show a [[Nile|Nilotic]] landscape, though this was a popular subject elsewhere.  However fragments have been found when excavating a glass factory on [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Rotroff, 333&lt;/ref&gt;  A description perhaps dating from the 270s BC (surviving in the works of the later writer [[Athenaeus]]) mentions two vessels that are ''diachysa'' ("with gold in it") and very likely made by this technique.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/s/sandwich_gold-glass_bowl.aspx "Sandwich gold-glass bowl"], British Museum online highlights; Williams, 190. Though textually very similar, these differ over the dating, with the book (2009) saying 210–160 BC and the website (in May 2013) 270–200 BC.

==Roman period==

Gold glass mosaic tesserae begin to be used in domestic mosaics in the 1st century AD, with Rome apparently the first location. They continued to be used throughout the ancient and medieval periods into the modern day. By around 400 gold began to be used as the background colour for Christian religious mosaics, as it was throughout the Byzantine period.&lt;ref&gt;Conventi, 1–3; specifically, "[http://www.mosaicmatters.co.uk/news/news_confonbyzglass.htm the earliest known use of gold tesserae was in 55 AD, in the Gardens of Lucullus by the Spanish Steps in Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decorated late Roman pieces are usually assumed to have been made in and around Rome, especially in the case of portraits of residents there, but also in the [[Rhineland]] around [[Cologne]] and [[History of Trier|Augusta Treverorum]], modern [[Trier]], which was a centre for other luxury glass products like [[cage cup]]s.  Alexandria is still thought to have been a major centre, and from linguistic analysis of the inscriptions it has been suggested that the technique, and perhaps the actual artists and craftsmen, reached Rome and Germany from there.  Yet it may just be a coincidence of survival that the other large body of "middle-class" portraiture from the period is the [[Fayum mummy portraits]] from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 25; Hennig, 215&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the Rhineland finds discussed below, small numbers of cut-off vessel bases have been found in northern Italy and modern [[Hungary]] and [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gennadios medallion in New York, illustrated above, is a fine example of an Alexandrian portrait on blue glass, using a rather more complex technique and naturalistic style than most Roman examples, including painting onto the gold to create shading, and with the Greek inscription showing local [[dialect]] features.  He had perhaps been given or commissioned the piece to celebrate victory in a musical competition.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, no. 264, entry by J.D.B.; see also no. 265; [http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170006564 Medallion with a Portrait of Gennadios], Metropolitan Museum of Art, with better image.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous Alexandrian-style portrait medallions, with an inscription in Egyptian Greek, was later mounted in an [[Early Medieval]] [[crux gemmata]] in [[Brescia]], in the mistaken belief that it showed the pious empress and [[Ostrogoths|Gothic]] queen [[Galla Placida]] (died 450) and her children;&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 338–340; Beckwith, 25&lt;/ref&gt; in fact the knot in the central figure's dress may mark a devotee of [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, 611&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait in the Brescia medallion also shares clear stylistic features with the [[Fayum mummy portraits]] of [[Roman Egypt]], in addition to a Greek inscription in the [[Alexandria]]n dialect of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of scholarly research on the Brescia Medallion, see Daniel Thomas Howells (2015). "[https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Late_Antique_Gold_Glass_online.pdf A Catalogue of the Late Antique Gold Glass in the British Museum (PDF).]" London: the British Museum (Arts and Humanities Research Council), p. 7. Accessed 2 October 2016.).
&lt;br&gt;"''Other important contributions to scholarship included the publication of an extensive summary of gold glass scholarship under the entry ‘Fonds de coupes’ in Fernand Cabrol and Henri Leclercq’s comprehensive Dictionnaire d’archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie in 1923. Leclercq updated Vopel’s catalogue, recording 512 gold glasses considered to be genuine, and developed a typological series consisting of eleven iconographic subjects: biblical subjects; Christ and the saints; various legends; inscriptions; pagan deities; secular subjects; male portraits; female portraits; portraits of couples and families; animals; and Jewish symbols. In a 1926 article devoted to the brushed technique gold glass known as the Brescia medallion (Pl. 1), Fernand de Mély challenged the deeply ingrained opinion of Garrucci and Vopel that all examples of brushed technique gold glass were in fact forgeries. The following year, de Mély’s hypothesis was 
supported and further elaborated upon in two articles by different scholars. A case for the Brescia medallion’s authenticity was argued for, not on the basis of its iconographic and orthographic similarity with pieces from Rome (a key reason for Garrucci’s dismissal), but instead for its close similarity to the Fayoum mummy portraits from Egypt. Indeed, this comparison was given further credence by Walter Crum’s assertion that the Greek inscription on the medallion was written in the Alexandrian dialect of Egypt. De Mély noted that the medallion and its inscription had been reported as early as 1725, far too early for the idiosyncrasies of Graeco-Egyptian word endings to have been understood by forgers.''"
&lt;br&gt;"''Comparing the iconography of the Brescia medallion with other more closely dated objects from Egypt, Hayford Peirce then proposed that brushed technique medallions were produced in the early 3rd century, whilst de Mély himself advocated a more general 3rd-century date. With the authenticity of the medallion more firmly established, Joseph Breck was prepared to propose a late 3rd to early 4th century date for all of the brushed technique cobalt blue-backed portrait medallions, some of which also had Greek inscriptions in the Alexandrian dialect. Although considered genuine by the majority of scholars by this point, the unequivocal authenticity of these glasses was not fully established until 1941 when Gerhart Ladner discovered and published a photograph of one such medallion still in situ, where it remains to this day, impressed into the plaster sealing in an individual loculus in the Catacomb of Panfilo in Rome (Pl. 2). Shortly after in 1942, Morey used the phrase ‘brushed technique’ to categorize this gold glass type, the iconography being produced through a series of small incisions undertaken with a gem cutter’s precision and lending themselves to a chiaroscuro-like effect similar to that of a fine steel engraving simulating brush strokes.''"&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of a group of 14 pieces dating to the 3rd century AD, all individualized secular portraits of high quality.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 207&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Jás Elsner (2007) contends that the Brescia medallion, likely depicting a family from Alexandria since the inscription is in the [[Greeks in Egypt|Alexandrian dialect of Greek]], has a range of possible dates ranging from the early-3rd to mid-5th century AD, before it found its way to Italy where it adorned a 7th-century [[Christian cross]].&lt;ref name="elsner 2007 p 17 fig p 18"&gt;Jás Elsner (2007).

It is thought that the tiny detail of pieces such as these can only have been achieved using [[lens (optics)|lens]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Sines and Sakellarakis, 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the refined "Alexandrian" medallions, wherever they were actually produced, mostly have a simple thin gold line framing the subject, the Roman examples have a variety of heavier frames, often using two round borders, the style of which forms part of efforts to group them by workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 83&lt;/ref&gt;  The level of portraiture is rudimentary, with features, hairstyles and clothes all following stereotypical styles.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 207; Lutraan, 29–45 goes into considerable detail&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:KHM Wien Zwischengoldglas Heilige XIa 37.jpg|thumb|300px|Two Christian saints, 4th century]]

An "Alexander plate with hunting scene" in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] is, if genuine,&lt;ref&gt;Presumably the piece described by Vickers (p. 610) as "widely suspected to be a modern forgery"&lt;/ref&gt; a very rare example of a complete vessel decorated with gold glass, and comes from the upper elite of Roman society.  It is a shallow bowl or plate 25.7&amp;nbsp;cm (10 1/8 inches) in diameter and 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm (1 3/4 inches) high. The decorated flat roundel in the centre takes about two thirds of the whole diameter. It shows a mounted huntsman with a spear pursuing two [[elk]], while beneath his horse a huntsman on foot with a hound on a leash confronts a [[wild boar]]. The Latin inscription "{{lang|la|ALEXANDER HOMO FELIX PIE ZESES CUM TUIS}}" means "Alexander fortunate man, drink, may you live, together with yours".  The identity of "Alexander" has been the subject of discussion, but he is on the whole though to be an unknown aristocrat rather than [[Alexander the Great]] or the Emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (reigned 232–235). The dish is perhaps slightly later than his reign and at least during his reign he could never be addressed as merely a "man".&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, no. 79, entry by R.B., which translates the inscription "Alexander, fortunate man, may you live [long] with your family and friends in affection" – a more literal version is given here; [http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1969.68?collection_search_query=Gold+glass&amp;year_operator=1&amp;year=400&amp;year_era=1&amp;year_end=&amp;year_end_era=1&amp;op=search&amp;form_build_id=form-1kMpg1FTVNs9NMt11E5m_8sn7Wqte6vJABKNb5yRWiE&amp;form_id=clevelandart_collection_search_form Cleveland Museum of Art], online collection image. The object was not on display in May 2013. It was intact in about 1900 but broken in 1968, then repaired. The image from Cleveland show large areas of the undecorated glass missing, that are present in Weitzmann's black-and-white photo.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek drinking toast ZHCAIC given in Latin letters as ZESES, meaning "live!" or "may you live", is a very common part of inscriptions on gold glass,&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 388, and 347–348 etc; Lutraan, 53&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes the only inscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170003564 Bowl Base with Miracle Scenes], Metropolitan Museum of Art (16.174.2)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is more common than the Latin equivalent VIVAS, probably because it was considered more refined, somewhat like the modern "bon appétit" used in English.  Two glasses including images of Jesus "misspell" "ZESES" as "ZESUS", managing to achieve wordplay between a drinking toast and the name of the Christian saviour.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Gladiator in gold glass.jpg|thumb|left|Gladiator in gold glass]]

Such secular "blessings" are typical, and on roundels made from cups they often urge the owner to drink, even when the [[iconography]] is religious.  One Jewish example has the usual array of symbols and the inscription "Drink, [so] you may live, Elares".  The [[Wedding at Cana]] is a popular Christian subject, with one example inscribed "Worthy of your friends, may you live in the peace of God, drink".&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 347 and 396 respectively&lt;/ref&gt;  Another popular phrase is DIGNITAS AMICORUM or "[you are] the honour of your friends".&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of inscriptions are made up of either names or such conventional expressions, or the two combined.  An example inscribed "DIGNITAS AMICORVM PIE ZESES VIVAS" typifies the tendency to pile together the common phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;  The convivial dedications found on so many examples are paralleled by several of the far more luxurious [[cage cup]]s or ''diatreta''.

One round bottom from a larger bowl found in the catacombs is 10.8&amp;nbsp;cm across, and now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]].  It has five abbreviated scenes from the Old and New Testaments surrounding a married couple in a roundel, with the feet of the outer figures to the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Newby, 24–25 (with photo); Vickers, 610–611&lt;/ref&gt;  A large and complex bowl from Cologne was decorated all over with Christian scenes and Imperial portraits, but presumably because of its size (height 8.6, diameter 11.4&amp;nbsp;cm) no second layer of glass was fused on, so the gold has now all been lost, though the shapes of the design can be seen.  The portraits of the sons of [[Constantine I]] allow an unusually precise probable dating to 326, his ''[[vicennalia]]'', or the 25th anniversary of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 377. Made, found and still in Cologne, now [[Römisch-Germanisches Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another complete piece is a [[paten]] from the [[Basilica of St. Severin, Cologne]], founded in the 4th century.  This is decorated with roundels containing [[Old Testament]] scenes and floral motifs. According to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', [[Pope Zephyrinus]], in office from 199–217, had approved the use of glass patens, and ones in other glass techniques survive.&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 270&lt;/ref&gt;  A variant technique is only known from vessels from Cologne with what have been called "sidewall blobs", where small gold glass medallions with images are fused into the walls of a vessel; one of the few examples was found in the cemetery of St Severin.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204; Lutraan, 3–4 and note, now British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography of the vessel bottoms==
[[File:Gold glass Christian plate, 4th century.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Saint Peter]], [[Virgin Mary]] in [[orant]] pose, [[Saint Paul]], 4th century]]
Almost all the Roman vessel bottoms have imagery of some sort, and around 240 have legible inscriptions as well. Of these, about half of the total number of gold glasses known,&lt;ref&gt;As catalogued by Lutraan; most of this section uses her for quantitative statements&lt;/ref&gt; portraits are most common, but there are small narrative scenes, mainly Christian but a few pagan.  Portraits of Christian sacred figures are on about half the full corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 215&lt;/ref&gt; There are a small number of depictions of sports, animals, wreaths and the like, and a single example with a central image of a plant.  No Imperial portraits are recorded, nor military scenes; unlike so much Roman public art the glasses concentrate on the private interests of individuals.  Apart from a single near-naked [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and some figures of [[Erotes (mythology)|erotes]],&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; sexual themes are another notable absence compared to much Roman art.  Most glasses feature a single image occupying most of the round space within the border, but some have a number of small scenes, usually arranged in small circular frames around a central image. Most portraits are between bust and half-length.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, Chapter 2; Milburn, 270–272&lt;/ref&gt;  The small number of glasses with Jewish iconography are covered separately below.

Either portraits or inscriptions naming private individuals are very common, though other examples have no personalizing aspect and were perhaps just bought from a dealer's stock.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Portraits of married couples are at first most the common, but saints were more numerous towards the end of the period; the two are also often combined.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, reported by Lutraan, 11, 14, 17&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not always possible to distinguish the two confidently, despite ''[[titulus (inscription)|tituli]]'' inscriptions and a convention of using contemporary dress for owners and a conventional out of date costume for sacred figures, even recent male ones such as [[Pope Damasus I]] (r. 366–384). Damasus, exceptionally for a contemporary cleric, appears on at least four glasses, or at least it is thought he is who "DAMAS" refers to.&lt;ref&gt;"DAMAS" on 4 glasses per Grig, 5 per Lutraan; Grig, 208–215 and ff.; Lutraan, 31–32 and pages following, page 39 on female sacred figures who dress in more contemporary styles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saints Peter and Paul together are very common, usually facing each other in profile, but sometimes with other figures.  Both were martyred in Rome, and especially popular there;&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 40–42; Milburn, 270–272; Grig, 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; other local martyrs such as [[Saint Agnes|Agnes]] are depicted several times,&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 44–45, Grig, 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Lucy Grig "the ''Roman-ness'' of the saints portrayed on the Roman glasses is striking", and five popes from the 3rd and 4th centuries are probably depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 215–216, 215 quoted, 219–220 on popes&lt;/ref&gt;  Christ is shown in a number of examples, usually as clean-shaven and youthful, as well as figures such as the [[Good Shepherd]] which may symbolize him, or in some cases [[Orpheus]] or general [[bucolic]] imagery.  A small Christ may stand between the heads of a married couple, blessing them.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 42–44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orant]]s perhaps representing the soul of an owner when not identified as a saint, and as in the catacombs always shown as female, appear a number of times, and female saints and the Virgin are always shown in the orant pose.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 44–45; Grig, 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gold glass Resurrection of Lazarus, 4th century.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Christian ''[[Raising of Lazarus]]'', 4th century]]

Narrative scenes from the Old Testament are more common than miracles of Christ, as in the catacomb paintings, and the same "abbreviated representations" of scenes of deliverance feature: the story of [[Jonah]], [[Daniel in the lions' den]], the three youths in the [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego|Fiery Furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common scenes in later Christian art, centred around the liturgical calendar, are very rare.  There are really only two non-Christian narrative scenes: one labour of Hercules (two more are shown in "sidewall blobs"), and one of [[Achilles]], but a number of "portrait" figures, as with Christian sacred figures often combined with owners.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a small number of "agonistic" or sporting scenes, with wrestlers, boxers, one gladiator, and several racing chariot teams.  Several of these, like others seeming to represent victory in a musical or dramatic context, feature palms and crowns and may well have been presented to celebrate victory in these fields in some amateur or professional setting, like the Alexandrian Gennadios portrait.  Two identical glasses featuring two boxers with a trainer, all named, suggest that the glasses may sometimes have been ordered in sets; one may speculate that this may have been common.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;  Single examples show [[Athena]] presiding over shipbuilders, a pair of personifications of Rome and Constantinople, and female figures representing the ''[[monetae]]'' or mints, which are often shown on coins. A number have animals that may carry symbolic meaning, or objects such as scrolls or wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

The short inscriptions tend to be similar regardless of the content of the image, with names and the "convivial formulae" described above together or separately predominating. A religious implication (as may be intended in ''vivas'' or ''zeses'' for example) is relatively rarely explicitly stated.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan's chapter 3 analyses these, and chapter 4 discusses relations between the images and their accompanying inscriptions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The names are in the single ''[[cognomen]]'' form which is hard to relate to such records as survive,&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 62&lt;/ref&gt; but three glasses can possibly be related to known individuals who were potential owners, and one to a family (that of the poet [[Ausonius]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;  These persons are rather grand, and one might think belonged to the classes buried in [[sarcophagi]] rather than ''loculi''; the glasses perhaps belonged to ''"amici"'', clients or dependents, or had passed as gifts or legacies by the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 211–212&lt;/ref&gt;  One glass in the British Museum is unusual in a number of respects: between a named couple is a smaller figure of Hercules, and the inscription: "ORFITVS ET CONSTANTIA IN NOMINE HERCVLlS ACERENTINO FELICES BIBATIS" or "Orfitus and Constantia, may you live/drink in happiness in the name of Hercules of Acerentia".  This may well represent Memmius Vitruvius Orfitus, prefect of Rome, and his wife. [[Acerenthia|Acerentia]] in southern Italy had a local cult of Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/g/gold-glass_medallion_showing_h.aspx "Gold-glass medallion showing Herakles"]; Lutraan, 67–70&lt;/ref&gt;  For some historians Orfitus was "notorious as the propaganda mastermind of the 'pagan revival'" of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish glasses==
[[File:2nd century Rome gold goblet shows Jewish ritual objects.jpg|thumb|300px|Jewish ritual objects, Rome, 2nd century AD]]

Only 13 of the more than 500 known Late Roman vessel bottoms are identifiably Jewish, but these have still been said to represent "the most appealing group of Jewish realia that have come down from antiquity".&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 81. What Rudgers' figure includes is not absolutely clear (for example glasses with non-Jewish imagery found in Jewish catacombs).&lt;/ref&gt;  They are all presumed to have been used in the Roman catacombs as grave-markers, though as with the examples identifiable with other religions, the exact [[find spot]] and context of the great majority is unrecorded.  Rather surprisingly, the only two of the 13 with full histories were found in Christian catacombs, whereas the only gold glass remains found in Jewish catacombs have no Jewish iconography,&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 82; Grig, 228&lt;/ref&gt;  and show that "some Jews felt no qualm in using gold glasses with pagan iconographical motifs".&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 85; Elsner's article casts doubt on the whole notion of separate arts for Jews and Christians in the period&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifiably Jewish roundels do not feature portraits but with one exception have a fairly standard array of religious symbols.  The most common arrangement is on two levels, with two [[Lion of Judah|Lions of Judah]] flanking a [[Torah ark]] above, and below two [[menorah (Temple)|menarot]], a [[shofar]] (rams horn), [[etrog]], [[lulav]] and perhaps others of the [[four Species]], scrolls and vases.  Not all the tiny symbols can be confidently identified.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 347–348; Rutgers, 82. One finely painted example in the [[Israel Museum]] mentioned by Rutgers, 83 and with an image at the external link at the end of the article has two birds flanking the Torah ark and the lions with a single Menorah below.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, the objects are all in the top tier, above a banqueting scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170005829 Bowl Fragments with Menorah, Shofar, and Torah Ark], Metropolitan Museum of Art (18.145.1a, b), also in Weitzmann as no. 348; for another variant on this theme in the Vatican, see Elsner, 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;  The single exception to such compositions has what is thought to be a representation of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]], perhaps representing the feat of [[Purim]].&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars are confident that Jewish customers used the same workshops as those of the other religions, who presumably kept patterns for designs for all religions, or were provided with sketches.  Some of the attempts to group glasses by workshop attribute Jewish glasses and those of other religions to the same workshop.  Apart from the use of symbols rather than human figures, the Jewish glasses seem to have been used in very much the same way as those from other religious groups, which is also characteristic of other classes of Jewish artefacts from Rome at this time, where the Jewish community adopted many aspects of the general Roman way of life.  Of the 13 known, five have inscriptions including the phrase "''pie zeses''" (see above) and two "''anima dulcis''" (literally "sweet soul", equating to "sweetheart"), both very common phrases in Christian and pagan inscriptions. The rarer phrase "''vivas cum ...''" ("live with ...") is also found on Jewish and non-Jewish glasses.  They would seem to have been given as gifts on the same sort of occasions, and there is evidence that Roman Jews shared the general Roman custom of New Year present-giving.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 83–85, and more generally for shared artistic and cultural practices: 81, 85, 88 and throughout; Grig, 205 and note; Elsner, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later uses and collections==
{{main|List of gold-glass portraits}}
[[File:Gold-glass portrait of two young men (Bologna).jpg|thumb|4th-century portrait, now in [[Bologna]]]]
The technique continued to be used for mosaic tesserae, and at times for pieces that remained relatively large, for example in a small tile in New York with a pattern forming a cross, perhaps from a [[Syria]]n church of the 9th to 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/170008121?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=%22gold+glass%22&amp;pos=10 Metropolitan Museum of Art (46.174)]&lt;/ref&gt;  A small group of Islamic vessels are decorated with mostly simplified vegetal motifs and probably date to the 10th century from [[Syria]]; the most complete ones are decorated over a large curved area and must have been made by using a "double vessel" method.  In both respects these are closer to the Hellenistic vessels than most Roman ones.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzel, summary on p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

From at least the 17th century the Roman glasses attracted [[antiquarian]] interest and they began to be removed from the catacombs, in a largely disorganized and unrecorded fashion; now only a "handful" remain in their original position in the catacomb walls.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 4&lt;/ref&gt;   The first significant publication on them was by [[Filippo Buonarroti]] in 1716, ''Osservazioni sopra alcuni frammenti di vasi antichi di vetro ornate di figure trovati nei cimiteri di Roma'' ("Observations on some fragments of antique glass vases decorated with figures, found in the cemeteries of Rome"), in which he made the extraordinary, almost [[Romanticism|proto-Romantic]] assertion that the aesthetic crudity of early Christian art, often remarked by connoisseurs of Roman arts, had served to intensify the piety of the worshipper, an early expression of feeling for [[primitive art]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, 307 and note; [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19539 James Hall, "Michelangelo and the Etruscans", ''New York Review of Books'' '''53'''.17 · 2 November 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  After other studies, the Italian [[Jesuit]] [[Raffaele Garrucci]] published the first illustrated survey in 1858, with an expanded second edition in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, 307&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century a number of imitations, copies and downright forgeries of Roman pieces were made, mostly in [[Murano]] off [[Venice]], by firms such as [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, throughout; for example, no. 1043 in the catalogue of ''Roman Glass in the Corning Museum of Glass: volume three, Part 2'', ed. David B. Whitehouse, 2004, Hudson Hills, {{ISBN|0872901556}}, 9780872901551, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bBBkBJN_lJMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=Roman+gold+glass&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XIGKUbePI5Ko0AXW2YCwBA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Roman%20gold%20glass&amp;f=false google books]; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/projects/gold_glass_in_late_antiquity.aspx Gold glass in late antiquity: the British Museum collection]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major public exhibition of these seems to have been at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle of 1878]] in Paris, by Italian firms.&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of museums around the world have examples of Roman vessel bottoms.&lt;ref&gt;Apart from the Vatican, a blurb for Morey's catalogue mentions collections in: "Ostia Antica, Arezzo, Parma, Brescia, Turin, Catania, Florence, Bologna, Verona, Pesaro, Naples, London, Oxford, Barcelona, Tel-Aviv, Paris, Cologne, Bonn, Frankfurt, Wurzburg, Munich, Vienna and New York". (Abebooks)&lt;/ref&gt; The largest collection is in the [[Vatican Museums]], with the 60 pieces of Late Antique glass in the British Museum the second largest.  A research project on their collection was due to finish in 2010 (see further reading below).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/projects/gold_glass_in_late_antiquity.aspx Gold glass in late antiquity: the British Museum collection]; see External links for many photos of the Vatican's collection&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wilshere Collection in the Ashmolean is the third largest, with some 34 pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers describes the whole collection, on loan to the museum from [[Pusey House]] until bought in 2007. The glass is described at 609–613&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Corning Museum of Glass]] has 18 examples and the Metropolitan Museum in New York nearly as many.  The most recent of many catalogues since the 18th century are by C.R. Morey in 1959, with 460 Roman vessel bases, against 426 in S. Smith's thesis of 2000. The corpus continues to be expanded by occasional new finds.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7276">The '''Grit, not grass hypothesis''' is an evolutionary hypothesis that explains the evolution of high-crowned teeth, particularly in New World mammals. The hypothesis is that the ingestion of gritty [[soil]] is the primary driver of [[hypsodont]] tooth development, not the [[silica]]-rich composition of [[grass]], as was previously thought.&lt;ref name="jardine2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jardine|first1=Phillip E.|last2=Janis|first2=Christine M.|last3=Sahney|first3=Sarda|last4=Benton|first4=Michael J.|authorlink4 = Michael Benton|title=Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates and Glires|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=2012|volume=365-366|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional Coevolution Hypothesis==
Since the morphology of the hypsodont tooth is suited to a more abrasive diet, hypsodonty was thought to have evolved concurrently with the spread of [[grasslands]]. During the [[Cretaceous]] Period (145-66 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] called the [[Western Interior Seaway]] which began to recede during the [[Late Cretaceous]] to the [[Paleocene]] (65-55 million years ago), leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain. During the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs (25 million years), the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. The grasslands provided a new [[Ecological niche|niche]] for mammals, including many [[ungulate]]s that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Grass contains silica-rich phytoliths (abrasive granules), which wear away dental tissue more quickly. So the spread of grasslands was linked to the development of high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth in grazers.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Modern Evolutionary Hypothesis==
===Early Evidence===
In 2006 Strömberg examined the independent acquisition of high-crowned cheek teeth (hypsodonty) in several ungulate lineages (e.g., [[camelid]]s, [[equid]]s, rhinoceroses) from the early to middle Miocene of North America, which had been classically linked to the spread of grasslands She showed habitats dominated by [[C3 carbon fixation|C3 grasses]] (cool-season grasses) were established in the [[Central Great Plains]] by early late [[Arikareean]] (≥21.9 Million years ago), at least 4 million years prior to the emergence of hypsodonty in [[Equidae]].&lt;ref name="Stromberg2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Caroline A. E. Strömberg | year=2006 | title=Evolution of hypsodonty in equids: testing a hypothesis of adaptation | journal=Paleobiology | volume=32 | pages=236–258|url=http://depts.washington.edu/strmbrgl/StrombergLab_website/Publications_files/Stromberg_2006.pdf | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2006)32[236:eohiet]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Mendoza and Palmqvist determined the relative importance of grass consumption and open habitat foraging in the development of hypsodont teeth using a dataset of 134 species of [[artiodactyl]]s and [[perissodactyl]]s. The results suggested that high-crowned teeth represent are adapted for a particular feeding environment, not diet preference. &lt;ref name="MendozaPalmqvist2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendoza|first1=M.|last2=Palmqvist|first2=P.|title=Hypsodonty in ungulates: an adaptation for grass consumption or for foraging in open habitat?|journal=Journal of Zoology|date=February 2008|volume=274|issue=2|pages=134–142|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00365.x|url=http://webpersonal.uma.es/de/ppb/Hypsodonty%20in%20ungulates.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===
Further, examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes.&lt;ref name="MendozaPalmqvist2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009"&gt;{{Citation | author=Billet, Blondel, and Muizon | title=Dental microwear analysis of notoungulates (Mammalia) from Salla (Late Oligocene, Bolivia) and discussion on their precocious hypsodonty| journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of dental microwear patterns of hypsodont [[notoungulates]] from the Late Oligocene Salla Beds of Bolivia showed shearing movements are associated with a diet rich in tough plants, not necessarily grasses. That the relationship between high-crowned mammals and the source of tooth wear in the fossil record may not be straightforward, hence the spread of grasslands in South America, traditionally linked with the development of notoungulate hypsodonty, is in question.&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009" /&gt;

Observations of hypsodonty development in Cenozoic mammals is also supported by the evolution of hypsodonty in other groups. For example, [[hadrosaurs]], a group of herbivorous [[dinosaurs]], likely grazed on low-lying vegetation and microwear patterns show that their diet contained an abrasive material, such as grit or silica. Grasses had evolved by the Late Cretaceous, but were not particularly common, so this study concluded that grass probably did not play a major component in the hadrosaur's diet.&lt;ref name="AP0629"&gt;{{Citation  |title=Hadrosaur chowdown — grind, grind, grind |journal=Associated Press | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal Discontinuity===
Most importantly, evidence has shown, that the development of hypsodonty is out of sync with the flourishing of grasslands both in North America and South America, where grasslands spread 10 millions years earlier.&lt;ref name="jardine2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009"/&gt;

==Hypsodonty==
Hypsodonty is observed both in the fossil record and the modern world. It is a characteristic of large [[clades]] (equids) as well as subspecies level specialization. For example, the [[Sumatran rhinoceros]] and the [[Javan rhinoceros]] both have [[brachydont]], lophodont cheek teeth whereas the [[Indian rhinoceros]], has hypsodont dentition. A mammal may have exclusively hypsodont molars or have a mix of dentitions. Hypsodont dentition is characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=John J.|last2=Wyss|first2=André R.|last3=Charrier|first3=Reynaldo|author-link3=Reynaldo Charrier|title=South America's Missing Mammals|journal=Scientific American|date=May 2007|volume=296|issue=5|pages=68–75|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0507-68|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v296/n5/full/scientificamerican0507-68.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kwan-Tufts"&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10640">A relationship between '''handedness and sexual orientation''' has been suggested by a number of researchers, who report that heterosexual individuals are somewhat more likely to be right-handed than are homosexual individuals.

The relationship between [[handedness]] and [[sexual orientation]] has been suggested within both sexes and may reflect the biological [[etiology]] of [[sexual orientation]]; work by [[Ray Blanchard]] has linked the relationship to the [[fraternal birth order effect]], which suggests that a man with several older biological brothers is more likely to be homosexual. The theory is still tentative and not all research has been able to confirm the disparity between homosexual and heterosexual men.

== Studies ==

=== Lalumière et al., 2000 meta-analysis ===
Lalumière et al. conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of 20 studies with a total of 6,987 homosexual and 16,423 heterosexual participants. They found that homosexual men had a 34% greater odds of non-right-handedness, and homosexual women had a 91% greater odds (39% overall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lalumière, M.

=== Williams et al., 2000 ===
In a study involving 382 men—278 homosexual and 104 heterosexual—no significant association emerged between handedness and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Finger-length ratios and sexual orientation|url=https://www.msu.edu/~breedsm/pdf/breedlove2000.pdf|year=2000|author1=Terrance J.

=== Mustanski et al., 2002 study ===

Mustanski et al. examined sexual orientation and hand preference in a sample of 382 men (205 heterosexual; 177 homosexual) and 354 women (149 heterosexual; 205 homosexual). Although a significantly higher proportion of [[Lesbian|homosexual women]] was found to be left-handed compared to heterosexual women (18% vs 10%), no significant differences were found between heterosexual and homosexual men with respect to hand preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Lippa, 2003 study ===

Lippa examined sexual orientation and handedness in a sample of 812 men (351 heterosexual; 461 homosexual) and 1189 women (707 heterosexual; 472 homosexual). Homosexual men were 82% more likely to be non-right-handed than heterosexual men, but no significant differences were found between heterosexual and homosexual women in terms of handedness.  When combining men and women into one large sample, homosexual individuals were 50% more likely to be non-right-handed than heterosexual individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Blanchard et al., 2006 study ===

Blanchard et al. argued that the [[Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]] (the probability that a boy will be homosexual increases with the number of older brothers who have the same biological mother) appears to be limited to right-handed men. Moreover, the same study indicates that left-handed men without older brothers are more likely to be homosexual than non-right-handed men who have older brothers.  As Blanchard et al. said in their report, "the odds of homosexuality is higher for men who have a non-right hand preference or who have older brothers, relative to men with neither of these features, but the odds for men with both features are similar to the odds for men with neither".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== BBC survey ===
In a multinational online survey, it was found that gay men and lesbians are more likely to be left-handed (13 and 11%, respectively) than heterosexual men and women (11% and 10%, respectively). Bisexuals of both sexes more often described themselves as ambidextrous than gay or heterosexual individuals of the same sex (bisexual men: 12%; gay and heterosexual men: 8%; bisexual women: 16%; lesbians: 12%; heterosexual women: 8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/sex/articles/results/handedness.shtml|title=BBC – Science &amp; Nature – Sex ID – Study Results|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bogaert, 2007 study ===
In a study of 373 heterosexual and 538 gay or bisexual men, a link was found between non-heterosexual orientation and extreme right-handedness, but not left-handedness.&lt;ref name=boga&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anthony Bogaert|year=2007|journal=Neuropsychology|title=Extreme right-handedness, older brothers, and sexual orientation in men.|volume=21|issue=1|pages=141–8|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.21.1.141|pmid=17201537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blanchard, 2008 ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' study ===

A subsequent study by Blanchard found that both right-handed homosexual men and left-handed heterosexual men had a statistically significant number of older male siblings, but that there was no significant observable effect for right-handed heterosexual men ''or'' for left-handed homosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Blanchard, 2008 ''Laterality'' study ===

Blanchard discussed ways in which the [[fraternal birth order effect]] and handedness could be explained in terms of the maternal immune hypothesis. In this, the mother is assumed to grow more immune to male [[antigens]] with each pregnancy, and thus produce a greater number of "anti-male" [[antibodies]]. He suggests two possibilities; that non-right-handed fetuses are less sensitive to the antibodies, or that the mothers of left-handed fetuses do not, for some reason, produce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a sample including 694 gay men and 894 straight men, it was found that 13.9% of gay men and 15.9% of straight men were non-right handed, a non-significant difference.

[[File:David Playing the Harp 1670 Jan de Bray.jpg|thumb|250px|''David Playing the Harp''  by [[Jan de Bray]], 1670.]]
Knowledge of the biblical period is mostly from literary references in the [[Bible]] and post-biblical sources. Religion and music historian Herbert Lockyer, Jr. writes that "music, both vocal and instrumental, was well cultivated among the [[Hebrews]], the [[New Testament]] Christians, and the [[Christian church]] through the centuries."&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;Lockyer, Herbert Jr. ''All the Music of the Bible'', Hendrickson Publ. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that "a look at the [[Old Testament]] reveals how God's ancient people were devoted to the study and practice of music, which holds a unique place in the historical and prophetic books, as well as the Psalter."

The music of religious ritual was first used by [[King David]], and, according to the ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Music'', he is credited with confirming the men of the [[Tribe of Levi]] as the "custodians of the music of the divine service."&lt;ref name=Hindley&gt;Hindley, Geoffrey. ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Music'', Chartwell (1971), Ch. "Jewish Music"&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Irene Hesk notes that of the twenty-four books of the [[Old Testament]], the 150 Psalms in the [[Book of Psalms]] ascribed to King David, have served as "the bedrock of Judeo-Christian hymnology," concluding that "no other poetry has been set to music more often in [[Western civilization]]."&lt;ref name=Hesk&gt;Hesk, Irene. ''Passport to Jewish Music: Its History, Traditions, and Culture'', Greenwood Publishing (1994) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ancient musical instruments has been practiced for centuries with some researchers studying instruments from [[Israel]]/[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] dating to the "biblical period."&lt;ref name=Burgh/&gt;{{rp|145}} Archaeological and written data have demonstrated clearly that music was an integral part of daily life in ancient Israel/Palestine. Figurines and [[iconograph]]ic depictions show that people played [[chordophone]]s and [[frame drum]]s, and that the human voice was essential as women and men sang love songs along with laments for the deceased. Data also describes outdoor scenes of music and dancing in sometimes prophetic frenzies, often with carefully orchestrated and choreographed musicians and singers within specially built structures.&lt;ref name=Burgh/&gt;{{rp|106}}

According to ancient music historian Theodore Burgh, "If we were able to step into the . . . biblical period, we would find a culture filled with music . . . where people used music in their daily lives."&lt;ref name=Burgh&gt;Burgh, Theodore W. ''Listening to the Artifacts: Music Culture in Ancient Palestine'', T &amp; T Clark International (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; "Such music was capable of expressing a great variety of moods and feelings or the broadly marked antitheses of joy and sorrow, hope and fear, faith and doubt. In fact, every shade and quality of sentiment are found in the wealth of songs and psalms and in the diverse melodies of the people."&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|X}}

==Cultural influences==

===Egypt===
[[Egypt]] was among the oldest cultures of the [[Near East]] and had a highly developed musical culture dating back to around 3000 BC. Egyptian sources, however, include only pictorial relics, some instruments, and a few literary records concerned with performance practices. On various pieces of sculpture there are reliefs of harpists and flutists taking part in religious ceremonies and social entertainments.

A number of instruments have been identified as being used in Egypt, including the [[lyre]] (a type of [[harp]]), an [[oboe]]-like instrument, various drums from Asia, the [[lute]] and the [[sistrum]] (rattle). [[Mural]]s showing singers and instrumentalist performing have also been found. According to music historian Homer Ulrich, it is likely that Egypt influenced the "educational and ethical aspects of [[Greek music]]."&lt;ref name=Ulrich&gt;Ulrich, Homer. ''A History of Music and Musical Style'', Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc. (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} Stephen Batuk equally observed that the historical link of music was consummated during the week of creation where birds in the air make sounds which could be seen as music.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Sumer and Babylonia===
{{main|Music of Mesopotamia}}

Although records are minimal, it is known that between 3000 and 2300 BC organized temple music with singers existed in [[Sumer]] and [[Babylonia]], the oldest cultural groups in [[Mesopotamia]]. Excavations have uncovered several musical instruments, including harps, lutes, double oboes, and a few others.

Because of the political interrelations between the Hebrews and the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] nations of Babylonia, [[Assyria]], and the [[Hittite empire]], there were similarities between the Hebrew music of the [[Judea]]n people and the others. Jewish music began in the early years of tribal life, and the "references to music in the Bible are numerous," writes Ulrich.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt;{{rp|11}} After the Hebrews established a kingdom in [[Israel]], their musical activities were to increase substantially.

==Ancient Israel==
[[File:Miriam.JPG|thumb|18th-century painting, "The Song of Miriam," by Paulo Malteis, Italy. Celebration after crossing the Red Sea from Egypt]]
According to music historian Abraham Schwadron, "probably the most important musical contribution of the ancient Hebrews was the elevation of the status of [[liturgy|liturgical]] music in union with ritual ceremonies."  He notes the "high degree of musico-liturgical organization" from the descriptive accounts of King [[Solomon's Temple]], such as the 24 choral groups consisting of 288 musicians which took part in 21 weekly services.&lt;ref name=Schwadron&gt;Schwadron, Abraham A. ''Music of Many Cultures: An Introduction'', Ch. 16. Univ. of California Press (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the similar instruments used by the Hebrews which were also used in neighboring cultures, including [[Phoenicia]], [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]], and [[Greece]], Schwadron writes that "it would be accurate to state that . . . it is in the particular uses of music—sacred and secular, ethical and aesthetical—that ancient [[Jewish music]] made a unique contribution.&lt;ref name=Schwadron/&gt;

Music historian John Stainer notes that the earlier relationship between [[Abraham]] and the [[Canaanites]] "in all probability influenced future Hebrew music," and which probably caused his posterity to carry a certain amount of Assyrian music or musical instruments into Egypt. He adds that a stay of four centuries "in so civilized a culture as Egypt must have largely added to their knowledge of the art."&lt;ref name=Stainer&gt;Stainer, John. ''Music of the Bible'', Da Capo Press (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Although the ancient music of the Psalms and the other Bible books (which were all chanted), is often thought to be lost, the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible contains [[cantillation]] marks indicating a melodic line for the words. Following the French archaeomusicologist Suzanne Haik-Vantoura, some authorities now argue that these cantillation marks date from temple times and record the music sung in the temple. Attempts have been made to decipher them in modern musical notation.&lt;ref name=Haik-Vantoura&gt;Haik-Vantoura, Suzanne ''La musique de la Bible révélée (Robert Dumas: Paris, 1976)''; Mitchell, David C. ''[https://www.amazon.com/Songs-Ascents-Worship-Jerusalems-Temples/dp/1508745358/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427658006&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mitchell+songs+of+ascents The Songs of Ascents]'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Babylonian exile===
The musical traditions of the Temple were rudely broken by the destruction of the [[First Temple]] and the exile of the Jews in [[Babylon]] during the 6th century BC. Hindley notes that most of the [[psalms]] seem to have been written in the years after the return of the Jews to [[Jerusalem]]. At this time too the practice of [[antiphonal]] singing between the [[Hazzan|cantor]] and the congregation seems to have become common.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

The music of [[ancient Israel]] represents almost fourteen centuries of change, roughly from 1300 BC to 70 AD, when [[Titus]]' [[siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] took place. Stainer points out the lack of many artifacts during this period. He concludes that the "sad lack of national monuments relating to the Jews is not surprising, when it is remembered that Jerusalem stood about seventeen sieges, each of which was accompanied by more or less destruction, and that, too, at the hands of victors who seemed to take a malicious delight in effacing the national characteristics of those they conquered."&lt;ref name=Stainer/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===Second Temple destruction===
However, after the fall of the First Temple, Werner states that the fabric of dreams spun about its earlier music included reminiscences, visions, and fantasies, as the Rabbis took pains to eradicate both its choral and instrumental traditions. "Their time had arrived, and their ideas on liturgy and music were radically different from those of the Temple priests." Werner finds it paradoxical that modern day rabbis continue to praise the instrumental music of the Temple but prohibit any and all instrumental music in their synagogues today.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|18}}

The destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 AD led to the collapse of the Hebrew nation and the beginning of the [[Diaspora]] (dispersion or exile) of Jews to other lands, such as Spain, Italy, and the [[Rhineland]]. In these places, the synagogue would replace the destroyed Temple, with new liturgical services, prayers, and rabbinical writings oriented to mourning the loss of both the Temple and personal freedom.&lt;ref name=Schwadron/&gt;

==Christian period==
[[File:Vatican image.jpg|thumb|Fresco of angel playing a lute by [[Melozzo da Forlì]].]]
Very little is known about primitive [[Christian music]], notes Whitcomb, because like most of the ancient, it was unwritten. As a result, as songs passed from generation to generation, they grew very different from the original. However, she notes that "much of this early music derived its beauty from the [[Greeks]] and its holiness from the [[Hebrews]]."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; According to Ulrich, Hebrew music "was of direct and immediate influence on the musical practices of the early Christian church."&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; He cites Werner in noting that "the connections between Hebrew and Christian [[chant]] have been scientifically investigated and proved."&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;Werner, Eric. ''The Sacred Bridge'', Columbia Univ. Press (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical art of the [[Levites]], the Temple musicians who were named after their historic ancestors, was lost by the end of the 1st century. In 70 AD the [[Second Temple]] was destroyed by the troops of the [[Emperor Titus]] and in the years following the Levites along with the majority of Jews fled from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. As a result, the synagogue music of the [[Jewish diaspora|Dispersion]] lost the joyful character of that of the Temple and the large instrumental forces were dispensed with.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

The [[New Testament]] was not written until centuries later than the old and the music had attained much higher development, according to music historian Ida Whitcomb. As it related to Christ, it is called [[Christian music]]. However, there are but few allusions to it in three of the [[Gospels]]: in the [[Gospel of Luke]], there are the "Angels' Song," Mary's "Magnificat," and Zacharias's "Song." In [[Acts]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] and [[Silas]] sing behind prison-bars: the prison is shaken, the doors fly open, and they are free. In the [[Epistles]], there are but few references to music, but in [[Ephesians]] there is a "beautiful one," in which Paul exhorts the churches to sing "Psalms" and "spiritual songs."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

Hindley adds that antiphonal chants between cantor or priest and the congregation originated in Hebrew worship methods. At its peak around the beginning of the [[Christian era]], the elaborate music of the Temple was performed by a large [[choir]] of highly trained men singers, with boys sometimes added, and during this period many instruments also were used by the Temple orchestra.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

Whitcomb adds that many of our noblest Church [[hymns]] have been suggested by the [[Psalms]], which she notes was "the first hymn-book of the Hebrew nation and remains today not only the hymn-book of the Hebrew Temple, but also of the Christian Church."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb&gt;Whitcomb, Ida Prentice. ''Young People's Story of Music'', Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical instruments==
Among the earliest [[pictograph]]ic signs found have been of a boat-shaped [[harp]] found on a [[Sumer]]ian clay tablet dating back to 3000 BC, and an earlier depiction of this harp was also found in modern southwest [[Iran]] dating around 3200 BC.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|45}}

[[File:Bar Kokhba Coin.jpg|thumb|Bar Kochba coinage showing trumpets and a lyre, c. 132 AD]]
Many relics of musical instruments have been found in Palestine dating from the [[Hellenistic age]] giving details about the state, character, and practice of liturgical music.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt; In other cases, many musical instruments of the Hebrews mentioned in the Bible are identified by analogy with similar instruments found in other nearby cultures, such as Egypt and Babylonia. An example of some instruments mentioned in the bible can be found in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 3:5:
{{quote|text=that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music...}}

According to Jewish historian [[Josephus Flavius]], all details of the [[First Temple]], including its musical instruments, were made and viewed as "symbols of the universe," especially instruments like the [[kithara]] or [[lyre]]. In his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', Josephus explains that the musical instruments, along with other matters of Jewish religion, represent a perishable "image" of the [[cosmos]], or of "a cosmic Temple."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|1}}

===String instruments===
Lockyer notes that according to the [[Scriptures]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20–21). He points out that the harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of [[David]], and its use is found more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was "raised to its highest perfection under David" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that "It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14–23; 18:10–11).&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|46}} When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12).

Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the [[lyre]].  A similar instrument was the [[lute]], which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage]], were issued by the Jews during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Second Jewish Revolt]] against the Roman Empire of 132–135 AD [[File:Sack of jerusalem.JPG|thumb|[[Arch of Titus]] with silver trumpets]]

In addition to those, there was the [[psaltery]], another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to [[Josephus]], it had twelve strings and was played with a [[quill]], not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|49}}

===Wind instruments===
Among the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the [[cornet]], [[flute]], [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], organ, [[pipe (instrument)|pipe]], and trumpet.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|50}}

There were also silver trumpets and the double [[oboe]]. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome and from coins, that "the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound." He adds that in ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], these trumpets "appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to [[Torah|Mosaic law]] and were probably among the trophies which the [[Emperor Titus]] brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, "there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo)&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

The flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. "Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

The [[shofar]] (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the [[Jewish New Year]] services in Jewish communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], or to announce the death of a notable. "In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God," writes Werner.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|12}}

===Percussion instruments===
[[File:Miriams Tanz.jpg|thumb|Miriam and women celebrate the crossing of the Red Sea; [[Tomić Psalter]], 1360/63]]
Among the percussion instruments were [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[cymbals]], [[sistrum]], [[tabret]], hand drums, and [[tambourines]].  Percussion instruments are those producing tones by being struck in various ways and have been used by bands and orchestras throughout history.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|59}}

The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and [[The Exodus|crossed the Red Sea]], ''"[[Miriam]] took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance."''&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;

==Singing==
Whitcomb writes that "much of the most beautiful music of the Bible is contained in the Psalms," and the word "psalm" comes from the Greek word meaning "to sing, to strike lyre." The psalter or psaltery was one of the instruments which accompanied the Psalm.&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; The word soon came to signify any form of melody. The psalms were sung antiphonally or responsively, perhaps by the priest and congregation, or by two choruses.

According to Shiloah, most of the customs and ceremonies mentioned earlier, such as weddings or other celebrations, were accompanied by music made by women and attests to the importance of women's songs. But there were many instances where women sang alone or with friends and family. "The woman fortifies her spirit by singing to herself, and perhaps to her infant, who hears and absorbs the mother's confessions, longings, complaints, and dreams."  There were also "mother-songs, soldier-songs, grass-widow-songs, orphan-songs, and woman's-trade-songs." According to some, writes Shiloah, women's songs existed because of the need to compensate for the ban against public participation of women in synagogue rituals.&lt;ref name=Shiloah/&gt;

Ancient music historian Joachim Braun notes that Philo had mentioned ritualist vigils near Alexandria, that included a meal and the singing of hymns by a double chorus as accompaniment to the processions and libations.&lt;ref name=Braun&gt;Braun, Joachim. ''Music in Ancient Israel/Palestine'', W. B. Eerdmans Publ. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance==
According to biblical historian Amnon Shiloah, dance was directly associated with music and was an important aspect of various events, although the actual dance movements are nowhere described in detail. There is meager evidence about dance when compared with a wider variety found in Egypt. However, there are many biblical descriptions of occasions that inspired dancing in biblical times.&lt;ref name=Shiloah/&gt;{{rp|209}}

In the Bible, Mishnah, and Talmud, dance is referred to in various contexts, and in Megido, the Negev, and other sites in Israel, recently found iconographic remnants show dancing figures. In Judg. 21:21, a festival is described during which it was customary to dance in the vineyards. Dancing was also associated with celebrations of military victories and for welcoming home heroes. In Exod. 15:20, Miriam and the other women burst into song and dance accompanied by drums to mark the parting of the Red Sea which saved the people of Israel; Jephtah's daughter danced to meet her father returning from victorious battles (Judg. 11:34); the women of Israel came out to dance before Saul and David upon their return from fighting the Philistines (1 Sam. 18:6); the king and his subjects were also inspired to dance when the Ark of the Covenant was brought up to Jerusalem (2 Sam. Ch. 6).&lt;ref name=Shiloah&gt;Shiloah, Amnon. ''Jewish Musical Traditions'', Wayne State Univ. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210}}

==Musical traditions==

===Purposes of music===
The Bible mentions many uses of music including songs of praise, songs of victory, songs of mourning, and above all the Psalms. Dances were also a common music expression along with the combination of singing with instrumental music. During later times there was also a purely vocal music which prevailed for a period.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; According to Ulrich, music played an important part in both the secular and the religious life of the Hebrews. Kings and other leaders of the people were customarily acclaimed in songs and fanfares, and very elaborate musical services in the Temple, described in the Bible, were important parts of worship. There are, for instance, descriptions in the Bible of an orchestra consisting of nine lutes, two harps, and a cymbal.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; In other parts there are accounts of all-women choirs combined with singing and dancing to the men's percussion accompaniment. Werner adds that the choir's repertoire consisted of psalms, canticles, and other poetic passages from Scripture, although it may have contained some noncanonical texts. The choice of psalms is said to have been determined by God's activities on the first seven days of creation, and the verses which allude to them.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|13}}

Werner writes that "unique in the history of music is the firm belief in the purifying and sin-atoning power of the Temple's music, ascribed to both chant and instruments."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt; The music had to be free from blemish or fault, and avoided magical elements. Even the High Priest's garment had symbolism: (Exod. 28:34–35): "a golden bell and a pomegranate, round about on the skirts of the robe . . . and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the holy place before the Lord . . . " According to Philo and Josephus, the bells represented symbols of cosmic harmony.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Music training===
According to the text of the Mishna, the early musicians, both singers and instrumentalists, were strictly trained to be professional musicians with their average training lasting five years. Bible historian Alfred Sendrey notes a "sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]]." :"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of music===
Different types of music were also defined:&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; 
*'''Cantillation.''' Used when parts of the Bible were read during the service and parts of the text were sung or chanted.
*'''Antiphony''' (also referred to as responsorial singing). Since Hebrew poetry is based on parallelism (the expression of one thought in two different ways), several types of performances were possible: either by two separate alternating choruses, or by a soloist alternating with the chorus. At its peak around the beginning of the Christian era, antiphonal music was performed by a large choir of highly trained men singers, with boys sometimes added. According to Hindley, "Antiphony is among the debts owed by Christian music to its Jewish predecessor."&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;
*'''Hymn songs.''' Within the service they were performed by either a soloist, called the cantor, or by groups. Some of the hymns were freely organized with groups of melodic [[motive (music)|motives]] with their variants connected to create a continuous melodic chant.
*'''Orchestration.''' Werner writes that "the sound of the Temple's orchestra consisted of never less than twelve instruments and rarely exceeded thirty-six." The trumpets were never mixed with the rest of the orchestra—being used for signals exclusively. One pair of cymbals were used in Temple rituals also as a signal instrument, "not unlike the gong in the modern theatre."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;

===Written notation===
Musical notation in the modern sense did not exist during this period. However, the Hebrew alphabet allows for special symbols to indicate how the music was to be performed. The alphabet consists of consonants and half-consonants, and vowels are indicated by dots and dashes above and below letter symbols. In addition to the vowel signs, a number of other signs, called "[[Tiberian vocalization|masoretic]]," refers not to single notes but to "melodic particles or groups," writes Ulrich. These particles were handed down by oral tradition among singers for centuries and were first codified in the 16th century. Ulrich notes that the "Dead Sea Scrolls contain signs similar to those in the liturgical script of early Christian sects . . . strengthening the conjecture that a common musical heritage is shared by the people of related cultures . . ."&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt;

==Influence on later music==
Music historian William Smoldon notes that despite the fact that instrumental music was not revived and used in the synagogue after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 AD, (excluding the symbolic [[Shofar]] still used in orthodox communities,) "the [[chant]] continued, and of late years research has made it increasingly clear that many of the forms and even melodic patterns of the [[Byzantine]] and Western Christian chants were adaptations from the music of the synagogues."&lt;ref name=Smoldon&gt;Smoldon, William. ''A History of Music'', Dimension Books, Inc. (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also notes that after the collapse of the Western [[Roman Empire]], the "one steadfast feature was the Western Christian Church" which was "respected by the [[barbarians]]." He adds that there seems "little doubt that the worship-music of the early Church, i.e. at such centres as [[Jerusalem]], [[Damascus]], [[Antioch]] and [[Alexandria]], grew from materials . . . of Greek and Syrian origins, together with the service-chants of the Jewish synagogue."&lt;ref name=Smoldon/&gt;{{rp|20}}

;Psalms
The [[Psalms]] have been sung through all the ages up to the present. Whitcomb describes the importance of the Psalms:
:"the [[Crusades|Crusader]] has chanted them as he ascended the Hill of [[Zion]]; and the victorious general was welcomed on his return by a hallelujah chorus. The sailor on the dark night at sea, the shepherd on the lonely plain, the little waif upon the street, have alike been cheered by the music of the Psalms. They have enlivened the vintage-feast, the boatman on the Rhine, the soldier by his camp-fire have been softened and the sad have been cheered by these sweet inspirations to faith, [[penitence]], thanksgiving, and adoration."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

Lockyer writes that [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor and champion of the pope, requested passages from his favorite psalm, Ps. 90, be read to him as he lay on his deathbed in September 1558. In that psalm, "[[Moses]] contrasts the eternity of God with the transience of human life, and Moses ends his song with a prayer for God's forgiveness and favor."(Ps 90:1–6)&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|21}}

'''''Jus commune''''' or '''''ius commune''''' is [[Latin]] for "common law" in certain jurisdictions. It is often used by [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurist]]s to refer to those aspects of the civil law system's invariant legal principles, sometimes called "the law of the land" in [[English law]]. While the ''ius commune'' was a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[David John Ibbetson]], ''Common Law and Ius Commune'', p. 20 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; (''Ius commune'' is distinct from the term "[[common law]]" meaning the Anglo-American family of law as opposed to the civil law family.)

The phrase "the common law of the civil law systems" means those underlying laws that create a distinct legal system and are common to all its elements.

The ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'', in its historical meaning, is commonly thought of as a combination of [[canon law]] and [[Roman law]] which formed the basis of a common system of legal thought in Western Europe from the rediscovery and reception of [[Justinian's Digest]] in the 12th and 13th centuries.  In addition to this definition, the term also possibly had a narrower meaning depending upon the context in which it was used.  Some scholars believe that the term, when used in the context of the ecclesiastical courts of England in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, also "meant the law that is common to the universal church, as opposed to the constitutions or special customs or privileges of any provincial church."&lt;ref&gt;F.W. Maitland, ''Canon Law in England'', The English Historical Review, Vol. 11, No. 43 (Jul. 1896) pp. 446-478.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'' was an actual part of the law in most areas, although in any one jurisdiction local laws (statutes and customs) could take precedence over the ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}''. This was the case up until the [[Codification (law)|codification]] movement in the late 18th and 19th centuries, which explicitly removed the direct applicability of Roman and canon law in most countries, although there continued to be argument about whether the ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'' was banished completely or survived where the national codes were silent.

The latter view prevailed, so it can still be said that there is, in theory at least, a common basis in substantive law throughout Western Europe (except England, which never had a reception as such) although it has of course fragmented greatly from its heyday in the 15th and 16th centuries. More important, however, is the civilian tradition of ways of thinking that the ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'' encouraged and the procedures it used, which have been more persistent than the actual substance.

In England, the law developed its own tradition separate from the rest of Europe based on its own common law. [[Scotland]] has a mixed civil and common law system. Scotland had a reception of Roman law and partial codification through the works of the Institutional Writers, such as [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair|Viscount Stair]] and [[George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar|Baron Hume]], among others. Influence from England has meant that Scotland's current system is more common law than civilian, but there are areas which are still heavily based on Roman law, such as Scots property law.

According to the '''Life-span model of motivation''' the personal goals that individuals set are a function of the opportunities and challenges that are present in their social environment. Personal goals are an important determinant to the way individuals direct their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-01-01|title=Personal project pursuit: Goals, action, and human flourishing.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2006-11798-000|journal=APA PsycNET|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model introduces four key processes; channeling, choice, co-agency and compensation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salmela-Aro|first=Katariina|date=2009-03-01|title=Personal goals and well-being during critical life transitions: The four C's—Channelling, choice, co-agency and compensation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040260809000045|journal=Advances in Life Course Research|series=Linked Lives and Self-Regulation.

== The 4 C's ==
Developmental trajectories are ''channeled'' by the [[social environment]], which represents the "opportunity space" for development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, individuals are active agents in constructing their development, and hence make ''choices'' regarding their goals and commitments. Given that development occurs in a social context, others in the environment such as peers, family members or teachers have a role in ''co-regulation'' of development. And last, success and failures in personal goals and tasks serve as feedback and basis for ''compensation'' in order to optimize development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=C0zbcXRqyMIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Developmental+Regulation+in+Adulthood:+Age-Normative+and+Sociostructural+Constraints+as+Adaptive+Challenges&amp;ots=XfOdup072Z&amp;sig=g96rMe7VkZQwL1MvcrT5PktzLLo#v=onepage&amp;q=Developmental%20Regulation%20in%20Adulthood:%20Age-Normative%20and%20Sociostructural%20Constraints%20as%20Adaptive%20Challenges&amp;f=false|title=Developmental Regulation in Adulthood: Age-Normative and Sociostructural Constraints as Adaptive Challenges|last=Heckhausen|first=Jutta|date=2006-06-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521027137|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2504">In [[linguistics]], [[language]]s are often studied in terms of six major subsystems, which relate to major subfields within linguistics. In addition, particular subfields of linguistic inquiry may divide their subject matter into more specific subsystems. This list contains links to commonly studied language subsystems.

== Major subsystems ==

Linguists recognize seven major language subsystems:

* [[Phonetics]], the [[sound]]s of human [[speech]], including their physiological production, acoustic properties, auditory perception, and neurophysiological status;
* [[Phonology]], the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken [[human language]] ([[natural language]] or [[constructed language]]);
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]], the structure of meaningful units of a language, such as [[word]]s and [[affix]]es;
* [[Syntax]], the principles and rules for constructing [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, and the like in human languages;
* [[Semantics]], the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaningful]] content of words, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], or other language elements;
* [[Pragmatics]], the ways in which [[Context (language use)|context]] contributes to meaning in natural language use; and
* [[Lexicology]], the study of words.

This division varies among linguists and authors. For example, phonetics and phonology are occasionally merged into one subsystem. Morphology and lexicology can also be merged.

== Sociolinguistics ==

* The term ''[[Variety (linguistics)|variety]]'' in [[sociolinguistics]] is used as a cover term for dialects, registers, and other forms of language, including standard languages.
** [[Dialect]] refers to a variety that is used by a particular group of speakers.
** [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|Accent]] refers to a specific system of pronunciation.
** [[Idiolect]] refers to the variety that is used by an individual speaker.
** [[Register (sociolinguistics)|Register]] or [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] refer to a variety that is used in a particular setting or for a particular purpose.
** [[Standard language]] is a variety promoted by some social group, either officially or unofficially, as the preferred form.
* [[Abstand and ausbau languages]] are concepts developed by sociolinguists to describe related language varieties, ranging from dialects of a single language to distinct languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10901">A '''mode of toxic action''' is a common set of [[physiological]] and [[behavioral]] signs that characterize a type of adverse biological response.&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;{{cite book | author = Rand G | title = Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment | year = 1995 | publisher = CRC Press | location =Boca Raton, FL | isbn = 1-56032-091-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mode of action]] should not be confused with [[mechanism of action]], which refer to the [[biochemical]] processes underlying a given mode of action.&lt;ref name="escher02"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Hermens JL | title = Modes of action in ecotoxicology: their role in body burdens, species sensitivity, QSARs, and mixture effects | journal = Environ. Sci. Technol. | volume = 36 | issue = 20 | pages = 4201–17 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12387389 | doi =  10.1021/es015848h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modes of toxic action are important, widely used tools in [[ecotoxicology]] and [[aquatic toxicology]] because they classify [[toxicant]]s or [[pollution|pollutants]] according to their type of toxic action. There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants. Non-specific acting toxicants are those that produce [[narcotic|narcosis]], while specific acting toxicants are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.

== Types ==

=== Non-specific ===

[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Non-specific acting modes of toxic action]] result in [[narcotic|narcosis]]; therefore, narcosis is a mode of toxic action. Narcosis is defined as a generalized depression in [[biological activity]] due to the presence of [[toxicant]] [[molecules]] in the organism.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; The target site and mechanism of toxic action through which narcosis affects organisms are still unclear, but there are [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that support that it occurs through alterations in the [[cell membranes]] at specific sites of the membranes, such as the [[lipid bilayer|lipid layers]] or the [[proteins]] bound to the membranes. Even though continuous exposure to a [[narcotic]] toxicant can produce [[death]], if the exposure to the toxicant is stopped, narcosis can be reversible.

=== Specific ===

[[Toxicant]]s that at low [[concentrations]] modify or inhibit some biological process by binding at a specific site or [[molecule]] have a specific acting mode of toxic action.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; However, at high enough concentrations, toxicants with specific acting modes of toxic actions can produce [[narcotic|narcosis]] that may or may not be reversible. Nevertheless, the specific action of the toxicant is always shown first because it requires lower concentrations.

There are several specific acting modes of toxic action:
*'''''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation]]'''''. Involves toxicants that uncouple the two processes that occur in [[oxidative phosphorylation]]: [[electron transfer]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) production.
* '''''Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors'''''. [[Acetylcholinesterase|AChE]] is an [[enzyme]] associated with [[nerve]] [[synapses]] that it’s designed to regulate nerve impulses by breaking down the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] (ACh). When toxicants bind to AChE, they inhibit the breakdown of ACh. This results in continued nerve impulses across the synapses, which eventually cause nerve system damage. Examples of AChE inhibitors are [[organophosphates]] and [[carbamates]], which are components found in [[pesticides]] (see [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]]).
* '''''Irritants'''''. These are chemicals that cause an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] effect on living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. The resulting effect of [[Irritation|irritants]] is an increase in the [[volume]] of cells due to a change in size ([[hypertrophy]]) or an increase in the number of cells ([[hyperplasia]]). Examples of irritants are [[benzaldehyde]], [[acrolein]], [[zinc sulphate]] and [[chlorine]].
* '''''Central nervous system (CNS) seizure agents'''''. [[Central nervous system|CNS]] seizure agents inhibit [[cellular signaling]] by acting as [[receptor antagonists]]. They result in the inhibition of biological responses. Examples of CNS seizure agents are [[organochlorine]] [[pesticides]].
* '''''Respiratory blockers'''''. These are toxicants that affect [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by interfering with the [[electron transport chain]] in the [[mitochondria]]. Examples of respiratory blockers are [[rotenone]] and [[cyanide]].

== Determination ==

The pioneer work of identifying the major categories of modes of toxic action (see description above) was conducted by investigators from the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) at the Duluth Laboratory using fish,&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty93"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McCarty LS, McCarty D | title = Enhancing ecotoxicological modeling and assessment: body residues and modes of toxic action|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | year = 1993 | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 1719–1728 | doi=10.1021/es00046a001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escher10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Ashauer R, Dyer S, Hermens JL, Lee JH, Leslie HA, Mayer P, Meador JP, Warne MS | title = Crucial role of mechanisms and modes of toxic action for understanding tissue residue toxicity and internal effect concentrations of organic chemicals | journal = Integr Environ Assess Manag | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–49 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21184568 | doi = 10.1002/ieam.100  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKim JM, Schmieder PK, Carlson RW, Hunt EP | title = Use of respiratory-cardiovascular responses of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) in identifying acute toxicity syndromes in fish: Part 1. Pentachlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, tricaine methanesulfonate and 1-octanol | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1987 | volume = 6 | pages = 295–312 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620060407}}&lt;/ref&gt; reason why they named the categories as ''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes]]'' (FATS). They proposed the FATS by assessing the [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses of the fish when subjected to [[toxicity test]]s, such as [[locomotive]] activities, body [[color]], [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] patterns, [[cough]] [[rate function|rate]], [[heart rate]], and others.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt;

It has been proposed that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The CBR is the whole-body [[concentration]] of a chemical that is associated with a given adverse biological response&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; and it is estimated using a [[partition coefficient]] and a [[bioconcentration]] factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first [[approximations]] of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues,&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism, so this [[Heart rate variability|variability]] should be considered.&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The effects of [[mixture]] toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally [[additive map|additive]],&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; chemicals with more than one mode of toxic action may contribute to toxicity.&lt;ref name="escher10" /&gt;

[[Scientific modeling|Modeling]] has become a common used tool to predict modes of toxic action in the last decade. The [[mathematical model|models]] are based in [[Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship]]s (QSARs), which are [[mathematical models]] that relate the [[biological activity]] of molecules to their [[chemical structure]]s and corresponding chemical and [[Physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; QSARs can then predict modes of toxic action of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to reference compounds with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Russom and colleagues&lt;ref name="russom"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russom CL, Bradbury SP, Broderius SJ, Hammermeister DE, Drummond RA | title = Predicting modes of toxic action from chemical structure: acute toxicity in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1997 | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 948–967 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620160514}}&lt;/ref&gt; were one of the first group of researchers being able to classify modes of toxic action with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of toxic action, chemicals having multiple modes of toxic action can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.

== Applications ==

=== Environmental risk assessment ===

The objective of environmental [[risk assessment]] is to protect the environment from adverse effects.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Researchers are further developing QSAR models with the ultimate goal providing a clear insight about a mode of toxic action, but also about what the actual target site is, the concentration of the chemical at this target site, and the interaction occurring at the target site,&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; as well as to predict the modes of toxic action in [[mixtures]]. Information on the mode of toxic action is crucial not only in understanding joint toxic effects and potential interactions between chemicals in mixtures, but also for developing assays for the evaluation of complex mixtures in the field.

=== Regulation ===

The combination of [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses, CBR estimates, and chemical fate and [[bioaccumulation]] QSAR models can be a powerful regulatory tool&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; to address [[pollution]] and toxicity in areas where [[effluents]] are discharged.

The '''Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies''' ({{lang-no|Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter om vold og traumatisk stress}}, '''NKVTS''') is a national, government-owned interdisciplinary research centre in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It is part of the [[University of Oslo]], but is established by, funded by and receives its assignments directly from the [[Government of Norway|central government]]. Its major focus areas are [[violence]] and [[sexual abuse]]; [[disaster]] management, [[terrorism]], [[armed conflicts]] and [[traumatic stress]]; and [[forced migration]] and [[Migrant health|refugee health]]. 

[[File:Day after Oslo bombing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|NKVTS is involved in major research projects on the psychological and social impact of [[terrorism]], such as the [[2011 Norway attacks]]]]
The centre was established in 2004 through the merger of a part of the former ''Division of Disaster Psychiatry'' (KKP) of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] medical service, the former ''Psychosocial Centre for Refugees'' at the University of Oslo (PSSF), the ''Norwegian Resource Centre for Information and Studies on Violence'' (VOS), and the ''Norwegian National Resource Center on Child Sexual Abuse'' (NRSB) at [[Aker University Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Malt |first=Ulrik |author-link= Ulrik Fredrik Malt |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |encyclopedia= Store medisinske leksikon |title= Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter om vold og traumatisk stress |trans-title= |url= http://sml.snl.no/Nasjonalt_kunnskapssenter_om_vold_og_traumatisk_stress |year= |publisher= |volume= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Refugee children from Syria at a clinic in Ramtha, northern Jordan (9613477263).jpg|thumb|Syrian refugee children in 2013. NKVTS conducts extensive research on [[forced migration]] and refugee health; many refugees develop symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] or other [[psychological disorder]]s]]
[[File:Gullhaugveien 1-3.jpg|thumb|NKVTS' current offices in central Oslo]]
[[File:Ullevål universitetssykehus.jpg|thumb|NKVTS was located at [[Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål]] 2004–2013]]
The centre is a joint initiative of the [[Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services|Ministry of Health]], the [[Ministry of Justice and Public Security]], the [[Norwegian Ministry of Defence|Ministry of Defence]], the [[Norwegian Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion|Ministry of Labour]], and the [[Norwegian Ministry of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion|Ministry of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion]], and is funded directly by these government departments while organizationally being part of the [[University of Oslo]]. The centre was located at [[Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål]] 2004–2013, and is now located in [[Nydalen]], [[Oslo]], in the immediate vicinity of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security and of the [[BI Norwegian Business School]].

The centre has 94 employees (2016). It employs experts in [[psychology]], [[medicine]] (including [[psychiatry]] and [[pediatrics]]), [[law]], [[sociology]], [[criminology]], [[social anthropology]] and other disciplines, with the main emphasis on psychology and psychiatry. Its academic staff include 6 [[Academic ranks in Norway#Research professor|research professors]] (corresponding to full professors), 2 research professors II (part-time), 32 senior researchers (corresponding to associate professors), 6 researchers (corresponding to assistant professors) and a number of postdoctoral fellows, research fellows (doctoral candidates) and research assistants. NKVTS cooperates closely with the [[Department of Psychology, University of Oslo|Department of Psychology]], the [[University of Oslo Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]] and the [[University of Oslo Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] at the University of Oslo, where several of its research professors also hold professorial chairs.&lt;ref name="Aarsrapport2016" /&gt;

[[Nora Sveaass]], then research director for refugee health and forced migration at NKVTS, was elected as a member of the [[United Nations Committee against Torture]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/norwegian-psychologist-to-sit-on-un-comm/id419790/ Norwegian psychologist to sit on UN Committee against Torture], [[Government of Norway]]&lt;/ref&gt;

NKVTS has major research projects on the psychological and social impact of [[terrorism]], including the [[2011 Norway attacks]]. NKVTS also has several research projects on the psychological impact of natural catastrophes such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], and on [[child soldier]]s in [[Africa]], [[torture]], traumatised refugees, [[war]] victims and [[soldier]]s, [[child sexual abuse]] and [[sexual violence]], and [[Domestic violence|violence in close relations]].

The current Director of the institute is [[Inger Elise Birkeland]], a former political adviser to Prime Minister [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]].

[[B.E. Saunders]] of the [[Medical University of South Carolina]] has described the institute as "one of the most highly respected research organizations in the world dedicated to research on violence and traumatic stress. Since its inception, it has conducted a series of highly sophisticated studies focusing on a wide array of topics, including the prevalence and impact of different forms of violence and abuse among children and adults, mental health treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related problems, and how best to implement and incorporate evidence-based interventions practices into community service agencies. These studies have had enormous impact not only in Norway, but internationally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nkvts.no/content/uploads/2018/11/Saunders_NKVTS_letter_11-9-18.pdf |title= To Bent Høie |last=Saunders |first=Benjamin E. |date=9 November 2018 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the work by H. G. Wells|The Outline of History}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to history:

'''[[History]]''' – discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented (the beginning of  [[recorded history]]).


== Nature of history ==
History can be described as all of the following:
* [[Academic discipline]] – body of knowledge given to – or received by – a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] – academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

===Essence of history===
* [[Chronology]] &amp;ndash; science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time, such as in [[historical timeline]]s.
* [[Past]] &amp;ndash; totality of events which occurred before a given point in time. The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. The past is the domain of history.
* [[Time]] &amp;ndash; measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. History describes what happened where, but also when (in time) those events took place.

== Historical disciplines ==
* [[Archaeology]] – study of past human cultures through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data
* [[Archontology]] – study of historical offices and important positions in state, international, political, religious and other organizations and societies
* [[Art history]] – study of changes in and social context of art
* [[Chronology]] – locating events in time
* [[Cultural history]] – study of culture in the past
* [[Diplomatic history]] – study of the historical foreign policy and diplomacy of states 
* [[History of science]] – study of the emergence and development of scientific inquiry
* [[Economic history]] – the study of economics in the past
* [[Environmental history]] – study of natural history and the human relationship with the natural world
* [[Futurology]] – study of the future: researches the medium to long-term future of societies and of the physical world
* [[Historiography]] &amp;ndash; both the study of the methodology of historians and development of history as a discipline, and also to a body of historical work on a particular subject. The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches.
* [[Intellectual history]]
* [[History painter|History painting]] – painting of works of art having historical motifs or depicting great events
* [[Military history]] – study of warfare and wars in history
* [[Naval history]] – branch of military history devoted to warfare at sea or in bodies of water
* [[Paleography]] – study of ancient texts
* [[Philosophy of history]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Political history]] – study of past political events, ideas, movements, and leaders
* [[Public history]] – presentation of history to public audiences and other areas typically outside academia
* [[Psychohistory]] – study of the psychological motivations of historical events
* [[Social history]] – study of societies and social trends in the past
* [[Universal history]] – study of trends and dynamics in world history
* [[Urban history]] – historical nature of cities and towns, and the process of urbanization
* [[Women's history]] – study of the roles of women throughout history 
* [[World history]] – study of global or transnational historical patterns

The '''Piraeus Lion''' ({{lang-it|Leone del Pireo}}; {{lang-sv|Pireuslejonet}}); is one of four [[lion]] statues on display at the [[Venetian Arsenal]], where it was displayed as a symbol of Venice's patron saint, [[Saint Mark]].

== History ==
It was originally located in [[Piraeus]], the harbour of [[Athens]]. It was looted by Venetian naval commander [[Francesco Morosini]] in 1687 as [[plunder]] taken in the [[Great Turkish War]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], during which the Venetians [[Siege of the Acropolis (1687)|captured Athens]] and Morosini's cannons caused damage to the [[Parthenon]] only matched by his subsequent looting.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Athens, The Acropolis, p.6/20, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the statue can also be seen at the [[Piraeus Archaeological Museum]] and the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]] in [[Stockholm]].

The lion was originally sculpted in about 360 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Vermeule, "Greek Funerary Animals, 450-300 B. C.", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''76''':1:49-59 (January 1972), {{jstor|503610}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and became a famous landmark in Piraeus, having stood there since the 1st or 2nd century AD. Its prominence was such that the port eventually became referred to in Italian as Porto Leone ("Lion Port") as the port's original name ceased to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Goette, Hans Rupprecht (2001), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FRHY3zWyrcEC Athens, Attica and the Megarid: An Archaeological Guide]''. [[Routledge]]. p. 141. {{ISBN|0-415-24370-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is depicted in a sitting pose, with a hollow throat and the mark of a pipe (now lost) running down its back; this suggests that it was originally used as a fountain.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Henry (1833). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1K_TIaJxo8EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The British Museum. Elgin and Phigaleian Marbles]''. [[British Museum]]. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the description of the statue from the 1670s, which said that water flowed from the lion's mouth into a cistern at its feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jarring |first=Gunnar |authorlink= |title=Evliya Celebi och Marmorlejonet från Pireus |journal=[[Fornvännen]] |volume=85 |pages=1–4 |publisher=[[Swedish National Heritage Board]] |year=1978 |url=http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1970talet/1978_001.pdf |issn=1404-9430 |accessdate=5 September 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue, which is made of white [[marble]] and stands some 3&amp;nbsp;m (9&amp;nbsp;ft.) high, is particularly noteworthy for having been defaced some time in the second half of the 11th century by Scandinavians who carved two lengthy [[Runic alphabet|runic]] inscriptions into the shoulders and flanks of the lion.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. D. Kendrick|Kendrick, Thomas D.]] (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z8NgXgRytUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A History of the Vikings]''. Courier Dover Publications. p. 176. {{ISBN|0-486-43396-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The runes are carved in the shape of an elaborate [[lindworm]] dragon-headed [[scroll]], in much the same style as on [[runestone]]s in [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref name=BussLion&gt;"The Book of THoTH (Leaves of Wisdom) — Dragon" (notes), URL: [http://www.book-of-thoth.com/thebook/index.php/Dragon BT-Dragon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325220622/http://www.book-of-thoth.com/thebook/index.php/Dragon |date=25 March 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The carvers of the runes were almost certainly [[Varangians]], Scandinavian mercenaries in the service of the [[Byzantine Emperor | Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor]].

[[File:Lion runes drawing.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Drawing of the same inscription.]]
The inscriptions were not recognised as runes until the Swedish diplomat [[Johan David Åkerblad]] identified them at the end of the 18th century. They are in the shape of a [[lindworm]] (a flightless dragon with serpentine body and two or no legs) and were first translated in the mid-19th century by [[Carl Christian Rafn]], the Secretary of the Kongelige Nordiske Oldskrift-Selskab (Royal Society of Nordic Antiquaries).&lt;ref name="Rafn"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rafn |first=Carl Christian  |authorlink=Carl Christian Rafn |contribution=En Nordisk Runeindskrift i Piræus, med Forklaring af C.

This has required translators to reconstruct some of the runes, filling in the blanks to determine what words they represented.

There have been several attempts to decipher and translate the text. Below follow Rafn's early attempt (1854) and Eric Brate's attempt (1914), which is considered to be the most successful one.&lt;ref name="Pritsak348"&gt;[[Omeljan Pritsak|Pritsak, Omeljan]]. (1981).

'''Project Pericles''' Inc. is a [[non-profit]] organization composed of [[liberal arts college]]s and universities geared towards the ideas that social responsibility and participatory citizenship are essential parts of an [[undergraduate]] curriculum, in the classroom, on campus, and in the community.

==Background==
Conceived by [[Eugene M. Lang]], a retired businessman known for his educational philanthropy, Project Pericles seeks to counter the growing political cynicism and civic disengagement of young people. Convinced that higher education must promote social and civic engagement, in 1999 Lang organized a planning committee and consulted with college presidents, trustees, faculty, students, and others. By the end of 2000, the objectives, policies, and startup plans of Project Pericles were set. Ten colleges and universities became “founding Pericleans.”   

The Boards of the Pericleans formally committed their institutions to the policies and objectives of Project Pericles. Their presidents formed a Presidents’ Council to cooperate in policy-making and program development and implementation. The planning committee became the Board of Directors. Distinguished educational, business, political, and community leaders became the National Board of Advisors. 

In April 2003, the first ten Pericleans met in New York for the first national conference of Project Pericles. Delegates included presidents, provosts, deans, faculty, students, and alumni. In August 2003, Project Pericles established an independent office and hired Karen E. Holt as Executive Director. In November 2005, Jan R. Liss became its second Executive Director.

In 2004 and 2005, a select group of new Pericleans added to the diversity of Project Pericles. The spirit of Pericleans and cumulative experience continue to strengthen Project Pericles in its mission as a transforming force for higher education.

{{featured article}}
{{Use British English Oxford spelling|date=August 2016}}'''Radiocarbon dating''' (also referred to as '''carbon dating''' or '''carbon-14 dating''') is a method for [[Chronological dating|determining the age]] of an object containing [[organic material]] by using the properties of [[carbon-14|radiocarbon]], a radioactive [[Isotopes of carbon|isotope of carbon]].

The method was developed in the late 1940s by [[Willard Libby]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work in 1960. It is based on the fact that radiocarbon ({{chem|14|C}}) is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of [[cosmic ray]]s with atmospheric [[nitrogen]]. The resulting {{chem|14|C}} combines with atmospheric [[oxygen]] to form radioactive [[carbon dioxide]], which is incorporated into plants by [[photosynthesis]]; animals then acquire {{chem|14|C}} by eating the plants. When the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its environment, and from that point onwards the amount of {{chem|14|C}} it contains begins to decrease as the {{chem|14|C}} undergoes [[radioactive decay]]. Measuring the amount of {{chem|14|C}} in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died. The older a sample is, the less {{chem|14|C}} there is to be detected, and because the [[half-life]] of {{chem|14|C}} (the period of time after which half of a given sample will have decayed) is about 5,730 years, the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by this process date to around 50,000 years ago, although special preparation methods occasionally permit accurate analysis of older samples.

Research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years. The resulting data, in the form of a calibration curve, is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample's calendar age. Other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of {{chem|14|C}} in different types of organisms (fractionation), and the varying levels of {{chem|14|C}} throughout the [[biosphere]] (reservoir effects).  Additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s. Because the time it takes to convert biological materials to [[fossil fuels]] is substantially longer than the time it takes for its {{chem|14|C}} to decay below detectable levels, fossil fuels contain almost no {{chem|14|C}}, and as a result there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere beginning in the late 19th century. Conversely, nuclear testing increased the amount of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere, which attained a maximum in about 1965 of almost twice what it had been before the testing began.

Measurement of radiocarbon was originally done by beta-counting devices, which counted the amount of [[beta radiation]] emitted by decaying {{chem|14|C}} atoms in a sample. More recently, [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] has become the method of choice; it counts all the {{chem|14|C}} atoms in the sample and not just the few that happen to decay during the measurements; it can therefore be used with much smaller samples (as small as individual plant seeds), and gives results much more quickly. The development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on [[archaeology]]. In addition to permitting more accurate dating within archaeological sites than previous methods, it allows comparison of dates of events across great distances. Histories of archaeology often refer to its impact as the "radiocarbon revolution".  Radiocarbon dating has allowed key transitions in prehistory to be dated, such as the end of the [[Younger Dryas|last ice age]], and the beginning of the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] in different regions.

=== History ===
In 1939, [[Martin Kamen]] and [[Samuel Ruben]] of the [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley]] began experiments to determine if any of the elements common in organic matter had isotopes with half-lives long enough to be of value in biomedical research. They synthesized {{chem|14|C}} using the laboratory's cyclotron accelerator and soon discovered that the atom's [[half-life]] was far longer than had been previously thought.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by a prediction by [[Serge A. Korff]], then employed at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], that the interaction of [[w:neutron temperature|thermal neutrons]] with {{chem|14|N}} in the upper atmosphere would create {{chem|14|C}}.{{#tag:ref|Korff's paper actually referred to slow neutrons, a term that since Korff's time has acquired a more specific meaning, referring to a range of neutron energies that does not overlap with thermal neutrons.&lt;ref name="Korff_1949"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korff|first1=S.A. |year=1940|title=On the contribution to the ionization at sea-level produced by the neutrons in the cosmic radiation|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute |volume=230|issue=6|pages=777–779|doi=10.1016/s0016-0032(40)90838-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name="taylor269"&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acs.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/radiocarbon-dating.html|title=Radiocarbon Dating – American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had previously been thought that {{chem|14|C}} would be more likely to be created by [[deuteron]]s interacting with {{chem|13|C}}.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; At some time during World War II, [[Willard Libby]], who was then at Berkeley, learned of Korff's research and conceived the idea that it might be possible to use radiocarbon for dating.&lt;ref name="taylor269" /&gt;&lt;ref name="acs.org"/&gt;

In 1945, Libby moved to the [[University of Chicago]] where he began his work on radiocarbon dating. He published a paper in 1946 in which he proposed that the carbon in living matter might include {{chem|14|C}} as well as non-radioactive carbon.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;9–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libby|first=W.F.|year=1946|title=Atmospheric helium three and radiocarbon from cosmic radiation|journal=Physical Review|volume=69|issue=11–12|pages=671–672|bibcode=1946PhRv...69..671L|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.69.671.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libby and several collaborators proceeded to experiment with [[methane]] collected from sewage works in Baltimore, and after [[Isotope enrichment|isotopically enriching]] their samples they were able to demonstrate that they contained {{chem|14|C}}. By contrast, methane created from petroleum showed no radiocarbon activity because of its age. The results were summarized in a paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1947, in which the authors commented that their results implied it would be possible to date materials containing carbon of organic origin.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson_1947"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=E.C.|last2=Libby|first2=W.F.|last3=Weinhouse|first3=S.|last4=Reid|first4=A.F.|last5=Kirshenbaum|first5=A.D.|last6=Grosse|first6=A.V.|year=1947|title=Radiocarbon from cosmic radiation|journal=Science|volume=105|issue=2765|pages=576–577|bibcode=1947Sci...105..576A|doi=10.1126/science.105.2735.576|pmid=17746224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libby and [[James R. Arnold|James Arnold]] proceeded to test the radiocarbon dating theory by analyzing samples with known ages. For example, two samples taken from the tombs of two Egyptian kings, [[Zoser]] and [[Sneferu]], independently dated to 2625 BC plus or minus 75 years, were dated by radiocarbon measurement to an average of 2800 BC plus or minus 250 years.

=== Physical and chemical details ===
{{Main|Carbon-14}}
In nature, [[carbon]] exists as two stable, nonradioactive [[isotope]]s: [[carbon-12]] ({{chem|12|C}}), and [[carbon-13]] ({{chem|13|C}}), and a radioactive isotope, [[carbon-14]] ({{chem|14|C}}), also known as "radiocarbon".  The half-life of {{chem|14|C}} (the time it takes for half of a given amount of {{chem|14|C}} to [[Radioactive decay|decay]]) is about 5,730 years, so its concentration in the atmosphere might be expected to reduce over thousands of years, but {{chem|14|C}} is constantly being produced in the lower [[stratosphere]] and upper [[troposphere]], primarily by galactic [[cosmic ray]]s, and to a lesser degree by solar cosmic rays.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://theses.gla.ac.uk/2941/1/2011russellphd.pdf|title=Marine radiocarbon reservoir effects (MRE) in archaeology: temporal and spatial changes through the Holocene within the UK coastal environment (PhD thesis)|author=Russell|first=Nicola|publisher=University of Glasgow|year=2011|isbn=|editor=|location=Glasgow, Scotland UK|pages=16|arxiv=|bibcode=|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These generate neutrons that in turn create {{chem|14|C}} when they strike [[nitrogen-14]] ({{chem|14|N}}) atoms.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; The following [[nuclear reaction]] is the main pathway by which {{chem|14|C}} is created:
: n + {{nuclide|nitrogen|14}} → {{nuclide|carbon|14}} + p
where n represents a [[neutron]] and p represents a [[proton]].&lt;ref name="CES_476"&gt;Bianchi &amp; Canuel (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LJ_2001" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|The interaction of cosmic rays with nitrogen and oxygen below the earth's surface can also create {{chem|14|C}}, and in some circumstances (e.g. near the surface of snow accumulations, which are permeable to gases) this {{chem|14|C}} migrates into the atmosphere.  However, this pathway is estimated to be responsible for less than 0.1% of the total production of {{chem|14|C}}.&lt;ref name="LJ_2001" /&gt;|group=note}}

Once produced, the {{chem|14|C}} quickly combines with the oxygen in the atmosphere to form first carbon monoxide ({{chem|C|O}}),&lt;ref name="LJ_2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lal|first=D.|last2=Jull|first2=A.J.T.|year=2001|title=In-situ cosmogenic {{chem|14|C}}: production and examples of its unique applications in studies of terrestrial and extraterrestrial processes |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=43|issue=2|pages=731–742|doi=10.6028/jres.109.013|pmid=27366605|pmc=4853109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately carbon dioxide ({{chem|CO|2}}).&lt;ref name=Alves2018/&gt;
:{{chem|14|C}} + {{chem|O|2}} → {{chem|14|C|O}} + O

:{{chem|14|C|O}} + OH → {{chem|14|C|O|2}} + H
Carbon dioxide produced in this way diffuses in the atmosphere, is dissolved in the ocean, and is taken up by plants via [[photosynthesis]]. Animals eat the plants, and ultimately the radiocarbon is distributed throughout the [[biosphere]]. The ratio of {{chem|14|C}} to {{chem|12|C}} is approximately 1.25 parts of {{chem|14|C}} to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; parts of {{chem|12|C}}.&lt;ref name="Aitken_56-58"&gt;Tsipenyuk (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;343.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, about 1% of the carbon atoms are of the stable isotope {{chem|13|C}}.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;

The equation for the radioactive decay of {{chem|14|C}} is:&lt;ref name="Currie_2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Currie|first=Lloyd A.|year=2004|title=The remarkable metrological history of radiocarbon dating II|journal=Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology|volume=109|issue=2|pages=185–217|doi=10.6028/jres.109.013|pmid=27366605|pmc=4853109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{nuclide|carbon|14}} → {{nuclide|nitrogen|14}} + {{subatomic particle|electron}} + {{subatomic particle|electron antineutrino}}
By emitting a beta particle (an [[electron]], e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and an [[Antineutrino|electron antineutrino]] ({{subatomic particle|Electron antineutrino}}), one of the neutrons in the {{chem|14|C}} nucleus changes to a proton and the {{chem|14|C}} nucleus reverts to the stable (non-radioactive) isotope {{chem|14|N}}.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principles ===
During its life, a plant or animal is in equilibrium with its surroundings by exchanging carbon either with the atmosphere, or through its diet. It will therefore have the same proportion of {{chem|14|C}} as the atmosphere, or in the case of marine animals or plants, with the ocean. Once it dies, it ceases to acquire {{chem|14|C}}, but the {{chem|14|C}} within its biological material at that time will continue to decay, and so the ratio of {{chem|14|C}} to {{chem|12|C}} in its remains will gradually decrease. Because {{chem|14|C}} decays at a known rate, the proportion of radiocarbon can be used to determine how long it has been since a given sample stopped exchanging carbon&amp;nbsp;– the older the sample, the less {{chem|14|C}} will be left.&lt;ref name="Aitken_56-58" /&gt;

The equation governing the decay of a radioactive isotope is:&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;N = N_0e^{-\lambda t}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of atoms of the isotope in the original sample (at time ''t'' = 0, when the organism from which the sample was taken died), and ''N'' is the number of atoms left after time ''t''.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; ''λ'' is a constant that depends on the particular isotope; for a given isotope it is equal to the reciprocal of the [[Radioactive decay#Time constant and mean-life|mean-life]]&amp;nbsp;– i.e. the average or expected time a given atom will survive before undergoing radioactive decay.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; The mean-life, denoted by ''τ'', of {{chem|14|C}} is 8,267 years,{{#tag:ref|The half-life of {{chem|14|C}} (which determines the mean-life) was thought to be 5568 ± 30 years in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Libby (1965), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mean-life and half-life are related by the following equation:&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_\frac{1}{2} = 0.693 \cdot \tau&lt;/math&gt;|group=note}} so the equation above can be rewritten as:&lt;ref&gt;Aitken (1990), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t = 8267 \cdot \ln(N_0/N) \text{ years} &lt;/math&gt;
The sample is assumed to have originally had the same {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio as the ratio in the atmosphere, and since the size of the sample is known, the total number of atoms in the sample can be calculated, yielding ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the number of {{chem|14|C}} atoms in the original sample. Measurement of ''N'', the number of {{chem|14|C}} atoms currently in the sample, allows the calculation of ''t'', the age of the sample, using the equation above.&lt;ref name="Aitken_56-58" /&gt;

The half-life of a radioactive isotope (usually denoted by t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a more familiar concept than the mean-life, so although the equations above are expressed in terms of the mean-life, it is more usual to quote the value of {{chem|14|C}}'s half-life than its mean-life.  The currently accepted value for the half-life of {{chem|14|C}} is 5,730 ± 40 years.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; This means that after 5,730 years, only half of the initial {{chem|14|C}} will remain; a quarter will remain after 11,460 years; an eighth after 17,190 years; and so on.

The above calculations make several assumptions, such as that the level of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere has remained constant over time.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; In fact, the level of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere has varied significantly and as a result the values provided by the equation above have to be corrected by using data from other sources.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 61–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is done by calibration curves (discussed below), which convert a measurement of {{chem|14|C}} in a sample into an estimated calendar age.  The calculations involve several steps and include an intermediate value called the "radiocarbon age", which is the age in "radiocarbon years" of the sample: an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no calibration curve has been used − the calculations for radiocarbon years assume that the atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio has not changed over time.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Calculating radiocarbon ages also requires the value of the half-life for {{chem|14|C}}.  In Libby's 1949 paper he used a value of 5720 ± 47 years, based on research by Engelkemeir et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engelkemeir|first=Antoinette G.|last2=Hamill|first2=W.H.|last3=Inghram|first3=Mark G.|last4=Libby|first4=W.F.|date=1949|title=The Half-Life of Radiocarbon (C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;)|journal=Physical Review|volume=75|issue=12|pages=1825|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.1825|via=|bibcode=1949PhRv...75.1825E}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was remarkably close to the modern value, but shortly afterwards the accepted value was revised to 5568 ± 30 years,&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frederick Johnson|year=1951|title=Introduction|jstor=25146610|journal=Memoirs of the Society for American Archaeology|volume=|issue=8|pages=1–19|arxiv=|bibcode=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this value was in use for more than a decade.

Carbon is distributed throughout the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the oceans; these are referred to collectively as the carbon exchange reservoir,&lt;ref&gt;Aitken (2003), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; and each component is also referred to individually as a carbon exchange reservoir.  The different elements of the carbon exchange reservoir vary in how much carbon they store, and in how long it takes for the {{chem|14|C}} generated by cosmic rays to fully mix with them.  This affects the ratio of {{chem|14|C}} to {{chem|12|C}} in the different reservoirs, and hence the radiocarbon ages of samples that originated in each reservoir.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; The atmosphere, which is where {{chem|14|C}} is generated, contains about 1.9% of the total carbon in the reservoirs, and the {{chem|14|C}} it contains mixes in less than seven years.&lt;ref name="Warneck_690"&gt;Warneck (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;690.&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of {{chem|14|C}} to {{chem|12|C}} in the atmosphere is taken as the baseline for the other reservoirs: if another reservoir has a lower ratio of {{chem|14|C}} to {{chem|12|C}}, it indicates that the carbon is older and hence that either some of the {{chem|14|C}} has decayed, or the reservoir is receiving carbon that is not at the atmospheric baseline.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt; The ocean surface is an example: it contains 2.4% of the carbon in the exchange reservoir, but there is only about 95% as much {{chem|14|C}} as would be expected if the ratio were the same as in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; The time it takes for carbon from the atmosphere to mix with the surface ocean is only a few years,&lt;ref&gt;Ferronsky &amp; Polyakov (2012), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; but the surface waters also receive water from the deep ocean, which has more than 90% of the carbon in the reservoir.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt; Water in the deep ocean takes about 1,000 years to circulate back through surface waters, and so the surface waters contain a combination of older water, with depleted {{chem|14|C}}, and water recently at the surface, with {{chem|14|C}} in equilibrium with the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt;

Creatures living at the ocean surface have the same {{chem|14|C}} ratios as the water they live in, and as a result of the reduced {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio, the radiocarbon age of marine life is typically about 400 years.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronin2010"&gt;Cronin (2010), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms on land are in closer equilibrium with the atmosphere and have the same {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio as the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|For marine life, the age only appears to be 400 years once a correction for [[Radiocarbon dating#Fractionation|fractionation]] is made.  This effect is accounted for during calibration by using a different marine calibration curve; without this curve, modern marine life would appear to be 400 years old when radiocarbon dated.  Similarly, the statement about land organisms is only true once fractionation is taken into account.|group=note}} These organisms contain about 1.3% of the carbon in the reservoir; sea organisms have a mass of less than 1% of those on land and are not shown on the diagram. Accumulated dead organic matter, of both plants and animals, exceeds the mass of the biosphere by a factor of nearly 3, and since this matter is no longer exchanging carbon with its environment, it has a {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio lower than that of the biosphere.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;

== Dating considerations ==
{{Main|Radiocarbon dating considerations}}
The variation in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in different parts of the carbon exchange reservoir means that a straightforward calculation of the age of a sample based on the amount of {{chem|14|C}} it contains will often give an incorrect result. There are several other possible sources of error that need to be considered.  The errors are of four general types:
* variations in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the atmosphere, both geographically and over time;
* isotopic fractionation;
* variations in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in different parts of the reservoir;
* contamination.

=== Atmospheric variation ===

In the early years of using the technique, it was understood that it depended on the atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio having remained the same over the preceding few thousand years. To verify the accuracy of the method, several artefacts&lt;!-- This article uses British English, so please do not change this to "artifact". --&gt; that were datable by other techniques were tested; the results of the testing were in reasonable agreement with the true ages of the objects. Over time, however, discrepancies began to appear between the known chronology for the oldest Egyptian dynasties and the radiocarbon dates of Egyptian artefacts. Neither the pre-existing Egyptian chronology nor the new radiocarbon dating method could be assumed to be accurate, but a third possibility was that the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio had changed over time.  The question was resolved by the [[Dendrochronology|study of tree rings]]:&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 16–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suess_1970"&gt;Suess (1970), p.&amp;nbsp;303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014)"&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; comparison of overlapping series of tree rings allowed the construction of a continuous sequence of tree-ring data that spanned 8,000 years.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;  (Since that time the tree-ring data series has been extended to 13,900 years.)&lt;ref name="INTCAL13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reimer|first=Paula J.|last2=Bard|first2=Edouard|last3=Bayliss|first3=Alex|last4=Beck|first4=J.

This was possible because although annual plants, such as corn, have a {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio that reflects the atmospheric ratio at the time they were growing, trees only add material to their outermost tree ring in any given year, while the inner tree rings don't get their {{chem|14|C}} replenished and instead start losing {{chem|14|C}} through decay.  Hence each ring preserves a record of the atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio of the year it grew in.  Carbon-dating the wood from the tree rings themselves provides the check needed on the atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio: with a sample of known date, and a measurement of the value of ''N'' (the number of atoms of {{chem|14|C}} remaining in the sample), the carbon-dating equation allows the calculation of ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; – the number of atoms of {{chem|14|C}} in the sample at the time the tree ring was formed – and hence the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the atmosphere at that time.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014)" /&gt; Equipped with the results of carbon-dating the tree rings, it became possible to construct calibration curves designed to correct the errors caused by the variation over time in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 43–49.&lt;/ref&gt; These curves are described in more detail [[Radiocarbon dating#Calibration|below]].

Coal and oil began to be burned in large quantities during the 19th century. Both are sufficiently old that they contain little or no detectable {{chem|14|C}} and, as a result, the {{chem|CO|2}} released substantially diluted the atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio. Dating an object from the early 20th century hence gives an apparent date older than the true date.  For the same reason, {{chem|14|C}} concentrations in the neighbourhood of large cities are lower than the atmospheric average. This fossil fuel effect (also known as the Suess effect, after Hans Suess, who first reported it in 1955) would only amount to a reduction of 0.2% in {{chem|14|C}} activity if the additional carbon from fossil fuels were distributed throughout the carbon exchange reservoir, but because of the long delay in mixing with the deep ocean, the actual effect is a 3% reduction.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aitken_71-72"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp.&amp;nbsp;71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

A much larger effect comes from above-ground nuclear testing, which released large numbers of neutrons and created {{chem|14|C}}. From about 1950 until 1963, when atmospheric nuclear testing was banned, it is estimated that several tonnes of {{chem|14|C}} were created. If all this extra {{chem|14|C}} had immediately been spread across the entire carbon exchange reservoir, it would have led to an increase in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio of only a few per cent, but the immediate effect was to almost double the amount of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere, with the peak level occurring in 1964 for the northern hemisphere, and in 1966 for the southern hemisphere. The level has since dropped, as this [[bomb pulse]] or "bomb carbon" (as it is sometimes called) percolates into the rest of the reservoir.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aitken_71-72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PTBT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/t/isn/4797.htm|title=Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hua_etal"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hua|first=Quan|last2=Barbetti|first2=Mike|last3=Rakowski|first3=Andrzej Z.|date=2013|title=Atmospheric Radiocarbon for the Period 1950–2010|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/radiocarbon/article/atmospheric-radiocarbon-for-the-period-19502010/6BD120B674D0467B648CE1B8DF6428B8|journal=Radiocarbon|volume=55|issue=4|pages=2059–2072|doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.v55i2.16177|issn=0033-8222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isotopic fractionation ===
Photosynthesis is the primary process by which carbon moves from the atmosphere into living things. In photosynthetic pathways {{chem|12|C}} is absorbed slightly more easily than {{chem|13|C}}, which in turn is more easily absorbed than {{chem|14|C}}. The differential uptake of the three carbon isotopes leads to {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} and {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratios in plants that differ from the ratios in the atmosphere. This effect is known as isotopic fractionation.&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leng_246"&gt;Maslin &amp; Swann (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;246.&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine the degree of fractionation that takes place in a given plant, the amounts of both {{chem|12|C}} and {{chem|13|C}} isotopes are measured, and the resulting {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is then compared to a standard ratio known as PDB.{{#tag:ref|"PDB" stands for "Pee Dee Belemnite", a fossil from the [[Pee Dee Formation|Pee Dee formation]] in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;|group = note}}  The {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is used instead of {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} because the former is much easier to measure, and the latter can be easily derived: the depletion of {{chem|13|C}} relative to {{chem|12|C}} is proportional to the difference in the atomic masses of the two isotopes, so the depletion for {{chem|14|C}} is twice the depletion of {{chem|13|C}}.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt;  The fractionation of {{chem|13|C}}, known as {{delta|13|C|link}}, is calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23" /&gt;

:&lt;math chem&gt;\delta \ce{^{13}C} = \left( \frac{\left( \frac{\ce{^{13}C}}{\ce{^{12}C}} \right)_{sample}}{\left( \frac{\ce{^{13}C}}{\ce{^{12}C}} \right)_{standard}} -1 \right) \times 1000&lt;/math&gt; &amp;permil;

where the ‰ sign indicates [[parts per thousand]].&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23" /&gt;  Because the PDB standard contains an unusually high proportion of {{chem|13|C}},{{#tag:ref|The PDB value is 11.2372‰.&lt;ref&gt;Dass (2007), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;|group = note}} most measured {{delta|13|C}} values are negative.

[[File:NR sheep.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[North Ronaldsay sheep]] on the beach in [[North Ronaldsay]]. In the winter, these sheep eat seaweed, which has a higher {{delta|13|C}} content than grass; samples from these sheep have a {{delta|13|C}} value of about −13‰, which is much higher than for sheep that feed on grasses.&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23" /&gt;]]

For marine organisms, the details of the photosynthesis reactions are less well understood, and the {{delta|13|C}} values for marine photosynthetic organisms are dependent on temperature. At higher temperatures, {{chem|CO|2}} has poor solubility in water, which means there is less {{chem|CO|2}} available for the photosynthetic reactions. Under these conditions, fractionation is reduced, and at temperatures above 14&amp;nbsp;°C the {{delta|13|C}} values are correspondingly higher, while at lower temperatures, {{chem|CO|2}} becomes more soluble and hence more available to marine organisms.&lt;ref name="Leng_246" /&gt; The {{delta|13|C}} value for animals depends on their diet. An animal that eats food with high {{delta|13|C}} values will have a higher {{delta|13|C}} than one that eats food with lower {{delta|13|C}} values.&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23" /&gt; The animal's own biochemical processes can also impact the results: for example, both bone minerals and bone collagen typically have a higher concentration of {{chem|13|C}} than is found in the animal's diet, though for different biochemical reasons. The enrichment of bone {{chem|13|C}} also implies that excreted material is depleted in {{Chem|13|C}} relative to the diet.&lt;ref&gt;Schoeninger (2010), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since {{chem|13|C}} makes up about 1% of the carbon in a sample, the {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio can be accurately measured by [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt; Typical values of {{delta|13|C}} have been found by experiment for many plants, as well as for different parts of animals such as bone [[collagen]], but when dating a given sample it is better to determine the {{delta|13|C}} value for that sample directly than to rely on the published values.&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23" /&gt;

The carbon exchange between atmospheric {{chem|CO|2}} and carbonate at the ocean surface is also subject to fractionation, with {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere more likely than {{chem|12|C}} to dissolve in the ocean. The result is an overall increase in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the ocean of 1.5%, relative to the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the atmosphere. This increase in {{chem|14|C}} concentration almost exactly cancels out the decrease caused by the upwelling of water (containing old, and hence {{chem|14|C}} depleted, carbon) from the deep ocean, so that direct measurements of {{chem|14|C}} radiation are similar to measurements for the rest of the biosphere. Correcting for isotopic fractionation, as is done for all radiocarbon dates to allow comparison between results from different parts of the biosphere, gives an apparent age of about 400 years for ocean surface water.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronin2010" /&gt;

=== Reservoir effects ===
Libby's original exchange reservoir hypothesis assumed that the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the exchange reservoir is constant all over the world,&lt;ref name="Libby1965"&gt;Libby (1965), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but it has since been discovered that there are several causes of variation in the ratio across the reservoir.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt;

'''[[Marine reservoir effect|Marine effect]]'''

The {{chem|CO|2}} in the atmosphere transfers to the ocean by dissolving in the surface water as carbonate and bicarbonate ions; at the same time the carbonate ions in the water are returning to the air as {{chem|CO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Libby1965" /&gt; This exchange process brings{{chem|14|C}} from the atmosphere into the surface waters of the ocean, but the {{chem|14|C}} thus introduced takes a long time to percolate through the entire volume of the ocean. The deepest parts of the ocean mix very slowly with the surface waters, and the mixing is uneven. The main mechanism that brings deep water to the surface is upwelling, which is more common in regions closer to the equator. Upwelling is also influenced by factors such as the topography of the local ocean bottom and coastlines, the climate, and wind patterns. Overall, the mixing of deep and surface waters takes far longer than the mixing of atmospheric {{chem|CO|2}} with the surface waters, and as a result water from some deep ocean areas has an apparent radiocarbon age of several thousand years. Upwelling mixes this "old" water with the surface water, giving the surface water an apparent age of about several hundred years (after correcting for fractionation).&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt; This effect is not uniform&amp;nbsp;– the average effect is about 400 years, but there are local deviations of several hundred years for areas that are geographically close to each other.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronin2010" /&gt; These deviations can be accounted for in calibration, and users of software such as CALIB can provide as an input the appropriate correction for the location of their samples.&lt;ref name=Alves2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Queiroz-Alves|first1=Eduardo|last2=Macario|first2=Kita |last3=Ascough|first3=Philippa |last4=Bronk Ramsey|first4=Christopher |year=2018|title=The worldwide marine radiocarbon reservoir effect: Definitions, mechanisms and prospects|journal=Reviews of Geophysics |volume=56|issue=1|pages=278–305|doi=10.1002/2017RG000588|bibcode=2018RvGeo..56..278A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect also applies to marine organisms such as shells, and marine mammals such as whales and seals, which have radiocarbon ages that appear to be hundreds of years old.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt;

'''Hemisphere effect'''

The northern and southern hemispheres have [[atmospheric circulation]] systems that are sufficiently independent of each other that there is a noticeable time lag in mixing between the two. The atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is lower in the southern hemisphere, with an apparent additional age of about 40 years for radiocarbon results from the south as compared to the north.{{#tag:ref|Two recent estimates included 8-80 radiocarbon years over the last 1000 years, with an average of 41 ± 14 years; and -2 to 83 radiocarbon years over the last 2000 years, with an average of 44 ± 17 years.  For older datasets an offset of about 50 years has been estimated.&lt;ref name="Hoggetal" /&gt;|group=note}} This is because the greater surface area of ocean in the southern hemisphere means that there is more carbon exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere than in the north. Since the surface ocean is depleted in {{chem|14|C}} because of the marine effect, {{chem|14|C}} is removed from the southern atmosphere more quickly than in the north.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoggetal"&gt;Hogg et al. (2013), p. 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect is strengthened by strong upwelling around Antarctica.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

'''Other effects'''

If the carbon in freshwater is partly acquired from aged carbon, such as rocks, then the result will be a reduction in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the water. For example, rivers that pass over [[limestone]], which is mostly composed of [[calcium carbonate]], will acquire carbonate ions. Similarly, groundwater can contain carbon derived from the rocks through which it has passed. These rocks are usually so old that they no longer contain any measurable {{chem|14|C}}, so this carbon lowers the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio of the water it enters, which can lead to apparent ages of thousands of years for both the affected water and the plants and freshwater organisms that live in it.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt; This is known as the [[hard water]] effect because it is often associated with calcium ions, which are characteristic of hard water; other sources of carbon such as [[humus]] can produce similar results, and can also reduce the apparent age if they are of more recent origin than the sample.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt;  The effect varies greatly and there is no general offset that can be applied; additional research is usually needed to determine the size of the offset, for example by comparing the radiocarbon age of deposited freshwater shells with associated organic material.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Volcanic eruptions]] eject large amounts of carbon into the air. The carbon is of geological origin and has no detectable {{chem|14|C}}, so the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the vicinity of the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas. Dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon. Plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratios: for example, plants in the neighbourhood of the [[Furnas]] caldera in the [[Azores]] were found to have apparent ages that ranged from 250 years to 3320 years.&lt;ref&gt;Pasquier-Cardina et al. (1999), pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contamination ===
Any addition of carbon to a sample of a different age will cause the measured date to be inaccurate. Contamination with modern carbon causes a sample to appear to be younger than it really is: the effect is greater for older samples. If a sample that is 17,000 years old is contaminated so that 1% of the sample is modern carbon, it will appear to be 600 years younger; for a sample that is 34,000 years old the same amount of contamination would cause an error of 4,000 years. Contamination with old carbon, with no remaining {{chem|14|C}}, causes an error in the other direction independent of age&amp;nbsp;– a sample contaminated with 1% old carbon will appear to be about 80 years older than it really is, regardless of the date of the sample.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Samples ==
{{Main|Radiocarbon dating samples}}
Samples for dating need to be converted into a form suitable for measuring the {{chem|14|C}} content; this can mean conversion to gaseous, liquid, or solid form, depending on the measurement technique to be used. Before this can be done, the sample must be treated to remove any contamination and any unwanted constituents.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;27–30.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes removing visible contaminants, such as rootlets that may have penetrated the sample since its burial.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30" /&gt;  Alkali and acid washes can be used to remove humic acid and carbonate contamination, but care has to be taken to avoid removing the part of the sample that contains the carbon to be tested.&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 86–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Material considerations ===
* It is common to reduce a wood sample to just the cellulose component before testing, but since this can reduce the volume of the sample to 20% of its original size, testing of the whole wood is often performed as well. Charcoal is often tested but is likely to need treatment to remove contaminants.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing" /&gt;
* Unburnt bone can be tested; it is usual to date it using [[collagen]], the protein fraction that remains after washing away the bone's structural material. [[Hydroxyproline]], one of the constituent amino acids in bone, was once thought to be a reliable indicator as it was not known to occur except in bone, but it has since been detected in groundwater.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30" /&gt;
* For burnt bone, testability depends on the conditions under which the bone was burnt. If the bone was heated under [[reducing conditions]], it (and associated organic matter) may have been carbonized. In this case the sample is often usable.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30" /&gt;
* Shells from both marine and land organisms consist almost entirely of calcium carbonate, either as [[aragonite]] or as [[calcite]], or some mixture of the two. Calcium carbonate is very susceptible to dissolving and recrystallizing; the recrystallized material will contain carbon from the sample's environment, which may be of geological origin.  If testing recrystallized shell is unavoidable, it is sometimes possible to identify the original shell material from a sequence of tests.&lt;ref&gt;Šilar (2004), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible to test [[conchiolin]], an organic protein found in shell, but it constitutes only 1–2% of shell material.&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing" /&gt;
* The three major components of peat are humic acid, [[humins]], and fulvic acid. Of these, humins give the most reliable date as they are insoluble in alkali and less likely to contain contaminants from the sample's environment.&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing" /&gt; A particular difficulty with dried peat is the removal of rootlets, which are likely to be hard to distinguish from the sample material.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30" /&gt;
* Soil contains organic material, but because of the likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin, it is very difficult to get satisfactory radiocarbon dates. It is preferable to sieve the soil for fragments of organic origin, and date the fragments with methods that are tolerant of small sample sizes.&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing" /&gt;
* Other materials that have been successfully dated include ivory, paper, textiles, individual seeds and grains, straw from within mud bricks, and charred food remains found in pottery.&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing" /&gt;

=== Preparation and size ===
Particularly for older samples, it may be useful to enrich the amount of {{chem|14|C}} in the sample before testing. This can be done with a thermal diffusion column. The process takes about a month and requires a sample about ten times as large as would be needed otherwise, but it allows more precise measurement of the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in old material and extends the maximum age that can be reliably reported.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 37–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once contamination has been removed, samples must be converted to a form suitable for the measuring technology to be used.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 31–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Where gas is required, {{Chem|CO|2}} is widely used.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aitken_76-78"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; For samples to be used in [[Liquid scintillation counting|liquid scintillation counters]], the carbon must be in liquid form; the sample is typically converted to [[benzene]]. For [[accelerator mass spectrometry]], solid graphite targets are the most common, although gaseous {{Chem|CO|2}} can also be used.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trumbore96"&gt;Trumbore (1996), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity of material needed for testing depends on the sample type and the technology being used. There are two types of testing technology: detectors that record radioactivity, known as beta counters, and accelerator mass spectrometers. For beta counters, a sample weighing at least {{convert|10|g|abbr=off}} is typically required.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt;   Accelerator mass spectrometry is much more sensitive, and samples containing as little as 0.5 milligrams of carbon can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and results ==
[[File:1 MV accelerator mass spectrometer.jpg|thumb|Measuring {{Chem|14|C}} is now most commonly done with an accelerator mass spectrometer]]
For decades after Libby performed the first radiocarbon dating experiments, the only way to measure the {{chem|14|C}} in a sample was to detect the radioactive decay of individual carbon atoms.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt; In this approach, what is measured is the activity, in number of decay events per unit mass per time period, of the sample.&lt;ref name="Aitken_76-78" /&gt; This method is also known as "beta counting", because it is the beta particles emitted by the decaying {{chem|14|C}} atoms that are detected.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2005), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s an alternative approach became available: directly counting the number of {{Chem|14|C}} and {{Chem|12|C}} atoms in a given sample, via accelerator mass spectrometry, usually referred to as AMS.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt; AMS counts the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio directly, instead of the activity of the sample, but measurements of activity and {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio can be converted into each other exactly.&lt;ref name="Aitken_76-78" /&gt; For some time, beta counting methods were more accurate than AMS, but AMS is now more accurate and has become the method of choice for radiocarbon measurements.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Walker (2005), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Killick (2014), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to improved accuracy, AMS has two further significant advantages over beta counting: it can perform accurate testing on samples much too small for beta counting; and it is much faster&amp;nbsp;– an accuracy of 1% can be achieved in minutes with AMS, which is far quicker than would be achievable with the older technology.&lt;ref&gt;Malainey (2010), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beta counting ===
Libby's first detector was a [[Geiger counter]] of his own design. He converted the carbon in his sample to lamp black (soot) and coated the inner surface of a cylinder with it.  This cylinder was inserted into the counter in such a way that the counting wire was inside the sample cylinder, in order that there should be no material between the sample and the wire.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt; Any interposing material would have interfered with the detection of radioactivity, since the beta particles emitted by decaying {{Chem|14|C}} are so weak that half are stopped by a 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm thickness of aluminium.&lt;ref name="Aitken_76-78" /&gt;

Libby's method was soon superseded by gas [[proportional counter]]s, which were less affected by bomb carbon (the additional {{Chem|14|C}} created by nuclear weapons testing). These counters record bursts of ionization caused by the beta particles emitted by the decaying {{Chem|14|C}} atoms; the bursts are proportional to the energy of the particle, so other sources of ionization, such as background radiation, can be identified and ignored. The counters are surrounded by lead or steel shielding, to eliminate background radiation and to reduce the incidence of cosmic rays. In addition, [[Electronic anticoincidence|anticoincidence]] detectors are used; these record events outside the counter, and any event recorded simultaneously both inside and outside the counter is regarded as an extraneous event and ignored.&lt;ref name="Aitken_76-78" /&gt;

The other common technology used for measuring {{Chem|14|C}} activity is liquid scintillation counting, which was invented in 1950, but which had to wait until the early 1960s, when efficient methods of benzene synthesis were developed, to become competitive with gas counting; after 1970 liquid counters became the more common technology choice for newly constructed dating laboratories. The counters work by detecting flashes of light caused by the beta particles emitted by {{chem|14|C}} as they interact with a fluorescing agent added to the benzene. Like gas counters, liquid scintillation counters require shielding and anticoincidence counters.&lt;ref&gt;Theodórsson (1996), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L'Annunziata &amp; Kessler (2012), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

For both the gas proportional counter and liquid scintillation counter, what is measured is the number of beta particles detected in a given time period. Since the mass of the sample is known, this can be converted to a standard measure of activity in units of either counts per minute per gram of carbon (cpm/g C), or [[becquerel]]s per kg (Bq/kg C, in [[SI units]]). Each measuring device is also used to measure the activity of a blank sample&amp;nbsp;– a sample prepared from carbon old enough to have no activity. This provides a value for the background radiation, which must be subtracted from the measured activity of the sample being dated to get the activity attributable solely to that sample's {{Chem|14|C}}. In addition, a sample with a standard activity is measured, to provide a baseline for comparison.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Eriksson Stenström et al. (2011), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accelerator mass spectrometry ===
[[File:Accelerator mass spectrometer schematic for radiocarbon.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Simplified schematic layout of an accelerator mass spectrometer used for counting carbon isotopes for carbon dating]]
AMS counts the atoms of {{Chem|14|C}} and {{Chem|12|C}} in a given sample, determining the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio directly. The sample, often in the form of graphite, is made to emit C&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions (carbon atoms with a single negative charge), which are injected into an [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]]. The ions are accelerated and passed through a stripper, which removes several electrons so that the ions emerge with a positive charge.  The ions, which may have from 1 to 4 positive charges (C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;), depending on the accelerator design, are then passed through a magnet that curves their path; the heavier ions are curved less than the lighter ones, so the different isotopes emerge as separate streams of ions. A particle detector then records the number of ions detected in the {{Chem|14|C}} stream, but since the volume of {{Chem|12|C}} (and {{Chem|13|C}}, needed for calibration) is too great for individual ion detection, counts are determined by measuring the electric current created in a [[Faraday cup]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 82–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The large positive charge induced by the stripper forces molecules such as {{chem|13|CH}}, which has a weight close enough to {{chem|14|C}} to interfere with the measurements, to dissociate, so they are not detected.&lt;ref name="Wiebert"&gt;Wiebert (1995), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most AMS machines also measure the sample's {{delta|13|C}}, for use in calculating the sample's radiocarbon age.&lt;ref&gt;Tuniz, Zoppi &amp; Barbetti (2004), p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of AMS, as opposed to simpler forms of mass spectrometry, is necessary because of the need to distinguish the carbon isotopes from other atoms or molecules that are very close in mass, such as {{chem|14|N}} and {{chem|13|CH}}.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt; As with beta counting, both blank samples and standard samples are used.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Two different kinds of blank may be measured: a sample of dead carbon that has undergone no chemical processing, to detect any machine background, and a sample known as a process blank made from dead carbon that is processed into target material in exactly the same way as the sample which is being dated. Any {{Chem|14|C}} signal from the machine background blank is likely to be caused either by beams of ions that have not followed the expected path inside the detector, or by carbon hydrides such as {{chem|12|CH|2}} or {{chem|13|CH}}. A {{chem|14|C}} signal from the process blank measures the amount of contamination introduced during the preparation of the sample. These measurements are used in the subsequent calculation of the age of the sample.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNichol|first=A.P.|last2=Jull|first2=A.T.S.|last3=Burr|first3=G.S.|year=2001|title=Converting AMS data to radiocarbon values: considerations and conventions|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/3969/3394|journal=Radiocarbon|volume=43|issue=2A|pages=313–320|doi=10.1017/S0033822200038169|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calculations ===
{{Main|Calculation of radiocarbon dates}}
The calculations to be performed on the measurements taken depend on the technology used, since beta counters measure the sample's radioactivity whereas AMS determines the ratio of the three different carbon isotopes in the sample.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

To determine the age of a sample whose activity has been measured by beta counting, the ratio of its activity to the activity of the standard must be found. To determine this, a blank sample (of old, or dead, carbon) is measured, and a sample of known activity is measured. The additional samples allow errors such as background radiation and systematic errors in the laboratory setup to be detected and corrected for.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The most common standard sample material is oxalic acid, such as the HOxII standard, 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb of which was prepared by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) in 1977 from French beet harvests.&lt;ref&gt;Terasmae (1984), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L'Annunziata (2007), p. 528.&lt;/ref&gt;

The results from AMS testing are in the form of ratios of {{chem|12|C}}, {{chem|13|C}}, and {{chem|14|C}}, which are used to calculate Fm, the "fraction modern". This is defined as the ratio between the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the sample and the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in modern carbon, which is in turn defined as the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio that would have been measured in 1950 had there been no fossil fuel effect.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Both beta counting and AMS results have to be corrected for fractionation. This is necessary because different materials of the same age, which because of fractionation have naturally different {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratios, will appear to be of different ages because the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is taken as the indicator of age. To avoid this, all radiocarbon measurements are converted to the measurement that would have been seen had the sample been made of wood, which has a known δ{{chem|13|C}} value of −25‰.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Once the corrected {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is known, a "radiocarbon age" is calculated using:&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoi.edu/nosams/page.do?pid=40146 |title=Radiocarbon Data Calculations: NOSAMS|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|year=2007|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Age} = -8033 \cdot \ln (Fm)&lt;/math&gt;

The calculation uses 8,033, the mean-life derived from Libby's half-life of 5,568 years, not 8,267, the mean-life derived from the more accurate modern value of 5,730 years. Libby’s value for the half-life is used to maintain consistency with early radiocarbon testing results; calibration curves include a correction for this, so the accuracy of final reported calendar ages is assured.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Errors and reliability ===
The reliability of the results can be improved by lengthening the testing time. For example, if counting beta decays for 250 minutes is enough to give an error of ± 80 years, with 68% confidence, then doubling the counting time to 500 minutes will allow a sample with only half as much {{Chem|14|C}} to be measured with the same error term of 80 years.&lt;ref name="Bowman_38-39"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiocarbon dating is generally limited to dating samples no more than 50,000 years old, as samples older than that have insufficient {{chem|14|C}} to be measurable.  Older dates have been obtained by using special sample preparation techniques, large samples, and very long measurement times.  These techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60,000 and in some cases up to 75,000 years before the present.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Radiocarbon dates are generally presented with a range of one [[standard deviation]] (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) on either side of the mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a [[normal distribution]] of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Errors in procedure can also lead to errors in the results. If 1% of the benzene in a modern reference sample accidentally evaporates, scintillation counting will give a radiocarbon age that is too young by about 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calibration&lt;!--'Calibrated years' redirects here--&gt; ===
{{Main|Calibration of radiocarbon dates}}
[[File:Prometheus tree1.jpg|left|thumb|The stump of a very old bristlecone pine.  Tree rings from these trees (among others) are used in building calibration curves.]]
The calculations given above produce dates in radiocarbon years: i.e. dates that represent the age the sample would be if the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio had been constant historically.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Libby had pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect, it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became clear that a correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates.&lt;ref name="Aitken_66-67"&gt;Aitken (1990), p.&amp;nbsp;66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

To produce a curve that can be used to relate calendar years to radiocarbon years, a sequence of securely dated samples is needed which can be tested to determine their radiocarbon age. The study of tree rings led to the first such sequence: individual pieces of wood show characteristic sequences of rings that vary in thickness because of environmental factors such as the amount of rainfall in a given year. These factors affect all trees in an area, so examining tree-ring sequences from old wood allows the identification of overlapping sequences. In this way, an uninterrupted sequence of tree rings can be extended far into the past. The first such published sequence, based on bristlecone pine tree rings, was created by [[Wesley Ferguson]].&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014)" /&gt; Hans Suess used this data to publish the first calibration curve for radiocarbon dating in 1967.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suess_1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aitken_66-67" /&gt; The curve showed two types of variation from the straight line: a long term fluctuation with a period of about 9,000 years, and a shorter term variation, often referred to as "wiggles", with a period of decades. Suess said he drew the line showing the wiggles by "cosmic ''schwung''", by which he meant that the variations were caused by extraterrestrial forces. It was unclear for some time whether the wiggles were real or not, but they are now well-established.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suess_1970" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  These short term fluctuations in the calibration curve are now known as de Vries effects, after [[Hessel de Vries]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A calibration curve is used by taking the radiocarbon date reported by a laboratory, and reading across from that date on the vertical axis of the graph. The point where this horizontal line intersects the curve will give the calendar age of the sample on the horizontal axis. This is the reverse of the way the curve is constructed: a point on the graph is derived from a sample of known age, such as a tree ring; when it is tested, the resulting radiocarbon age gives a data point for the graph.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;[[File:Intcal 13 calibration curve.png|thumb|The Northern hemisphere curve from INTCAL13.  As of 2014 this is the most recent version of the standard calibration curve.  The diagonal line shows where the curve would lie if radiocarbon ages and calendar ages were the same.&lt;ref name="INTCAL13"/&gt;]]Over the next thirty years many calibration curves were published using a variety of methods and statistical approaches.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; These were superseded by the INTCAL series of curves, beginning with INTCAL98, published in 1998, and updated in 2004, 2009, and 2013. The improvements to these curves are based on new data gathered from tree rings, [[varve]]s, [[coral]], plant [[macrofossil]]s, [[speleothems]], and [[foraminifera]].  The INTCAL13 data includes separate curves for the northern and southern hemispheres, as they differ systematically because of the hemisphere effect.  The southern curve (SHCAL13) is based on independent data where possible, and derived from the northern curve by adding the average offset for the southern hemisphere where no direct data was available. There is also a separate marine calibration curve, MARINE13.&lt;ref name="INTCAL13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stuiver|first=M.|last2=Braziunas|first2=T.F.|year=1993|title=Modelling atmospheric {{chem|14|C}} influences and {{chem|14|C}} ages of marine samples to 10,000 BC|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/1558/1562|journal=Radiocarbon|volume=35|issue=1|pages=137–189|doi=10.1017/s0033822200013874}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a set of samples forming a sequence with a known separation in time, these samples form a subset of the calibration curve. The sequence can be compared to the calibration curve and the best match to the sequence established. This “wiggle-matching” technique can lead to more precise dating than is possible with individual radiocarbon dates.&lt;ref name="Walker2005"&gt;Walker (2005), pp. 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wiggle-matching can be used in places where there is a plateau on the calibration curve, and hence can provide a much more accurate date than the intercept or probability methods are able to produce.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique is not restricted to tree rings; for example, a stratified [[tephra]] sequence in New Zealand, known to predate human colonization of the islands, has been dated to 1314&amp;nbsp;AD ± 12 years by wiggle-matching.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2005), pp. 207–209.&lt;/ref&gt; The wiggles also mean that reading a date from a calibration curve can give more than one answer: this occurs when the curve wiggles up and down enough that the radiocarbon age intercepts the curve in more than one place, which may lead to a radiocarbon result being reported as two separate age ranges, corresponding to the two parts of the curve that the radiocarbon age intercepted.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

[[Bayesian inference|Bayesian statistical techniques]] can be applied when there are several radiocarbon dates to be calibrated.  For example, if a series of radiocarbon dates is taken from different levels in a stratigraphic sequence, Bayesian analysis can be used to evaluate dates which are outliers, and can calculate improved probability distributions, based on the prior information that the sequence should be ordered in time.&lt;ref name="Walker2005" /&gt;  When Bayesian analysis was introduced, its use was limited by the need to use mainframe computers to perform the calculations, but the technique has since been implemented on programs available for personal computers, such as OxCal.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reporting dates ===
Several formats for citing radiocarbon results have been used since the first samples were dated. As of 2014, the standard format required by the journal ''[[Radiocarbon (magazine)|Radiocarbon]]'' is as follows.&lt;ref name=Radiocarbon_Authors&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radiocarbon.org/Authors/author-info.pdf |title= Radiocarbon: Information for Authors |author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 25, 2011 |website= Radiocarbon |publisher= University of Arizona |pages= 5–7 |accessdate= 1 January 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130810014457/http://www.radiocarbon.org/Authors/author-info.pdf |archivedate= 10 August 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncalibrated dates should be reported as "&lt;laboratory&gt;: &lt;{{chem|14|C}} year&gt; ± &lt;range&gt; BP", where:
* &lt;laboratory&gt; identifies the laboratory that tested the sample, and the sample ID
* &lt;{{chem|14|C}} year&gt; is the laboratory's determination of the age of the sample, in radiocarbon years
* &lt;range&gt; is the laboratory's estimate of the error in the age, at 1σ confidence.
* BP stands for "[[before present]]", referring to a reference date of 1950, so that 500 BP means the year 1450 AD.

For example, the uncalibrated date "UtC-2020: 3510 ± 60 BP" indicates that the sample was tested by the Utrecht van der Graaff Laboratorium, where it has a sample number of 2020, and that the uncalibrated age is 3510 years before present, ± 60 years. Related forms are sometimes used: for example, "10 ka BP" means 10,000 radiocarbon years before present (i.e. 8,050 BC), and {{chem|14|C}} yr BP might be used to distinguish the uncalibrated date from a date derived from another dating method such as [[Thermoluminescence dating|thermoluminescence]].&lt;ref name=Radiocarbon_Authors /&gt;

Calibrated {{chem|14|C}} dates are frequently reported as cal BP, cal BC, or cal AD, again with BP referring to the year 1950 as the zero date.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Radiocarbon'' gives two options for reporting calibrated dates. A common format is "cal &lt;date-range&gt; &lt;confidence&gt;", where:
* &lt;date-range&gt; is the range of dates corresponding to the given confidence level
* &lt;confidence&gt; indicates the confidence level for the given date range.

For example, "cal 1220–1281 AD (1σ)" means a calibrated date for which the true date lies between 1220 AD and 1281 AD, with the confidence level given as 1σ, or one standard deviation. Calibrated dates can also be expressed as BP instead of using BC and AD. The curve used to calibrate the results should be the latest available INTCAL curve. Calibrated dates should also identify any programs, such as OxCal, used to perform the calibration.&lt;ref name="Radiocarbon_Authors" /&gt;  In addition, an article in ''Radiocarbon'' in 2014 about radiocarbon date reporting conventions recommends that information should be provided about sample treatment, including the sample material, pretreatment methods, and quality control measurements; that the citation to the software used for calibration should specify the version number and any options or models used; and that the calibrated date should be given with the associated probabilities for each range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millard|first=Andrew R.|date=2014|title=Conventions for Reporting Radiocarbon Determinations|journal=Radiocarbon|volume=56|issue=2|pages=555–559|doi=10.2458/56.17455|doi-access=free|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/21052/1/21052.pdf|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in archaeology ==

=== Interpretation ===
A key concept in interpreting radiocarbon dates is [[archaeological association]]: what is the true relationship between two or more objects at an archaeological site?  It frequently happens that a sample for radiocarbon dating can be taken directly from the object of interest, but there are also many cases where this is not possible.  Metal grave goods, for example, cannot be radiocarbon dated, but they may be found in a grave with a coffin, charcoal, or other material which can be assumed to have been deposited at the same time.  In these cases a date for the coffin or charcoal is indicative of the date of deposition of the grave goods, because of the direct functional relationship between the two.  There are also cases where there is no functional relationship, but the association is reasonably strong: for example, a layer of charcoal in a rubbish pit provides a date which has a relationship to the rubbish pit.&lt;ref&gt;Mook &amp; Waterbolk (1985), pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contamination is of particular concern when dating very old material obtained from archaeological excavations and great care is needed in the specimen selection and preparation. In 2014, [[Thomas Higham]] and co-workers suggested that many of the dates published for [[Neanderthal]] artefacts are too recent because of contamination by "young carbon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Higham | first1=T. | year=2014 | title=The timing and spatiotemporal patterning of Neanderthal disappearance | journal=Nature | volume=512 | issue=7514 | pages=306–309 | doi=10.1038/nature13621| pmid=25143113 | displayauthors=1 | last2=Wood | first2=Rachel | last3=Ramsey | first3=Christopher Bronk | last4=Brock | first4=Fiona | last5=Basell | first5=Laura | last6=Camps | first6=Marta | last7=Arrizabalaga | first7=Alvaro | last8=Baena | first8=Javier | last9=Barroso-Ruíz | first9=Cecillio | last10=Bergman | first10=Christopher | last11=Boitard | first11=Coralie | last12=Boscato | first12=Paolo | last13=Caparrós | first13=Miguel | last14=Conard | first14=Nicholas J. | last15=Draily | first15=Christelle | last16=Froment | first16=Alain | last17=Galván | first17=Bertila | last18=Gambassini | first18=Paolo | last19=Garcia-Moreno | first19=Alejandro | last20=Grimaldi | first20=Stefano | last21=Haesaerts | first21=Paul | last22=Holt | first22=Brigitte | last23=Iriarte-Chiapusso | first23=Maria-Jose | last24=Jelinek | first24=Arthur | last25=Jordá Pardo | first25=Jesús F. | last26=Maíllo-Fernández | first26=José-Manuel | last27=Marom | first27=Anat | last28=Maroto | first28=Julià | last29=Menéndez | first29=Mario | bibcode=2014Natur.512..306H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a tree grows, only the outermost tree ring exchanges carbon with its environment, so the age measured for a wood sample depends on where the sample is taken from.  This means that radiocarbon dates on wood samples can be older than the date at which the tree was felled.  In addition, if a piece of wood is used for multiple purposes, there may be a significant delay between the felling of the tree and the final use in the context in which it is found.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often referred to as the "[[old wood]]" problem.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;  One example is the Bronze Age [[trackway]] at Withy Bed Copse, in England; the trackway was built from wood that had clearly been worked for other purposes before being re-used in the trackway.  Another example is driftwood, which may be used as construction material.  It is not always possible to recognize re-use.  Other materials can present the same problem: for example, [[bitumen]] is known to have been used by some [[Neolithic]] communities to waterproof baskets; the bitumen's radiocarbon age will be greater than is measurable by the laboratory, regardless of the actual age of the context, so testing the basket material will give a misleading age if care is not taken.  A separate issue, related to re-use, is that of lengthy use, or delayed deposition.  For example, a wooden object that remains in use for a lengthy period will have an apparent age greater than the actual age of the context in which it is deposited.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

===Use outside archaeology===
Archaeology is not the only field to make use of radiocarbon dating.  The ability to date minute samples using AMS has meant that palaeobotanists and palaeoclimatologists can use radiocarbon dating on pollen samples.  Radiocarbon dates can also be used in geology, sedimentology, and lake studies, for example.  Dates on organic material recovered from strata of interest can be used to correlate strata in different locations that appear to be similar on geological grounds.  Dating material from one location gives date information about the other location, and the dates are also used to place strata in the overall geological timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godwin|first1=Harry|date=|year=1961|title=The Croonian Lecture: Radiocarbon Dating and Quaternary History in Britain|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/153/952/287.full.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=153|issue=952|pages=287–320|via=|doi=10.1098/rspb.1961.0001|bibcode=1961RSPSB.153..287G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable applications ===

==== Pleistocene/Holocene boundary in Two Creeks Fossil Forest ====
The [[Pleistocene]] is a geological epoch that began about 2.6 million years ago.  The [[Holocene]], the current geological epoch, begins about 11,700 years ago, when the Pleistocene ends.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Establishing the date of this boundary − which is defined by sharp climatic warming − as accurately as possible has been a goal of geologists for much of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bousman &amp; Vierra (2012), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Two Creeks, Wisconsin|Two Creeks]], in Wisconsin, a fossil forest was discovered ([[Two Creeks Buried Forest State Natural Area]]), and subsequent research determined that the destruction of the forest was caused by the Valders ice readvance, the last southward movement of ice before the end of the Pleistocene in that area.  Before the advent of radiocarbon dating, the fossilized trees had been dated by correlating sequences of annually deposited layers of sediment at Two Creeks with sequences in Scandinavia. This led to estimates that the trees were between 24,000 and 19,000 years old,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; and hence this was taken to be the date of the last advance of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] before its final retreat marked the end of the Pleistocene in North America.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Macdougall (2008), pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1952 Libby published radiocarbon dates for several samples from the Two Creeks site and two similar sites nearby; the dates were averaged to 11,404 BP with a standard error of 350 years.  This result was uncalibrated, as the need for calibration of radiocarbon ages was not yet understood.  Further results over the next decade supported an average date of 11,350 BP, with the results thought to be most accurate averaging 11,600 BP.  There was initial resistance to these results on the part of [[Ernst Antevs]], the [[palaeobotanist]] who had worked on the Scandinavian varve series, but his objections were eventually discounted by other geologists.  In the 1990s samples were tested with AMS, yielding (uncalibrated) dates ranging from 11,640 BP to 11,800 BP, both with a standard error of 160 years.  Subsequently, a sample from the fossil forest was used in an interlaboratory test, with results provided by over 70 laboratories.  These tests produced a median age of 11,788 ± 8 BP (2σ confidence) which when calibrated gives a date range of 13,730 to 13,550 cal BP.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The Two Creeks radiocarbon dates are now regarded as a key result in developing the modern understanding of North American glaciation at the end of the Pleistocene.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

In 1947, [[Dead Sea Scrolls|scrolls]] were discovered in caves near the [[Dead Sea]] that proved to contain writing in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], most of which are thought to have been produced by the [[Essenes]], a small Jewish sect.  These scrolls are of great significance in the study of Biblical texts because many of them contain the earliest known version of books of the Hebrew bible.&lt;ref name="taylor38"&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt; A sample of the linen wrapping from one of these scrolls, the [[Great Isaiah scroll|Great Isaiah Scroll]], was included in a 1955 analysis by Libby, with an estimated age of 1,917 ± 200 years.&lt;ref name="taylor38" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Libby (1965), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on an analysis of the writing style, [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] estimates were made of the age of 21 of the scrolls, and samples from most of these, along with other scrolls which had not been palaeographically dated, were tested by two AMS laboratories in the 1990s.  The results ranged in age from the early 4th century BC to the mid 4th century AD.  In all but two cases the scrolls were determined to be within 100 years of the palaeographically determined age.  The Isaiah scroll was included in the testing and was found to have two possible date ranges at a 2σ confidence level, because of the shape of the calibration curve at that point: there is a 15% chance that it dates from 355–295 BC, and an 84% chance that it dates from 210–45 BC.  Subsequently, these dates were criticized on the grounds that before the scrolls were tested, they had been treated with modern castor oil in order to make the writing easier to read; it was argued that failure to remove the castor oil sufficiently would have caused the dates to be too young.  Multiple papers have been published both supporting and opposing the criticism.&lt;ref name="taylor38" /&gt;

=== Impact ===
Soon after the publication of Libby's 1949 paper in ''Science'', universities around the world began establishing radiocarbon-dating laboratories, and by the end of the 1950s there were more than 20 active {{chem|14|C}} research laboratories.  It quickly became apparent that the principles of radiocarbon dating were valid, despite certain discrepancies, the causes of which then remained unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on archaeology{{snd}}often described as the "radiocarbon revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1997), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of anthropologist R.&amp;nbsp;E. Taylor, "{{chem|14|C}} data made a ''world'' prehistory possible by contributing a time scale that transcends local, regional and continental boundaries". It provides more accurate dating within sites than previous methods, which usually derived either from stratigraphy or from typologies (e.g. of stone tools or pottery); it also allows comparison and synchronization of events across great distances. The advent of radiocarbon dating may even have led to better field methods in archaeology, since better data recording leads to firmer association of objects with the samples to be tested. These improved field methods were sometimes motivated by attempts to prove that a {{chem|14|C}} date was incorrect. Taylor also suggests that the availability of definite date information freed archaeologists from the need to focus so much of their energy on determining the dates of their finds, and led to an expansion of the questions archaeologists were willing to research. For example, from the 1970s questions about the evolution of human behaviour were much more frequently seen in archaeology.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Taylor (1987), pp. 143–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dating framework provided by radiocarbon led to a change in the prevailing view of how innovations spread through prehistoric Europe. Researchers had previously thought that many ideas spread by diffusion through the continent, or by invasions of peoples bringing new cultural ideas with them. As radiocarbon dates began to prove these ideas wrong in many instances, it became apparent that these innovations must sometimes have arisen locally. This has been described as a "second radiocarbon revolution", and with regard to British prehistory, archaeologist [[Richard J.C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]] has characterized the impact of radiocarbon dating as "radical&amp;nbsp;... therapy" for the "progressive disease of invasionism". More broadly, the success of radiocarbon dating stimulated interest in analytical and statistical approaches to archaeological data.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  Taylor has also described the impact of AMS, and the ability to obtain accurate measurements from very small samples, as ushering in a third radiocarbon revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew (2014), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, radiocarbon dating techniques date an object of popular interest, for example the [[Shroud of Turin]], a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories [[Radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin|dated samples of linen from the Shroud in 1988]]; the results pointed to 14th-century origins, raising doubts about the shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.&lt;ref name=Currie_2004 /&gt;

Researchers have studied other radioactive isotopes created by cosmic rays to determine if they could also be used to assist in dating objects of archaeological interest; such isotopes include [[Helium-3|{{Chem|3|He}}]], [[Beryllium-10|{{Chem|10|Be}}]], [[Neon-21|{{Chem|21|Ne}}]], [[Aluminium-26|{{Chem|26|Al}}]], and [[Chlorine-36|{{Chem|36|Cl}}]].  With the development of AMS in the 1980s it became possible to measure these isotopes precisely enough for them to be the basis of useful dating techniques, which have been primarily applied to dating rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2005), pp. 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Naturally occurring radioactive isotopes can also form the basis of dating methods, as with [[K-Ar dating|potassium–argon dating]], [[argon–argon dating]], and [[Uranium–thorium dating|uranium series dating]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2005), pp. 57–77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other dating techniques of interest to archaeologists include [[Thermoluminescence dating|thermoluminescence]], [[optically stimulated luminescence]], [[electron spin resonance]], and [[fission track dating]], as well as techniques that depend on annual bands or layers, such as [[dendrochronology]], [[tephrochronology]], and [[varve]] chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2005), pp. 93–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''''' ({{lang-de|Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus}}) is a book written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[sociologist]], economist, and politician. Begun as a series of essays, the original German text was composed in 1904 and 1905, and was translated into English for the first time by American sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="WeberBaehr2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Max Weber|author2=Peter R. Baehr|author3=Gordon C. Wells|title=The Protestant ethic and the "spirit" of capitalism and other writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MmligHndssC|accessdate=21 August 2011|year=2002|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-043921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a founding text in [[economic sociology]] and [[sociology]] in general.

In the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in [[Northern Europe]] evolved when the [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprise]]s and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the [[Protestant work ethic]] was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKinnon | first1 = AM | year = 2010 | title = Elective affinities of the Protestant ethic: Weber and the chemistry of capitalism | url = http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Sociological Theory | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 108–126 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2009.01367.x| hdl = 2164/3035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, apart from Calvinists, Weber also discusses [[Lutherans]] (especially [[Pietists]], but also notes differences between traditional Lutherans and Calvinists), [[Methodists]], [[Baptists]], [[Quakers]], and [[Moravians]] (specifically referring to the [[Herrnhut]]-based community under [[Count von Zinzendorf]]'s spiritual lead).

In 1998, the [[International Sociological Association]] listed this work as the fourth most important sociological book of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="isa-sociology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/books-of-the-xx-century/|title=ISA - International Sociological Association: Books of the Century|publisher=International Sociological Association|year=1998 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the 8th most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Elliott|title=What are the most-cited publications in the social sciences (according to Google Scholar)?|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/12/what-are-the-most-cited-publications-in-the-social-sciences-according-to-google-scholar/|website=LSE Imact Blog|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

===Basic concepts===
Although not a detailed study of Protestantism but rather an introduction to Weber's later studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economics (''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]],'' ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]],'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]),'' ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' argues that [[Puritan]] [[ethic]]s and [[idea]]s influenced the development of capitalism. The 'spirit of capitalism' does not refer to the spirit in the metaphysical sense but rather a set of values, the spirit of hard work and progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Michael Shea |url=http://discoversociety.org/2015/10/06/the-protestant-ethic-and-the-language-of-austerity/ |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Language of Austerity |date=6 October 2015 |publisher=[[Discover Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious devotion, Weber argues, is usually accompanied by a rejection of worldly affairs, including the pursuit of wealth and possessions. To illustrate his theory, Weber quotes the ethical writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]]:

{{quote|sign=|source=|Remember, that ''time is money''.  He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle, one half of that day, though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon ''that'' the only expense; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides. [...] Remember, that money is the ''prolific, generating nature''. Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and so on. Five shillings turned is six, turned again is seven and threepence, and so on, till it becomes a hundred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding feline taint, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation. He that murders a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores of pounds.}}

Weber notes that this is not a philosophy of mere greed, but a statement laden with moral language. Indeed, Franklin claims that God revealed the usefulness of virtue to him.&lt;ref name="protestant"&gt;Weber, Max "The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism" (Penguin Books, 2002) translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9–12}}

The Reformation profoundly affected the view of work, dignifying even the most mundane professions as adding to the common good and thus blessed by God, as much as any "sacred" calling (German: ''Ruf''). A common illustration is that of a cobbler, hunched over his work, who devotes his entire effort to the praise of God.

To emphasize the [[work ethic]] in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a higher wage, with the expectation that laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer. However, in precapitalist societies this often results in laborers spending ''less'' time harvesting. Laborers judge that they can earn the same, while spending less time working and having more leisure. He also notes that societies having more Protestants are those that have a more developed capitalist economy.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|15–16}}

It is particularly advantageous in technical occupations for workers to be extremely devoted to their craft.  To view the craft as an end in itself, or as a "calling" would serve this need well. This attitude is well-noted in certain classes which have endured religious education, especially of a [[Pietist]] background.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

He defines spirit of capitalism as the ideas and ''esprit'' that favour the [[Rationalization (sociology)|rational]] pursuit of [[Wealth|economic gain]]: "We shall nevertheless provisionally use the expression 'spirit of capitalism' for that attitude which, ''in the pursuit of a calling [berufsmäßig]'', strives systematically for profit for its own sake in the manner exemplified by Benjamin Franklin."&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

Weber points out that such a [[spirit]] is not limited to [[Western culture]] if one considers it as the attitude of [[Person|individual]]s, but that such individuals – heroic entrepreneurs, as he calls them – could not by themselves establish a new economic order (capitalism).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'',  University of California Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54–55}} He further noted that the spirit of capitalism could be divorced from religion, and that those passionate capitalists of his era were either passionate against the Church or at least indifferent to it.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Desire for profit with minimum effort and seeing work as a burden to be avoided, and doing no more than what was enough for modest life, were common attitudes.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|55}} As he wrote in his essays:

:{{quote|In order that a manner of life well adapted to the peculiarities of the capitalism… could come to dominate others, it had to originate somewhere, and not in isolated individuals alone, but as a way of life common to the whole groups of man.}}

After defining the "spirit of capitalism," Weber argues that there are many reasons to find its origins in the religious ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Many others like [[William Petty]], [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[John Keats]] have noted the [[Affinity (sociology)|affinity]] between Protestantism and the development of [[commercialism]].&lt;ref name="Bendix54"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber shows that certain branches of Protestantism had supported worldly activities dedicated to economic gain, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance. This recognition was not a goal in itself; rather they were a byproduct of other doctrines of faith that encouraged planning, hard work and self-denial in the pursuit of worldly riches.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

===Origins of the Protestant work ethic===

Weber traced the origins of the Protestant ethic to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], though he acknowledged some respect for secular everyday labor as early as the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|28}} The Roman Catholic Church assured salvation to individuals who accepted the church's sacraments and submitted to the clerical authority. However, the Reformation had effectively removed such assurances. From a [[psychological]] viewpoint, the average person had difficulty adjusting to this new worldview, and only the most devout believers or "religious geniuses" within Protestantism, such as [[Martin Luther]], were able to make this adjustment, according to Weber.

In the absence of such assurances from religious authority, Weber argued that Protestants began to look for other "signs" that they were saved. Calvin and his followers taught a doctrine of [[Predestination|double predestination]], in which from the beginning God chose some people for salvation and others for damnation. The inability to influence one's own salvation presented a very difficult problem for Calvin's followers. It became an absolute duty to believe that one was chosen for salvation, and to dispel any doubt about that: lack of self-confidence was evidence of insufficient faith and a sign of damnation. So, self-confidence took the place of priestly assurance of God's grace.

Worldly success became one measure of that self-confidence. Luther made an early endorsement of Europe's emerging divisions. Weber identifies the applicability of Luther's conclusions, noting that a "vocation" from God was no longer limited to the clergy or church, but applied to any occupation or trade. Weber had always detested Lutheranism for the servility it inspired toward the bureaucratic state. When he discussed it in the ''Protestant Ethic'', he used Lutheranism as the chief example of the ''[[unio mystica]]'' that contrasted sharply with the ascetic posture. Later he would associate "Luther, the symbolic exponent of [[bureaucratic despotism]], with the ascetic hostility to [[Eros]] — an example of Weber's sporadic tendency to link together bureaucratic and ascetic modes of life and to oppose both from mystical and aristocratic perspectives."&lt;ref name="Mitzman1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Mitzman|title=The Iron Cage: An Historical Interpretation of Max Weber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mayilngcerQC&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=1970|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3745-3|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Weber saw the fulfillment of the Protestant ethic not in [[Lutheranism]], which was too concerned with the reception of divine spirit in the soul, but in [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] forms of Christianity.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|32–33}} The trend was carried further still in Pietism.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|90}} The [[Baptists]] diluted the concept of the calling relative to Calvinists, but other aspects made its congregants fertile soil for the development of capitalism—namely, a lack of paralyzing ascetism, the refusal to accept state office and thereby develop ''un''politically, and the doctrine of control by conscience which caused rigorous honesty.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|102–104}}

What Weber argued, in simple terms:
* According to the new Protestant religions, an individual was religiously compelled to follow a secular vocation (German: ''Beruf'') with as much zeal as possible. A person living according to this world view was more likely to accumulate money.
* The new religions (in particular, Calvinism and other more austere Protestant sects) effectively forbade wastefully ''using'' hard earned money and identified the purchase of luxuries as a [[sin]]. Donations to an individual's church or congregation were limited due to the rejection by certain Protestant sects of [[icon]]s. Finally, donation of money to the poor or to [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] was generally frowned on as it was seen as furthering beggary. This social condition was perceived as laziness, burdening their fellow man, and an affront to God; by not working, one failed to glorify God.

The manner in which this paradox was resolved, Weber argued, was the investment of this money, which gave an extreme boost to [[Primitive accumulation|nascent capitalism]].

===The Protestant work ethic in Weber's time===

By the time Weber wrote his essay, he believed that the religious underpinnings of the Protestant ethic had largely gone from society. He cited the writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]], which emphasized frugality, hard work and thrift, but were mostly free of spiritual content. Weber also attributed the success of mass production partly to the Protestant ethic. Only after expensive luxuries were disdained could individuals accept the uniform products, such as clothes and furniture, that industrialization offered.

In his remarkably prescient conclusion to the book, Weber lamented that the loss of religious underpinning to capitalism's spirit has led to a kind of involuntary servitude to mechanized industry.

{{quote|The Puritan wanted to work in calling; we are forced to do so.  For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order.  This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force.  Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter’s view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the 'saint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any moment.' But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage. (Page 181, 1953 Scribner's edition.)}}

Weber maintained that while Puritan religious ideas had significantly impacted the development of economic system in Europe and United States, there were other factors in play, as well. They included a closer relationship between mathematics and [[observation]], the enhanced value of scholarship, rational systematization of government administration, and an increase in entrepreneurship ventures. In the end, the study of Protestant ethic, according to Weber, investigated a part of the detachment from [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], that ''disenchantment of the world'' that could be seen as a unique characteristic of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|60}}

===Conclusions===

In the final endnotes Weber states that he abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague [[Ernst Troeltsch]], a professional [[theology|theologian]], had begun work on ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects''. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area, which is laying groundwork for comparative analysis of religion and society. Weber moved beyond Protestantism with his research but would continue research into [[sociology of religion]] within his later works (the study of [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Judaism]] and the religions of [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|China]] and [[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Budhism|India]]).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"/&gt;{{rp|49}}

This book is also Weber's first brush with the concept of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]. His idea of modern capitalism as growing out of the religious pursuit of wealth meant a change to a rational means of existence, wealth. That is to say, at some point the Calvinist rationale informing the "spirit" of capitalism became unreliant on the underlying religious movement behind it, leaving only rational capitalism. In essence then, Weber's "Spirit of Capitalism" is effectively and more broadly a Spirit of Rationalization.

==Reception==
The essay can also be interpreted as one of Weber's criticisms of [[Karl Marx]] and his theories. While Marx's [[historical materialism]] held that all human institutions – including religion – were based on economic foundations, many have seen ''The Protestant Ethic'' as turning this theory on its head by implying that a religious movement fostered capitalism, not the other way around.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Other scholars have taken a more nuanced view of Weber's argument. Weber states in the closing of this essay, "it is, of course, not my aim to substitute for a one-sided materialistic an equally one-sided spiritualistic causal interpretation of culture and history. Each is equally possible, but each if it does not serve as the preparation, but as the conclusion of an investigation, accomplishes equally little in the interest of historical truth." Weber's argument can be understood as an attempt to deepen the understanding of the cultural origins of capitalism, which does not exclude the historical materialist origins described by Marx: modern capitalism emerged from an elective affinity of 'material; and 'ideal' factors.&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Economic criticism===
The economist and historian [[Henryk Grossman]] criticises Weber's analysis on two fronts, firstly with reference to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s extensive work which showed that the stringent legal measures taken against poverty and vagabondage was a reaction to the massive population shifts caused by the [[enclosure]] of the [[commons]] in England.  And, secondly, in Grossman's own work showing how this "bloody legislation" against those who had been put off their land was effected across Europe and especially in France.  For Grossman this legislation, the outlawing of [[idleness]] and the [[poorhouses]] they instituted physically forced people from [[serfdom]] into [[wage-labor]].  For him, this general fact was not related to Protestantism and so capitalism came largely by force and not by any vocational training regarding an inner-worldliness of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Henryk (2006) ‘The Beginnings of Capitalism and the New Mass Morality’ Journal of Classical Sociology 6 (2): July&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible that the Protestant "work ethic" reinforced or legitimized these legal measures within a larger cultural context.

In a paper published on 10 November 2009, Harvard economist Davide Cantoni tested Weber's Protestant hypothesis using population and economic growth in second-millennium Germany as the data set, with negative results. Cantoni writes:

{{quote|Using population figures in a dataset comprising 276 cities in the years 1300–1900, I find no effects of Protestantism on economic growth. The finding is robust to the inclusion of a variety of controls, and does not appear to depend on data selection or small sample size. In addition, Protestantism has no effect when interacted with other likely determinants of economic development. I also analyze the endogeneity of religious choice; instrumental variables estimates of the effects of Protestantism are similar to the OLS results.&lt;ref&gt;David Cantoni, "The Economic Effects of the Protestant Reformation: Testing the Weber Hypothesis in the German Lands," November 2009, {{cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205143318/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |archivedate=5 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Cantoni uses city size, and not relative real wage growth, which was the Weber thesis, as his "main dependent variable" (Cantoni, 2).

Other recent scholarship continues to find valid Protestant Ethic effects both in historical and contemporary development patterns.

Dudley and Blum write:
{{quote|Evidence of falling wages in Catholic cities and rising wages in Protestant cities between 1500 and 1750, during the spread of literacy in the vernacular, is inconsistent with most theoretical models of economic growth. In The Protestant Ethic, Weber suggested an alternative explanation based on culture. Here, a theoretical model confirms that a small change in the subjective cost of cooperating with strangers can generate a profound transformation in trading networks. In explaining urban growth in early-modern Europe, specifications compatible with human-capital versions of the neoclassical model and endogenous-growth theory are rejected in favor of a "small-world" formulation based on the Weber thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807123042/http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archivedate=2003-08-07  |title=Religion and Economic Growth: Was Weber Right? |first1=Ulrich |last1=Blum |first2=Leonard |last2=Dudley |date=February 2001 |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=207–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Revisionist criticism===
H. M. Robertson, in his book ''Aspects of Economic Individualism'', argued against the historical and religious claims of Weber. Robertson points out that capitalism began to flourish not in Britain, but in 14th century Italy, a decidedly different epoch. Since this is true, then the rise of capitalism cannot be attributed to [[Adam Smith]], the Protestant Reformation, etc. In fact, Robertson goes further, and states that what happened in Britain was rather a retrogression from what was achieved in Italy centuries earlier.

Looking at the history of the development of economic thought, Robertson shows that Adam Smith and [[David Ricardo]] did not found economic science ''de novo''. In fact, liberal economic theory was developed by French and Italian Catholics, who were influenced by the [[Scholastics]]. The British economic thought was rather a step backwards since it espoused the [[Labor Theory of Value]], which had already been proved incorrect by the [[School of Salamanca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313191910/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-13 |title=Catholicism, Protestantism, and Capitalism |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |author-link=Murray Rothbard |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=February 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===
It has recently been suggested that Protestantism has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the "Protestant ethics" but rather through the promotion of literacy.&lt;ref name="urss.ru"&gt;[[Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'', Moscow: URSS, {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}} [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14&amp;page=Book&amp;id=34250] ([http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=187&amp;Itemid=70 Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and "the Spirit of Capitalism"]). P.87-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker and Wossmann at the University of Munich,&lt;ref name="epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de"&gt;Becker, Sascha O. and Wossmann, Ludger. "Was Weber Wrong? A Human Capital Theory of Protestant Economics History." Munich Discussion Paper No. 2007-7, 22 January 2007. http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1366/1/weberLMU.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Andrey Korotayev]] and [[Daria Khaltourina]] at the Russian Academy of Sciences,&lt;ref name="urss.ru"/&gt; showed that literacy levels differing in religious areas can sufficiently explain the economic gaps cited by Weber. The results were supported even under a concentric diffusion model of Protestantism using distance from Wittenberg as a model.&lt;ref name="epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de"/&gt;

==Support==

In 1958, American sociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]] conducted an empirical inquiry into "religion's impact on politics, economics, and family life" in the [[Detroit]], Mich., area. It revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with respect to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported basic hypotheses of Weber's work ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''. According to Lenski, "the contribution of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory." Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, [[John Wesley]], one of the founders of the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church, had observed that "diligence and frugality" made Methodists wealthy. "In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress. Both facilitated the accumulation of capital, so critically important to the economic growth and development of nations."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics. and Family Life'', Revised Edition, Garden City, N.Y., pp. 350-352&lt;/ref&gt;

German theologian Friedrich Wilhelm Graf notes: "Sociologists of religion like [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] have interpreted the Protestant revolution in [[Latin America]] as implicit support of basic elements of Weber's thesis. [...] At any rate, many pious persons there interpret their transition from the Roman Catholic church to Protestant [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregations in terms of a moral idea that promises long-term economic gains through strong innerworldly asceticism. The strict ascetic self-discipline that has been successfully institutionalized in the Pentecostal congregations, the readiness to work more and with greater effort and to take less leisurely attitudes lead many Pentecostal Christians to believe that their new faith in God is supported by their economic successes."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Graf (2010), ''Der Protestantismus. Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Second, Revised Edition, Munich (Germany), pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tickling games''' are interpersonal or social activities involving the [[tickling]] of one person by another. Some people find tickling to not only be a pleasurable experience, but also an [[erotic]] one. They may be [[sexual arousal|sexually excited]] by being tickled or by tickling another person.&lt;ref name=Love&gt;Love B., ''Encyclopedia of Unusual Sex Practices.'' New York: Barricade Books Inc.; 1992. p280-281.&lt;/ref&gt; Some engage in tickling games as part of a social act.

==Terminology==
'''[[Knismesis and gargalesis|Knismolagnia]]''' is the experience of "arousal from [[tickling]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page=375 |title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unususal Sexual Practices|first=Anil|last=Aggrawal|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|year=2009|ISBN=978-1-4200-4308-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Acarophilia]]''', often confused{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} with knismolagnia, refers to arousal from scratching.

Excessive tickling has been described as a primary sexual obsession and, under these circumstances, is sometimes considered a form of [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis|Ellis H.]] ''Studies in the psychology of sex.'' Vol. iii. Philadelphia: FA Davis Co.; 1926&lt;/ref&gt; People whose [[human sexuality|sexuality]] is based almost solely on tickling can be said to have a tickling fixation. This [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] may also exist outside of sexual contexts.

==Overview==
Consensual tickling can be regarded as a form of [[physical intimacy]] as it involves the touching of one person's body by another. It could serve as a [[human bonding|bonding experience]] between friends, or a simple act of familiarity and trust. Between adults, it sometimes functions as an outlet for sexual energy, with [[erotic]] games, [[foreplay]] and [[Human sexual activity|sex]] being the primary methods of doing such.

==Tickling games==
[[File:Tickling fetish.jpg|thumb|A woman being tickled at [[EXXXOTICA]] New York 2009]]
Some people take part in tickling games or contests which test their endurance to being tickled, for amusement, erotic pleasure, or other reasons. These games may involve some form of [[Bondage (BDSM)|physical restraint]] of the person to be tickled to prevent them protecting the ticklish spots or otherwise interfering with the game. Common positions for tickling are the [[over-arm tie]], the [[hogtie bondage|hogtie]], [[Spreadeagle (position)|spread-eagle]], with the person being [[rope bondage|tied up]], [[Bondage cuffs|cuffed]] or in [[stocks]]. The restraints may be left loose to increase the amount of possible movement, but short of the person being able to protect the ticklish spots. On the other hand, some participants prefer very tight bondage. The tied person may also be [[blindfold]]ed to increase the anxiety and surprise element.

The objective of such games is to generate uncontrollable writhing, struggling, laughing and vocalizations etc., from the person being tickled, while the person tries to control such reactions, without the ability to physically defend the ticklish spots.

In [[dominance and submission]] scenarios, [[sexual partner]]s may agree upon a [[safeword]] such as "falafel", "watermelon", or "bicycle" to signal that tickling should stop.

==History==
Trinity Western University traces its history back to 1957, when a committee was established by the [[Evangelical Free Church of America]] to study and consider the feasibility of a liberal arts college on North America's [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific Coast]]. The committee decided on a location between [[Vancouver]] and [[Seattle]] in rural British Columbia, in what is now the [[Township of Langley]]. 
Trinity Junior College began as a two-year college in 1962, and its name was changed to Trinity Western College 10 years later, following a significant period of growth in enrollment and program options. After 20 years as a transfer college, Trinity Western began awarding [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degrees in 1980.  
In 1985 the British Columbia Provincial Government legislated the institution to its current position as a privately funded Christian university and it became known as Trinity Western University.&lt;ref name=history0708&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twu.ca/academics/calendar/ac0708-what-twu-is-all-about.pdf|title=What Trinity Western University is All About|accessdate=February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305001125/http://www.twu.ca/academics/calendar/ac0708-what-twu-is-all-about.pdf|archive-date=March 5, 2009|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the fourth-oldest university in the province of British Columbia after [[UBC|the University of British Columbia]], the University of Victoria, and [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wiki|url=https://www2.viu.ca/homeroom/content/timeline/1950s/1960.htm|title=British Columbia History of Higher Education Timeline|publisher=Vancouver Island University |year=1997|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate===
Undergraduate degrees awarded by Trinity Western University include the [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]], [[Bachelor of Business Administration]], [[Bachelor of Education]], and [[Bachelor of Human Kinetics]]. There is also a [[Bachelor of Engineering#Canada|Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering]] transfer program in collaboration with the [[University of British Columbia]]'s engineering department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twu.ca/academics/science/engineering/ |title=Engineering at Trinity Western University |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814221254/http://twu.ca/academics/science/engineering/ |archivedate=August 14, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Honors course|Honours]] programs are available in a number of majors.

Undergraduate courses in the humanities are traditionally either seminars or lectures held one- or two-times a week with an additional conversation-based seminar called a "discussion group". To graduate, all students must complete a [[liberal arts]] [[Core curriculum#Core curriculum|core curriculum]] known as the "University Core", comprising 18 classes of various subjects. Students have a high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured Core, which allows students to study subjects of interest outside their chosen major. Most of the Core classes at Trinity Western are led by a full-time professor (as opposed to a teaching assistant).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Within the 18 classes, students complete a two-semester English language requirement, along with courses from the [[fine art]]s, [[natural science]]s, [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[religious studies]] departments, two courses of [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary studies]], and up to three [[physical education]] courses.

In addition to the Core, students are required to complete an [[academic major]]. Trinity Western University grants [[bachelor's degrees]] in 45 academic majors, and 56 minors, concentrations, or certificates, with over 1,200 courses from which to choose.&lt;ref name=fastfacts /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Canada |url=http://twu.ca/undergraduate/academics/majors-and-programs/ |title=Trinity Western University |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may choose courses from any of the university's faculties or schools:

===Christian Creed and Covenant===
The university was founded by a committee commissioned by the [[Evangelical Free Church of America]] to establish a Christian liberal arts college. As such, the committee's mission has shaped the campus and the university. Trinity Western University has maintained extremely close ties with the broader [[Christian church]], and historically has had close relationships with the [[Evangelical]] and [[Mainline Protestant]] denominations, as well as with the [[Mennonite]] tradition recently. This has also resulted in the university having a significant American influence when compared with other Canadian universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twu.ca/life/community/traditions/can-am-game.html |title=Can-Am Hockey Game |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=August 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918060015/http://www.twu.ca/life/community/traditions/can-am-game.html |archivedate=September 18, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than one out of every six students is American.&lt;ref name=fastfacts /&gt;

The university previously mandated that all students abide by a code of conduct called the Community Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/07/02/court-upholds-law-societys-decision-not-to-accredit-trinity-western-university.html|quote=Trinity Western University in Langley, B.C. plans to open a law school in 2015.

Approximately 80% of undergraduates enrolled self-identify as Christian. &lt;!--Denominations and traditions with significant representation in the makeup of the university include the Evangelical, mainline Protestant, Mennonite, [[Anglican]], [[Catholic]], and [[Pentecostal]] denominations. [[Jewish]] and [[Muslim]] students also attend, as do [[Buddhists]] and students of [[Atheism|no faith]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}--&gt; There are many Christian clubs, organizations, and ministries on campus. There is no compulsory participation in any religious liturgies. Students and clubs of other religious denominations are welcomed and supported. Nearly every resident hall has a [[Chaplain]] in residence. In the morning on every weekday there is [[Chapel]], at which attendance is voluntary, and [[Eucharist|communion]] is offered each Friday. Within the university Core, students are required four terms of Religious Studies. One term is allotted to a Survey of the [[Old Testament]], and one to a Survey of the [[New Testament]]. Another term must be a class in Religious and Cultural studies.

===Insignia and symbols===

Trinity Western's motto is Turris Fortis Deus Noster. The Latin motto is translated as "A Mighty Fortress is Our God". The inspiration for the motto came from a famous hymn of the same name written by [[Martin Luther]].

The Coat of Arms of Trinity Western University depicts an Azure shield enshrined with an Or Trinity Cross and an Or B.C. sun. Surrounding the shield are a Pioneer holding a rifle and an Aboriginal Chief wearing a headdress and carrying a talking stick, both of the mid 19th century. The two are standing with the shield on a field of [[Pacific Dogwood]]s, the provincial flower of British Columbia. Above the shield are gold and blue banners, and protecting it is the helmet of salvation. Above the banners is Old Fort Langley, on which the Hudson Bay flag is flying. Surrounding the shield is an escroll on which the University motto is written. The Coat of Arms was granted by the Royal College of Arms, and was presented to then-university president R. Neil Snider in 1986 by the Lieutenant Governor of B.C. on behalf of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.twu.ca/sites/magazine/no-22/back-40/default.html |title=Flags, Flowers, and Fur Traders &amp;#124; Issue No. 22 - Trinity Western Magazine |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610184211/http://www.twu.ca/sites/magazine/no-22/back-40/default.html |archivedate=June 10, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A torch symbol is also used prevalently at the university, as the Coat of Arms is reserved to authenticate the highest official University academic and legal documents.

[[Spartiate|Spartans]] is the nickname of the varsity teams that compete for Trinity Western University. The name, which comes from the Ancient Greek civilization of Sparta, originated when the university's first intercollegiate team the men's basketball team, began competing in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.twu.ca/sites/magazine/no-15/athletics/default.html |title=Spartan Logo Reborn &amp;#124; Issue No. 15 - Trinity Western Magazine |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918064611/http://www.twu.ca/sites/magazine/no-15/athletics/default.html |archive-date=September 18, 2011 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The main campus is located in the rural [[Township of Langley]], [[British Columbia]], occupying {{convert|157|acre|km2}} on the edge of historic [[Fort Langley]]. Fort Langley, a former fur-trade post of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], was the first capital of British Columbia when the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] and the [[Colony of British Columbia]] were united under [[James Douglas (governor)|Governor Sir James Douglas]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Margaret A. Ormsby |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/sir-james-douglas |title=Sir James Douglas |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a residence hall on campus named in honour of Douglas. The campus is situated about 45 minutes southeast from [[Vancouver]] and about 2 hours north from [[Seattle]].

Campus buildings vary in age and style from Hanson Chapel, completed in 1962 (the first building completed on campus), to the Skidmore Hall dormitory, completed in 2017. Today the campus consists of 35 buildings and residence halls that house the university's various departments and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twu.ca/about/campus-locations/campus-map |title=Trinity Western University - Campus Map|publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lake TWU.jpg|right|250px|thumb|McMillan Lake]]

The architecture on campus is inspired by British Columbia, Rural B.C., and the Pacific Northwest. Modern red brick covers Alloway Library, Larsen Atrium, and Stanley Nelson Student Centre at the main part of campus. Other significant buildings on campus include Robert N. Thompson Building which houses the Political Science, History, English, and Geography departments. The newly built and yet to be named Music Building is home to the School of Art, Media + Culture. The Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences are housed in the Neufeld Science Centre, which experienced a major renovation in 2011, and the Vernon Stromback Centre at the east end of campus. In total there are 33 buildings on the university campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Canada |url=http://twu.ca/campus/map-numerical.html |title=Trinity Western University |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=September 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815174054/http://twu.ca/campus/map-numerical.html |archivedate=August 15, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During President Raymond's tenure, the university has built the Music Building in 2010, and in 2011 Fraser Hall and the Neufeld Science Centre received major renovations in 2011.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} In 2012 the Vernon Strombeck Centre received a significant interior and exterior renovation, and in 2013 the prominent Robert N.

===Athletic facilities===

Rogers Field is located on the northeast edge of campus, and is the home pitch to the women's and men's varsity soccer teams. In 2008 Rogers Field was the host venue as the Spartans women's soccer team won the CIS Championship. It also hosted the men's CIS Championship in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/msoc/past_champs |title=CIS : Past CIS Champions |publisher=English.cis-sic.ca |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David E. Enarson Gymnasium has been the university's indoor sports venue since it was built in 1969. In 2009, the newly built [[Langley Events Centre]] replaced Enarson as the home of Spartans basketball and volleyball, and replaced George Preston Arena as the home of Spartans hockey. The LEC was the host venue when the Spartans' men's volleyball team won the CIS Championship in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/mvball/past_champs |title=CIS : Past Champions |publisher=English.cis-sic.ca |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Enarson Gymnasium houses the university's athletic offices and strength and conditioning room, hosts physical education classes and intramurals, and occasionally varsity sports events. It is also the new home court for the [[Vancouver Dragons]] of the [[Minor League Basketball Association]]. 

Tennis courts, an indoor rock wall, and practice fields are also located on campus. Though the university does not sponsor rowing teams, there are rowing facilities on the [[Fraser River]]. The cross country and track and field teams train at the Township of Langley's McLeod Athletic Park, the host park of the B.C. high school championships and the 2010 [[BC Summer Games|British Columbia Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.theprovince.com/2013/05/31/new-venue-new-future-as-bchs-track-and-field-meet-moves-from-burnaby-to-langleys-mcleod-park/ New venue, new future as BCHS track and field meet moves from Burnaby to Langley’s McLeod Park | The Province].

[[File:Booth House.JPG|right|thumb|The Laurentian Leadership Centre, in Ottawa]] The home of the Laurentian Leadership Centre in Ottawa is the [[Booth House (Ottawa)|Booth House]], an historic mansion in [[Downtown Ottawa]] and a [[National Historic Site of Canada]]. Built in 1901 as the home of lumber and railway baron [[John Rudolphus Booth|John R. Booth]], Trinity Western purchased the building in 2000. Located on [[Metcalfe Street (Ottawa)|Metcalfe Street]] near [[Somerset Street (Ottawa)|Somerset]], the campus is within minutes of the [[Canadian Parliament]] and many important governmental ministries, departments, and embassies.

The '''Laurentian Leadership Centre''' program, an extension of Trinity Western University, offers third and fourth year students, and recent graduates, an opportunity to experience a fully credited semester of study as well as a [[Parliamentary]], communications, business or NGO internship in Canada's national capital, [[Ottawa]], Ontario. Although the program is open to students of any major, it is primarily designed for those who plan a career in political science, business, communications, history or international studies. The program is also open to visiting students from other universities.

The LLC is located a few blocks away from [[Parliament Hill]], Ottawa. The 20 students accepted to the program each semester take three academic courses in: Canadian Governmental Leadership, Ethics &amp; Public Affairs, and Law &amp; Public Policy. Courses are taught both by TWU professors as well as national and international leaders and guest speakers.

The internship program is the distinguishing feature of the Laurentian Leadership Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janet Epp-Buckingham |url=https://canadianchristianity.com/twu-proposes-law-school-4326/ |title=Trinity Western University proposes Law School |publisher=Canadian Christianity |date=September 18, 2012 |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.david-kilgour.com/faith/trinity.htm |title=Christian Students as Leaders in Public Life |publisher=David-kilgour.com |date=October 9, 2002 |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LLC director places each student in an internship relevant to his or her academic or career interest.

;Bellingham
Located very close to the Canadian-U.S. border on the U.S. side, Trinity Western's [[Bellingham]] campus provides adult degree completion Bachelor of Arts programs in leadership, psychology and the [[social sciences]]. Students meet one night per week and one Saturday per course. Upon completion of each six-week course in succession, students may work to finish their bachelor's degree in as few as 18 months, depending upon the number of credits transferred. TWU Bellingham personalizes evaluation of students' past education and life experiences to recognize the skills and knowledge applied to degree requirements. Classes engage dynamic discussions, are learner-centred and success focused.

Trinity Western's Bellingham campus also hosts the unique Freshman FASTTrack program, a one-year program of liberal arts core courses for new freshman. The program is designed to aid the transition from high school to university, transferring into the four-year college or university of their choice. Subjects are integrated to maximize interdisciplinary learning. Using the cohort model, small classes involve dynamic discussions and are supported with learning coaches. This concentrated immersion style of learning results in students completing a full 31 semester college credits attending morning classes, leaving their afternoons and evenings free to work or study.

The [[Trinity Western University Students Association]] is the elected government of the student body, and works as an aid and mediator between individual students and university administration, in addition to sponsoring several events throughout the academic year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twusa.ca/documents/TWUSABylaws.pdf TWUSA Bylaws] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://twusa.ca/documents/PolicyManual.doc TWUSA Policy Manual] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the university's chamber choirs are often invited to guest perform with the [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]], performances which have been broadcast on a number of occasions on [[CBC Radio]]; as well, Trinity Western's choirs have performed frequently with the [[CBC Radio Orchestra]], the [[Vancouver Chamber Choir]], and at venues including [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City|New York]] and frequent performances at the [[Orpheum, Vancouver]], and the [[Chan Shun Concert Hall]].

The university hosts three student publications. ''[[Mars' Hill]]'', the [[student newspaper]], is one of the most decorated student newspapers in North America in recent years. ''Mars' Hill'' has won the [[Associated Collegiate Press]] [[National Pacemaker Awards|National Pacemaker Award]], considered the [[Pulitzer Prize]] of student journalism, for best non-daily newspaper in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentpress.org/acp/winners/npm08.html|title=2008 ACP Newspaper Pacemaker Winners|publisher=National Scholastic Press Association/Associated Collegiate Press|accessdate=April 14, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421084307/http://studentpress.org/acp/winners/npm08.html|archivedate=April 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studentpress.org/acp/winners/npm10.html |title=ACP - Contest Winners |publisher=Studentpress.org |accessdate=August 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829125827/http://www.studentpress.org/acp/winners/npm10.html |archivedate=August 29, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a finalist in 2006 and 2009.

===Athletics===
{{Main|Trinity Western Spartans}}
Since its founding in 1962 Trinity Western has provided athletics for both women and men. Today, the university supports athletics at the varsity, club, and intramural levels. Its colours are gold and blue.

The university sponsors 11 men's and women's varsity sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twu.ca/athletics|title=Trinity Western Athletics|work=twu.ca|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams compete in [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]], the top university athletics league in Canada, with teams competing in the [[Canada West Universities Athletic Association]] at the regional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadawest.org/sports/2010/8/2/Members.aspx |title=Canada West Universities Athletic Association - Canada West Members |publisher=Canadawest.org |accessdate=August 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819132643/http://www.canadawest.org/sports/2010/8/2/Members.aspx |archivedate=August 19, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Varsity teams competing in [[U Sports]] include men's and women's [[basketball]], [[soccer]], [[volleyball]], [[track and field]], and [[cross country running|cross country]]. The men's [[ice hockey|hockey]] team plays in the [[British Columbia Intercollegiate Hockey League]]. The basketball, volleyball, and hockey teams play their home games and matches at the [[Langley Events Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.langleyeventscentre.com/our-community/teams |title=Teams |publisher=Langley Events Centre |accessdate=August 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410124402/http://langleyeventscentre.com/our-community/teams |archivedate=April 10, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity Western teams have won nine U Sports national championships.

In addition to varsity sports, Trinity Western hosts five club sports teams for students who wish to participate in athletics at a high level while not making the time commitment that would be needed to compete on a varsity team. Club teams include women's and men's basketball and soccer, and men's hockey. Each year, several dozen teams compete in [[intramurals]]. Intramurals are open to members of the university's faculty, staff, and students, though a team representing a residential hall must consist only of members of that hall. Along with the academic requirements for graduation, Trinity Western requires every undergraduate to complete three classes of physical education, one of which is a lab in the Concepts of Physical Health.

===Traditions===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
Over its fifty years of history, the university and its students have developed several traditions, some formal, others informal. Some of the more noteworthy traditions include the CanAm game, a hockey game played between a side of male American students and a side of female Canadian students. The game is often hotly contested given its "Battle of the Sexes" nature with national pride on the line as well. Orientation Week is held at the beginning of each year for incoming freshman and new students. Continuous aspects of Orientation Week have been the Banana Challenge, Dorm Skit Night, and visiting [[Stanley Park]]. Hootenany is held every year at Enarson Gym, and showcases some of the university's more talented, and weird acts. Every other Friday during the academic year "11:07", a student improv comedy show, is held in the theatre. 11:07 is often widely attended given many of the students inability to leave campus. Every year the art students have a Senior Show, which shows art ranging from installation, to sculpture, to painting, to video. Each April, the graduating seniors give themselves a Graduate Banquet. This is usually held at a hotel in [[Downtown Vancouver]], but in previous years has also taken place in [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]] and in Langley. On campus at the beginning of every hour, the Bell Tower tolls. Located near the centre of campus next to the library gardens, it is Trinity Western's tallest structure and its chimes can be heard across campus.

At Spartans' sporting events, students, alumni, and fans sing the Spartan Song, the [[fight song]] of the university. With their strong level of [[school spirit]], the university's fans have gained the nickname the "Spartan Faithful".&lt;ref&gt;[http://twu.ca/athletics/spartan/spartan-of-the-week/2008-2009/2008-10-26-spartan-faithful.html Home of the Faithful - The Legend Continues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614084319/http://twu.ca/athletics/spartan/spartan-of-the-week/2008-2009/2008-10-26-spartan-faithful.html |date=June 14, 2012 }}.

===Community Covenant===

TWU students and staff agree when joining the University community to abide by a common Community Covenant agreement, which it describes as "a solemn pledge in which members place themselves under obligations on the part of the institution to its members, the members to the institution, and the members to one another."

Members of the TWU community commit themselves to:

==Controversies and court cases==

In November 2016 ''[[The Province]]'' reported on the school's acceptance or lack thereof of [[LGBTQ]] students. According to the story, gay students were subjected to a culture of shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/queer-at-twu |title=A university's queer covenant: Is TWU controlling a culture of shame?|first=Bethany|last=Lindsay|accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching certification program accreditation lawsuit===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
{{Main|Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers}}

In 1995, Trinity Western launched a teaching certification program, but the [[British Columbia College of Teachers]] denied accreditation of the university's program, arguing that the "Responsibilities of Membership" agreement students must sign (replaced in 2009 with the Community Covenant) is discriminatory and that those graduating from Trinity Western's program will discriminate against [[gay]] students.&lt;ref name="lexum 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1867/index.do|title=~Supreme Court Judgments; Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers|publisher=Lexum|date=May 17, 2001|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower courts in British Columbia and, later, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], ruled in favour of Trinity Western University, stating that there was no basis for the BCCT's decision, and, moreover, that "the concern that graduates of TWU will act in a detrimental fashion in the classroom is not supported by any evidence".&lt;ref name="lexum 2001" /&gt;

The final analysis of the case, as reported by the Factum of the Intervener, the [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association|B.C. Civil Liberties Association]], was that "In the circumstances of this case the Council of the B.C. College of Teachers failed to conduct such an enquiry and erroneously concluded that equality of rights on the basis of sexual orientation trump freedom of religion and association. They do not."

===Faculty of Law accreditation lawsuits===
Automatic accreditation of graduates from TWU's proposed faculty of law were approved by most of the provincial law societies across Canada in 2014, except the Law Society of Upper Canada (now the [[Law Society of Ontario]]) and the [[Nova Scotia Barristers' Society]]. On June 11, 2014, 3,210 of the [[Law Society of British Columbia]]'s 13,000 members voted in support of a resolution to reverse its decision to grant the faculty accreditation and requested that the province revoke its accreditation of the law program because of the view that it discriminates against unmarried couples and homosexual individuals. 968 members voted against with 8,822 not registering a vote.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/trinity-western-law-school-loses-b-c-law-society-vote-1.2670688 |title=Trinity Western law school loses B.C. Law Society vote - British Columbia - CBC News |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 26, 2014 the governing members of the Law Society decided to hold a binding referendum of their membership to determine whether to revoke Trinity Western's accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/law-society-of-b-c-to-hold-binding-referendum-on-trinity-western-law-school-1.2778849|title=Law Society of B.C. to hold binding referendum on Trinity Western law school|work=CBC News |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nova Scotia: ''Trinity Western University v Nova Scotia Barristers' Society'''''

The case was brought before the [[Nova Scotia Supreme Court]], arguing that denying automatic accreditation to TWU law graduates is an infringement on the students' right to freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="courts.ns.ca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity Western University v. Nova Scotia Barristers' Society, 2015 NSSC 25|url=http://decisions.courts.ns.ca/nsc/nssc/en/item/100659/index.do|website=Nova Scotia Courts' Decision Database|publisher=Supreme Court of Nova Scotia|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court ruled in favour of TWU; accepting the argument that, as a private religious university, the school had the right to uphold its own code of conduct "even if the effect of that code is to exclude... or offend others" and attempting to force TWU to change its community covenant was an infringement on religious freedom. The ruling further noted that the [[Nova Scotia Barristers' Society]] already requires all lawyers to follow its Code of Professional Conduct, which forbids all discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Professional Conduct|url=http://nsbs.org/sites/default/files/cms/menu-pdf/2015-05-25_codeofconduct.pdf|publisher=Nova Scotia Barristers' Society|accessdate=July 8, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709153655/http://nsbs.org/sites/default/files/cms/menu-pdf/2015-05-25_codeofconduct.pdf|archivedate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the Community Covenant would not affect TWU graduates in their practice of law.&lt;ref name="courts.ns.ca"/&gt; The NSBS appealed to the [[Nova Scotia Court of Appeal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order CA438894: Trinity Western University v Nova Scotia Barristers' Society|url=https://www.nsbs.org/sites/default/files/ftp/TWU_Submissions/Order_CA438894_2015-08-28.pdf|publisher=Nova Scotia Court of Appeal}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the appeals court upheld the previous decision.&lt;ref name="twu v nsbs appeal dec - CBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Skenderis|first1=Stephanie|last2=Tattrie|first2=Jon|title=Trinity Western University wins legal battle with N.S.

'''Ontario: ''Trinity Western University v The Law Society of Upper Canada'''''

The case was brought before the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]], arguing that the law school graduates should not be refused automatic accreditation in Ontario by the Law Society of Upper Canada based on the Community Covenant Agreement of their school because it violates TWU students' rights to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and freedom of association.&lt;ref name=oscj-decision&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity Western University v. The Law Society of Upper Canada, 2015 ONSC 4250|url=http://www.ontariocourts.ca/en/2015ONSC4250.htm|publisher=Ontario Superior Court of Justice|accessdate=July 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704185642/http://www.ontariocourts.ca/en/2015ONSC4250.htm|archivedate=July 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court ruled in favour of the LSUC; stating that its refusal to automatically accredit TWU graduates was a reasonable balancing of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter rights]] to equality and freedom of religion, and that the refusal of automatic accreditation was not a violation of TWU students' rights to freedom of expression or freedom of association. The ruling further noted that TWU graduates are free to apply independently to the LSUC for accreditation following their graduation.&lt;ref name=ts-lsuc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallant|first1=Jacques|title=Ontario court upholds Law Society's decision not to accredit Trinity Western University|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/07/02/court-upholds-law-societys-decision-not-to-accredit-trinity-western-university.html|accessdate=July 3, 2015|work=Toronto Star|date=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TWU filed a motion to appeal with the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] September 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motions for Leave to Appeal - 2015|url=http://www.ontariocourts.ca/coa/en/leave/2015.htm|website=Court of Appeal for Ontario|publisher=Ontario Courts Judges Library|accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling in favour of LSUC in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallant|first1=Jacques|date=June 29, 2016|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/06/29/ontario-appeal-court-upholds-decision-not-to-accredit-evangelical-law-school.html|title=Ontario appeal court upholds decision not to accredit evangelical law school|work=Toronto Star|access-date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''British Columbia: ''Trinity Western University v Law Society of British Columbia'''''

The case was brought before the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] on August 24, 2015 with hearings concluding on August 26. The [[Law Society of British Columbia]] had argued that TWU forcing students to sign the "Community Covenant" creates an unwelcome atmosphere for LGBTQ students and, given the high levels of competition for law school seats in Canada, would effectively create a two-tier system in which LGBTQ individuals would not have equal access to limited law school spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=4127&amp;t=Hearing-in-TWU-v.-Law-Society-of-BC-concludes|title=Hearing in TWU v.

The Court ruled in favour of TWU on December 10, 2015, overturning the LSBC's decision against accrediting the TWU law school and stating the LSBC did not "attempt to resolve the collision of the competing [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]] interests [of equality before the law and freedom of religion]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity Western University v.

[[File:TEAF Matrix of Views and Perspectives.svg|thumb|304px|The [[TEAF]] Matrix of Views and Perspectives.]]
A '''view model''' or '''viewpoints framework''' in [[systems engineering]], [[software engineering]], and [[enterprise engineering]] is a framework which defines a coherent set of ''views'' to be used in the construction of a [[system architecture]], [[software architecture]], or  [[enterprise architecture]]. A ''view'' is a representation of a whole system from the perspective of a related set of concerns.&lt;ref name="ISO42010"&gt;ISO/IEC/IEEE  42010:2011, Systems and software engineering — Architecture description&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 10746-1,
Information technology — Open Distributed Processing — Reference model: Overview&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1990s there have been a number of efforts to prescribe approaches for describing and analyzing system architectures. These recent efforts define a set of views (or viewpoints). They are sometimes referred to as [[architecture framework]]s or [[enterprise architecture framework]]s, but are not usually called "view models".

Usually a ''view'' is a work product that presents specific architecture data for a given system. However, the same term is sometimes used to refer to a view ''definition'', including the particular viewpoint and the corresponding guidance that defines each concrete view. The term ''view model'' is related to view definitions.

== Overview ==
The purpose of views and viewpoints is to enable humans to comprehend very [[complex system]]s, to organize the elements of the problem and the solution around domains of [[expertise]] and to [[Separation of concerns|separate concerns]]. In the [[engineering]] of physically intensive systems, viewpoints often correspond to capabilities and responsibilities within the engineering organization.&lt;ref name="NIST2003"&gt;Edward J. Barkmeyer ea (2003). [http://www.mel.nist.gov/msidlibrary/doc/AMIS-Concepts.pdf ''Concepts for Automating Systems Integration''] NIST 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most complex system specifications are so extensive that no single individual can fully comprehend all aspects of the specifications. Furthermore, we all have different interests in a given system and different reasons for examining the [[system]]'s [[specification]]s. A [[business]] executive will ask different questions of a system make-up than would a system implementer. The concept of viewpoints framework, therefore, is to provide separate viewpoints into the specification of a given complex system in order to facilitate communication with the stakeholders. Each viewpoint satisfies an audience with interest in a particular set of aspects of the system. Each viewpoint may use a specific ''viewpoint language'' that optimizes the vocabulary and presentation for the audience of that viewpoint. Viewpoint modeling has become an effective approach for dealing with the inherent complexity of large distributed systems.

Architecture description practices, as described in [[IEEE 1471|IEEE Std 1471-2000]], utilize multiple views to address several areas of concerns, each one focusing on a specific aspect of the system. Examples of [[architecture framework]]s using multiple views include Kruchten's [[4+1|"4+1" view model]], the [[Zachman Framework]], [[TOGAF]], [[DoDAF]], [[RM-ODP]], and Hamdaqa's [[5+1|"5+1" view model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamdaqa|first1=Mohammad|last2=Tahvildari|first2=Ladan|title=The (5+1) architectural view model for cloud applications|journal=Proceedings of 24th Annual International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering|pages=46–60|url=http://stargroup.uwaterloo.ca/~mhamdaqa/publications/CASCON2014-The%205+1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 1970s, methods began to appear in software engineering for modeling with multiple views. [[Douglas T. Ross]] and K.E. Schoman in 1977 introduce the constructs context, viewpoint, and vantage point to organize the modeling process in systems requirements definition.&lt;ref name="Ross-Schoman1977"&gt;[[Douglas T. Ross]] and K.E. Schoman, Jr. "Structured analysis for requirements definition." ''IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,'' SE-3(1), January 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ross and Schoman, a viewpoint "makes clear what aspects are considered relevant to achieving ... the overall purpose [of the model]" and determines ''How do we look at [a subject being modelled]?''

As examples of viewpoints, the paper offers: Technical, Operational and Economic viewpoints. In 1992, [[Anthony Finkelstein]] and others published a very important paper on viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Finkelstein+1992"&gt;[[Anthony Finkelstein|A. Finkelstein]], J. Kramer, B. Nuseibeh, L. Finkelstein, and M. Goedicke. "[http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/A.Finkelstein/papers/ijseke92.pdf Viewpoints: A framework for integrating multiple perspectives in system development]." ''International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering,'' 2(1):31-58, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In that work: "A viewpoint can be thought of as a combination of the idea of an “actor”, “knowledge source”, “role” or “agent” in the development process and the idea of a “view” or “perspective” which an actor maintains." An important idea in this paper was to distinguish "a ''representation style'', the scheme and notation by which the viewpoint expresses what it can see" and "a ''specification'', the statements expressed in the viewpoint's style describing particular domains". Subsequent work, such as [[IEEE 1471]], preserved this distinction by utilizing two separate terms: viewpoint and view, respectively.

Since the early 1990s there have been a number of efforts to codify approaches for describing and analyzing system architectures. These are often terms [[architecture framework]]s or sometimes ''viewpoint sets''. Many of these have been funded by the [[United States Department of Defense]], but some have sprung from international or national efforts in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] or the [[IEEE]]. Among these, the IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software-Intensive Systems ([[IEEE 1471|IEEE Std 1471-2000]]) established useful definitions of view, viewpoint, stakeholder and concern and guidelines for documenting a [[system architecture]] through the use of multiple views by applying viewpoints to address [[stakeholder analysis|stakeholder concerns]].&lt;ref name="ShSk"/&gt; The advantage of multiple views is that hidden requirements and stakeholder disagreements can be discovered more readily. However, studies show that in practice, the added complexity of reconciling multiple views can undermine this advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easterbrook|first1=S.|last2=Yu|first2=E.|last3=Aranda|first3=J.|last4=Fan|first4=Yuntian|last5=Horkoff|first5=J.|last6=Leica|first6=M.|last7=Qadir|first7=R. A.|title=Do viewpoints lead to better conceptual models? An exploratory case study|journal=13th IEEE International Conference on Requirements Engineering (RE'05)|date=1 August 2005|pages=199–208|doi=10.1109/RE.2005.23|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/RE.2005.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IEEE 1471]] (now [[ISO/IEC 42010|ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011]], ''Systems and software engineering — Architecture description'') prescribes the contents of architecture descriptions and describes their creation and use under a number of scenarios, including precedented and unprecedented design, evolutionary design, and capture of design of existing systems. In all of these scenarios the overall process is the same: identify [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]], elicit concerns, identify a set of viewpoints to be used, and then apply these viewpoint specifications to develop the set of views relevant to the system of interest. Rather than define a particular set of viewpoints, the standard provides uniform mechanisms and requirements for architects and organizations to define their own viewpoints. In 1996 the ISO Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing ([[RM-ODP]]) was published to provide a useful framework for describing the architecture and design of large-scale distributed systems.

== View model topics ==

=== View ===
A view of a system is a representation of the system from the perspective of a viewpoint. This viewpoint on a system involves a perspective focusing on specific concerns regarding the system, which suppresses details to provide a simplified model having only those elements related to the concerns of the viewpoint. For example, a security viewpoint focuses on security concerns and a security viewpoint model contains those elements that are related to security from a more general model of a system.&lt;ref&gt;Sinan Si Alhir (2003). "[http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=5 Understanding the Model Driven Architecture (MDA)]". In: ''Methods &amp; Tools''. Fall 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Graphical projection|view]] allows a user to examine a portion of a particular interest area. For example, an Information View may present all functions, organizations, technology, etc. that use a particular piece of information, while the Organizational View may present all functions, technology, and information of concern to a particular organization. In the [[Zachman Framework]] views comprise a group of work products whose development requires a particular analytical and technical expertise because they focus on either the “what,” “how,” “who,” “where,” “when,” or “why” of the enterprise.  For example, Functional View work products answer the question “how is the mission carried out?”  They are most easily developed by experts in [[functional decomposition]] using process and activity modeling.  They show the enterprise from the point of view of functions.  They also may show organizational and information components, but only as they relate to functions.&lt;ref name="TEAF00"&gt;US Department of the Treasury Chief Information Officer Council (2000). [http://www.eaframeworks.com/TEAF/teaf.doc Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework]. Version 1, July 2000. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318003653/http://www.eaframeworks.com/TEAF/teaf.doc |date=18 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viewpoints ===
In systems engineering, a viewpoint is a partitioning or restriction of concerns in a system. Adoption of a viewpoint is usable so that issues in those aspects can be addressed separately. A good selection of viewpoints also partitions the design of the system into specific areas of expertise.&lt;ref name="NIST2003"/&gt;

Viewpoints provide the conventions, rules, and languages for constructing, presenting and analysing views. In ISO/IEC 42010:2007 ([[IEEE 1471|IEEE-Std-1471-2000]]) a viewpoint is a specification for an individual view. A view is a representation of a whole system from the perspective of a viewpoint. A view may consist of one or more [[Software Architectural Model|architectural models]].&lt;ref&gt;IEEE-1471-2000&lt;/ref&gt; Each such architectural model is developed using the methods established by its associated architectural system, as well as for the system as a whole.
&lt;ref name="ShSk"/&gt;

=== Modeling perspectives ===

[[Modeling perspectives]] is a set of different ways to represent pre-selected aspects of a system. Each [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] has a different focus, conceptualization, dedication and visualization of what the [[Scientific modelling|model]] is representing.

In [[information system]]s, the traditional way to divide modeling perspectives is to distinguish the structural, functional and behavioral/processual perspectives. This together with rule, object, communication and actor and role perspectives is one way of classifying modeling approaches &lt;ref&gt;[[John Krogstie]], (2003). [http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~krogstie/publications/2003/quality-book/b2-languages.pdf Conceptual modeling], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316203713/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~krogstie/publications/2003/quality-book/b2-languages.pdf |date=March 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viewpoint model ===
In any given viewpoint, it is possible to make a model of the system that contains only the objects that are visible from that viewpoint, but also captures all of the objects, relationships and constraints that are present in the system and relevant to that viewpoint. Such a model is said to be a viewpoint model, or a view of the system from that viewpoint.&lt;ref name="NIST2003"/&gt;

A given view is a specification for the system at a particular level of abstraction from a given viewpoint. Different levels of abstraction contain different levels of detail. Higher-level views allow the engineer to fashion and comprehend the whole design and identify and resolve problems in the large. Lower-level views allow the engineer to concentrate on a part of the design and develop the detailed specifications.&lt;ref name="NIST2003"/&gt;

[[File:ArchitectureFrameworkStructure.png|thumb|200px|Illustration of the views, products and data in Architecture Framework.]]

In the system itself, however, all of the specifications appearing in the various viewpoint models must be addressed in the realized components of the system. And the specifications for any given component may be drawn from many different viewpoints. On the other hand, the specifications induced by the distribution of functions over specific components and component interactions will typically reflect a different partitioning of concerns than that reflected in the original viewpoints. Thus additional viewpoints, addressing the concerns of the individual components and the bottom-up synthesis of the system, may also be useful.&lt;ref name="NIST2003"/&gt;

=== Architecture description ===
An [[Software architecture description|architecture description]] is a representation of a system architecture, at any time, in terms of its component parts, how those parts function, the rules and constraints under which those parts function, and how those parts relate to each other and to the environment. In an architecture description the ''architecture data'' is shared across several views and products.

At the data layer are the architecture data elements and their defining attributes and relationships. At the presentation layer are the products and views that support a visual means to communicate and understand the purpose of the architecture, what it describes, and the various architectural analyses performed. Products provide a way for visualizing architecture data as graphical, tabular, or textual representations. Views provide the ability to visualize architecture data that stem across products, logically organizing the data for a specific or holistic perspective of the architecture.

== Types of system view models ==

=== Three-schema approach ===
[[File:4-2 ANSI-SPARC three level architecture.svg|thumb|320px|The notion of a three-schema model was first introduced in 1977 by the [[ANSI-SPARC Architecture|ANSI/X3/SPARC three-level architecture]], which determined three levels to model data.&lt;ref name="MW99"&gt;Matthew West and Julian Fowler (1999). [http://www.matthew-west.org.uk/documents/princ03.pdf Developing High Quality Data Models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221084613/http://www.matthew-west.org.uk/documents/princ03.pdf |date=December 21, 2008 }}. The European Process Industries STEP Technical Liaison Executive (EPISTLE).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Three-schema approach]] for data modeling, introduced in 1977, can be considered one of the first view models. It is an approach to building information systems and systems information management, that promotes the [[conceptual model]] as the key to achieving [[data integration]].&lt;ref name="STRAP08"&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/strap/strpsec2.htm STRAP SECTION 2 APPROACH]. Retrieved 30 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Three schema approach defines three schemas and views:
* External schema for user views
* [[Conceptual schema]] integrates external schemata
* Internal schema that defines physical storage structures
At the center, the conceptual schema defines the [[ontology]] of the [[concept]]s as the [[user (computing)|user]]s think of them and talk about them. The physical schema describes the internal formats of the [[data]] stored in the [[database]], and the external schema defines the view of the data presented to the [[application program]]s.&lt;ref name ="JFS04"&gt;[[John F. Sowa]] (2004). [ "The Challenge of Knowledge Soup"]. published in: ''Research Trends in Science, Technology and Mathematics Education''. Edited by J. Ramadas &amp; S. Chunawala, Homi Bhabha Centre, Mumbai, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The framework attempted to permit multiple data models to be used for external schemata.&lt;ref&gt;Gad Ariav &amp; James Clifford (1986). ''New Directions for Database Systems: Revised Versions of the Papers''. New York University Graduate School of Business Administration. Center for Research on Information Systems, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the skill and interest in building information systems has grown tremendously. However, for the most part, the traditional approach to building systems has only focused on defining [[data]] from two distinct views, the "user view" and the "computer view". From the user view, which will be referred to as the “external schema,” the definition of data is in the context of reports and screens designed to aid individuals in doing their specific jobs. The required structure of data from a usage view changes with the business environment and the individual preferences of the user. From the computer view, which will be referred to as the “internal schema,” data is defined in terms of file structures for storage and retrieval. The required structure of data for [[computer storage]] depends upon the specific computer technology employed and the need for efficient processing of data.&lt;ref name="ITL93"&gt;itl.nist.gov (1993) [http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef1x.doc ''Integration Definition for Information Modeling (IDEFIX)''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203223034/http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef1x.doc |date=2013-12-03 }}. 21 Dec 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 4+1 view model of architecture ===
[[File:4+1 Architectural View Model.svg|thumb|354px|Illustration of the [[4+1]] view model or architecture.]]
[[4+1]] is a view model designed by [[Philippe Kruchten]] in 1995 for describing the architecture of software-intensive systems, based on the use of multiple, concurrent views.&lt;ref name="Kru95"&gt;Kruchten, Philippe (1995, November). [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/teaching/papers/4+1view-architecture.pdf Architectural Blueprints — The “4+1” View Model of Software Architecture.] IEEE Software 12 (6), pp. 42-50.
&lt;/ref&gt; The views are used to describe the system in the viewpoint of different stakeholders, such as end-users, developers and project managers. The four views of the model are logical, development, process and physical view:

The four views of the model are concerned with :
* ''Logical view'': is concerned with the functionality that the system provides to end-users.
* ''Development view'': illustrates a system from a programmers perspective and is concerned with software management.
* ''Process view'': deals with the dynamic aspect of the system, explains the system processes and how they communicate, and focuses on the runtime behavior of the system.
* ''Physical view'': depicts the system from a system engineer's point of view.  It is concerned with the topology of software components on the physical layer, as well as communication between these components.

In addition selected [[use case]]s or scenarios are utilized to illustrate the architecture. Hence the model contains 4+1 views.&lt;ref name="Kru95"/&gt;

== Types of enterprise architecture views ==
[[Enterprise architecture framework]] defines how to organize the structure and views associated with an [[enterprise architecture]]. Because the discipline of Enterprise Architecture and Engineering is so broad, and because enterprises can be large and complex, the models associated with the discipline also tend to be large and complex. To manage this scale and complexity, an Architecture Framework provides tools and methods that can bring the task into focus and allow valuable artifacts to be produced when they are most needed.

Architecture Frameworks are commonly used in [[Information technology]] and [[Information system]] governance. An organization may wish to mandate that certain models be produced before a [[system design]] can be approved. Similarly, they may wish to specify certain views be used in the documentation of procured systems - the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] stipulates that specific DoDAF views be provided by equipment suppliers for capital project above a certain value.

=== Zachman Framework ===
[[File:Simplification Zachman Enterprise Framework.jpg|thumb|480px|Simplified illustration of the [[Zachman Framework]] with an explanation of the rows.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Veterans Affairs (2008) [http://www.va.gov/oirm/architecture/EA/theory/tutorial.ppt A Tutorial on the Zachman Architecture Framework] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713072901/http://www.va.gov/oirm/architecture/EA/theory/tutorial.ppt |date=July 13, 2007 }}. Accessed 06 Dec 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The original framework is more advanced, see for an example [http://zachmaninternational.com/index.php/ea-articles/26-articles/13-the-zachman-framework-a-concise-definition ''here''].]]
The [[Zachman Framework]], originally conceived by [[John Zachman]] at IBM in 1987, is a framework for enterprise architecture, which provides a formal and highly structured way of viewing and defining an enterprise.

The Framework is used for organizing architectural "artifacts" in a way that takes into account both who the artifact targets (for example, business owner and builder) and what particular issue (for example, data and functionality) is being addressed. These artifacts may include design documents, specifications, and models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb466232.aspx ''A Comparison of the Top Four Enterprise Architecture Methodologies''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409195426/http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb466232.aspx |date=2008-04-09 }}, Roger Sessions, Microsoft Developer Network Architecture Center,&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zachman Framework is often referenced as a standard approach for expressing the basic elements of [[enterprise architecture]]. The Zachman Framework has been recognized by the U.S. Federal Government as having "...&amp;nbsp;received worldwide acceptance as an integrated framework for managing change in enterprises and the systems that support them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.gov/Documents/fedarch1.pdf Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916153405/http://www.cio.gov/Documents/fedarch1.pdf |date=September 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RM-ODP views ===
[[File:RM-ODP viewpoints.jpg|thumb|320px|The [[RM-ODP]] view model, which provides five generic and complementary viewpoints on the system and its environment.]]
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing ([[RM-ODP]]) &lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 10746-1:1998 Information technology – Open Distributed Processing: Reference Model – Part 1: Overview, International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, Switzerland, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; specifies a set of viewpoints for partitioning the design of a distributed software/hardware system. Since most integration problems arise in the design of such systems or in very analogous situations, these viewpoints may prove useful in separating integration concerns. The RMODP viewpoints are:&lt;ref name="NIST2003"/&gt;
* the ''enterprise viewpoint'', which is concerned with the purpose and behaviors of the system as it relates to the business objective and the business processes of the organization
* the ''information viewpoint'', which is concerned with the nature of the information handled by the system and constraints on the use and interpretation of that information
* the ''computational viewpoint'', which is concerned with the functional decomposition of the system into a set of components that exhibit specific behaviors and interact at interfaces
* the ''engineering viewpoint'', which is concerned with the mechanisms and functions required to support the interactions of the computational components
* the ''technology viewpoint'', which is concerned with the explicit choice of technologies for the implementation of the system, and particularly for the communications among the components

RMODP further defines a requirement for a design to contain specifications of consistency between viewpoints, including:&lt;ref name="NIST2003"/&gt;
* the use of enterprise objects and processes in defining information units
* the use of enterprise objects and behaviors in specifying the behaviors of computational components, and use of the information units in defining computational interfaces
* the association of engineering choices with computational interfaces and behavior requirements
* the satisfaction of information, computational and engineering requirements in the chosen technologies

=== DoDAF views ===
The [[Department of Defense Architecture Framework]] (DoDAF) defines a standard way to organize an [[enterprise architecture]] (EA) or [[systems architecture]] into complementary and consistent views. It is especially suited to large systems with complex integration and interoperability challenges, and is apparently unique in its use of "[[operational view]]s" detailing the external customer's operating domain in which the developing system will operate.
[[File:DoDAF Linkages Among Views.jpg|thumb|360px|[[DoDAF]] linkages among views.&lt;ref name="DoD07"&gt;DoD (2007) [http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/jitc_dri/pdfs/dodaf_v1v1.pdf DoD Architecture Framework Version 1.5] . 23 April 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311061225/http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/jitc_dri/pdfs/dodaf_v1v1.pdf |date=March 11, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The DoDAF defines a set of products that act as mechanisms for visualizing, understanding,
and assimilating the broad scope and complexities of an architecture description through graphic,
tabular, or textual means. These products are organized under four views: 
* Overarching All View (AV),
* [[Operational View]] (OV),
* Systems View (SV), and the
* Technical Standards View (TV).
Each view depicts certain perspectives of an architecture as described below. Only a subset of the full DoDAF viewset is usually created for each system development. The figure represents the information that links the [[operational view]], systems and services view, and technical standards view. The three views and their interrelationships driven – by common architecture data elements – provide the basis for deriving measures such as interoperability or performance, and for measuring the impact of the values of these metrics on operational mission and task effectiveness.&lt;ref name="DoD07"/&gt;

=== Federal Enterprise Architecture views ===
In the US [[Federal Enterprise Architecture]] enterprise, segment, and solution architecture provide different business perspectives by varying the level of detail and addressing related but distinct concerns. Just as enterprises are themselves hierarchically organized, so are the different views provided by each type of architecture. The Federal Enterprise Architecture Practice Guidance (2006) has defined three types of architecture:&lt;ref name="FEAPMO06"/&gt;

[[File:Architectural Levels and Attributes.jpg|thumb|420px|[[Federal Enterprise Architecture]] levels and attributes&lt;ref name="FEAPMO06"&gt;Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office (2006). [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/omb/egov/documents/FEA_Practice_Guidance.pdf FEA Practice Guidance] {{Dead link|date=May 2012|bot=BlevintronBot}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* Enterprise architecture,
* Segment architecture, and
* Solution architecture.

By definition, Enterprise Architecture (EA) is fundamentally concerned with identifying common or shared assets – whether they are strategies, business processes, investments, data, systems, or technologies. EA is driven by strategy; it helps an agency identify whether its resources are properly aligned to the agency mission and strategic goals and objectives. From an investment perspective, EA is used to drive decisions about the IT investment portfolio as a whole. Consequently, the primary stakeholders of the EA are the senior managers and executives tasked with ensuring the agency fulfills its mission as effectively and efficiently as possible.&lt;ref name="FEAPMO06"/&gt;

By contrast, segment architecture defines a simple roadmap for a core mission area, business service, or enterprise service. Segment architecture is driven by business management and delivers products that improve the delivery of services to citizens and agency staff. From an investment perspective, segment architecture drives decisions for a business case or group of business cases supporting a core mission area or common or shared service. The primary stakeholders for segment architecture are business owners and managers. Segment architecture is related to EA through three principles: structure, reuse, and alignment. First, segment architecture inherits the framework used by the EA, although it may be extended and specialized to meet the specific needs of a core mission area or common or shared service. Second, segment architecture reuses important assets defined at the enterprise level including: data; common business processes and investments; and applications and technologies. Third, segment architecture aligns with elements defined at the enterprise level, such as business strategies, mandates, standards, and performance measures.&lt;ref name="FEAPMO06"/&gt;

=== Nominal set of views ===
In search of "Framework for Modeling Space Systems Architectures" Peter Shames and Joseph Skipper (2006) defined a "nominal set of views",&lt;ref name="ShSk"&gt;Peter Shames, Joseph Skipper. [http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39851/1/06-0876.pdf "Toward a Framework for Modeling Space Systems Architectures"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227132305/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39851/1/06-0876.pdf |date=2009-02-27 }}. NASA, JPL.&lt;/ref&gt; Derived from CCSDS RASDS, RM-ODP, ISO 10746 and compliant with [[IEEE 1471]].
[[File:Nominal set of views.jpg|thumb|360px|Illustration of the "Nominal set of views".&lt;ref name="ShSk06"&gt;Peter Shames &amp; Joseph Skipper (2006).

This "set of views", as described below, is a listing of possible modeling viewpoints. Not all of these views may be used for any one project and other views may be defined as necessary. Note that for some analyses elements from multiple viewpoints may be combined into a new view, possibly using a layered representation.

In a latter presentation this nominal set of views was presented as an Extended RASDS Semantic Information Model Derivation.&lt;ref name="ShSk06"/&gt; Hereby RASDS stands for Reference Architecture for Space Data Systems. see second image.

;Enterprise Viewpoint&lt;ref name="ShSk"/&gt;
* Organization view – Includes [[organization]]al elements and their structures and relationships. May include agreements, contracts, policies and organizational interactions.
* Requirements view – Describes the [[requirement]]s, goals, and objectives that drive the system. Says what the system must be able to do.
* Scenario view – Describes the way that the system is intended to be used, see [[scenario planning]]. Includes user views and descriptions of how the system is expected to behave.

;Information viewpoint&lt;ref name="ShSk"/&gt;
*Metamodel view – An abstract view that defines [[information model]] elements and their structures and relationships. Defines the classes of data that are created and managed by the system and the data architecture.
*Information view – Describes the actual [[data]] and [[information]] as it is realized and manipulated within the system. Data elements are defined by the metamodel view and they are referred to by functional objects in other views.
[[File:Reference Architecture for Space Data Systems.jpg|thumb|360px|Reference Architecture for Space Data Systems.&lt;ref name="ShSk06"/&gt;]]
;Functional viewpoint&lt;ref name="ShSk"/&gt;
*Functional Dataflow view – An abstract view that describes the [[function model|functional elements]] in the system, their interactions, behavior, provided services, constraints and data flows among them. Defines which functions the system is capable of performing, regardless of how these functions are actually implemented.
*Functional Control view – Describes the [[control flow]]s and interactions among functional elements within the system. Includes overall system control interactions, interactions between control elements and sensor / effector elements and management interactions.

;Physical viewpoint&lt;ref name="ShSk"/&gt;
*Data System view – Describes instruments, computers, and data storage components, their data system attributes and the communications connectors (busses, networks, point to point links) that are used in the system.
*Telecomm view – Describes the telecomm components (antenna, transceiver), their attributes and their connectors (RF or optical links).
*Navigation view – Describes the motion of the major elements within the system (trajectory, path, orbit), including their interaction with external elements and forces that are outside of the control of the system, but that must be modeled with it to understand system behavior (planets, asteroids, solar pressure, gravity)
*Structural view – Describes the structural components in the system (s/c bus, struts, panels, articulation), their physical attributes and connectors, along with the relevant structural aspects of other components (mass, stiffness, attachment)
*Thermal view – Describes the active and passive thermal components in the system (radiators, coolers, vents) and their connectors (physical and free space radiation) and attributes, along with the thermal properties of other components (i.e. antenna as sun shade)
*Power view – Describes the active and passive power components in the system (solar panels, batteries, RTGs) within the system and their connectors, along with the power properties of other components (data system and propulsion elements as power sinks and structural panels as grounding plane)
*Propulsion view – Describes the active and passive propulsion components in the system (thrusters, gyros, motors, wheels) within the system and their connectors, along with the propulsive properties of other components

[[File:MBED Top Level Ontology.jpg|thumb|360px|MBED Top Level Ontology based on the Nominal set of views.&lt;ref name="ShSk"/&gt;]] 
;Engineering viewpoint&lt;ref name="ShSk"/&gt;
*Allocation view – Describes the allocation of functional objects to engineered physical and computational components within the system, permits analysis of performance and used to verify satisfaction of requirements
*Software view - Describes the software engineering aspects of the system, software design and implementation of functionality within software components, select languages and libraries to be used, define APIs, do the engineering of abstract functional objects into tangible software elements.

The '''Z Pulsed Power Facility''', informally known as the '''Z machine''', is the largest high frequency [[electromagnetic wave]] generator in the world and is designed to test materials in conditions of extreme temperature and pressure. Since its refurbishment in October 1996&lt;ref name="sandia.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/zpinch.htm |title=Sandia National Laboratories - News Releases |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609044428/http://www.sandia.gov/media/zpinch.htm |archive-date=2015-06-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been used primarily as an [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) research facility.
Operated by [[Sandia National Laboratories]], it gathers data to aid in [[computer modeling]] of [[nuclear weapon]]s and eventual [[Nuclear power|nuclear fusion pulsed power plants]]. The Z machine is located at Sandia's main site in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].

==Origins==
{{see also|Fusion power#History of research}}
The Z machine origins can be traced from the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] needing to replicate the [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reactions]] of a [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear bomb]] in a lab environment to better understand the physics involved.

Since the 1970s the DoE had been looking into [[List of fusion power technologies|ways]] to [[fusion power|generate electricity from fusion reactions]], with continuous reactions such as [[tokamak]]s or discrete fusion of small balls of light atoms. Since at the time lasers were far from having the required power, the main approach considered was heavy ion fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/faq-s#TOC-What-is-heavy-ion-fusion- |title=FAQs |publisher=Fusionpowercorporation.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621010153/http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/faq-s#TOC-What-is-heavy-ion-fusion- |archive-date=2015-06-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However major advances such as [[Q-switching]] and [[mode-locking]] made [[laser]]s an option (culminating in the [[National Ignition Facility]]) and the Heavy Ion Fusion programs became more or less dormant. In 1985, the review of DoE's program by the National Academies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/1985-icf-review-by-the-national-academies |title=1985 ICF Review by the National Academies |publisher=Fusionpowercorporation.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621010156/http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/1985-icf-review-by-the-national-academies |archive-date=2015-06-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated "The energy crisis is dormant for the time being". Heavy ion fusion machines were tasked to help military research improve [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bombs]].

The first research at Sandia dates back from 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/particle-beam-fusion-program-publications-and-related-reports-january-1971-to-july-1979/oclc/079670227 |title=Particle beam fusion program publications and related reports, January 1971 to July 1979 (Book, 1979) |publisher=WorldCat.org |date=2015-05-02 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621010434/http://www.worldcat.org/title/particle-beam-fusion-program-publications-and-related-reports-january-1971-to-july-1979/oclc/079670227 |archive-date=2015-06-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where Gerold Yonas&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Rd2P4Mvj7vw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnsl.org/Documents/GerryYonas_shortbio.pdf |format=PDF |title=Gerry Yonas : Resume |publisher=Bnsl.org |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620231327/http://www.bnsl.org/Documents/GerryYonas_shortbio.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated and directed the particle-beam fusion program.

In the December 1976 issue of Popular Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 |title=Popular Science |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1976 conference proceedings published in 1977, an article titled "Particle Beam Fusion Research"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/physics/FEC/STIPUB439_VOL1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research 1976 : Vol. 1 |publisher=Naweb.iaea.org |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225931/http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/physics/FEC/STIPUB439_VOL1.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; described early work and first generation machines: Hydra (1972); Proto I (1975); Proto II (1977); EBFA/PBFA (electronic beam fusion accelerator/particle beam fusion accelerator) (1980).

In 1985, the PBFA-II was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/saturn.htm |title=Saturn News Release |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094201/http://www.sandia.gov/media/saturn.htm |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Harrison, J.L. |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/5700471-2njsdC/5700471.pdf |title=PBFA control and monitor system &amp;#124; SciTech Connect |publisher=Osti.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandia continued to target heavy ion fusion at a slow pace despite the National Academies report.

The November 1978 issue of Scientific American carried Yonas' first general-public article, "Fusion power with particle beams".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fusion power with particle beams |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=|bibcode=1978SciAm.239...50Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, defense-related research was also ongoing at Sandia with the Hermes III machine and Saturn (1987), upgraded from PBFA-I, which operated at lower total power than PBFA-II but advanced Sandia's knowledge in high voltage and high current and was therefore a useful predecessor to the Z machine.

In 1996, the US Army published a report&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130619090333/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/md/md1400/md1450/data/md1450data.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; on the decommissioning of the Aurora Pulsed Radiation Simulator. This report is useful in understanding ties between nuclear arms testing and inertial fusion energy research.

Also in 1996, the PBFA-II machine was once again upgraded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/251439-H9Gefu/webviewable/251439.pdf |title=PBFA Z: A 20-MA z-pinch driver for plasma radiation sources &amp;#124; SciTech Connect |publisher=Osti.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; into PBFA-Z&lt;ref name="sandia.gov"/&gt; or simply "Z machine", described for the first time to the general public on August 1998 in Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fs1.bib.tiera.ru/content/DVD-009/_Scientific_american_%28August_1998%29_%281998%29%28en%29%2888s%29.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121004233022/http://www.pescadoo.net/malc/art-6.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics of the Z machine==
The Z machine uses the well known principle of [[Z-pinch]] where the fast discharge of capacitors through a tube of plasma causes it to be compressed towards its centerline by the resulting [[Lorentz force]]s. [[Willard Harrison Bennett|Bennet]] successfully researched the application of Z-pinches to plasma compression. The Z machine layout is cylindrical. On the outside it houses huge [[capacitor]]s discharging through [[Marx generator]]s which generate a one microsecond high-voltage pulse. Yonas then uses a system to divide this time by a factor of 10, using the [[dielectric]] power of water, to enable the creation of 100ns discharges.

However this effort was not successful for Heavy Ion Fusion, due to lack of sufficient focusing of the beams, despite the high power used. It had been known for a long time that the Lorentz forces were radial but the current flow was highly unstable and rotated along the cylinder which causes [[Pinch (plasma physics)#Pinch production and types|twisting]] of the imploding tube therefore decreasing the quality of the compression.

A Russian scientist, [[Valentin Panteleimonovich Smirnov|Valentin Smirnov]], then had the idea of replacing the tube (called "liner") with a wire array, to fight the azimuthal flow of the current, and therefore fight the MHD instability. The Angara V&lt;ref&gt;[http://dorland.pp.ph.ic.ac.uk/magpie/publications/workshop2009/8th_Wednesday/6B1%20Oleinik.pdf ]{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; facility of the [[Kurchatov Institute]] had been built for the same reason: to help simulate and design the second stage of hydrogen bombs and test the effect of high power x-rays on nuclear missiles' warheads. The space inside the wire array was filled with polystyrene, which helps homogenize the X-ray flux.

Any country developing thermonuclear weapons has its own Z machine, but those not using water lines had long rising pulses (for example 800ns in the Sphinx, the French machine at [[Gramat]]). In the UK, the [[MAGPIE|Magpie]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923084547/http://dorland.pp.ph.ic.ac.uk/magpie/experiments/Generator.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; machine was situated at the [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] under control of Malcolm Haines.

By removing the polystyrene core, Sandia was able to obtain a thin 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm plasma cord in which 10 million amperes flowed with 90 megabars of pressure.

==Early operation 1996-2006==
The key attributes of Sandia's Z machine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/zmachine.htm |title=Sandia National Laboratories - News Releases |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609044423/http://www.sandia.gov/media/zmachine.htm |archive-date=2015-06-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are its 18 million amperes and a discharge time of less than 100 [[second|nanoseconds]]. The array of [[tungsten]] wires is called a "liner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/z290.htm |title=Sandia Z accelerator |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428231250/http://www.sandia.gov/media/z290.htm |archive-date=2015-04-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, Sandia tested the idea of nested wire arrays;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR1999/zmach.htm |title=News Release - Z machine |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607033045/http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR1999/zmach.htm |archive-date=2015-06-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the second array, out of phase with the first, compensates for [[Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities]].
In 2001, Sandia introduced the Z-Beamlet laser (from surplus equipment of the [[National Ignition Facility]]) as a tool to better image the compressing pellet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neal Singer |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR2001/Zbeam.htm |title=News Release - Z-Beamlet |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094139/http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR2001/Zbeam.htm |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This confirmed the shaping uniformity of pellets compressed by the Z machine.

Sandia announced the fusing of small amounts of [[deuterium]] in the Z machine on April 7, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030603190249/http://www.sandia.gov/news-center/news-releases/2003/nuclear-power/Zneutrons.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being used as an X-ray generator, the Z machine propelled small plates at 34 kilometers a second, faster than the 30 kilometers per second that Earth travels in its orbit around the [[Sun]], and four times [[escape velocity|Earth's escape velocity]] (3 times it at sea level).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2005/nuclear-power/z-saturn.html |title=Sandia National Labs: News: Title |publisher=Share.sandia.gov |date=2005-06-06 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040225/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2005/nuclear-power/z-saturn.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also successfully created a special, hyperdense "hot ice" known as [[ice VII]], by quickly compressing water to pressures of 70,000 to 120,000 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] (7 to 12 [[gigapascal|GPa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/z-ice.html |title=Ice created in nanoseconds by Sandia's Z machine - March 15, 2007 |publisher=Sandia.gov |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135615/http://sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/z-ice.html |archive-date=2011-10-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical shock from impacting Z-machine accelerated projectiles is able to melt diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/diamonds.html |title=Z machine melts diamond to puddle |publisher=Share.sandia.gov |date=2006-11-02 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031129/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/diamonds.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good overview of the different missions of the Z machine can be found in the 2002 Trivelpiece committee report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/newsreleases/reports/TrivelpieceSANDReport2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pulsed Power Peer Review Committee Report |publisher=Sandia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175927/http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/newsreleases/reports/TrivelpieceSANDReport2002.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which reviewed the pulsed power activities at Sandia.

==Two billion Kelvin==
At the beginning of 2006, the Z machine produced plasmas with announced temperatures in excess of 2&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin]] (2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10{{sup|9}}&amp;nbsp;K) or 3.6&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]] (2&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]), even reaching a peak at 3.7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10{{sup|9}}&amp;nbsp;K or 6.6&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;°F (3.7&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/physics-astron/hottest-z-output.html |title=Sandia's Z machine exceeds two billion degrees Kelvin |publisher=Share.sandia.gov |date=2006-03-08 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105101307/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/physics-astron/hottest-z-output.html |archive-date=2015-11-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haines_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haines_b" /&gt;
It was achieved in part by replacing the tungsten wires with thicker steel wires. This temperature, which enables a 10% to 15% efficiency in converting electrical energy to soft x-rays, was much higher than anticipated (3 to 4 times the [[kinetic energy]] of the incoming wires on axis). The [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book Of Records]] formerly listed it as the highest human-achieved temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbZMg7CGnKYC&amp;pg=PA277 |title=Guinness World Records 2008 - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/PR_display.asp?prID=1074 |title=BNL Newsroom &amp;#124; 'Perfect' Liquid Hot Enough to be Quark Soup |publisher=Bnl.gov |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820105503/http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/PR_display.asp?prID=1074 |archive-date=2012-08-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Large Hadron Collider]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gayle |first=Damien |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2189318/Atom-smashing-scientists-reach-highest-recorded-man-temperature--100-000-TIMES-hotter-Suns-interior.html |title=Atom-smashing scientists reach highest ever recorded man-made temperature - 100,000 TIMES hotter then the Sun's interior &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620232835/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2189318/Atom-smashing-scientists-reach-highest-recorded-man-temperature--100-000-TIMES-hotter-Suns-interior.html |archive-date=2015-06-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have since produced higher temperatures). The origin of this extra energy still remains unexplained, but it has been theorized that small-scale [[magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]] turbulence and viscous damping would convert magnetic energy into thermal energy of the ions, which then would transfer their energy to the electrons through collisions.&lt;ref name="haines_a"&gt;{{cite journal

A $60 million (raised to $90 million) retrofit program called ZR (Z Refurbished) was announced in 2004 to increase its power by 50%. The Z machine was dismantled in July 2006 for this upgrade, including the installation of newly designed hardware and components and more powerful [[Marx generator]]s. The de-ionized water section of the machine has been reduced to about half the previous size while the oil section has been expanded significantly in order to house larger intermediate storage lines (i-stores) and new laser towers, which used to sit in the water section. The refurbishment was completed in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/zaccelerator.html |title=Successful 'shots' signal re-opening of Sandia’s giant Z accelerator - October 17, 2007 |publisher=Sandia.gov |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402210006/http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/zaccelerator.html |archive-date=2010-04-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The newer Z machine can now shoot around 26 million amperes&lt;ref name="sandia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandia.gov/z-machine/about_z/index.html|title=About Z|publisher=Sandia National Laboratories|accessdate=30 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030142206/http://www.sandia.gov/z-machine/about_z/index.html|archive-date=2016-10-30|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (instead of 18 million amperes previously) in 95 nanoseconds.
The radiated power has been raised to 350 terawatts and the X-ray energy output to 2.7 [[megajoule]]s. However the maximum temperature the new version may reach with the same record holder [[stainless steel]] wire-array liner used in 2005 is not yet known.

The ultra-high temperatures reached in 2006 (2.66 to 3.7 billion kelvins) are much higher than those required for the classical [[hydrogen]], deuterium and [[tritium]] fusion previously considered. They could allow, in theory if not in practice, the fusion of light hydrogen atoms with heavier atoms such as [[lithium]] or [[boron]]. These two possible fusion reactions do not produce [[neutron]]s, and thus no [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] or [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]], so they open the possibility of human-made clean [[aneutronic fusion]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Sandia's roadmap includes another Z machine version called ZN (Z Neutron) to test higher yields in fusion power and automation systems. ZN is planned to give between 20 and 30 MJ of hydrogen fusion power with a shot per hour using a Russian [[Linear Transformer Driver]] (LTD) replacing the current Marx generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/070427.html |title=Sandia National Labs: News: Publications: Sandia Lab News: April 27, 2007 |publisher=Sandia.gov |date=2007-04-27 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924093956/http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/070427.html |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 8 to 10 years of operation, ZN would become a transmutation pilot plant capable of a fusion shot every 100 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/2006/067148.pdf |format=PDF |title=Z-Inertial Dusion Energy : Power Plant Final Report FY 2006 |publisher=Prod.sandia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-20 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step planned would be the Z-IFE (Z-inertial fusion energy) test facility, the first true z-pinch driven prototype fusion power plant. It is suggested it would integrate Sandia's latest designs using LTDs. Sandia Labs recently proposed a conceptual 1 petawatt (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; watts) LTD Z-pinch power plant, where the electric discharge would reach 70 million amperes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/prog_cap/pub_papers/accelerator_architecture_PRSTAB_2007.pdf |format=PDF |title=Architecture of petawatt-class z-pinch accelerators |publisher=Sandia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192309/http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/prog_cap/pub_papers/accelerator_architecture_PRSTAB_2007.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, fusion shot simulations at 60 to 70 million amperes are showing a 100 to 1000 fold return on input energy.

Major problems include producing energy in a single Z-pinch shot, and quickly reloading the reactor after each shot. By their early estimates, an implosion of a fuel capsule every 10 seconds could economically produce 300&amp;nbsp;MW of fusion energy.
