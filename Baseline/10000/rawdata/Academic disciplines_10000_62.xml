The '''American Academy for Liberal Education''' ('''AALE''') is a [[United States]]-based [[educational accreditation]] organization with a focus on fostering [[liberal arts]] education, both in higher education and in earlier schooling.

AALE does not currently have [[U.S. Department of Education]] recognition as a higher education accreditor.&lt;ref name="current status"&gt;{{cite web |title = Accreditation &gt; Agency List|url = http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/Agencies.aspx|accessdate = 2016-02-19|archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fope.ed.gov%2Faccreditation%2FAgencies.aspx&amp;date=2016-02-19|archive-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
AALE was formed in 1992 with the stated purpose of "supporting and recognizing excellence in undergraduate liberal arts teaching and learning through accreditation."&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Department of Education Staff Report to the Senior Department Official on Recognition Compliance Issues: American Academy for Liberal Education", [http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/finalstaffreports.pdf U.S. Department of Education], 2010. 44 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Founders included [[Jacques Barzun]], retired philosophy professor from [[Columbia University]], [[E.O. Wilson]] of [[Harvard University]], historian [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]] of [[Emory University]], and [[Lynne Cheney]], former [[U.S. Secretary of Education]].&lt;ref name=HonanNYT1995&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/06/us/a-new-group-will-accredit-some-colleges.html |title=A New Group Will Accredit Some Colleges |first=William H. |last=Honan |author-link=William H. Honan |newspaper=New York Times |date=August 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/02/16/american_university_iraq/ |work=Salon.com |date=February 16, 2011 |title=The empire strikes again; Sex, oil, chaos and corruption at the American University of Iraq |first1= Russ |last1=Baker |first2=Kristina |last2=Borjesson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its initial focus was on undergraduate education, which Barzun said had become "confused, misdirected or not directed at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/03/education/traditionalist-scholars-plan-to-rate-liberal-arts-colleges.html |title=Traditionalist Scholars Plan To Rate Liberal Arts Colleges |last=DePalma |first=Anthony |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 3, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1995, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] granted AALE official recognition as an institutional accreditor for colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=HonanNYT1995/&gt; This recognition allowed AALE-accredited institutions in the United States to participate in student financial aid programs authorized under the [[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Act]] and other U.S. federal programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg8.html Accreditation in the United States: Specialized Accrediting Agencies], U.S. Department of Education website, accessed December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2006, the U.S. Department of Education suspended AALE's authority to accredit new institutions and programs.&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fears of Possible Federal Learning Standards Grow as Liberal-Arts Accreditor Is Penalized |url= http://chronicle.com/daily/2006/12/2006120601n.htm |work=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date= December 7, 2006}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i40/40a02202.htm |title=Accreditor Loses Certification Power |author=Paul Basken |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction was lifted in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nas.org/polPressReleases.cfm?Doc_Id=5 NAS Expresses Pleasure and Relief at Advisory Panel's Recommendation on the AALE], National Association of Scholars press release, December 19, 2007 (accessed on NAS website, December 23, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In the ruling that lifted the restrictions for a period of three years (expiring in December, 2010), Education Secretary [[Margaret Spellings]] wrote of "continued concerns stemming from AALE's being cited consistently since 2001 for either not having clear standards with respect to measuring student outcomes or not collecting and reviewing data on how institutions it accredits measures student outcomes."&lt;ref name=Purgatory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/07/23/aale |title=A Break From Purgatory, Barely |work=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2010, AALE voluntarily withdrew its request for renewal of U.S. Department of Education recognition as a higher education accreditor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Meeting of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/naciqi-dir/fall-2010-report.pdf|work=Department of Education|publisher=ed.gov|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For institutions accredited by AALE in 2010 or earlier, accreditation remained valid through July 1, 2012 for purposes of federal government financial aid to students under Title IV of the [[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aale.org/highered/domesticpubs.html |title=Domestic Standards, Applications, and Publications |publisher=American Academy for Liberal Education |accessdate=4 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406034332/http://www.aale.org/highered/domesticpubs.html |archive-date=2013-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==
AALE provides two types of accreditation for [[higher education]] institutions that offer general education programs in the [[liberal arts]]. It provides institutional accreditation for [[university|universities]] and [[college]]s that want AALE to be their sole accreditor and it provides program accreditation for liberal arts programs within higher education institutions that are institutionally accredited by another accreditor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aale.org/highered/us.html Accreditation process] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810044155/http://www.aale.org/highered/us.html |date=2009-08-10 }}, AALE website (accessed December 7, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; AALE accreditation activities are not limited to the United States; the organization works with institutions and programs worldwide that emphasize liberal education and the liberal arts.

The organization also is an accreditor of [[K–12]] [[charter schools]] and [[independent school]]s throughout the United States.

As of August 2009, AALE had accredited about 20 institutions within the United States,and another dozen members outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aale.org/highered/list.html Members and Applicants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307173211/http://www.aale.org/highered/list.html |date=2014-03-07 }}, AALE website, accessed August 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Several AALE-accredited institutions follow a "[[great books]]" approach.&lt;ref name="standards" /&gt;

==Leadership==
Since January 2011, AALE has been led by acting president Charles E. Butterworth, an emeritus professor of politics and government at the [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aale.org/newsletter.html |title=Current Events: AALE Announces New Acting President |publisher=American Academy for Liberal Education |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406035329/http://www.aale.org/newsletter.html |archive-date=2013-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apotropaic magic''' (from Greek {{transl|grc|apotrepein}} "to ward off" from {{transl|grc|apo-}} "away" and {{transl|grc|trepein}} "to turn") is a type of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] intended to turn away harm or evil influences, as in deflecting misfortune or averting the [[evil eye]]. Apotropaic observances may also be practiced out of vague [[superstition]] or out of tradition, as in [[good luck charm]]s (perhaps some token on a [[charm bracelet]]), [[amulets]], or gestures such as [[crossed fingers]] or [[knocking on wood]]. The Greeks made offerings to the "averting gods" ({{lang-grc|ἀποτρόπαιοι θεοί|translit=apotropaioi theoi|label=none}}), [[chthonic]] deities and [[Greek hero|hero]]es who grant safety and deflect evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mgilleland.com/averters.htm |editor=Gilleland, Michael |translator=Jones, W.H.S. |title=Averters of Evil |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=3 July 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615171021/http://www.mgilleland.com/averters.htm |archive-date=2013-06-15 |dead-url=unfit |quote=[[Hippocrates]], ''Regimen'' 4.89: So with this knowledge about the heavenly bodies, precautions must be taken, with change of regimen and prayers to the gods; in the case of good signs, to the Sun, to Heavenly Zeus, to Zeus, Protector of Home, to Athena, Protectress of Home, to Hermes and to Apollo; in the case of adverse signs, to the Averters of evil [apotropaioi], to Earth and to the Heroes, that all dangers may be averted. &lt;br&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 2.11.1 (Corinth): Before the altar, a barrow has been raised for Epopeus himself, and near the grave are the gods Averters of evil [''apotropaioi'']. Near them, the Greeks perform such rites as they are wont to do in order to avert misfortunes. ({{lang|grc|πρὸ τοῦ βωμοῦ δὲ αὐτῷ μνῆμα Ἐπωπεῖ κέχωσται, καὶ τοῦ τάφου πλησίον εἰσὶν Ἀποτρόπαιοι θεοί: παρὰ τούτοις δρῶσιν ὅσα Ἕλληνες ἐς ἀποτροπὴν κακῶν νομίζουσιν.}})}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbols ==
=== Egypt ===
[[File:Egyptian - Magic Wand Depicting a Procession of Deities - Walters 71510.jpg|thumb|An [[apotropaic wand]] shows a procession of protective deities. It was used in birth rituals, perhaps to draw a [[magic circle]] around the mother and child.]]
Apotropaic magical rituals were practiced throughout the [[ancient Near East]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Fearsome deities were invoked via ritual in order to protect individuals by warding away evil spirits. In ancient Egypt, these household rituals (performed in the home, not in state-run [[temples]]) were embodied by the deity who personified magic itself, [[Heka (god)|Heka]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ritner (1988). ''The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice. ''Chicago: The Oriental Institute of Chicago, 14-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The two gods most frequently invoked in these rituals were the [[hippopotamus]]-formed [[fertility goddess]], [[Taweret]], and the lion-demon, [[Bes]] (who developed from the early apotropaic dwarf demon-god, [[Aha (deity)|Aha]], literally "fighter").&lt;ref&gt;James F. Romano (1978), ''The Origin of Aha (also called Bes). ''New York: College Art Association, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects were often used in these rituals in order to facilitate communication with the gods. One of the most commonly found magical objects, the ivory apotropaic [[wand]] ([[birth tusk]]), gained widespread popularity in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (ca. 1550 – 1069 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig Atlenmüller (1965). ''Die Apotopaia und Die Götter Mittelägyptens.'' Munich: Ludwig-Maximilians University.&lt;/ref&gt; These wands were used to protect expectant mothers and children from malevolent forces, and were adorned with processions of apotropaic [[solar deities]]. Likewise, protective amulets bearing the likenesses of [[ancient Egyptian deities|gods and goddesses]] like [[Taweret]] were commonly worn. Water came to be used frequently in ritual as well, wherein libation vessels in the shape of Taweret were used to pour healing water over an individual. In much later periods (when Egypt came under the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Ptolemies]]), [[stele]] featuring the god [[Horus]] were used in similar rituals; water would be poured over the stele and—after ritually acquiring healing powers—was collected in a basin for an afflicted person to drink.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

=== Ancient Greece ===
[[File:Gorgon at the Corfu Archaelogical Museum.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Gorgon]], flanked by [[lion]]esses and showing her belt clasp of serpents; the [[pediment]] of the 580 BCE [[Temple of Artemis (Corfu)|temple of Artemis in Corfu]]. [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]].]] [[File:Eye-cup Staatliche Antikensammlungen 589.jpg|thumb|[[Chalcis|Chalcidian]] black-figured [[eye-cup]], circa 530 BCE. [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]]]]
Among the ancient Greeks, the most widely used image intended to avert evil was that of the [[Gorgon]], the head of which now may be called the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'', which features wild eyes, fangs, and protruding tongue. The full figure of the Gorgon holds the apex of the oldest remaining [[Greek temple]] where she is flanked by two lionesses. The Gorgon head was mounted on the [[aegis]] and shield of [[Athena]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, pp 196ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evil eye ===
[[Eye]]s were often painted to ward off the [[evil eye]]. An exaggerated apotropaic eye or a pair of eyes were painted on Greek drinking vessels called [[Kylix|''kylikes'']] ([[eye-cup]]s) from the 6th century BCE.{{clarifyme|date=July 2018}}&lt;!--only 6hC? Or 6hC on?--&gt; The exaggerated eyes may have been intended to prevent [[evil spirits]] from entering the mouth while drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Apotropaism in Greek vase-paintings |author=Walter Leo Hildburgh |year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=apotropaic eye (art) |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30332/apotropaic-eye |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fishing boat]]s in some parts of the [[Mediterranean]] region still have stylised eyes painted on the bows. The defunct [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[budget airline]], [[Fly Air]], adopted the symbol ''[[nazar boncuğu]]'' (''nazar bonjuk'') on the [[vertical stabilizer]] (fin) of its aeroplanes.{{cn|date=May 2018}} The apotropaic [[Yiddish]] expression, "{{transl|yi|kain ein horeh}}" ("no evil eye", {{Hebrew|קיין עין הרע}}, in modern [[Hebrew]] "בלי עין הרע"-"Bli ein ha'ra") is somewhat equivalent to the expression, "[[Knock on wood]]."{{cn|date=May 2018}}

=== Grotesquerie ===
[[File:Kilpeck Sheelagh na Gig.jpg|thumb|A 12th-century ''[[sheela na gig]]'' on the church at [[Kilpeck]], [[Herefordshire]]]]
People believed that the doorways and windows of buildings were particularly vulnerable to the entry or passage of [[evil]]. On [[church (building)|churches]] and [[castle]]s, [[gargoyle]]s or other [[grotesque]] faces and figures such as ''[[sheela na gig]]s'' and [[hunky punk]]s were carved to frighten away [[witch]]es and other malign influences.&lt;ref name="Tschen-Emmons 2015 p. 72"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tschen-Emmons |first=J.B. |title=Artifacts from Medieval Europe |publisher=ABC-CLIO |series=Daily Life through Artifacts |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-61069-622-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K78oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 |access-date=May 11, 2018 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures may also have been carved at fireplaces or chimneys; in some cases, simple geometric or letter carvings were used for these. When a wooden post was used to support a chimney opening, this was often an easier material for amateur carving. To discourage witchcraft, [[rowan]] wood may have been chosen for the post or mantel.&lt;ref name="Ayres, Domestic interiors"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayres |first=James |title=Domestic interiors: the British tradition, 1500–1850 |isbn=0-300-08445-5 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly the grotesque faces carved into [[pumpkin lantern]]s (and their earlier counterparts, made from [[turnip]]s, [[Rutabaga|swedes]] or [[beet]]s) at [[Halloween]] are meant to avert evil: this season was ''[[Samhain]]'', the [[Celtic people|Celtic]] new year. As a "time between times", it was believed to be a period when [[soul]]s of the dead and other dangerous spirits walked the earth. Many European peoples had such associations with the period following the harvest in the fall. (''See also:'' [[Celtic calendar]])

=== Other ===
[[Mirror]]s and other shiny objects were believed to deflect the evil eye. Traditional English "Plough Jags" (performers of a regional variant of the [[mummers play]]) sometimes decorated their costumes (particularly their hats) with shiny items, to the extent of borrowing [[Sheffield plate|silver plate]] for the purpose. "Witch balls" are shiny [[blown glass]] ornaments, like [[Christmas baubles]], that were hung in windows.
[[File:Dacian apotropaic eyes motif Iron Gate helmet.jpg|thumb|[[Geto]]-[[Dacians|Dacian]] apotropaic eyes on the [[Helmet of Iron Gates]] (4th century BCE)]]
Items and symbols such as crosses, [[crucifix]]es, [[silver bullet]]s, wild [[rose]]s and [[garlic]] were believed to ward off or destroy [[vampire]]s.

In [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]], [[magpie]]s are traditionally thought to bring bad luck. Many people repeated various rhymes or [[salutation]]s to placate them.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="Magpie TV"&gt;The children's TV series ''[[Magpie (TV series)|Magpie]]'' preserved these rhymes as its theme song into the 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt;

A worn-out man's [[shoe buckle|buckle]] shoe from the 18th century was found in the [[wainscoting]] of the Combination Room, [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. This was placed in the wall "as an apotropaic item intended to ward off evil and bad luck." The discovery was interesting, because this kind of magic is a silent tradition in England. After the repairs were done to the wall, the shoe was re-interred along with some current coins, a custom when dealing with finds like this. Replacing the shoe and concealing it respects the original desire of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.archaeology.org/issues/236-1611/artifact/4945-artifact-cambridge-magic-shoe Artifact]". [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1481828 Archaeology Magazine]. November/December 2016. Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], ''[[phalloi]]'' were believed to have apotropaic qualities. Often stone reliefs would be placed above doorways, and three-dimensional versions were erected across the Greek world. Most notable of these were the urban monuments found on the island of [[Delos]]. Grotesque, [[satyr]]-like bearded faces, sometimes with the pointed cap of the workman, were carved over the doors of ovens and kilns, to protect the work from fire and mishap.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, pp 187ff "The Ker as Gorgon".&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar use of phallic representations to ward off the evil eye remains popular in modern [[Bhutan]]. It is associated with the 500-year-old [[Buddhist]] tradition of [[Drukpa Kunley]]. It is paralleled by other [[South Asia]]n uses of the [[lingam]] symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4381893.stm |title=Bhutan's phalluses ward off evil |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-03-25 |accessdate=2010-01-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213181647/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4381893.stm |archivedate=13 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman art]], apotropaic imagery was a common theme. Envy was thought to bring bad luck to the person envied. To avoid envy, [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] sought to incite laughter in their guests by using humorous images. Images such as large phalluses (see ''[[fascinus]]''), deformities like hunchbacks, or [[Pygmies]] and other non-Roman subjects were common. Romans saw [[deformity]] as comical and believed that such images could be used to deflect the evil eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Art in the Lives of Ordinary Romans |author=John R. Clarke |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, apotropaic [[figurehead]]s carved onto the prow of sailing ships are considered to have been a replacement for the sacrifice of a [[thrall]] during the [[Migration Period|Age of Invasions]] by Saxon and Viking sailors, to avoid bad luck on the voyage.  [[Dredging]] of the Thames under [[London Bridge]] led to the discovery of a large number of bent and broken knives, daggers, swords and coins, from the modern period and dating back to Celtic times.  This custom seems to have been to avoid bad luck, particularly when setting off on a voyage.  Similarly, the burial of an old boot or shoe by the [[lintel]] of the back door of a house seems to have had a similar intention.

[[Apotropaic mark]]s such as the initials of the [[Virgin Mary]] were scratched near the openings of buildings in England to ward off witches.&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=Maev |title=Witches' marks: public asked to seek ancient scratchings in buildings |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/31/witches-marks-historic-england-evil-spirits |work=The Guardian |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Good luck tokens and charms ==
[[File:Itsukushima charms.jpg|thumb|Amulets for specific purposes on sale at a [[Shinto]] [[shrine]] in Japan ]]

It is difficult to differentiate between items supposed to avert evil and items intended to attract good fortune, but generally a [[talisman]] brings good luck{{cn|date=May 2018}} whereas an [[amulet]] wards off or protects against and is therefore apotropaic.

[[File:Votive tree cappadocia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A tree covered with [[Nazar (amulet)|nazars]] against the [[evil eye]]]]
In [[Western culture]], a [[horseshoe]] was often nailed up over, or close by, doorways, normally with the ends pointing upwards; it is said to collect good luck, or to stop the luck from falling out (see [[Oakham's horseshoes]]). Model horseshoes (of card or plastic) are given as good-luck tokens, particularly at [[wedding]]s, and small paper horseshoes feature in [[confetti]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
[[Irish Traveler]]s and [[Romani people|Roma]] often sell white [[Calluna|heather]] to "bring good luck". (Sometimes white [[sea-lavender]], a species of ''[[Limonium]]'', is sold instead.){{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In Ireland, [[St Brigid's cross]]es, woven from [[Juncus|rush]], were kept indoors (in houses and animal houses) to keep away illness for the year.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In some [[Native American cultures in the United States|Native American cultures]], a [[dreamcatcher]] made of yarn like a web is placed above a bed or sleeping area to protect sleeping children from nightmares.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Apotropaic names {{anchor|Naming culture}} ==
[[Ashkenazi Jews]]' apotropaic names were often given not at birth but during serious illness. An example is Nekras (''Некрас'', "not handsome" in Russian), with the hope the child would be handsome,&lt;ref name="Beider2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Alexander Beider |title=Handbook of Ashkenazic Given Names and Their Variants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EEYrAQAAIAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Avotaynu |isbn=978-1-886223-43-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yiddish]] names [[Alter (name)|Alter]] and Alte ("old").&lt;ref name="Beider2015"&gt;{{cite book |author=Alexander Beider |title=Origins of Yiddish Dialects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmK8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183 |date=29 October 2015 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-105981-0 |pages=183–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Serbian names]] are many apotropaic names (''zaštitna imena'', "protective names"), such as [[Vuk (name)|Vuk]] (and its many derivatives) and [[Staniša]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grković |first=Milica |title=Rečnik ličnih imena kod Srba |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1D9CAQAAIAAJ |year=1977 |publisher=Vuk Karadžić |location=Belgrade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some traditional [[Chinese name#Taiwan|Taiwanese names]] referenced domestic animals such as "buffalo" (水牛) and "dog" (狗, 犬), or humble elements of the landscape like "soil" and "water" (土, 水). They conveyed contentment with a peaceful and low-profile life.

'''Astrometry''' is the branch of [[astronomy]] that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of [[star]]s and other [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. The information obtained by astrometric measurements provides information on the [[kinematics]] and physical origin of the [[Solar System]] and our [[galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]].

==History==
[[File:Thousandau1 space probe.jpg|thumb|Concept art for the [[TAU (spacecraft)|TAU spacecraft]], a 1980s era study which would have used an interstellar precursor probe to expand the baseline for calculating stellar parallax in support of Astrometry]]
The history of astrometry is linked to the history of [[star catalogue]]s, which gave astronomers reference points for objects in the sky so they could track their movements. This can be dated back to [[Hipparchus]], who around 190 BC used the catalogue of his predecessors [[Timocharis]] and [[Aristillus]] to discover Earth's [[precession]]. In doing so, he also developed the brightness scale still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Walter, Hans G. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Hipparchus compiled a catalogue with at least 850 stars and their positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Star maps: history, artistry, and cartography |first=Nick |last=Kanas |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=109 |isbn=0-387-71668-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hipparchus's successor, [[Ptolemy]], included a catalogue of 1,022 stars in his work the ''[[Almagest]]'', giving their location, coordinates, and brightness.&lt;ref&gt;p. 110, Kanas 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]] carried out observations on the stars and described their positions, [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]s and [[star color]], and gave drawings for each constellation, in his ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''. [[Ibn Yunus]] observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large [[astrolabe]] with a diameter of nearly 1.4 metres. His observations on [[eclipse]]s were still used centuries later in [[Simon Newcomb]]'s investigations on the motion of the Moon, while his other observations inspired [[Laplace]]'s ''Obliquity of the Ecliptic'' and ''Inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn''.{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1895AJ.....15..113L Great Inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] astronomer [[Ulugh Beg]] compiled the ''[[Zij-i-Sultani]]'', in which he catalogued 1,019 stars. Like the earlier catalogs of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, Ulugh Beg's catalogue is estimated to have been precise to within approximately 20 [[minutes of arc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Astrometry |title=History of astronomy: an encyclopedia |first=John |last=Lankford |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |date=1997 |page=49 |isbn=0-8153-0322-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Tycho Brahe]] used improved instruments, including large [[mural instrument]]s, to measure star positions more accurately than previously, with a precision of 15–35 [[Minute of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|arcsec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Astrometry |first1=Jean |last1=Kovalevsky |first2=P. Kenneth |last2=Seidelmann |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2004 |pages=2–3 |isbn=0-521-64216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] measured the [[right ascension]] of the stars at the [[Constantinople Observatory of Taqi ad-Din]] using the "observational clock" he invented.&lt;ref name=Tekeli&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first = Sevim | last = Tekeli | title = Taqi al-Din | date = 1997 | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | publisher = [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] | isbn = 0-7923-4066-3 | url = https://www.springer.com/philosophy/philosophy+of+sciences/book/978-1-4020-4425-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[telescope]]s became commonplace, [[setting circles]] sped measurements

[[James Bradley]] first tried to measure [[stellar parallax]]es in 1729. The stellar movement proved too insignificant for his [[telescope]], but he instead discovered the [[aberration of light]] and the [[astronomical nutation|nutation]] of the Earth's axis. His cataloguing of 3222 stars was refined in 1807 by [[Friedrich Bessel]], the father of modern astrometry. He made the first measurement of stellar parallax: 0.3 [[Minute of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|arcsec]] for the [[binary star]] [[61 Cygni]].

Being very difficult to measure, only about 60 stellar parallaxes had been obtained by the end of the 19th century, mostly by use of the [[filar micrometer]]. [[Astrograph]]s using astronomical [[photographic plate]]s sped the process in the early 20th century.  Automated plate-measuring machines&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1107461 CERN paper on plate measuring machine] USNO StarScan&lt;/ref&gt; and more sophisticated computer technology of the 1960s allowed more efficient compilation of [[star catalogue]]s. In the 1980s, [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) replaced photographic plates and reduced optical uncertainties to one milliarcsecond. This technology made astrometry less expensive, opening the field to an amateur audience.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1989, the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Hipparcos]] satellite took astrometry into orbit, where it could be less affected by mechanical forces of the Earth and optical distortions from its atmosphere. Operated from 1989 to 1993, Hipparcos measured large and small angles on the sky with much greater precision than any previous optical telescopes. During its 4-year run, the positions, parallaxes, and [[proper motions]] of 118,218 stars were determined with an unprecedented degree of accuracy. A new "[[Hipparcos Catalogue|Tycho catalog]]" drew together a database of 1,058,332 to within 20-30 [[Minute of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|mas]] (milliarcseconds). Additional catalogues were compiled for the 23,882 double/multiple stars and 11,597 [[variable star]]s also analyzed during the Hipparcos mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Today, the catalogue most often used is [[Star catalogue#USNO-B1.0|USNO-B1.0]], an all-sky catalogue that tracks proper motions, positions, magnitudes and other characteristics for over one billion stellar objects. During the past 50 years, 7,435 [[Schmidt camera]] plates were used to complete several sky surveys that make the data in USNO-B1.0 accurate to within 0.2 arcsec.&lt;ref&gt;Kovalevsky, Jean (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[Image:orbit3.gif|thumb|right|200px|Diagram showing how a smaller object (such as an [[extrasolar planet]]) orbiting a larger object (such as a [[star]]) could produce changes in position and velocity of the latter as they orbit their common [[center of mass]] (red cross).]]
[[Image:Solar system barycenter.svg|thumb|right|200px|Motion of [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]] of solar system relative to the Sun.]]
Apart from the fundamental function of providing [[astronomer]]s with a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] to report their observations in, astrometry is also fundamental for fields like [[celestial mechanics]], [[stellar dynamics]] and [[galactic astronomy]]. In [[observational astronomy]], astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by their unique motions. It is instrumental for keeping time, in that [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is basically the [[International Atomic Time|atomic time]] synchronized to [[Earth]]'s rotation by means of exact observations. Astrometry is an important step in the [[cosmic distance ladder]] because it establishes [[parallax]] distance estimates for stars in the [[Milky Way]].

Astrometry has also been used to support claims of [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Astrometry|extrasolar planet detection]] by measuring the displacement the proposed planets cause in their parent star's apparent position on the sky, due to their mutual orbit around the center of mass of the system. Astrometry is more accurate in space missions that are not affected by the distorting effects of the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Nature  462, 705 (2009) 8 December 2009 {{doi|10.1038/462705a}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's planned [[Space Interferometry Mission]] ([[SIM PlanetQuest]]) (now cancelled) was to utilize astrometric techniques to detect [[terrestrial planet]]s orbiting 200 or so of the nearest [[Solar analog|solar-type stars]]. The European Space Agency's [[Gaia Mission]], launched in 2013, applies astrometric techniques in its stellar census. In addition to the detection of exoplanets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaSC/120377_index_0_m.html ESA - Space Science - Gaia overview]&lt;/ref&gt; it can also be used to determine their mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Gaia/Infant_exoplanet_weighed_by_Hipparcos_and_Gaia |title=Infant exoplanet weighed by Hipparcos and Gaia|date=20 August 2018|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrometric measurements are used by [[astrophysicist]]s to constrain certain models in [[celestial mechanics]]. By measuring the velocities of [[pulsar]]s, it is possible to put a limit on the [[asymmetry]] of [[supernova]] explosions. Also, astrometric results are used to determine the distribution of [[dark matter]] in the galaxy.

Astronomers use astrometric techniques for the tracking of [[near-Earth objects]]. Astrometry is responsible for the detection of many record-breaking Solar System objects. To find such objects astrometrically, astronomers use telescopes to survey the sky and large-area cameras to take pictures at various determined intervals. By studying these images, they can detect Solar System objects by their movements relative to the background stars, which remain fixed. Once a movement per unit time is observed, astronomers compensate for the parallax caused by Earth's motion during this time and the heliocentric distance to this object is calculated. Using this distance and other photographs, more information about the object, including its [[orbital elements]], can be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Statistics ==

A fundamental aspect of astrometry is error correction. Various factors introduce errors into the measurement of stellar positions, including atmospheric conditions, imperfections in the instruments and errors by the observer or the measuring instruments. Many of these errors can be reduced by various techniques, such as through instrument improvements and compensations to the data. The results are then [[Error analysis (mathematics)|analyzed]] using [[statistics|statistical methods]] to compute data estimates and error ranges.

'''Bard College Berlin''' (formerly known as '''ECLA''' or '''European College of Liberal Arts''') is a private, non-profit institution of higher education in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It was founded as a non-profit association in 1999. The college is, according to [[Martha Nussbaum]], one of the educational institutions in Europe that makes the [[liberal arts]] idea into reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = | last = | title = Teaching Humanity| publisher = [[Newsweek]] | date = Aug 21, 2006| url= http://www.newsweek.com/id/46439}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students and faculty come from all over the world and the language of instruction is English. Qualifying students earn both an American B.A. and a German B.A.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berlin.bard.edu/academics/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bard College Berlin was founded as ECLA (a non-profit association) in 1999 under the leadership of Stephan Gutzeit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zeit.de/1999/40/Das_College_im_Kopf/seite-1&lt;/ref&gt; The founding dean was Erika Anita Kiss. The first program to be introduced was the six-week International Summer University. Later two one-year programs were developed and still continue to be offered: the Academy Year and the Project Year. A four-year [[Bachelor of Arts]] program in Humanities, the Arts, and Social Thought was launched in October 2009. In November 2011, ECLA merged with [[Bard College]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York|Annandale-on-Hudson]], New York, USA, and subsequently became Bard College Berlin, A Liberal Arts University.&lt;ref&gt;http://idw-online.de/de/news562305&lt;/ref&gt; A four-year BA program in Economics, Politics, and Social Thought was introduced in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berlin.bard.edu/academics/economics-politics-and-social-thought/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
===Academic programs===
[[File:Seminar Bard College Berlin, 2013.jpg|380px|thumb|Seminar Bard College Berlin, 2013]]

At Bard College Berlin students may enroll in a BA degree, or in a one-semester or one-year program suitable to their profile, background, and individual aims of study. The college supports internship opportunities and practical training, and has many established connections with the intellectual and cultural life of Berlin. The academic programs currently offered are Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, the Arts, and Social Thought; Bachelor of Arts in Economics, Politics, and Social Thought; Academy Year; Project Year; Arts and Society in Berlin; LAB Berlin; and Begin in Berlin. Every summer the following programs are offered: Summer Theater Intensive, Summer Language Intensive, and Berlin Summer Studio.

In 2016, the Program for International Education and Social Change was introduced, which enables students from areas that are experiencing severe economic, social, and political crisis to access the liberal arts education offered by Bard College Berlin. The program continues a long tradition of Bard College.

Bard College Berlin provides an immersion in intellectual history from ancient Greece to the present day, with rigorous concentration on philosophy, economics, politics, literature, art history, film, and theater and studio arts. The total number of ECTS credits earned is 240. Study of the German language is offered and encouraged. 
&lt;!-- 
ECLA's first one-year programme was introduced in 2002, and continues today in a developed version as the Academy Year Programme. During the Academy Year, students take the first two core courses of the BA degree (Greek Civilization and Medieval Literature and Culture) and their choice of elective seminars. Students may also study languages.&lt;ref&gt;Core Courses in 2012–13: http://www.ecla.de/academics/one-year-programmes/&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Project Year (PY)

Another one-year programme, introduced in 2003, continues today as the Project Year Programme. During this course of study, students pursue an individual project under the supervision of an ECLA of Bard faculty member with relevant expertise. In addition to their individual project, PY students take two core courses. The work culminates with a 25-page essay and an oral presentation of the project to the rest of the school. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecla.de/one-year-programmes/&lt;/ref&gt;
 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 
===Special programmes===
Besides the main academic programmes, ECLA of Bard organises and hosts a week-long conference each year. The programme functions as a forum for inquiry into current affairs, and it has received a [[UNESCO]] award as an event for education in sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://swwe.ecla.de/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Previous State of the World Week topics included [[Censorship]] (2012), The Translator (2010), Politics of Cultural Ownership (2009), Water Management (2008),&lt;ref&gt;http://swwe.ecla.de/index.html State of the World Week 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social entrepreneurship]] (2007),&lt;ref&gt;http://swwe.ecla.de/index2.html State of the World Week 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
New Forms of War: Challenges as the Nation State Declines (2006), EU Enlargement: Cultural Issues and Implications (2005), Political Developments in the Middle East and Central Asia (2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4272">In [[machine learning]], '''Bayesian Program Synthesis (BPS)''', Bayesian Programs write (synthesize) new Bayesian programs.  This is in contrast to the field of [[Probabilistic programming language|probabilistic programs]] where humans write new probabilistic (Bayesian) programs.

[[Bayesian probability|Bayesian probabilities]] is a strategy to learn distributions over Bayesian programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603542/ai-software-juggles-probabilities-to-learn-from-less-data/|title=AI Software Juggles Probabilities to Learn from Less Data|last=Knight|first=Will|date=|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-03-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian Program Synthesis can be compared to the work on Bayesian Program Learning by Lake, Salakhutdinov, and Tenenbaum's,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where probabilistic program components were hand-written, pre-trained on data, and then hand assembled in order to recognize handwritten characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lake|first=Brenden M.|last2=Salakhutdinov|first2=Ruslan|last3=Tenenbaum|first3=Joshua B.|date=2015-12-11|title=Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1332|journal=Science|language=en|volume=350|issue=6266|pages=1332–1338|doi=10.1126/science.aab3050|issn=0036-8075|pmid=26659050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The framework ==
Bayesian Program Synthesis (BPS) has been described as a framework related to and utilizing probabilistic programming. In BPS, probabilistic programs are generated that are themselves priors over a space of probabilistic programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2017/0216/Startup-pairs-man-with-machine-to-crack-the-black-box-of-neural-networks|title=Startup pairs man with machine to crack the 'black box' of neural networks|last=Wood|first=Charlie|date=2017-02-16|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-03-04|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This strategy allows more automatic synthesis of new programs via inference and is achieved by the composition of modular component programs. 

The modularity in BPS allows inference to work on and test smaller probabilistic programs before being integrated into a larger model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://robohub.org/talking-machines-probabilistic-programming-with-ben-vigoda/|title=Talking Machines: Probabilistic programming, with Ben Vigoda {{!}} Robohub|website=robohub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian methods and models are frequently used to incorporate prior knowledge. When good prior knowledge can be incorporated into a Bayesian model, effective inference can often be performed with much less data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/ais-factions-get-feisty-really-theyre-team/|title=AI’s Factions Get Feisty. But Really, They’re All on the Same Team|last=Metz|first=Cade|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This framework can be also be contrasted with the family of automated [[program synthesis]] fields, including program synthesis, [[programming by example]], and [[programming by demonstration]]. The goal in such fields is to find the best program that satisfies some constraint. In program synthesis, for instance, verification of logical constraints reduce the state space of possible programs, allowing more efficient search to find an optimal program. Bayesian Program Synthesis differs both in that the constraints are probabilistic and the output is itself a distribution over programs that can be further refined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Central Drug Research Institute''' (CDRI) is a multidisciplinary research laboratory in [[Lucknow]], [[India]], employing scientific personnel from various areas of biomedical sciences.

It is one of the first laboratories to be established in India right after its independence. CDRI is among the thirty nine laboratories that are functioning under the aegis of the council of scientific and Industrial Research [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]] of India. CDRI was formally inaugurated on 17 Feb 1951 by the then [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Jawahar Lal Nehru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdri.res.in/profile.aspx|title=CDRI {{!}} Home|last=cosmic|website=cdri.res.in|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For administrative and scientific purposes the Institute's manpower has been grouped into 17 R &amp; D divisions and few divisions providing technical and scientific support. The following divisions of CDRI are involved in [[Research and Development]].
*''[[Biochemistry]]''
*''[[Ethnobotany]]''
*''Clinical and Experimental Medicine''
*''[[Endocrinology]]''

The '''conservation-restoration of the Shroud of Turin''' refers to the [[conservation-restoration]] and enduring preservation of the [[Shroud of Turin]] to avoid further damage and contamination. Since 1578 the Shroud has been kept in the Royal [[Chapel]] of [[Turin Cathedral]] (from 1694 to 1993 the Shroud rested in the Royal Chapel's Bertola [[altar]]), under the [[laminated glass|laminated]] [[bulletproof glass]] of the airtight case.&lt;ref name="TS"&gt;

==Restorations==
On 4 December 1532, the Shroud sustained a fire, which burned out several holes in the fabric. In the spring of 1534, the [[Poor Clare Nuns]] patched the holes and placed a backing [[Holland cloth]] on the reverse.

On 11 April 1997, the Turin Cathedral sustained another fire, but the Shroud survived entirely unscathed. By that time the Shroud stayed within the three walls of [[plate glass]] each {{convert|11|ft|m}} long and {{convert|6.5|ft|m}} high. The fireman Mario Trematore decided to use a [[sledgehammer]] against the bulletproof glass to rescue the relic. Eventually he caused the 39mm thick material to shatter and another fireman arrived to help Trematore. When asked how he managed to break the glass, Trematore replied: "The bulletproof glass can stop bullets, but it cannot stop the strength of values represented by the symbol inside it. With only a hammer and our hands (still bleeding), we broke the glass".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2002 restoration, conducted by the Commission for the Conservation of the Shroud between 20 June and 22 July, thirty triangular patches, sewn by nuns in 1534, as well as the Holland cloth, were removed. The pre-1516/pre-1192 L-shaped burn holes, called "poker holes" and mentioned in the 12th century ''[[Hungarian Pray Codex]]'', have remained. The 2002 restoration has been criticized for the damage it caused to the Shroud.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Meacham]], "The Rape of the Turin Shroud", 2005, {{ISBN|1-4116-5769-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural hazards==
Because of [[dehydration]], which might have been involved in the [[Shroud of Turin#Possible means of image formation|image formation]], the Shroud was not recommended to be stored in [[vacuum]].&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shroud.com/adler1.htm|title=Conservation Of The Shroud of Turin|publisher =Shroud Spectrum International, No. 42, December 1993|author=Alan D. Adler, Larry A. Schwalbe |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the minor changes of temperature can enhance the pressure, humidity and mechanical stress, the Shroud's case was made climate-controlled.

An [[electron microscope]] investigation of the dust and pollens removed from the Shroud during the 1978 examination has revealed that some species of [[mites]] are resident on the cloth.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt; ''[[Lichenotheliaceae|Lichenothelia]]'' and [[arachnids]] in one of the tape samples have been also observed.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt;
 
As the Shroud was rolled and unrolled for display throughout the centuries, it sustained a repeated [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] of the charred edges to the areas holed in the fire.&lt;ref name="CST"/&gt; The low magnification images of the blood areas already show an extensive abrasion of this type.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt; To reduce the stress of [[gravity]] the Shroud was suggested being in horizontal display. To minimize possible [[cosmic ray]] exposure, it was also suggested that the plane of the cloth be aligned perpendicular to the ground.

Adler, confirming the presence of [[bilirubin]] on the fabric, noted that it is not light-stable and may change the color under any light.&lt;ref name="CST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shroud.com/restored.htm|title=Comments On The Restoration|publisher = Shroud.com |author= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adler, since the image fibers are at or near saturation while the surrounding cloth is not, the latter will gradually get darker  until the image first becomes a silhouette and later finally vanishes.&lt;ref name="CST"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5712">A '''corrosion inhibitor''' is a [[chemical compound]] that, when added to a liquid or gas, decreases the [[corrosion]] rate of a material, typically a [[metal]] or an [[alloy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Gräfen, Elmar-Manfred Horn, Hartmut Schlecker, Helmut Schindler "Corrosion" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, 2002. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.b01_08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of a corrosion inhibitor depends on fluid composition, quantity of water, and flow regime. A common mechanism for inhibiting corrosion involves formation of a coating, often a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] layer, which prevents access of the corrosive substance to the metal. Permanent treatments such as [[chrome plating]] are not generally considered inhibitors, however. Instead corrosion inhibitors are ''additives'' to the fluids that surround the metal or related object.

Corrosion inhibitors are common in industry, and also found in over-the-counter products, typically in spray form in combination with a [[lubricant]] and sometimes a [[penetrating oil]].

==Types==
[[File:CuBTApolymer.png|thumb|[[Benzotriazole]] inhibits corrosion of copper by forming an inert layer of this polymer on the metal's surface]]
The nature of the corrosive inhibitor depends on (i) the material being protected, which are most commonly metal objects, and (ii) on the corrosive agent(s) to be neutralized. The corrosive agents are generally oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, and [[carbon dioxide]]. Oxygen is generally removed by reductive inhibitors such as [[amine]]s and [[hydrazine]]s:
:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
In this example, [[hydrazine]] converts oxygen, a common corrosive agent, to water, which is generally benign. Related inhibitors of oxygen corrosion are [[hexamine]], [[phenylenediamine]], and [[dimethylethanolamine]], and their derivatives. [[Antioxidant]]s such as sulfite and [[ascorbic acid]] are sometimes used. Some corrosion inhibitors form a [[passivation (chemistry)|passivating coating]] on the surface by [[chemisorption]]. [[Benzotriazole]] is one such species used to protect [[copper]]. For [[lubrication]], [[zinc dithiophosphate]]s are common - they deposit sulfide on surfaces.

The suitability of any given chemical for a task in hand depends on many factors, including their [[operating temperature]].

==Illustrative applications==
*Volatile amines are used in [[boiler]]s to minimize the effects of acid. In some cases, the amines form a protective film on the steel surface and, at the same time, act as an anodic inhibitor. An inhibitor that acts both in a cathodic and anodic manner is termed a ''mixed inhibitor''.
*[[Benzotriazole]] inhibits the corrosion and staining of copper surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;M. Finšgarand and I. Milošev "Inhibition of copper corrosion by 1,2,3-benzotriazole: A review" Corrosion Science 2010, Volume 52, Pages 2737-2749 {{doi|10.1016/j.corsci.2010.05.002}} &lt;/ref&gt;
*Corrosion inhibitors are often added to [[paint]]s. A [[pigment]] with anticorrosive properties is [[zinc phosphate]]. Compounds derived from [[tannic acid]] or zinc salts of organonitrogens (e.g. Alcophor 827) can be used together with anticorrosive pigments. Other corrosion inhibitors are Anticor 70, Albaex, Ferrophos, and Molywhite MZAP.
*[[Antiseptic]]s are used to counter [[microbial corrosion]]. [[Benzalkonium chloride]] is commonly used in [[oil field]] industry.
*In oil refineries, [[hydrogen sulfide]] can corrode steels so it is removed often using air and amines by conversion to [[polysulfide]]s.
===Fuels industry===
Corrosion inhibitors are commonly added to [[antifreeze (coolant)|coolant]]s, fuels, [[hydraulic fluid]]s, [[boiler water]], [[engine oil]], and many other fluids used in industry. For fuels, various corrosion inhibitors can be used. Some components include [[zinc dithiophosphate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050218035909/http://www.octel-starreon.com/Products_RFA_Corrosion.htm Octel-Starreon Refinery Fuel Additives Corrosion Inhibitors for hydrocarbon fuels - corrosion inhibitor and corrosion protection to fuel distribution system]&lt;/ref&gt;
* DCI-4A, widely used in commercial and military [[jet fuel]]s, acts also as a [[lubricity]] additive. Can be also used for [[gasoline]]s and other [[distillate]] fuels.
* DCI-6A, for motor gasoline and distillate fuels, and for [[U.S. military]] fuels ([[JP-4]], [[JP-5]], [[JP-8]])
* DCI-11, for alcohols and gasolines containing [[oxygenate]]s
* DCI-28, for very low-pH alcohols and gasolines containing oxygenates
* DCI-30, for gasoline and distillate fuels, excellent for pipeline transfers and storage, caustic-resistant
* DMA-4 (solution of alkylaminophosphate in kerosene), for petroleum distillates

The '''Cross of Saint Euphrosyne''' was a revered [[relic]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and [[Belarus]], which was made in 1161 by Lazar Bohsha for the order of Saint [[Euphrosyne of Polatsk]] and lost in June 1941 in [[Mahilyow]].

Euphrosyne, [[Abbess|mother superior]] of Polatsk Convent, ordered the cross to decorate the new Transfiguration church. The simple [[cypress]] cross was decorated with gold, gemstones and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], depicting [[Jesus Christ]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Theotokos]], the [[Four Evangelists]], archangels Gabriel and Michael, and three patron saints of Euphrosyne and her parents. The work cost 120 [[hryvna]]s. Inside, the cross contained pieces of the [[True Cross|Holy Cross]] and other relics.

In the 13th century, the cross was relocated to [[Smolensk]]; after a long travel across the country, it was returned to [[Polatsk]] in 1841. The cross was thoroughly photographed for the record in 1896. In 1928 the nationalized relic was taken to [[Minsk]], then, in 1929, to [[Mahilyow]], and was locked in a safe box of the regional [[Communist Party|communist party]] headquarters.

==Disappearance==

The cross disappeared during the swift [[Operation Barbarossa|occupation of Belarus]] by German forces (June–July 1941).

There are no reliable accounts of what happened to the cross in 1941. There are at least three different versions (other than destruction by fire or plunder):

* The official Soviet version abruptly stated that the cross was looted by Germans.
* In 1991, the minister of culture of [[Belarus]] asserted that the cross, together with other Belarusian treasures, had been evacuated to [[Moscow]].
* German paperwork of the [[Alfred Rosenberg]] organization recorded a ''Mahilyow treasure'' captured by Germans in Smolensk. However, there is no evidence of the Polatsk Cross itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Nikolay Petrovsky. Who stole the cross of St. Euphrosyne // Echo Planety, No. 11, 2000 [http://www.explan.ru/archive/2000/11/s1.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228204653/// |date=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Nikolay Kuzmich, a craftsman from [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], completed an officially endorsed replica of the cross, now on display in the Polatsk cathedral.

==Modern symbolic usage==

The Cross of St. Euphrosyne is often used as a national symbol of Belarus. The 1991 version of the Belarusian coat of arms [[Pahonia]] features a cross resembling the Cross of St. Euphrosyne on the knight's shield.

The Cross is the subject of two [[Postage stamps and postal history of Belarus|postage stamps of Belarus]], issued in 1992 and 2001, and a [[commemorative coin]] of Belarus issued in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Cross of Euphrosyne will appear on a Belarusian coin [http://naviny.by/rubrics/finance/2007/10/17/ic_articles_114_153420/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The national-democratic opposition movement [[Young Front]] has the cross as main element of its symbol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17016">'''[[Demographics|Demographic]] history''' is the reconstructed record of human population in the past. Given the lack of population records prior to the 1950s, there are many gaps in our record of demographic history. Historical demographers must make do with estimates. models and extrapolations.  For the methodology, see [[Historical demography]]

==Historical population of the world==
{{see also|World population estimates}}
[[File:World population growth (lin-log scale).png|thumb|400px|Population of the world from 10,000 BC to 2000 AD (logarithmic scale)]]

Estimating the ancestral population of [[anatomically modern humans]], [[Colin McEvedy]] and [[Richard Jones (disambiguation)#Other occupations|Richard Jones]] chose bounds based on [[gorilla]] and [[chimpanzee]] population densities of 1/km² and 3-4/km²,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEvedy |first=Colin |title=[[Atlas of World Population History]] |date=June 29, 1978 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, then assumed that as ''[[Homo erectus]]'' moved up the food chain, they lost an order of magnitude in density. With a habitat of 68 million km² ("the [[Old World]] south of latitude 50° north, minus [[Australia]]"), ''Homo erectus'' could have numbered around 1.7 million individuals. After being replaced by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and moving into the [[New World]] and de-glaciated territory, by 10,000 BC world population was approaching four million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEvedy |first=Colin |title=[[Atlas of World Population History]] |date=June 29, 1978 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; McEvedy and Jones argue that, after populating the maximum available range, this was the limit of our [[Hunter-gatherer|food-gathering]] ancestors, with further population growth requiring [[Neolithic Revolution|food-producing]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEvedy |first=Colin |title=[[Atlas of World Population History]] |date=June 29, 1978 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial population "upswing" began around 5000 BC. Global population gained 50% in the 5th millennium BC, and 100% each millennium until 1000 BC, reaching 50 million people. After the beginning of the [[Iron Age]], growth rate reached its peak with a [[doubling time]] of 500 years. However, growth slackened between 500 BC and 1 AD, before ceasing around 200 AD. This "primary cycle" was, at this time in history, confined to [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and mainland [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEvedy |first=Colin |title=[[Atlas of World Population History]] |date=June 29, 1978 |page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; McEvedy and Jones describe a secondary, "medieval cycle" being led by [[Feudalism|feudal Europe]] and [[Song dynasty|Song China]] from around 900 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEvedy |first=Colin |title=[[Atlas of World Population History]] |date=June 29, 1978 |page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period from 500 to 900 [[world population]] grew slowly but the growth rate accelerated between 900 and 1300 when the population doubled. During the 14th century, there was a fall in population associated with the [[Black Death]] that spread from [[Asia]] to [[Europe]]. This was followed by a period of restrained growth for 300 years.&lt;ref name="EoPH"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/historical-demography Historical Demography] in [[Encyclopedia of Public Health]], Retrieved on 3 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century world population entered a period of accelerated growth. European population reached a peak growth rate of 10 per thousand per year in the second half of the 19th century. During the 20th century, the growth rate among the European populations fell and was overtaken by a rapid acceleration in the growth rate in other continents, which reached 21 per thousand per year in the last 50 years of the millennium. Between 1900 and 2000, the population of the world increased by 277%, a fourfold increase from 1.5 billion to 6 billion. The European component increased by 124%, and the remainder by 349%.&lt;ref name="EoPH"/&gt;

===India===
{{Main|Demography of India}}
{{See also|Census of India|Economic history of India}}

The Indian population was about 100 million in 1500. Under the [[Mughal Empire]], the population rose to 160 million in 1700.&lt;ref name="mcevedy184"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Colin McEvedy |author-link1=Colin McEvedy |author2=Richard Jones |date=1978 |title=Atlas of World Population History |publisher=[[Facts on File]] |location=New York |pages=184-185 |url=http://www.arabgeographers.net/up/uploads/14299936761.pdf#page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mughal India]] had a relatively high degree of [[urbanization]] for its time, with 15% of its population living in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the urban population in contemporary Europe at the time and higher than that of [[British India]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="eraly"&gt;[[Abraham Eraly]] (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zpa8gyGW_twC&amp;pg=PA5 ''The Mughal World: Life in India's Last Golden Age'', page 5], [[Penguin Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[British Raj]], the population reached 255 million according to the [[1881 Census of India|census taken in 1881]].&lt;ref&gt;Anatole Romaniuk, "Glimpses of Indian Historical Demography." Canadian Studies in Population 40.3-4 (2014): 248-251. [https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/csp/article/download/21301/16105 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parameswara Krishnan, ''Glimpses of Indian Historical Demography'' (Delhi: B.R. Publishing Corporation 2010) {{ISBN|978-8176466387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kingsley Davis, ''The Population of India and Pakistan'' (Princeton University Press, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kingsley Davis, "The population of India." ''Far Eastern Survey'' (1943): 76-79. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3022159 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of India's population since 1881 have focused on such topics as total population, birth and death rates, growth rates, geographic distribution, literacy, the rural and urban divide, cities of a million, and the three cities with populations over eight million: Delhi, Greater Mumbai (Bombay), and Kolkata (Calcutta).&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Khan,  "Population growth and demographic change in India," ''Asian Profile'' (2004) 32#5 pp 441-460&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortality rates fell in 1920-45 era, primarily due to biological immunization. Other factors included rising incomes and better living conditions, improved better nutrition, a safer and cleaner environmental, and better official health policies and medical care.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Klein, "Population growth and mortality in British India: Part II: The demographic revolution," ''Indian Economic Social History Review'' (1990) 27#1 pp 33-63 doi: 10.1177/001946469002700102 [http://ier.sagepub.com/content/27/1/33 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe overcrowding in the cities caused major public health problems, as noted in an official report from 1938:&lt;ref&gt;Klein, "Population growth and mortality in British India: Part II: The demographic revolution," p 42&lt;/ref&gt;
:In the urban and industrial areas ... cramped sites, the high values of land and the necessity for the worker to live in the vicinity of his work ... all tend to intensify congestion and overcrowding. In the busiest centres houses are built close together, eave touching eave, and frequently back to back .... Indeed space is so valuable that, in place of streets and roads, winding lanes provide the only approach to the houses. Neglect of sanitation is often evidenced by heaps of rotting garbage and pools of sewage, whilst the absence of latrines enhance the general pollution of air and soil.

==Early modern Europe==

[[Karl Julius Beloch]] estimated the population of early modern Europe, circa 1600, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Julius Beloch, "Die Bevölkerung Europas zur Zeit der Renaissance" in ''Zeitschrift für Socialwissenschaft'', 1900, pp. 765 to 786.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Italy, 13,000,000
*Spain and Portugal, 10,000,000
*France, 16,000,000, in its boundaries in 1600&lt;ref&gt;Beloch gives it an area of 470,000 km2, too small for France in 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''e-Administration''', or [[electronics|electronic]] administration, refers to any of a number of mechanisms which convert what in a traditional office are paper processes into electronic processes, with the goal being to create a [[paperless office]].  This is an ICT tool, with the goal being to improve productivity and performance.

e-Administration can encompass both intra-office and inter-office [[communication]] for any organization.

Its objective is to introduce total [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and [[accountability]] leading to better [[e-Governance]] within any organization.  In [[Germany]], this initiative is especially targeted at [[government]] organizations, where public accountability is of special concern.  Similar processes are being developed in many [[United States|American]] [[corporations]] to aid compliance with the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]].

The implementation of any e-administration solution should be customer centric rather than organization centric, should remove dependence on specific individuals, and should introduce transparent systems of working.  Examples of e-administration include, online timesheets and expense account. These can be used to help reduce costs to an organization.

The '''Etching Revival''' is the re-emergence and invigoration of [[etching]] as an original form of [[printmaking]] during a period of time stretching approximately from 1850 to 1930.

==Historical outline==
During the century after [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt's]] death the techniques of etching and [[drypoint]] brought to their highest point by him gradually declined. By the late eighteenth century, with brilliant exceptions like [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], most etchings were reproductive or illustrative.

However, in the 1840s and 50's in France, a number of artists did produce some landscape etchings which seemed to recapture some of the spirit of the [[Old Master print]]. [[Daubigny]], [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]] and especially [[Charles Jacque]] produced etchings that were different from those heavily worked reproductive plates of the previous century.

Several people were of special importance to the French Etching Revival. The publisher [[Alfred Cadart]],&lt;ref name="Oxford 359"&gt;Martin Kemp (Ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=95J-ppmZmt8C&amp;pg=PA359 ''The Oxford History of Western Art''], Oxford University Press (2000), p. 359, {{ISBN|0-19-860012-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the printer Auguste Delâtre, and [[Maxime Lalanne]], an etcher who wrote a popular textbook of etching in 1866, established the broad contours of the movement. Cadart founded the ''Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; des Aquafortistes'' in 1862, reviving the awareness of the beautiful, original etching in the minds of the collecting public.&lt;ref name="Oxford 359" /&gt; [[Charles Méryon]] was an early inspiration, and close collaborator with Delâtre, laying out the various possible techniques of modern etching and producing works that would be ranked with Rembrandt and [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]].&lt;ref&gt;van Breda, Jacobus. "Charles Meryon: Paper and Ink," &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 3 No. 3 (September-October 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Treatise on Etching'' by Lalanne was translated by S.R. Koehler and published in the United States in 1880. It played a significant role in the Etching Revival in America. However, before the translation of Lalanne's book, [[Philip Gilbert Hamerton]] had become an enthusiastic promoter of etching in Britain. His ''Etching and Etchers'' (1868) was more an art history than a technical text but it did much to popularize the art and some of its modern practitioners. The book went through many editions till the 20th century. By the 1870s Hamerton was also publishing an influential periodical, titled ''[[The Portfolio]]'', that published etchings in editions of 1000 copies.[[File:Zaandam2.jpg|thumb|''Zaandam by [[James MacNeill Whistler]], c.1889]]

For Hamerton and others, the father of the British Etching Revival was [[Francis Seymour Haden]], the surgeon etcher, who, with his brother-in-law, the American, [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]], produced a body of work starting around 1860 that still stands as one the highpoints of etching history. Haden was a collector and authority on the etchings of Rembrandt and it comes as no surprise that as Whistler, the younger man, began to show signs of veering far from the 17th-century model, Haden and he parted company.

It was Whistler who convinced the artist [[Alphonse Legros]], one of the members of the French Revival, to come to England as a teacher. This linking of the art of the two countries, though short-lived, did much to validate etching as an art form. Very soon, French etching would show the same modernist signs that French art showed generally, while English and American etching remained true to the kind of technical proficiency and subject matter artists revered in Rembrandt. One distinct aspect of the revival, in contrast with the Old Master period, was an interest in giving unique qualities to each impression of a print.&lt;ref&gt;Woodbury, Sara. "Giving a Good Impression: B.J.O. Nordfeldt's Inscribed Etchings," &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 7 No. 2 (July-August 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall in popularity==
Etching as a collected and therefore as a practised art appears to have died with the [[Great Depression]]. Without a large group of collectors many artists returned to their canvases. Etchings fell hugely in value until the 1980s when a new market (albeit a small one) began to develop for what is now seen as a small but important tributary of the stream of 19th- and 20th-century art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4490">'''Ethnovideography''' is a methodology of using [[video]] in the study of [[people]]s, [[community|communities]], groups or sub-groups.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, A.G. 2002. ''Ethnovideography''. SEAMEO-SEARCA and CIP-UPWARD&lt;/ref&gt; It espouses the use of video to document reality instead of "creating" realities. Hence, ethnovideographic presentations are unscripted. Narrations, background music, sound effects and special effects are not employed. The use of artificial lighting, obtrusive hardware, production crews and all but the simplest camera technique are discouraged. 

Although originally experimented upon by the [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]] science community in the [[Philippines]] in the early 1990s as adjuncts to [[environmental impact assessment]]s (EIAs), studies of indigenous knowledge systems and documentation of agricultural [[best practice]], it traces its roots in the [[cinéma vérité]] movement of the 1950s and 1960s, the difference being its emphasis on small format or digital format video and its adoption of extra-sociological subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, A.G. 1983. Participatory Film-Making: A Structural Analysis of Cinema Direct. ''DevCom Quarterly''. UPLB Institute of Development Communication&lt;/ref&gt; Being a methodology, ethnovideography is theory-based and adopts a set of procedures or protocols.

==History==
The earliest mention of ethnovideography in current literature comes from an [[Asian Development Bank]] project document written by a team of environmental consultants headed by Sylvia Guerrero, former Dean of the [[University of the Philippines]] College of Social Work and Community Development. Guerrero et al. (1992) defined ethnovideography as:

''...a research procedure developed at the UPLB Institute of Development Communication, which makes use of small-format video-generated non-alphanumeric data for social analysis. This procedure entails video documentation of five types of subjects: people, places, processes, events and social problems...''&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, S.H. 1992. ''Inception Report for Improving the Implementation of Environmental impact Assessment''. Asian Development Bank&lt;/ref&gt; 

Credited for coining the term ethnovideography as well as its development as a methodology, Alexander Flor considers it more than a research procedure but a [[knowledge management]] system and a form of development intervention as well. Flor was a professor of [[development communication]] at the [[University of the Philippines Los Banos]] who underwent a [[Fulbright]]-PAEF post-doctoral tour in the US in 1989. The tour included a summer at the [[USC Center for Visual Anthropology]], wherein exposure to the use of video in urban anthropology contributed to his early constructs on ethnovideography. Other influences include Professor Alain Martenot who mentored Flor on [[Direct Cinema]] technique under a French Foreign Ministry grant. His early work on ethnovideography was sponsored by the Users' Perspectives with Agricultural and Rural Development (UPWARD) facility of the Lima-based [[International Potato Center]]. Succeeding research were conducted mostly by [[development communication]] graduate students, e.g. Bandara,&lt;ref&gt;Bandara, R. 1994. ''Usefulness and Effectivity of Ethnovideography as a Training Tool in Sri Lanka''. University of the Philippines Los Banos Graduate School&lt;/ref&gt; Hardono,&lt;ref&gt;Hardono.1993. ''Usefulness and Effectivity of Ethnovideography in Documenting Indigenous Knowledge on Sustainable Agriculture in Indonesia''. University of the Philippines Los Banos Graduate School&lt;/ref&gt; and Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Iis Nana Maya. 1993. ''Usefulness and Effectivity of Ethnovideography in Research Agenda Setting''. University of the Philippines Los Banos Graduate School&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, ethnovideographic studies have been uploaded to [[YouTube]].

In 2002, the book [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL5866684W/Ethnovideography Ethnovideography: Video Based Indigenous Knowledge Systems] was co-published by [http://www.searca.org SEAMEO-SEARCA] and [[International Potato Center|CIP]]-UPWARD.

'''Force-field analysis''' is a development in social science. It provides a framework for looking at the factors (''forces'') that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces that are either driving movement toward a goal (helping forces) or blocking movement toward a goal (hindering forces). The principle, developed by [[Kurt Lewin]], is a significant contribution to the fields of [[social science]], [[psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[community psychology]], [[Communication studies|communication]], [[organizational development]], [[process management]], and [[change management]].

==History==
Lewin, a social psychologist, believed the "field" to be a [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] psychological environment existing in an individual's (or in the collective group) mind at a certain point in time that can be mathematically described in a [[topological]] constellation of constructs. The "field" is very dynamic, changing with time and experience. When fully constructed, an individual's "field" (Lewin used the term "life space") describes that person's motives, values, needs, moods, goals, anxieties, and ideals. 

Lewin believed that changes of an individual's "life space" depend upon that individual's internalization of external stimuli (from the physical and social world) into the "life space". Although Lewin did not use the word "experiential" (see [[experiential learning]]), he nonetheless believed that interaction (experience) of the "life space" with "external stimuli" (at what he calls the "boundary zone") were important for development (or regression). For Lewin, development (or regression) of an individual occurs when their "life space" has a "boundary zone" experience with external stimuli. Note, it is not merely the experience that causes change in the "life space", but the acceptance (internalization) of external stimuli.

Lewin took these same principles and applied them to the analysis of [[group conflict]], [[learning]], [[adolescence]], [[hatred]], [[morale]], German society, etc. This approach allowed him to break down common misconceptions of these social phenomena, and to determine their basic elemental constructs. He used theory, mathematics, and common sense to define a force field, and hence to determine the causes of human and group behavior.

A '''gas chamber''' is an apparatus for killing humans or other animals with gas, consisting of a sealed chamber into which a [[poison]]ous or [[asphyxiant gas]] is introduced. The most commonly used poisonous agent is [[hydrogen cyanide]]; [[carbon dioxide]] and [[carbon monoxide]] have also been used. Gas chambers were used as a method of execution for condemned prisoners in the United States beginning in the 1920s and continue to be a legal execution method in three states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution |title=Methods of Execution - Death Penalty Information Center |publisher=deathpenaltyinfo.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225054450/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution |archivedate=2011-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[the Holocaust]], large-scale gas chambers designed for mass killing were used by [[Nazi Germany]] as part of their [[genocide]] program. The use of gas chambers in [[North Korea]] has also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Barnett |first=Antony |title=Revealed: the gas chamber horror of North Korea's gulag |newspaper=The Guardian |date=February 1, 2004 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/korea/article/0,2763,1136483,00.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |location=London}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]] made extensive use of various types of gas chamber for mass killing.

Beginning in 1939, gas chambers were used as part of the [[Aktion T4|Nazi euthanasia program]] aimed at eliminating physically and intellectually disabled people. Experiments in the gassing of patients were conducted in October 1939 in occupied [[Poznan|Posen]] in Poland. Hundreds of prisoners were killed by [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning in an improvised gas chamber.&lt;ref name="browning"&gt; {{cite book | title=The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 – March 1942 | publisher=Arrow |last=Browning |first=Christopher |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8032-5979-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 gas chambers using bottled pure carbon monoxide were established at six euthanasia centres in Germany.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005220 | title = Gassing Operations | last =  | first =  | date =  | website = Holocaust Encyclopedia | publisher = United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | access-date = 30 November 2017 | quote =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171203210358/https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005220 | archivedate = 3 December 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to persons with disabilities, these centres were also used to kill prisoners transferred from concentration camps in Germany, Austria, and Poland. Killings of concentration camp inmates continued after the euthanasia program was officially shut down in 1941.&lt;ref name="klee"&gt;{{cite book | title=Euthanasie im NS-Staat.

During the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Russia]], mass executions by [[exhaust gas]] were performed by ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' using [[gas van]]s, trucks modified to divert engine exhaust into a sealed interior gas chamber.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE" /&gt; 

Starting in 1941, gas chambers were used at [[extermination camp]]s in Poland for the mass killing of [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Roma]], and other victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Gas vans were used at the [[Chełmno extermination camp]]. The [[Operation Reinhard]] extermination camps at [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]], and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] used exhaust fumes from stationary [[diesel engine]]s.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE" /&gt; In search of more efficient killing methods, the Nazis experimented with using the [[hydrogen cyanide]]-based [[fumigation|fumigant]] [[Zyklon B]] at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. This method was adopted for mass killings at the Auschwitz and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] camps. Up to 6000 victims were gassed with Zyklon-B each day at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE" /&gt;

Most extermination camp gas chambers were dismantled or destroyed in the last months of the [[World War II]] as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops approached, except for those at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] and Majdanek. One destroyed gas chamber at Auschwitz was reconstructed after the war to stand as a memorial.

==Lithuania==
In 1937–1940, [[Lithuania]] operated a gas chamber in [[Aleksotas]] within the First Fort of the [[Kaunas Fortress]].&lt;ref name=cernevic/&gt; Before, the executions were carried out by hanging or by shooting. However, these methods were viewed as brutal and in January 1937, the criminal code was amended to provide execution by gas which at the time was viewed as more civilized and humane. Lithuania considered and rejected execution by poison. The first execution was carried on July 27, 1937: Bronius Pogužinskas, age 37, convicted of murder of five people from a Jewish family.&lt;ref name=cernevic/&gt; Historian Sigita Černevičiūtė counted at least nine executions in the gas chamber, though records are incomplete and fragmentary. Of the nine, eight were convicted of murder. One, Aleksandras Maurušaitis, was in addition convicted of anti-government actions during the [[1935 Suvalkija strike]]. The last known execution took place on May 19, 1940 for robbery. The fate of the gas chamber after the [[Occupation of Lithuania by Soviet Union 1940|occupation by the Soviet Union]] in June 1940 is unclear.&lt;ref name=cernevic&gt;{{cite web |first=Sigita |last=Černevičiūtė |title=Dujų kamera prieškario Lietuvoje 1937-1940 metais |date=April 8, 2014 |url=http://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/istorija/duju-kamera-prieskario-lietuvoje-1937-1940-metais-582-418225 |publisher=15 min (republished from ''Naujasis Židinys-Aidai'') |language=lt |accessdate=2016-11-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127154408/http://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/istorija/duju-kamera-prieskario-lietuvoje-1937-1940-metais-582-418225 |archivedate=November 27, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North Korea==
Kwon Hyok, a former head of security at [[Camp 22]], described laboratories equipped with gas chambers for [[Asphyxiant gas|suffocation gas]] experiments, in which three or four people, normally a family, are the experimental subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/korea/article/0,2763,1136483,00.html |title=Revealed: the gas chamber horror of North Korea's gulag |first=Antony |last=Barnett |date=31 January 2004 |via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freekorea.us/2007/02/18/holocaust-now-looking-down-into-hell-at-camp-22/ Video testimonials by former guards and prisoners at Camp 22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024121846/http://freekorea.us/2007/02/18/holocaust-now-looking-down-into-hell-at-camp-22/ |date=2007-10-24 }}, where the experiments are said to have occurred, with Google Earth images Camp 22 and other camps&lt;/ref&gt;  After undergoing medical checks, the chambers are sealed and poison is injected through a tube, while scientists observe from above through glass. In a report reminiscent of an earlier account of a family of seven, Kwon claims to have watched one family of two parents, a son and a daughter die from suffocating gas, with the parents trying to save the children using [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]] for as long as they had the strength. Kwon's testimony was supported by documents from Camp 22 describing the transfer of prisoners designated for the experiments. The documents were identified as genuine by Kim Sang Hun, a London-based expert on Korea and human rights activist.&lt;ref name="bbc01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3440771.stm |title=Within prison walls |accessdate=2009-12-15 |author=Olenka Frenkiel |date=January 30, 2004 |publisher=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623201644/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3440771.stm |archivedate=June 23, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A press conference in [[Pyongyang]], organized by North Korean authorities, denounced this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.people.cn/200403/31/eng20040331_138993.shtml |title=DPRK civilians admit faking papers on chemical weapons testing on humans |accessdate=15 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191733/http://en.people.cn/200403/31/eng20040331_138993.shtml |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2004/200403/news03/31.htm#10 Truth behind False Report about "Experiment of Chem.

Gas chambers have been used for [[capital punishment in the United States]] to execute [[List of United States death row inmates|death row inmates]]. The first person to be executed in the United States by lethal gas was [[Gee Jon]], on February 8, 1924. An unsuccessful attempt to pump poison gas directly into his cell at [[Nevada State Prison]] led to the development of the first makeshift gas chamber to carry out Gee's death sentence.&lt;ref name="DPIC-Descriptions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods#gas |title=Descriptions of Execution Methods: Gas Chamber |publisher=[[Death Penalty Information Center]] |year=2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112105603/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods#gas |archivedate=November 12, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 1948, [[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]] and [[Sam Shockley]] were executed in the gas chamber at [[San Quentin State Prison]] for their role in the [[Battle of Alcatraz]].

In 1957, [[Burton Abbott]] was executed as the governor of California, [[Goodwin J. Knight]], was on the telephone to stay the execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 25, 1957 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809259,00.html |title=Race in the Death House |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=2007-11-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330000547/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809259,00.html |archivedate=March 30, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the restoration of the death penalty in the United States in 1976, eleven executions by gas chamber have been conducted.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |title=German executed in Arizona, legal challenge fails |publisher=CNN |date=March 4, 1999 |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9903/04/arizona.execution.01/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011002515/http://www.cnn.com/US/9903/04/arizona.execution.01/ |archivedate=October 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, reports of suffering during gas chamber executions had led to controversy over the use of this method.

At the September 2, 1983, execution of [[Jimmy Lee Gray]] in [[Mississippi]], officials cleared the viewing room after eight minutes while Gray was still alive and gasping for air. The decision to clear the room while he was still alive was criticized by his [[Attorneys in the United States|attorney]]. [[David Bruck]], an attorney specializing in death penalty cases, said, "Jimmy Lee Gray died banging his head against a steel pole in the gas chamber while reporters counted his moans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Some examples of post-Furman botched executions |publisher=Death Penalty Information Center |date=May 24, 2007 |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=8&amp;did=478 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122180900/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=8&amp;did=478 |archivedate=November 22, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray was convicted for the [[murder]] of three-year-old Deressa Jean Scales in 1976, after [[kidnapping]] and anally raping her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30B17FE395C0C718CDDA00894DB484D81 Killer Of 3-Year-Old Mississippi Girl Executed After Justices Reject Plea].

During the April 6, 1992, execution of [[Donald Harding (murderer)|Donald Harding]] in [[Arizona]], it took 11 minutes for death to occur. The prison warden stated that he would quit if required to conduct another gas chamber execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Weil |first=Elizabeth |title=The needle and the damage done |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 11, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/magazine/11injection.t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421134244/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/magazine/11injection.t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin |archivedate=April 21, 2017 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Harding's execution, Arizona voted that all persons condemned after November 1992 would be executed by lethal injection.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

Following the execution of [[Robert Alton Harris]], a federal court declared that "execution by lethal gas under the California protocol is unconstitutionally [[cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and unusual]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Fierro, Ruiz, Harris v.

California's gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison was converted to an execution chamber for lethal injection.

As of 2010, the last person to be executed in the gas chamber was German national [[Walter LaGrand]], sentenced to death before 1992, who was executed in [[Arizona]] on March 3, 1999. The [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] had ruled that he could not be executed by gas chamber, but the decision was overturned by the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; The gas chamber was formerly used in [[Colorado]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Oregon]]. Six states, Arizona, California, [[Maryland]], Mississippi, [[Missouri]] and [[Wyoming]], authorize lethal gas if lethal injection cannot be administered, the condemned committed their crime before a certain date, or the condemned chooses to die in the gas chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Methods of execution |publisher=Death Penalty Information Center |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=8&amp;did=245 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703193933/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=8&amp;did=245 |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, [[Governor of New York]] [[David Paterson]] signed a bill rendering gas chambers illegal for use by [[humane society|humane societies]] and other animal shelters.&lt;ref name="humaneanimal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=$AGM374$@TXAGM0374+&amp;LIST=SEA17+&amp;BROWSER=BROWSER+&amp;TOKEN=26623049+&amp;TARGET=VIEW |title=Agriculture and Markets Law § 374 |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because hydrogen cyanide gas condenses at approximately 78&amp;nbsp;°F (26&amp;nbsp;°C), the temperature in the chamber (when it is in use) is maintained at a minimum of 80&amp;nbsp;°F (27&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zundelsite.org/archive/leuchter/report3/ch7000.html  Mississippi State Penitentiary, Leuchter report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706021251/http://www.zundelsite.org/archive/leuchter/report3/ch7000.html |date=2015-07-06 }} section 7.002&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excluding all oxygen====
{{main article|Inert gas asphyxiation}}
Nitrogen gas or oxygen-depleted air has been considered for human execution, as it can induce [[nitrogen asphyxiation]]. The victim detects little abnormal sensation as the oxygen level falls. This leads to [[asphyxia]]tion (death from lack of oxygen) without the painful and traumatic feeling of suffocation, or the side effects of poisoning.

In April 2015, [[Governor of Oklahoma|Oklahoma Governor]] [[Mary Fallin]] approved a bill allowing nitrogen asphyxiation as an execution method.&lt;ref name="newsok.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-gov.-mary-fallin-signs-bill-allowing-nitrogen-asphyxiation-as-alternative-execution-method/article/5411181 |title=Oklahoma Gov.

Gas chambers have also been used for [[animal euthanasia]], using [[carbon monoxide]] as the lethal agent. Sometimes a box filled with [[anesthetic]] gas is used to anesthetize small animals for surgery or euthanasia. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[File:Club Bathbohouse.jpg|thumb|Gay bathhouse in the U.S.]]
A '''gay bathhouse''', also known as a '''gay sauna''' or a '''gay steambath''', is a commercial space for [[men who have sex with men|men to have sex with other men]]. In [[gay slang]], a bathhouse may be called just "the baths," "the sauna" or "the tubs". In general, a gay bath is mainly used for having [[sexual activity]] rather than only [[bathing]].&lt;ref name="Prior2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |date=2007 |page=121 |chapter=Baths, Public: III.&amp;#160;West, Middle Ages–Present |last=Prior |first=Jason |editor1-last=Malti‑Douglas |editor1-first=Fedwa |editor2-last=Choksy |editor2-first=Jamsheed K. |editor3-last=Roof |editor3-first=Judith |editor4-last=Sautman |editor4-first=Francesca Canadé |editor5-last=Jones |editor5-first=Sumie |editor6-last=Zhou |editor6-first=Liana |publisher=Thomson Gale |location=Farmington Hills, Michigan |volume=1:&amp;#160;A–C |isbn=978-0-02-865961-9 |lccn=2007020796 |oclc=894526708}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colker1994"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-10/local/me-32240_1_gay-bathhouse |title=Within the Walls of Gay Bathhouse Lies a World of Their Own |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1994-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222212010/http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-10/local/me-32240_1_gay-bathhouse |archive-date=2014-12-22 |dead-url=no |last=Colker |first=David |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all men who visit a gay bathhouse are considered [[homosexuality|gay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Woods|Binson|2003|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Gremore, "Straight guys in gay bathhouses? Yep, it happens. Former employee tells all," ''[[Quora]]'', August 10, 2017, https://www.queerty.com/straight-guys-gay-bathhouses-yep-happens-former-employee-tells-20170810.&lt;/ref&gt; Bathhouses offering similar services for women are rare, but some men's bathhouses occasionally have a "[[lesbian]]" or "women only" night.

Bathhouses vary considerably in size and amenities{{spnd}}from small establishments with 10 or 20 rooms and a handful of lockers to multi-story saunas with a variety of room styles or sizes and several steam baths, [[Jacuzzi]] tubs, and sometimes [[swimming pool]]s. Most have a steam room (or wet sauna), dry sauna, showers, lockers, and small private rooms.

Many bathhouses are, for legal reasons, "membership only", though membership is generally open to any [[Age of consent|adult]] who seeks it, usually after paying a small fee. Unlike [[brothel]]s, customers pay only for the use of the facilities. Sexual activity, if it occurs, is not provided by staff of the establishment but is between customers, and no money is exchanged. Many gay bathhouses, for legal reasons, explicitly prohibit or discourage [[prostitution]] and ban known prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Let's emphasize 'safe' part of safe sex |work=Plain Dealer (Cleveland) |date=July 21, 2006 |author=Regina Brett |quote=The Flex club opens in August.

Records of men meeting for sex with other men in bathhouses date back to the 15th century. A tradition of public baths dates back to the 6th century BC, and there are many ancient records of [[Homosexuality in ancient Greece|homosexual activity in Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|De Bonneville|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western world|West]], gay men have been using bathhouses for sex since at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when homosexual acts were illegal in most Western countries and men who were caught engaging in homosexual acts were often arrested and publicly humiliated. Men began frequenting [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] areas such as bathhouses, public parks, alleys, train and bus stations, adult theaters, public lavatories ([[cottaging|cottages or tearooms]]), and gym changing rooms where they could meet other men for sex. Some bathhouse owners tried to prevent sex between patrons while others, mindful of profits or prepared to risk prosecution, overlooked discreet homosexual activity.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

===Early records===
; 1492 Florence
: In [[Florence]], [[Italy]], in 1492 there was a purge against the "vice of sodomy". The places used for homosexual acts were to be taverns, baths, and ''casini'' (sheds or houses used for illicit sex and gambling). The ''Eight of Watch'' (the city's leading criminal court) issued several [[decree]]s associated with [[sodomy]] and on April 11, 1492 they warned the managers of bathhouses to keep out "suspect boys" on penalty of a fine. In the short period from April 1492 to February 1494 they convicted 44 men for homosexual relations not involving violence or aggravating circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rocke|1998|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; 1876 Paris
: In France the first recorded [[police raid]] on a [[Paris]]ian bathhouse was in 1876 in the ''Bains de Gymnase'' on the ''Rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière''. Six men aged 14 to 22 were prosecuted for an ''offence against public decency'' and the manager and two employees for ''facilitating [[pederasty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Higgs|1999|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1903 New York
: In the [[United States]] on February 21, 1903, [[New York City Police|New York police]] conducted the first recorded raid on a gay bathhouse, the ''Ariston Hotel Baths''. 26 men were arrested and 12 brought to trial on sodomy charges; 7 men received sentences ranging from 4 to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref name=Chauncey&gt;{{harv|Chauncey|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New York City]], the ''[[Everard Baths|Everard]]'' (nicknamed the ''Everhard'')&lt;ref name=Stein2004&gt;{{harv|Stein|2004|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; was converted from a church to a bathhouse in 1888 and was patronized by gay men before the 1920s and by the 1930s had a reputation as the "classiest, safest, and best known of the baths".&lt;ref name=neilmiller/&gt; It was damaged by fire on May 25, 1977, when nine men died and several others were seriously injured. The Everard closed in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/nyregion/4-new-york-bathhouses-still-operate-under-city-s-program-of-inspections.html |title=4 New York Bathhouses still operate under city's program of inspections |work=The New York Times |date=May 3, 1987 |accessdate=22 December 2006 |last=Bronstein |first=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also popular in the 1910s were the ''Produce Exchange Baths'' and the ''Lafayette Baths'' (403–405 Lafayette Street, which from 1916 was managed by [[Ira Gershwin|Ira]] &amp; [[George Gershwin]]). American [[:Category:Precisionism|precisionist]] painter [[Charles Demuth]] used the Lafayette Baths as his favourite haunt. His 1918 homoerotic self-portrait set in a [[Turkish bath]] is likely to have been inspired by it.&lt;ref name=neilmiller/&gt; The ''Penn Post Baths'' in a hotel basement (the  [[Penn Post Hotel]], 304 West 31st Street) was a popular gay location in the 1920s despite a seedy condition and the lack of private rooms.&lt;ref name=neilmiller&gt;{{harv|Miller|1995|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American composer [[Charles Griffes]] (1884–1920) wrote in his diaries about visits to the [[New York City]] bathhouses and the [[YMCA]]. His biography states: "So great was his need to be with boys, that though his home contained two pianos, he chose to practice at an instrument at the Y, and his favourite time was when the players were coming and going from their games."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gustav-Wrathall|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|When a friend with "little experience but great desire" confided his homosexual longings to Charles Griffes in 1916, Griffes took him to the Lafayette so that he could meet other gay men and explore his sexual interests in a supportive environment: the friend was "astounded and fascinated" by what he saw there. The baths also encouraged more advanced forms of sexual experimentation. Griffes himself had had his first encounter with a man interested in sadomasochism at the Lafayette two years earlier (he found the man "interesting" but the experience unappealing), and several men interviewed in the mid-1930s referred to experimenting in the baths and learning of new pleasures.&lt;ref name=Chauncey/&gt;|George Chauncey|Gay New York 1995}}

In [[London]], the Savoy Turkish Baths at 92 Jermyn Street became a favourite spot (opening in 1910 and remaining open until September 1975).&lt;ref name=Potvin2008&gt;{{citation |year=2008 |title=Material and visual cultures beyond male bonding, 1870–1914: bodies, boundaries and intimacy |first1=John |last1=Potvin |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=9780754656654 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KCxAAAAIAAJ |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist A.J. Langguth wrote: "...[The baths at Jermyn Street] represented a twilight arena for elderly men who came to sweat poisons from their systems and youths who came to strike beguiling poses in Turkish towels... although they were closely overseen by attendants, they provided a discreet place to inspect a young man before offering a cup of tea at [[J.

In the 1950s the [[Bermondsey]] Turkish Baths were rated by [[Kenneth Williams]] as "quite fabulous" in his diaries.&lt;ref name=houlbrook/&gt;
{{Quotation|''Steambaths in the 1930s: ''The steambaths that had been well known to me were those of East Ham, Greenwich and Bermondsey.

===Modern gay bathhouses===

In the 1950s exclusively gay bathhouses began to open in the United States. Though subject to [[Vice squad|vice raids]], these bathhouses were "oases of homosexual camaraderie"&lt;ref name=History/&gt; and were, as they remain today, "places where it was safe to be gay",&lt;ref name=History/&gt; whether or not patrons themselves identified as homosexual. The gay baths offered a much safer alternative to [[public sex|sex in other public places]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

In the late 1960s and 1970s, gay bathhouses{{spnd}}now primarily gay-owned and operated{{spnd}}became fully licensed gay establishments which soon became major gay institutions. These bathhouses served as informal gay meeting places, places where friends could meet and relax. Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for [[Gay pride|Pride Day]] and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]], when some gay men, particularly those who had been rejected by their families due to their [[sexual orientation]], had nowhere else to go. The American writer [[Truman Capote]] was a regular at New York City baths in the 1970s, in particular the sauna at West 58th Street.&lt;ref name=TGM&gt;{{harv|Kaiser|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another service offered by the baths was [[voting|voter registration]]. In the run-up to the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 election]], the [[New St. Mark's Baths]] in New York City, with the assistance of the [[League of Women Voters]], conducted a voter registration drive on its premises.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

Gay [[saunas]], as they are more commonly known in Australia and New Zealand, were present in most large cities in those countries by the late 1980s. As homosexuality was [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986|decriminalised in New Zealand]] and [[LGBT rights in Australia#The gay rights movement|most Australian states]] during the 1970s and 1980s, there was no criminal conduct occurring on the premises of such "sex on site venues".

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] gay saunas were routinely raided by police up until the end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in [[Streatham]], the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Policing Gay Sex |journal=Gay Times |issue=138 |publisher=Millivres |date=March 1990 |issn=0950-6101}} 'The draconian sentence (six months jail and a £5,000 fine) on the owner and manager of Brownies sauna for keeping a [[disorderly house]] is a case in point'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sauna owner appeals against prison sentence |journal=Gay Times |issue=127 |publisher=Millivres |date=April 1989 |issn=0950-6101 |quote=‘There was also’, he said, an ‘element of corruption’. ‘Anyone who came off the street merely to take a sauna&amp;#160;... would be able to see what was going on and be invited to take part.

Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of [[Labouchere Amendment|gross indecency]], until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]].

==Bathhouses today==
[[File:Sailors health club.jpg|thumb|Sailors leaflet in 1998]]

Gay bathhouses today continue to fill a similar function as they did historically. The community aspect has lessened in some territories, particularly those where gay men increasingly tend to [[Coming out|come out]].

Some men still use bathhouses as a convenient, safe place to meet other men for sex.&lt;ref&gt;"Guys Reveal Best.and Worst Bathhouse Experiences," ''[[Queerty]]'', February 7, 2016, https://www.queerty.com/guys-reveal-their-best-and-worst-bathhouse-experiences-20160207.&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where homosexuality is more accepted, safety may no longer be a primary attraction.

Many bathhouses are open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. There is typically a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry to those who are visibly [[drunk|intoxicated]], as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution.

Sexual encounters at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some feel that the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse ''for''. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not.&lt;ref name=Shneer2006&gt;{{citation |year=2006 |title=American queer, now and then |editor1=David Shneer |editor2=Caryn Aviv |publisher=Paradigm Publishers |isbn=9781594511714 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lATaAAAAMAAJ |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bathhouses are still used by [[men who have sex with men]] and do not identify as gay or [[bisexuality|bisexual]], including those that are closeted or in [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] relationships.

In many bathhouses the customer has a choice between renting a room or a locker, often for fixed periods of up to 12 hours. A room typically consists of a locker and a single bed (though doubles are sometimes available) with a thin vinyl mat supported on a simple wooden box or frame, an arrangement that facilitates easy cleaning between patrons. In many bathhouses (particularly those outside the United States), some or all of the rooms are freely available to all patrons.

Some bathhouses have areas designed to facilitate impersonal sex. These areas{{spnd}}rooms or hallways{{spnd}}are illuminated only by a (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the [[Continental Baths]] in New York or the [[Club Baths]] in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]] for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.

Some men use the baths as a cheaper alternative to hotels,&lt;ref name="KLYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Best Places To Get Serviced With Zeal And Abandon |work=LA Weekly (California) |date=October 8, 2004 |author1=Ron Athey |author2=Vaginal Davis |page=39 |quote=Have you noticed that besides the deluxe safe-sex kits, every sauna we've visited has an on-site clinic for counseling and disease testing?

Bathhouses are not always identifiable as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the [[Rainbow flag (gay movement)|rainbow flag]], which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the [[gay press]] and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first [[television]] advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] in Melbourne promoted ''Wet on Wellington'', a sauna in [[Wellington Street, Collingwood|Wellington Street]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]].

In many countries, being identified in such a sauna was still viewed by the press as scandalous. In [[Ireland]] in November 1994, the ''Incognito'' sauna made mainstream press as the gay sauna where a priest had died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and two other priests were on hand to help out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Priest's body lay undetected for over two hours on floor of gay club, Medical student tried to revive curate who is thought to have had heart attack |work=Irish Times |date=November 14, 1994 |author=Alison O'Connor |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Capurro]] is known for his deliberately provocative comedy material and often refers to [[gay sex]]ual culture including gay bathhouses.&lt;ref name="Capurro"&gt;{{cite news |title=The hate issue – London's Least Wanted; We asked you to tell us which Londoners or London institutions drove you round the twist and you replied with gusto. |work=Time Out |date=February 13, 2008 |author=Nina Caplan |quote='I hate groups of drunk blokes who behave like arseholes towards women.

==Layout and typical amenities==
On being buzzed in, the customer receives a towel (to wear, around the waist) and the key for his room or locker. The customer undresses, storing his clothing in the locker provided, and is then free to wander throughout the public areas of the bathhouse, which typically include the amenities of a traditional bathhouse or [[steambath]] ([[:it:File:Il bagno turco.JPG|Picture from the movie ''Hamam'']]).

Many bathhouses also provide free [[condoms]] and [[lubricant]].&lt;ref name=KLYT/&gt; Some establishments require a piece of identification or an item of value to be left with the front desk on entry. ''Homosexualities''&lt;ref name=Bell1979&gt;{{harv|Bell|1979|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the importance of a towel: {{Quotation|Visiting a downtown gay bath was in many ways like revisiting a high-school gym – everyone wearing the same towel, in the same color, on the same part of the body. There was no status consciousness in the social-stratification sense; the towel or loincloth created a sort of equal-status social group.|a paragraph|Homosexualities, p239, 1979}}

Bathhouses are often designed with imagery and/or music to create surroundings that are arousing to the visitors.

Bathhouses are usually dimly lit and play music, although an outdoors, enclosed rooftop or pool area is not uncommon. They are often laid out in a manner that allows or encourages customers to wander throughout the establishment; a space laid out in this way is often referred to as a "maze".&lt;ref name="Woods GB"&gt;{{cite book |last=Woods |first=William J. |author2=Diane Binson |title=Gay Bathhouses and Public Health Policy |publisher=Haworth Press, {{ISBN|1560232730}} |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2MsjlZT1LcC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bathhouses have a space where random, anonymous sex is all that can occur. These spaces{{spnd}}rooms, hallways, or [[maze]]s, sometimes with [[glory hole (sexual slang)|glory holes]]{{spnd}}have as their only illumination a (dim) red "Exit" sign, so one can have sex but one cannot see with whom. Other clubs, such as the Continental Baths or the Club Baths of Washington, D.C., would have two or more bunk beds placed near each other, in a public area, thus providing a place to have sex for those who can afford only to rent a locker, and also maximizing the chances of being watched, for the [[exhibitionism|exhibitionists]] so inclined. Rooms are usually grouped together, as are lockers. Bathhouses are frequently decorated with posters of nude or semi-nude men, and sometimes explicit depictions of sex. It is not uncommon to see [[pornographic movie]]s playing on wall-mounted televisions throughout the bathhouse.

Most men typically just wear the towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, it is perfectly acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel to feel his penis, which, if well received, is the first step in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or [[Fetish clothes|fetish-wear]], but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear [[flip flops]] or [[sandals]], sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an [[Rubber band|elastic band]] which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.&lt;ref name="Reynolds GM"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Robert |author2=Gerard Sullivan |title=Gay Men's Sexual Stories: Getting It! |publisher=Haworth Press, {{ISBN|1560233192}} |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5-5kyZ94LgC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some bathhouses require customers to purchase yearly memberships and many offer special entry rates to members, students, military, or other groups.&lt;ref name="Woods GB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bedfellows PPS"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bedfellows |first=Dangerous |author2=Ephen Glenn Colter |author3=Wayne Hoffman |author4=Eva Pendleton |author5=Alison Redick |author6=David Serlin |title=Policing Public Sex: Queer Politics and the Future of AIDS Activism |publisher=South End Press Press, {{ISBN|089608549X}} |year=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FqMoLytiNlUC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, bathhouses can restrict entrance to men of certain age ranges (apart from the general requirement of being an adult) or physical types, although in other places this would be considered illegal [[discrimination]].

==Etiquette==
Customers typically divide their time between the showers/saunas/jacuzzis and the main areas of the establishment. Customers who have rented rooms have free access to their room.

Customers who have rooms may leave their room doors open to signal that they are available for sex. An open door can also be an invitation for others to watch or join in sexual activity that is already occurring.

When a room is occupied only by a single person, some men will position themselves to suggest what they might like from someone joining them in the room: those who would like to be [[anal sex|penetrated anally]] ("bottoms") will sometimes lie face down on the bed with the door open, while those who prefer to penetrate others ("tops") or to receive [[fellatio]] might lie face up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/08.29.96/gay-bath-9635.html Both Sides Now]; Richard Sine; Metro: Silicon Valley's Weekly Newspaper; August 29&amp;#160;– September 4, 1996 issue. Retrieved 4 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the baths served as community spaces for gay men. Even now, some men choose to go to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Chauncey|1995|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.

In this highly sexualized environment a look or nod is frequently enough to express interest. In darkened areas of the establishment including the mazes, video rooms, group sex areas, and the saunas or hot tubs (but not generally in the showers, toilets, hallways, gyms, café areas, and lounges), men are usually free to touch other patrons; it is expected, and often welcomed. A shake of the head, or pushing away the other's hand, means that the attention is not welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bathhouseblues.com/bathhouse_etiquette.html Bathhouse Etiquette].

Some establishments allow or encourage sex in specific group sex areas. In some jurisdictions such activity is prohibited, and sex must be confined to private rooms. Some forbid sex in pools for hygiene reasons. In the United Kingdom, the requirement is often set by the local authority's Environmental Health department{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

==High-risk behavior==

===Sexually transmitted diseases===
[[File:Pleasuredrome condoms.jpg|thumb|250px|Pleasuredrome condoms]]
From the mid-1980s onward there was lobbying against gay bathhouses blaming them for being a [[focus of infection]] encouraging the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), in particular [[HIV]], and this forced their closure in some jurisdictions (see Legal issues, below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/14/nyregion/bathhouses-reflect-aids-concerns.html |title=Bathhouses reflect AIDS concerns |work=The New York Times |date=October 14, 1985 |accessdate=26 December 2006 |last=Gross |first=Jane |quote=At the St. Marks Baths, for the price of a locker or a room, patrons now get a free condom, enclosed in a package that bears the legend ''the contents of this envelope could save your life.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Woods|Binson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, fears about the spread of STDs have prompted the closing of bathhouses{{spnd}}with their private rooms{{spnd}}in favour of [[sex club]]s, in which all sexual activity takes place in the open, and can be observed by monitors whose job it is to enforce safe-sex practices. However, proponents of bathhouses point out that closing these facilities does not prevent people from engaging in unsafe sex.&lt;ref name="Woods GB"/&gt;

Neither the claim that bathhouses are responsible for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, nor the claim that they are not, has been conclusively proved, but it is known that STDs are spread via [[unprotected sex]], and as part of their membership agreement, or as a condition of entry, some bathhouses now require customers to affirm in writing that they will only practice [[safe sex]] on the premises, and venues frequently provide free [[condom]]s, [[latex glove]]s, and [[sexual lubricant|lubrication]] (and/or have them available for purchase).&lt;ref name="Woods GB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard Sine"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sine |first=Richard |title=Both Sides Now: The South Bay's only gay bathhouse profits while promoting protected sex.

Some anti-bathhouse activists argue that these measures are not enough, especially given that it is virtually impossible to monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse; however, while they acknowledge that closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, they point out that they may be less likely to engage in anal or multipartner sex{{spnd}}both of which put participants at risk for contracting STDs{{spnd}}in such situations.&lt;ref&gt;Santana, Hedimo and Richters, Juliet: ''Sites of Sexual Activities among Men. Sex-on-premises venues in Sydney'', Monograph 5/1998, National Centre in HIV [[Social research]], Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

Others counter these claims by pointing out that bathhouses are a major source of safer sex information{{spnd}}they provide pamphlets and post safer sex posters prominently (often on the walls of each room as well as in the common areas), provide free condoms and lubricants, and often require patrons to affirm that they will only have safer sex on the premises.

===Drugs and alcohol===
In some countries bathhouses are prohibited from selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license may be required to submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do not{{spnd}}or cannot{{spnd}}regulate the consumption of drugs (typically [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[poppers]], [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], [[cocaine]], and [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]]) by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people more likely to engage in unsafe sex.&lt;ref name="Nichols MAA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nichols |first=Eve K. |title=Mobilizing Against AIDS: The Authoritative Edition from the Institute of Medicine; Academy of Sciences |publisher=Harvard University Press; {{ISBN|0674577620}} |year=1989 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-h3_h0WK6QC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex clubs with no private areas potentially find it easier to regulate consumption of drugs on their premises.

The use of [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] is also known to lead to riskier sexual behaviour, but since gay crystal meth users tend to seek out other users to engage in sexual activity, they often prefer to make such arrangements via the internet.&lt;ref name="Honigsbaum2005"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/26/aids.usa |title=Special report: West Side story: a tale of unprotected sex which could be link to new HIV superbug |work=The Observer |date=26 March 2005 |last=Honigsbaum |first=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowe2007&gt;{{cite web |title=Meth Use Among Gay Men Decreasing; Other Drug Use Holding Steady |last=Rowe |first=Aaron |date=26 July 2007 |publisher=Wired News |accessdate=22 October 2009 |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/07/meth-and-gay-se/ |quote=Researchers from the [[San Francisco]] Department of Public Health report that meth use among men who have sex with men has decreased over the past three years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution===
In some countries straight and gay bathhouses are used by [[rent boy]]s to find customers by offering massage services, the "complete service" is often used as a euphemism for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Aggleton|1999|pp=116–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Operation Soap}}
: On February 5, 1981, 150 police raided four gay bathhouses in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]: the Club Baths, the ''Romans II Health and Recreation Spa'', the ''Richmond Street Health Emporium'', and ''The Barracks''. The ''Richmond Health Emporium'' was so badly damaged in the raid that it never reopened. Nicknamed ''Operation Soap'', the raid resulted in the arrests of 268 men. There was an immediate and angry response from both the gay and lesbian community and over 3,000 people gathered in protest. A second demonstration which took place on February 20, included over 4,000 people who gathered at Queen's Park and marched to Metro Toronto Police's 52 Division.&lt;ref name="Gulliver HA"/&gt;

: In November 2004, the Crown stayed the found-in charge against the last remaining patron, saying it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the case. The case against the owners and managers of Goliath's, however, was expected to come to trial in February 2005. Terry Haldane, the only "found-in" patron who was actively fighting the charge against him, accused the Crown of dropping the charge because Haldane and his lawyers had given notice of their plan to challenge the bawdy house law all the way to [[Supreme Court of Canada|the Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=cxg/&gt;

===United States===
In [[California]] the "[[Consenting Adult Sex Bill]]", passed in January 1976, made gay bathhouses and the sex that took place within them legal for the first time. During the 1970s, the two most popular gay bathhouses in San Francisco, both located in the [[South of Market, San Francisco, California|SOMA]] neighborhood, were the ''Ritch Street Health Club'' at 330 Ritch St., the interior of which was designed like a [[Minoan palaces|Minoan palace]], and ''The Barracks'', a [[BDSM]] bathhouse at 72 Hallam near Folsom in which each room was designed to accommodate a different BDSM [[sexual fantasy]]. In 1978 a group of police officers raided the ''Liberty Baths'' in the [[Polk Gulch]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]] and arrested three patrons for "lewd conduct in a public place", but the District Attorney's office soon dropped the charges against them.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; In 1984, however, fear of [[AIDS]] caused the [[San Francisco]] [[Health department]], with the support of some gay activists such as [[Randy Shilts]], and against the opposition of other gay activists, to ask the courts to close gay bathhouses in the city. The court, under Judge Roy Wonder, instead issued a [[court order]] that limited sexual practices and disallowed renting of private rooms in bathhouses, so that sexual activity could be monitored, as a public health measure. Some of the bathhouses tried to live within the strict rules of this court order, but many of them felt they could not easily do business under the new rules and closed. Eventually, the few remaining actual bathhouses succumbed to either economic pressures or the continuing legal pressures of the city and finally closed. Several sex clubs, which were not officially bathhouses, continued to operate indefinitely and operate to this day, though following strict rules under the court order and city regulations. Bathhouses themselves, however, operate just outside the city, thus outside of their laws, such as in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

In 1985, the [[New York City]] Health Department ordered that the city's gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, heterosexual sex clubs such as [[Plato's Retreat]] had to shut down as well because the city had just passed a [[gay rights]] ordinance, and allowing the heterosexual clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments would have been a violation of that ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wmob.com/artpages/platos1.html |title=Swinging doors shut: City probe KO's Plato's |work=Daily News |accessdate=8 November 2007 |last=Golubski |first=Suzanne |last2=Kappstatter |first2=Bob |location=New York |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043031/http://www.wmob.com/artpages/platos1.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2010 ten patrons and one employee were arrested during a [[police raid]] at Club Dallas in [[Texas]].  The patrons were charged with either [[public lewdness]] or [[indecent exposure]] while the employee was charged with interfering with the police. The [[Dallas Police Department]]'s liaison to the gay community stated that their actions were in response to a complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dallasvoice.com/11-arrested-raid-club-dallas-1048387.html|title=11 arrested in raid at Club Dallas|language=en-us|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer [[Bette Midler]] is well known for getting her start at the famous Continental Baths in New York City in the early 1970s, where she earned the nickname Bathhouse Betty. It was there, accompanied by pianist [[Barry Manilow]] (who, like the bathhouse patrons, sometimes wore only a white towel&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''The History of Gay Bathhouses.'' Online. Retrieved February 23, 2004. Available: {{cite web|url=http://www.gaytubs.com/ahistory.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 23, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020010356/http://gaytubs.com/ahistory.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=October 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), that she created her stage persona "the Divine Miss M."

On getting her start in bathhouses, Midler has remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I'm still proud of those days [when I got my start singing at the gay bathhouses]. I feel like I was at the forefront of the [[Gay Liberation|gay liberation movement]], and I hope I did my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.houstonvoice.com |title=Bette Midler |work=Houston Voice |date=October 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Turtle entangled in marine debris (ghost net).jpg|thumb|300px|A sea turtle entangled in a ghost net.]]

'''Ghost nets''' are [[fishing net]]s that have been [[marine debris|left or lost in the ocean]] by fishermen. These nets, often nearly invisible in the dim light, can be left tangled on a rocky reef or drifting in the open sea. They can [[Plastic_pollution#Entanglement|entangle]] [[fish]], [[dolphin]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, [[shark]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[seabird]]s, [[crab]]s, and other creatures, including the occasional human diver.&lt;ref&gt;Esteban, Michelle (2002) [http://www.eurocbc.org/page54.html ''Tracking Down Ghost Nets'']&lt;/ref&gt; Acting as designed, the nets restrict movement, causing starvation, laceration and infection, and suffocation in those that need to return to the surface to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6248366.stm |title='Ghost fishing' killing seabirds |accessdate=2008-04-01 |date=28 June 2007 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Marine organisms entangled in a ghost net within the Maldives (Olive Ridley Project).jpg|thumb|300px|Many marine species including [[turtles]], [[sharks]], [[whales]], [[dolphins]], [[dugong]]s become entangled in ghost nets. Most go unnoticed and unrecorded.]]
[[File:Starbuck AKK FishnetFloat.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[glass float]] on the beach. Many of these floats for fish nets wash up on island beaches around the Pacific. The loss of the floats can leave fish nets drifting in the open ocean where they continue to entangle fish, birds, and marine mammals.]]

Some commercial fisherman use [[gillnet]]s. These are suspended in the sea by flotation [[buoy]]s, such as [[glass float]]s, along one edge. In this way they can form a vertical wall hundreds of metres long, where any fish within a certain size range can be caught. Normally these nets are collected by fishermen and the catch removed. 

If this is not done, the net can continue to catch fish until the weight of the catch exceeds the buoyancy of the floats. The net then sinks, and the fish are devoured by bottom-dwelling crustaceans and other fish. Then the floats pull the net up again and the cycle continues. Given the high-quality synthetics that are used today, the destruction can continue for a long time.

The problem is not just nets but '''ghost gear''' in general;&lt;ref name=guard1&gt;Hannah Gould, [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/sep/10/fishing-industry-vows-to-tackle-wildlife-deaths-from-ghost-gear Hidden problem of 'ghost gear': the abandoned fishing nets clogging up oceans], ''Theguardian.com'', 10 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; old-fashioned [[crab trap]]s, without the required "rot-out panel", also sit on the bottom, where they become self-baiting traps that go on catching crabs year after year. Even balled-up [[fishing line]] can be deadly for a variety of creatures, including birds and marine mammals. Over time the nets become more and more tangled. In general, fish are less likely to be trapped in gear that has been down a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Dunagan, Christopher (2000)[[The Sun (Lowell)|''The Sun'']]. [http://web.kitsapsun.com/news/2000/may/0504pugetsoundwa.html The net effect: trouble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404001020/http://web.kitsapsun.com/news/2000/may/0504pugetsoundwa.html |date=2009-04-04 }}, 5 April&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishermen sometimes abandon worn-out nets because it is often the easiest way to get rid of them.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

The French government offered a reward for ghost nets handed in to local coastguards along sections of the Normandy coast between 1980 and 1981. The project was abandoned when people vandalized nets to claim rewards, without retrieving anything at all from the shoreline or ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Andres, Von Brandt (1984) ''Fish catching methods of the world'' {{ISBN|978-0-685-63409-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, the Global Ghost Gear Initiative (GGGI) was created by the [[World Animal Protection]] to give a unique and stronger voice to the cause.

The term ALDFG means "abandoned or lost or discarded fishing gear".

==Environmental impact==
From 2000 to 2012, the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] reported an average of 11 large [[whales]] entangled in ghost nets every year along the US west coast. From 2002 to 2010, 870 nets were recovered in [[Washington (state)]] with over 32,000 marine animals trapped inside. Ghost gear is estimated to account for 10% of all [[marine litter]].&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

According to the SeaDoc Society, each ghost net kills $20,000 worth of [[Dungeness crab]] over 10 years. The [[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]] calculated that ghost crab pots capture 1.25 million [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]]s each year in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] alone.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

In May 2016, the [[Australian Fisheries Management Authority]] (AFMA) recovered 10 tonnes of abandoned nets within the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone and [[Torres Strait]] protected zone perimeters. One protected turtle was rescued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afma.gov.au/ghost-net-busters/ Ghost net busters], ''Afma.gov.au'', 3 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Unlike synthetic fishing nets, [[biodegradable]] fishing nets decompose naturally under water after a certain period of time. Coconut fibre ([[coir]]) fishing nets are commercially made and are hence a practical solution that can be taken by fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2016-02-biodegradable-fishing-nets-marine-animals.html Biodegradable fishing nets: advantages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/economic/futurefibres/fibres/coir/en/ Coir fishing nets]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company Net-works worked out a solution to turn discarded fishing nets into carpet tiles.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Beavis,[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/30/net-works-is-net-gain-for-poor-coastal-community Net-Works is net gain for poor coastal community], ''Theguardian.com'', 30 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the US Fishing for Energy initiative collected 2.8 million pounds of fishing gear, and in partnership with [[Covanta Energy]] turned this into enough electricity to power 182 homes for one year by incineration.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NOAA, [https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/prevention/fishing-energy Fishing for Energy]. Accessed July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan to protect UK seas from ghost fishing was backed by the [http://conservativeeurope.com/news/meps-back-plan-to-end-ghost-fishing European Parliament] Fisheries Committee in 2018. Mr Flack, who led the committee, said: "Abandoned fishing nets are polluting our seas, wasting fishing stocks and indiscriminately killing whales, sea lions or even dolphins. The tragedy of ghost fishing must end.&lt;ref&gt;MEPs back plan to end ‘ghost fishing', [http://conservativeeurope.com/news/meps-back-plan-to-end-ghost-fishing]. 20 June, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], the '''Gorgoneion''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γοργόνειον) was a special [[apotropaic]]  [[amulet]] showing the [[Gorgon]] head, used most famously by the [[Olympian gods|Olympian deities]] [[Athena]] and [[Zeus]]: both are said to have worn the gorgoneion as a protective [[pendant]].&lt;ref name="Vassilika"&gt;{{harvnb|Vassilika|1998|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was assumed, among other godlike attributes, as a royal [[aegis]] to imply divine birth or protection, by rulers of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic age]], as shown, for instance, on the [[Alexander Mosaic]] and the [[Gonzaga Cameo]].

==Origin==
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], gorgoneia represent certain aspects of the [[Mother Goddess]] cult associated with "dynamic life energy" and asserts that the images may be related to a cultural continuity persisting since Neolithic examples. She defined the gorgoneion as a quintessentially European image. [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks in order to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at the owner: "The ritual object comes first; then the monster is begotten to account for it; then the hero is supplied to account for the slaying of the monster".&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=187–188}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[Homer]] refers to the Gorgon on four occasions, each time alluding to the head alone, as if she had no body.&lt;ref name="Potts"&gt;{{harvnb|Potts|1982|pp=26–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] notes that "Medusa is a head and nothing more... a [[mask]] with a body later appended".&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; Prior to the fifth century BC, she was depicted as particularly ugly, with a protruding tongue, [[boar]] [[tusk]]s, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring fixedly on the viewer and the snakes twisting all around her.

The direct frontal stare, "seemingly looking out from its own iconographical context and directly challenging the viewer",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ogden|2008|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. (''But see'' the common depiction of the [[Evil_eye#Greece|evil eye]] on 6th century drinking vessels, and particularly, [[eye-cup]]s, which, like Gorgoneia, are assumed apotropaics.) In some instances what sometimes appears as a beard (probably standing for stylized hair or streaks of blood however) was appended to her chin, making her appear as an [[Dionysian Mysteries|orgiastic deity]] akin to [[Dionysus]].

Gorgoneia that decorate the shields of warriors on mid-fifth century Greek vases are considerably less grotesque and menacing. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; The [[Hellenistic]] marble known as the [[Medusa Rondanini]] illustrates the Gorgon's eventual transformation into a beautiful woman.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:OlympiaGorgo retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Winged Gorgoneion (Olympia B 110)|Winged Gorgoneion]] from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], originally an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] shield decoration, early sixth century BC]]
[[File:Gorgoneion Cdm Paris 320.jpg|thumb|Gorgoneion on the Tondo of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Black-figure pottery|black-figured]] cup, end of sixth century BC - Cabinet des médailles de la Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris, France.]]
Gorgoneia appear frequently in Greek art at the turn of the eighth century BC. One of the earliest representations is on an [[electrum]] [[stater]] discovered during excavations at [[Parium]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; Other early eighth-century examples were found at [[Tiryns]]. Going further back into history, there is a similar image from the [[Knossos]] palace, datable to the fifteenth century BC. [[Marija Gimbutas]] even argues that "the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the [[Sesklo culture]] illustrates",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gimbutas|2001|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in her book, ''Language of the Goddess'', she also identifies the prototype of the Gorgoneion in [[Neolithic]] art motifs, especially in [[anthropomorphic]] vases and [[terracotta]] masks inlaid with gold.

In the sixth century, gorgoneia of a canonical "lion mask type" were ubiquitous on Greek temples, especially in and around [[Corinth]]. [[Pediment]]al gorgoneia were common in [[Sicily]]; probably the earliest occurrence being in the [[Temple of Apollo (Syracuse)|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref name="Marconi"&gt;{{harvnb|Marconi|2007|pp=214–217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 500 BC, they ceased to be used for the decoration of monumental buildings, but were still shown on [[antefix]]es of smaller structures throughout the next century.&lt;ref name="Marconi"/&gt;

Apart from temples, the Gorgon imagery is present on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins found across the Mediterranean region from [[Etruria]] to the [[Black Sea]] coast. The Gorgon coins were struck in 37 cities, making her image on coins second in [[numismatics|numismatic ubiquity]] only to several principal [[Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; On [[mosaic]] floors, the gorgoneion usually was depicted next to the threshold, as if guarding it from hostile intruders. On [[Attica|Attic]] kilns, the gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from mishaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=189, figs. 27–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gorgon imagery remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the [[Byzantine Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsches Archäologisches Institut|1991|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Kievan Rus]], and was revived in the West by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artists.

More recently, the gorgoneion was adopted by [[Gianni Versace]] as a logo for his fashion company.

==By ideological classification (historiography)==
Although there is arguably some intrinsic [[bias]] in history studies (with [[nationalism|national]] bias perhaps being the most significant), history can also be studied from [[ideology|ideological]] perspectives, which practitioners feel are often ignored, such as:
*[[Marxist historiography]]
*[[Feminist history]] (also called ''herstory'').

A form of historical speculation known commonly as [[counterfactual history]] has also been adopted by some historians as a means of assessing and exploring the possible outcomes if certain events had not occurred or had occurred in a different way. This is somewhat similar to the [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] genre in fiction.

Lists of false or dubious historical resources and [[historical myths]] that were once popular and widespread, or have become so, have also been prepared.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4090">'''Material religion''' is a framework used by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]] examining the interaction between [[religion]] and [[material culture]]. Its specific focus is on the place of objects, images, spaces, and buildings in religious communities.

Some scholars within the study of religion have criticised the material religion approach for often seeking to reintroduce the [[phenomenology of religion]] into the discipline.

==Definition==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Religion, being a prime human activity throughout history, is rooted in the body and in its sensual relations with the world. It always has been and always will be. We can make sense out of the senses. This is the first true thing we can say about religion, because it is also the first true thing we can say about being human. We are sentient beings, and religion is sensuous.|source=— Scholar of religion S. Brent Plate, 2014{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=7}} }}

The scholar of religion S. Brent Plate was of the view that "religion must be understood as deriving from rudimentary human experiences, from lived, embodied practices".{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=15}} He stated that "to learn about religion we have to come to our senses. Literally. We have to begin to discover... that we cannot know the worlds of any other culture, let alone our own, unless we get inside the sensational operations of human bodies."{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=8}}

==History==

The material religion framework has been promoted by the scholars such as Birgit Meyer, Sally Promey, S. Brent Plate, David Morgan, etc.

In 2005, the peer-reviewed journal ''Material Religion: The Journal of Objects, Art and Belief'' was launched. In their editorial statement, the editors described it as "a new project in the study of religious images, objects, spaces, and material practices."{{sfn|Editors|2005|p=5}}

==Criticism==
The anthropologist [[Simon Coleman (anthropologist)|Simon Coleman]] suggested that the term "material religion" was [[tautology (grammar)|tautological]], in that "religion is inherently material in its very constitution."{{sfn|Coleman|2009|p=360}}

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson suggested that the material religion framework could be an alternative means to explore religion, in contrast to the dominant [[world religions]] paradigm which they regarded as problematic.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016|pp=12–13}} They nevertheless thought that material religion represented "phenomenology by stealth".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016|p=13}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19537">'''Mathematical finance''', also known as '''quantitative finance''', is a field of [[applied mathematics]], concerned with mathematical modeling of [[financial market]]s. Generally, mathematical finance will derive and extend the [[Mathematical model|mathematical]] or [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] models without necessarily establishing a link to financial theory, taking observed market prices as input. Mathematical consistency is required, not compatibility with economic theory. Thus, for example, while a [[financial economist]] might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain [[share price]], a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given, and attempt to use [[stochastic calculus]] to obtain the corresponding value of [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]]s of the [[stock]] (''see: [[Valuation of options]]; [[Financial modeling#Quantitative finance|Financial modeling]]; [[Asset pricing]]''). The [[fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing]] is one of the key theorems in mathematical finance, while the [[Black–Scholes]] equation and formula are amongst the key results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Tim|title=What is financial mathematics?|url=http://plus.maths.org/content/what-financial-mathematics|publisher=+Plus Magazine|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical finance also overlaps heavily with the fields of [[computational finance]] and [[financial engineering]]. The latter focuses on applications and modeling, often by help of [[stochastic asset model]]s (''see: [[Quantitative analyst]]''), while the former focuses, in addition to analysis, on building tools of implementation for the models. In general, there exist two separate branches of finance that require advanced quantitative techniques: derivatives pricing on the one hand, and [[risk management|risk-]] and [[Investment management#Investment managers and portfolio structures|portfolio management]] on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantitative Finance|url=http://finance.laws.com/quantitative-finance|publisher=About.com|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French mathematician [[Louis Bachelier]] is considered the author of the first scholarly work on mathematical finance, published in 1900. But mathematical finance emerged as a discipline in the 1970s, following the work of [[Fischer Black]], [[Myron Scholes]] and [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]] on option pricing theory.

Today many universities offer degree and research programs in mathematical finance.

==History: Q versus P==
There are two separate branches of finance that require advanced quantitative techniques: derivatives pricing, and risk and portfolio management. One of the main differences is that they use different probabilities, namely the risk-neutral probability (or arbitrage-pricing probability), denoted by "Q", and the actual (or actuarial) probability, denoted by "P".

The goal of derivatives pricing is to determine the fair price of a given security in terms of more [[market liquidity|liquid securities]] whose price is determined by the law of [[supply and demand]]. The meaning of "fair" depends, of course, on whether one considers buying or selling the security. Examples of securities being priced are [[option (finance)|plain vanilla]] and [[exotic options]], [[convertible bonds]], etc.

Once a fair price has been determined, the sell-side trader can make a market on the security. Therefore, derivatives pricing is a complex "extrapolation" exercise to define the current market value of a security, which is then used by the sell-side community. 
Quantitative derivatives pricing was initiated by [[Louis Bachelier]] in ''The Theory of Speculation'' ("Théorie de la spéculation", published 1900), with the introduction of the most basic and most influential of processes, the [[Brownian motion]], and its applications to the pricing of options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53289874|title=Stochastic calculus for finance|last=E.|first=Shreve, Steven|date=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780387401003|location=New York|oclc=53289874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868286679|title=Introduction to Quantitative Finance.|last=Stephen.|first=Blyth,|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=|isbn=9780199666591|location=|pages=157|oclc=868286679}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brownian motion is derived using the [[Langevin equation]] and the discrete [[random walk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57743436|title=Quantitative finance for physicists : an introduction|last=B.|first=Schmidt, Anatoly|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|isbn=9780080492209|location=San Diego, Calif.|oclc=57743436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelier modeled the [[time series]] of changes in the [[logarithm]] of stock prices as a [[random walk]] in which the short-term changes had a finite [[variance]]. This causes longer-term changes to follow a [[Gaussian distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bachelir|first=Louis|title=The Theory of Speculation|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5LLDy7-d3SKNGI0M2E0NGItYzFlMS00NGU2LWE2ZDAtODc3MDY3MzdiNmY0/edit?hl=en_GB&amp;pli=1|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory remained dormant until [[Fischer Black]] and [[Myron Scholes]], along with fundamental contributions by [[Robert C. Merton]], applied the second most influential process, the [[geometric Brownian motion]], to [[option pricing]]. For this M. Scholes and R. Merton were awarded the 1997 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. Black was ineligible for the prize because of his death in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindbeck|first=Assar|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1969-2007|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/economic-sciences/lindbeck/index.html|publisher=Nobel Prize|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next important step was the [[fundamental theorem of asset pricing]] by Harrison and Pliska (1981), according to which the suitably normalized current price ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a security is arbitrage-free, and thus truly fair, only if there exists a [[stochastic process]] ''P&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' with constant [[expected value]] which describes its future evolution:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Angus|title=A risky business: How to price derivatives|url=http://plus.maths.org/content/risky-business-how-price-derivatives|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=Price+ Magazine|date=1 Dec 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P_{0} = \mathbf{E}_{0} (P_{t}) &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}} }}
A process satisfying ({{EquationNote|1}}) is called a "martingale". A martingale does not reward risk. Thus the probability of the normalized security price process is called "risk-neutral" and is typically denoted by the [[Blackboard bold|blackboard font]] letter "&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;".

The relationship ({{EquationNote|1}}) must hold for all times t: therefore the processes used for derivatives pricing are naturally set in continuous time.

The [[Quantitative analyst|quants]] who operate in the Q world of derivatives pricing are specialists with deep knowledge of the specific products they model.

Securities are priced individually, and thus the problems in the Q world are low-dimensional in nature.
Calibration is one of the main challenges of the Q world: once a continuous-time parametric process has been calibrated to a set of traded securities through a relationship such as (1), a similar relationship is used to define the price of new derivatives.

The main quantitative tools necessary to handle continuous-time Q-processes are [[Itō calculus|Itō’s stochastic calculus]], [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|simulation]] and [[partial differential equations]] (PDE’s).

Risk and portfolio management aims at modeling the statistically derived probability distribution of the market prices of all the securities at a given future investment horizon. &lt;br /&gt;
This "real" probability distribution of the market prices is typically denoted by the blackboard font letter "&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt;", as opposed to the "risk-neutral" probability "&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;" used in derivatives pricing. Based on the P distribution, the buy-side community takes decisions on which securities to purchase in order to improve the prospective profit-and-loss profile of their positions considered as a portfolio.

For their pioneering work, Markowitz and Sharpe, along with Merton Miller, shared the 1990 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], for the first time ever awarded for a work in finance.

The portfolio-selection work of Markowitz and Sharpe introduced mathematics to [[investment management]]. With time, the mathematics has become more sophisticated. Thanks to Robert Merton and Paul Samuelson, one-period models were replaced by continuous time, [[Brownian Model of Financial Markets|Brownian-motion models]], and the quadratic utility function implicit in mean–variance optimization was replaced by more general increasing, concave utility functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karatzas|first1=Ioannis|last2=Shreve|first2=Steve|title=Methods of Mathematical Finance|location=Secaucus, NJ, USA|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, Incorporated|year=1998|isbn=9780387948393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in more recent years the focus shifted toward estimation risk, i.e., the dangers of incorrectly assuming that advanced time series analysis alone can provide completely accurate estimates of the market parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meucci|first1=Attilio|title=Risk and Asset Allocation|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9783642009648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much effort has gone into the study of financial markets and how prices vary with time. [[Charles Dow]], one of the founders of [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] and [[The Wall Street Journal]], enunciated a set of ideas on the subject which are now called [[Dow Theory]]. This is the basis of the so-called [[technical analysis]] method of attempting to predict future changes. One of the tenets of "technical analysis" is that [[market trends]] give an indication of the future, at least in the short term. The claims of the technical analysts are disputed by many academics.

Over the years, increasingly sophisticated mathematical models and derivative pricing strategies have been developed, but their credibility was damaged by the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]].
Contemporary practice of mathematical finance has been subjected to criticism from figures within the field notably by [[Paul Wilmott]], and by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], in his book [[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|''The Black Swan'']].&lt;ref name="Black Swan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taleb|first1=Nassim Nicholas|authorlink=Nassim Nicholas Taleb|year=2007|title=The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable|publisher=Random House Trade|isbn=978-1-4000-6351-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb claims that the prices of financial assets cannot be characterized by the simple models currently in use, rendering much of current practice at best irrelevant, and, at worst, dangerously misleading. Wilmott and [[Emanuel Derman]] published the ''[[Financial Modelers' Manifesto]]'' in January 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2009/1/8/Financial-Modelers-Manifesto|publisher=Paul Wilmott's Blog|title=Financial Modelers' Manifesto|date=January 8, 2009|accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which addresses some of the most serious concerns.
Bodies such as the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]] are now attempting to develop new theories and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cfb9c43a-48b7-11df-8af4-00144feab49a.html |title=Mathematicians must get out of their ivory towers |author=Gillian Tett |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, modeling the changes by distributions with finite variance is, increasingly, said to be inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Svetlozar T. Rachev|author2=[[Frank J. Fabozzi]]|author3=Christian Menn|year=2005|title=Fat-Tailed and Skewed Asset Return Distributions: Implications for Risk Management, Portfolio Selection, and Option Pricing |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |isbn=978-0471718864 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s it was discovered by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] that changes in prices do not follow a [[Gaussian distribution]], but are rather modeled better by Lévy alpha-[[stable distribution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benoit Mandelbrot|B. Mandelbrot]], [http://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/341Fa09/econ/Mandelbroit_VariationCertainSpeculativePrices.pdf "The variation of certain Speculative Prices"], ''The Journal of Business'' 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of change, or volatility, depends on the length of the time interval to a [[power law|power]] a bit more than 1/2. Large changes up or down are more likely than what one would calculate using a Gaussian distribution with an estimated [[standard deviation]]. But the problem is that it does not solve the problem as it makes parametrization much harder and risk control less reliable.&lt;ref name="Black Swan" /&gt; See also [[Variance gamma process #Option pricing]].

'''Mitigated speech''' is a [[linguistic]] term describing deferential or indirect speech inherent in communication between individuals of perceived [[Geert Hofstede|High Power Distance]] which has been in use for at least two decades with many published references.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Sik H. and Bradac, James J. : ''Power in Language: Verbal Communication and Social Influence (Language and Language Behavior)''  Sage Publications, Inc (May 25, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, William Peter and Tajfel, Henri: [https://books.google.com/books?id=toHSl37qbfMC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=Ng++Bradac+Power+in+Language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o27ICSXtLK&amp;sig=tHbmqXj0s68-p-ye1JD9ereSDjs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gZTQSdGMCs6dkAXf9-jZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA193,M1 Social Groups and Identities] Routledge (1996) Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasper, Gabriele and Blum-Kulka, Shoshana: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QAsbd2oi7LMC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22mitigated+speech%22+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UbqYXTVmQU&amp;sig=VrYIEFLQ8TkAo9UnsZS70QHJKRA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7pPQScSEJ4iMkAWllOTjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result" Interlanguage Pragmatics] Oxford (1993). Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Hare, D., and Roscoe, S. ''Flightdeck performance - the human factor''. Ames: Iowa State University Press (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was popularized by  [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in his book, ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'', where he defines mitigated speech as "any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said".&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm: ''Outliers: The Story of Success'', Penguin (2008) p.194&lt;/ref&gt; He continues with reference to Fischer and Orasanu,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Ute and Orasanu, Judith: ''Cultural Diversity and Crew Communication'', paper presented at Astronautical Congress, Amsterdam; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe 6 degrees of mitigation with which we make suggestions to authority: 

# '''Command''' – "Strategy X is going to be implemented" 
# '''Team Obligation Statement'''  – "We need to try strategy X" 
# '''Team Suggestion''' – "Why don't we try strategy X?" 
# '''Query''' – "Do you think strategy X would help us in this situation?" 
# '''Preference''' – "Perhaps we should take a look at one of these Y alternatives" 
# '''Hint''' – "I wonder if we could run into any roadblocks on our current course" 

Gladwell brings up the concept in the context of how crews relate to each other in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, graphically illustrating the degree to which mitigated speech can be detrimental in high-risk situations which require clear communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2550">'''Online land planning''' is a collaborative process in which [[sustainable development]] practices and design professionals from across the world are networked to provide advice and solutions on [[urban design]] and [[land planning]] issues. The target audience includes property owners, communities, businesses and government agencies that have limited access, time, finances or personnel to make informed decisions about [[land use]]. In many cases, this approach provides [[electronic documents]] that become the catalyst to rebuild after natural or man-made spur [[rural community development]] and stimulate or create a new [[microeconomy]].

==Importance of technology==
One goal of online land planning is the effective use of the internet to support information sharing and decision making from remote locations such as the home. The use of the Internet, coupled with software technology such as [[geographic information systems]] (GIS), allows municipalities and other public and private organizations to compile base information, exchange information, present solutions to land planning issues, and receive feedback vis the internet. Benefits for land development companies and real estate industry organizations like the Urban Land Institute [http://www.uli.org] include easier access to efficient digital planning technologies, along with the opportunity for immediate participation and feedback.

Worldwide, local and regional governments have created their own websites with access to map-centric and entreprise GIS databases that provide operational and public-service resources.

'''''Paintings of Abanindranath Tagore''''' is a book on [[Abanindranath Tagore]]'s paintings by art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]].&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9788189323097|title=Amazon.com: Paintings Of Abanindranath Tagore: R. Siva Kumar: Books|publisher=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered as a landmark book in the Indian art scene that brings together a large corpus of [[Abanindranath]]'s work for the first time. It fulfils a glaring lacuna in the picture of this master of modern Indian art.

In the books [[R. Siva Kumar]] states, 'The social space that Abanindranath narrativized as an artist-flaneur is thus the subject of the Orientalist artist/writer read from the obverse. He reclaims the colonial subjects' right to narrate their stories that was arrogated to themselves by the colonial rulers and perpetuated by presenting their readings as 'objective'. Abanindranath reasserts this right by recasting the Nights ([[Arabian Nights]]), a text central to the Orientalist representation of the East, by urging us to read his act of imagination contrapuntally with the text authenticated by the Orientalist.'&lt;ref name="artnewsnviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnewsnviews.com/view-article.php?article=abanindranath-tagore-a-reappraisal-&amp;iid=22&amp;articleid=556|title=Abanindranath Tagore: a reappraisal|publisher=artnewsnviews.com|accessdate=2014-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951) is a singular figure in [[Modern Indian painting|Modern Indian Art]]. Having arrived on the [[Indian art]] scene with the first wave of nationalism, he was seen as father figure of nationalist art and modernism. Along with [[E. B. Havell]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy|Coomaraswamy]], [[Sister Nivedita]] and other nationalists he brought an attitudinal change in the Indian response to traditional art. But his true contribution went beyond these. Trained under European artists initially, realism remained the underpinning of his work. But as a modernist at heart who was guided more by his sensibility than his training, he transformed the post Renaissance academic realism into which he was trained with his series of contacts with oriental art into something more supple and responsive to the imaginative flights of his mind. A post-Romantic in his sensibilities, he let his individualism triumph over his nationalism. Although he aligned with the nationalists in the early years of his career he transcended it very soon to develop something more akin to a [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelairian]] aesthetics of modernism with a subjective response to the world rather than an unmediated representation of things. His most impressive work, the Arabian Nights series painted in 1930, can be described as a look at his immediate world through the eyes of a [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelarian]] [[Flâneur|Flaneur]], with the stories of the Arabian Nights serving as a pre-text. Equally original as a writer, [[Abanindranath]] is a phenomenon whose import has not been fully grasped. Much of this has been due to the unfamiliarity with his work in the absence of easily accessible public collections and publications. The present book brings together a large body of his work for the first time in an attempt to fulfill a glaring lacuna in our picture of this early master of modern Indian art.&lt;ref name="pratikshanbooks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pratikshanbooks.com/booksonart/index.html|title=Pratikshan :: Books in Books On Art|publisher=pratikshanbooks.com|accessdate=2014-12-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302123621/http://www.pratikshanbooks.com/booksonart/index.html|archivedate=2014-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=August 2012}}

'''Philosophical theology''' is both a branch and form of [[theology]] in which [[philosophy|philosophical]] methods are used in developing or analyzing theological concepts. It therefore includes [[natural theology]] as well as philosophical treatments of [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] and [[heterodox]] theology. Philosophical theology is also closely related to the [[philosophy of religion]].

== Definitions ==
[[Mortimer J. Adler]] distinguishes philosophical theology from [[natural theology]]. While the former is, according to him, theology done by non-Christian philosophers, the latter is done by those who are already Christians and are actually trying to find rational proofs for their faith.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, "A Philosopher's Religious Faith," in Kelly J. Clark (ed), ''Philosophers Who Believe'' (Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 1993), 205-207&lt;/ref&gt; Adler thinks that the term "natural theology" is a misnomer and is actually apologetics, and cites as an example Thomas Aquinas' ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', addressed to the Jews and Moors in Spain, which though written as if it were philosophical theology, was in fact, apologetics and not philosophical theology, as it was written by a Christian and not by a pagan. In Adler's view, few if any of the books on natural theology, are sound as works in philosophical theology, because they are not written by pagans.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, "A Philosopher's Religious Faith," in Kelly J. Clark (ed), ''Philosophers Who Believe'', 207&lt;/ref&gt; An example of philosophical theology, according to Adler, is Aristotle's theology as found in his ''Metaphysics.''&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, "A Philosopher's Religious Faith," in Kelly J. Clark (ed), ''Philosophers Who Believe'', 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Adler's view, Charles Taliaferro and Chad Meister think that doing philosophical theology may not be restricted by whether the doer is an insider to faith or not, for anyone doing philosophical theology only tries to consider whether a theological doctrine can make philosophical sense or not.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taliaferro and Chad Meister, ''Contemporary Philosophical Theology'' (Routledge, 2016) {{ISBN|9781317294429}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, as Adler points it out, a pagan doing philosophical theology and coming to a theological conclusion has a different route than an insider using philosophy to examine or seek to understand his faith.

== Philosophy and theology ==
The relationship between theology and philosophy has been long-debated and discussed with the [[Christian tradition]]. [[Tertullian]], an influential early Christian theologian and apologist, believed that philosophy has little to do with theology, arguing that the use of philosophy often corrupted theology, leading to unorthodox beliefs that were not grounded in the early Christian tradition. He famously asked the question 'What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?'. ([[Athens]] symbolized the philosophical approach because of its role as a leading center of [[Hellenistic philosophy]], while [[Jerusalem]] represented Christianity because of its role as an important location and intellectual centre in the [[early church]].) Other leaders, however, saw a closer relationship between philosophy and theology. [[Justin Martyr]] looked at people like [[Heraclitus]] and [[Socrates]] as possessing the divine light of revelation and believed them to be true philosophers. Justin saw Christianity as the True Philosophy and argued for Christianity using philosophical methods and terminology. [[St. Augustine]], who became one of the most influential theologians in history and whose works laid the foundation for much of Western philosophy (as well as much of Western theology), espoused a more middle-of-the-road, moderate approach, arguing that philosophy and theology often complement each other while at the same time cautioning that philosophy should not always be used in theological discourse. Instead, he argued, one should make sure that a philosophical approach toward a particular issue was grounded in prior Christian commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/christiantheology-philosophy/|title= Philosophy and Christian Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The disciplines of Philosophy and Theology have often been connected, with theologians and philosophers interacting and debating similar and sometimes overlapping issues. Philosophy played a key role in the formation of Western theology. [[Thomas Aquinas]], one of the most influential philosophers and theologians in history, for instance, borrowed much of his concepts from [[Aristotle]]. [[Scholasticism]] dominated both the philosophical and theological landscape in the [[Middle Ages]], with theologians such as Aquinas, [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Peter Abelard]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Albertus Magnus]] playing key role in both philosophy and theology.

In modern times, [[Anthony Thiselton]] has shown in his ''Fusion of Horizons'' the role that philosophy has played in the interpretation of scriptures, i.e., in the field of [[hermeneutics]]. Philosophy provides interpretive grids for apprehension of revelation. There are others, like [[Sadhu Sundar Singh]], for instance, who believed that it is the illumination of the [[Holy Spirit]] that gives the truest meaning of revelation. Yet, one can't fail to see that cultural grids play an important role in the development of theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/christiantheology-philosophy/|title= Philosophy and Christian Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contemporary philosophers continue to write and argue from a Christian perspective, with Christian concepts undergirding their philosophical work. In recent decades some of the most well-known philosophers who have written from a Christian perspective are [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[William Lane Craig]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[Paul Tillich]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Richard Swinburne]], and [[James K. A. Smith]].

==Foundations of modern philosophical theology==
During the 18th, 19th centuries, and 20th centuries many theologians reacted against the [[modernism|modernist]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and [[logical positivism|positivist]] attacks on [[Christian theology]]. Some [[Christian existentialism|existentialistic]] or [[neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] intellectuals like the [[Swiss Reformed Church|Swiss Reformed]] theologian [[Karl Barth]] turned away from philosophy (called [[fideism]]) and argued that faith should be based strictly upon divine revelation. A popular approach in some circles is the approach of [[Reformed epistemology|Reformed epistemologists]], such as [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]], who assert that belief in God might be [[foundationalism|foundational]] (or, properly [[basic belief|'basic']]) and warranted without the need for logical or evidential justification, like belief in [[problem of other minds|other minds]] or the [[philosophical skepticism|external world]], rather than inferentially derived from other beliefs; it can, however, be subject to [[defeater]]s, rationally requiring that one give up the belief. Many other philosophers and theologians, however, disagree with this perspective and provide alternative views. Many other theologians have turned to [[continental philosophy]], [[analytic philosophy]], and [[postmodern philosophy]] in attempts to analyze and reframe the Christian theology in contemporary contexts.

== Philosophical theology ==
While philosophical theology can denote an approach to theology which is philosophical in nature, it can also denote a specific area of theology in which philosophical methods and terminology are used to analyze theological concepts. One task of philosophical theologians is to attempt to reconcile certain aspects of Christian doctrine with developments in philosophy. One question concerns how to prove the existence and nature of God. The knowledge of God is dealt with in the [[epistemology]] of [[religion]]. There are many different perspectives with philosophical theology on such questions. In modern times [[process theology]], [[open theism]] and [[Panentheism#Panentheism in Christianity|Christian panentheism]] have tried to look at God as the Being who is not only the Source and Ground of all being but also influenced by the people and processes of the world which he created and to which he belongs—rejecting or at least amending the classical medieval doctrine of [[impassibility]].

== Christology ==
Within [[Christology]], a number of philosophical questions have been raised, such as how the divine can incarnate as a human, how the eternal can enter the temporal, and how the divine and the human can be united in one yet remain distinct. Such questions led to earlier [[heresies]] like [[Arianism]], [[Sabellianism]], [[Docetism]], etc. Often, one's [[Epistemology|epistemic theory]] can play an important role in how one answers such questions. There is, for instance, sometimes a clash between those who want to emphasize the [[rational]] foundation for theology and those who want to emphasize the [[empirical]] foundation for theology. There has also been a contrast made between Christology from above and Christology from below. The former emphasizes the divine side of [[Christ]]; the latter, the human side. The human side obviously tends to look at it more empirically. The Scriptures call the Incarnation as a mystery of godliness.&lt;ref&gt;1 Tim. 3: 16.&lt;/ref&gt; It baffles human imagination, leading many to call it a divine mystery. Yet, philosophical theologians argue that it is also important to find a philosophical ground for asserting both the divinity and humanity of Christ. Others theologians, however, like [[Rudolph Bultmann]], ventured to remove any myths from the Bible, a hermeneutical approach they called [[demythology]]. They have therefore looked at the [[New Testament]] Christology as greatly tampered with and in need of being demythologized. There has been a separation made between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith (see also the [[Quest for the Historical Jesus]]).

In [[hydrodynamics]], a '''plume''' is a column of one fluid moving through another.  Several effects control the motion of the fluid, including momentum (inertia), diffusion and buoyancy (density differences).  Pure ''jets'' and pure ''plumes'' define flows that are driven entirely by momentum and buoyancy effects, respectively.  Flows between these two limits are usually described as forced plumes or buoyant jets.  "Buoyancy is defined as being positive" when, in the absence of other forces or initial motion, the entering fluid would tend to rise.  Situations where the density of the plume fluid is greater than its surroundings (i.e. in still conditions, its natural tendency would be to sink), but the flow has sufficient initial momentum to carry it some distance vertically, are described as being negatively buoyant.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J.S. (1979), "Buoyancy effects in fluids", Ch.6, pp.165--&amp;, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==
Usually, as a plume moves away from its source, it widens because of [[entrainment (hydrodynamics)|entrainment]] of the surrounding fluid at its edges. Plume shapes can be influenced by flow in the ambient fluid (for example, if local wind blowing in the same direction as the plume results in a co-flowing jet). This usually causes a plume which has initially been 'buoyancy-dominated'  to become 'momentum-dominated' (this transition is usually predicted by a dimensionless number called the [[Richardson number]]).

=== Flow and detection ===
A further phenomenon of importance is whether a plume has [[laminar flow]] or [[turbulent flow]]. Usually there is a transition from laminar to turbulent as the plume moves away from its source. This phenomenon can be clearly seen in the rising column of smoke from a cigarette. When high accuracy is required, [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) can be employed to simulate plumes, but the results can be sensitive to the [[turbulence model]] chosen. CFD is often undertaken for '''rocket plumes''', where condensed phase constituents can be present in addition to gaseous constituents. These types of simulations can become quite complex, including [[afterburning]] and [[thermal radiation]], and (for example) [[ballistic missile]] launches are often detected by sensing hot rocket plumes. Similarly, spacecraft managers are sometimes concerned with impingement of [[attitude control system]] thruster plumes onto sensitive subsystems like solar arrays and star trackers.

Another phenomenon which can also be seen clearly in the flow of smoke from a cigarette is that the leading-edge of the flow, or the starting-plume, is quite often approximately in the shape of a ring-[[vortex]] ([[smoke ring]]).&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. S. (1962). ''The Starting Plume in Neutral Surroundings'', J. Fluid Mech. vol 13, pp356-368&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[Pollutants]] released to the ground can work their way down into the [[groundwater]], leading to [[groundwater pollution]]. The resulting body of polluted water within an [[aquifer]] is called a plume, with its migrating edges called plume fronts. Plumes are used to locate, map, and measure [[water pollution]] within the aquifer's total body of water, and plume fronts to determine directions and speed of the contamination's spreading in it.&lt;ref&gt;Fetter, C.W. Jr 1998 Contaminant Hydrogeology&lt;/ref&gt;

Plumes are of considerable importance in the [[atmospheric dispersion modelling]] of [[air pollution]]. A classic work on the subject of air pollution plumes is that by Gary Briggs.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Gary A. (1975). ''Plume Rise Predictions'', Chapter 3 in ''Lectures on Air Pollution and Environmental Impact Analysis'',  Duanne A. Haugen, editor, Amer. Met. Soc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''thermal plume''' is one which is generated by gas rising above heat source. The gas rises because [[thermal expansion]] makes warm gas less dense than the surrounding cooler gas.

==Simple plume modelling==
Quite simple modelling will enable many properties of fully developed, turbulent plumes to be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Scase, M. M., Caulfield, C. P., Dalziel, S. B. &amp; Hunt, J. C. R. (2006). ''Time-dependent plumes and jets with decreasing source strengths'', J. Fluid Mech. vol 563, pp443-461&lt;/ref&gt;

# It is usually sufficient to assume that the pressure gradient is set by the gradient far from the plume (this approximation is similar to the usual [[Turbulence modeling#Eddy viscosity|Boussinesq approximation]]).
# The distribution of density and velocity across the plume are modelled either with simple Gaussian distributions or else are taken as uniform across the plume (the so-called 'top hat' model).
# The rate of entrainment into the plume is proportional to the local velocity.&lt;ref name="morton turb"&gt;Morton, B. R., Turner, J. S., and Taylor, G.I. (1956), ''Turbulent gravitational convection from maintained and instantaneous sources'', P. Roy. Soc. Lond., vol. 234, pp.1--&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Though initially thought to be a constant, recent work has shown that the entrainment coefficient varies with the local Richardson number.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminski, E. Tait, S. and Carazzo, G. (2005), ''Turbulent entrainment in jets with arbitrary buoyancy'', J. Fluid Mech., vol. 526, pp.361--376&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical values for the entrainment coefficient are of about 0.08 for vertical jets and 0.12 for vertical, buoyant plumes whilst for bent-over plumes, the entrainment coefficient is about 0.6.
# Conservation equations for mass (including entrainment), and momentum and buoyancy fluxes are sufficient for a complete description of the flow in many cases,&lt;ref name="morton turb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woods, A.W. (2010), ''Turbulent plumes in nature'', Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., Vol. 42, pp. 391--412&lt;/ref&gt; For a simple rising plume these equations predict that the plume will widen at a constant half-angle of about 6 to 15 degrees.

==Gaussian plume modelling==
Gaussian plume models can be used in several fluid dynamics scenarios to calculate concentration distribution of solutes such as a smoke stack release or contaminant released in a river. Gaussian distributions are established by Fickian diffusion, and follow a gaussian (bell-shaped) distribution.&lt;ref name="connolly model"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/paul.connolly/teaching/practicals/gaussian_plume_modelling.html|title=Gaussian Plume Model|website=personalpages.manchester.ac.uk|last1=Connolly|first1=Paul|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For calculating the expected concentration of a one dimensional instantaneous point source we consider a mass M released at an instantaneous point in time, in a one dimensional domain along x. This will give the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Nepf. ''1.061 Transport Processes in the Environment.'' Fall 2008. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare, https://ocw.mit.edu License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C(x,t)=M/\surd(4\pi*D*t) *exp((x-x0)^2/(4D(t-t0)) &lt;/math&gt;

where M is the mass released at time t=t0 and location x=x0, and D is the diffusivity [m^2/s]. This  equation makes the following four assumptions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mass Transport in Environmental Flows|last=Variano|first=Evan|publisher=UC Berkeley|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The mass M is released instantaneously.
# The mass M is released in an infinite domain.
# The mass spreads only through diffusion.
# Diffusion does not vary in space.&lt;ref name="connolly model"/&gt;

{{Userspace draft|source=ArticleWizard|date=January 2013}} 

'''Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elect. Corp.''' is a key United States legal case from 1961 in [[trademark infringement]] law. It is also cited in [[personality rights]] particularly around celebrities. The decision set out that trademark infringement is measured by the multi-factor "likelihood of confusion" test. That is, a new mark will infringe on an existing trademark if the new mark is so similar to the original that consumers are likely to confuse the two marks, and mistakenly purchase from the wrong company.&lt;ref name=polaroid&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Polaroid v. Polarad |vol=287 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=492 |pinpoint= |court=2nd Cir. |date=1961 |url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Polaroid+Corporation+v.+Polarad+Electronics&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,60,107,112,114,122,127,129&amp;case=2293827617926067028&amp;scilh=0 |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of confusion test turns on several factors,&lt;ref name=polaroid /&gt; including:
* Strength of the plaintiff's trademark; 
* Degree of similarity between the two marks at issue; 
* Similarity of the goods and services at issue;
* Evidence of actual confusion; 
* Purchaser sophistication; 
* Quality of the defendant's goods or services; 
* Defendant's intent in adopting the mark:  

This multi-factor test was famously articularted by Judge [[Henry Friendly]] in Polaroid v. Polarad.&lt;ref name=polaroid /&gt; and are often referred to as the "Polaroid Factors."&lt;ref&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jdlitman/classes/SI519/PFactors.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upcounsel.com/likelihood-of-confusion-factors&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quimbee.com/keyterms/polaroid-factors&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''pollution haven hypothesis''' posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this often comes at the cost of environmentally unsound practices. [[Developing country|Developing nations]] with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

==Three scales of the hypothesis==
#[[Pollution control]] costs have an impact at the margins, where they exert some effect on investment decisions and trade flows.
#Pollution control costs are important enough to measurably influence trade and investment.
#Countries set their environmental standards below socially-efficient levels in order to attract investment or to promote their exports.&lt;ref name="Four New Empirical Tests of the PHH"&gt;{{cite web|last=Millimet|first=Daniel|title=Four New Empirical Tests of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis When Environmental Regulation is Endogenous|url=http://econ.tulane.edu/seminars/Millimet.pdf|publisher=Tulane University|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scales 1 and 2 have empirical support, but the significance of the hypothesis relative to other investment and trade factors is still controversial.  One study found that environmental regulations have a strong negative effect on a country's [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]], particularly in pollution-intensive industries when measured by employment.  However, that same study found that the environmental regulations present in a country's neighbors have an insignificant impact on that country's trade flows.&lt;ref name="Four New Empirical Tests of the PHH" /&gt;

==Formula and variations==
:Yi = αRi + XiβI + εi

In the above formula, Y is economic activity, R is regulatory stringency, X is an aggregate of other characteristics that affect Y and ε is an [[error term]].&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; Theoretically, by changing your value of R, analysts will be able to calculate the expected effect on economic activity. According to the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, this equation shows that environmental regulations and economic activity are negatively correlated, because regulations raise the cost of key inputs to goods with pollution-intensive productions and reduce jurisdictions' comparative advantage in these goods. This lack of comparative advantage causes firms to move to countries with lower environmental standards, decreasing Y.

There is also an expanded formula, as shown below:

:Yit = vi + αRit + γTit + θRitTit + X’βit + εit

This expanded formula takes into account whether [[trade liberalization]] (i.e. the level of [[trade barrier]]s that exist in a country, labeled as T) increases the negative correlation between economic activity (Y) and regulatory stringency (R).  Some authors claim that trade barriers disproportionately effect the environment, and this equation attempts to quantify the interaction between trade barriers and regulatory stringency, and the corresponding effect with respect to output in an economy.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt;

== Connection with the environmental Kuznets curve ==
[[File:Environmntal Kuznets Curve.png|thumb|A simple recreation of the Environmental Kuznets Curve, made using Microsoft Excel.]]
{{see also|Kuznets curve}}

The '''environmental Kuznets curve''' (EKC) is a conceptual model that suggests that a country's pollution concentrations rise with development and industrialization up to a turning point, after which they fall again as the country uses its increased affluence to reduce pollution concentrations, suggesting that the cleaner environment in developed countries comes at the expense of a dirtier environment in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Exploring the Causality between the Pollution Haven Hypothesis and the Environmental Kuznets Curve"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ibara|first=Brian|title=Exploring the Causality between the Pollution Haven Hypothesis and the Environmental Kuznets Curve|url=http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/econ_honproj/21|work=Honors projects|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the EKC is potentially a reflection of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, because one of the factors that may drive the increase in [[environmental degradation]] seen in [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial economies]] is an [[global waste trade|influx of waste from post-industrial economies]].  This same transfer of polluting firms through trade and foreign investment could lead to the decrease in environmental degradation seen in downward-sloping section of the EKC, which models post-industrial (service) economies. This model holds true in cases of national development, but cannot necessarily be applied at a local scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography|last=Moseley, Perramond, Hapke, Laris|first=William G., Eric, Holly M., Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4051-8932-3|location=Oxford, UK|pages=179-180|quote=|via=Open edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real-world example==
Spent batteries that [[United States|Americans]] turn in to be recycled are increasingly being sent to [[Mexico]], where the lead inside them is extracted by crude methods that are illegal in the United States.  This increased export flow is a result of strict new [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] standards on lead pollution, which make domestic recycling more difficult and expensive in the United States, but do not prohibit companies from exporting the work and danger to countries where environmental standards are low and enforcement is lax.  In this sense, Mexico is becoming a pollution haven for the United States battery industry because Mexican environmental officials acknowledge that they lack the money, manpower, and technical capacity to police the flow.  According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2011, 20% of spent American vehicle and industrial batteries were being exported to Mexico, up from 6% in 2007, meaning that approximately 20 million batteries would cross the border that year.  A significant proportion of this flow was being smuggled in after being mislabeled as metal scrap.&lt;ref name="NY Times Lead Export Article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenthal|first=Elizabeth|title=Lead from Old US Batteries Sent to Mexico Raises Risks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/science/earth/recycled-battery-lead-puts-mexicans-in-danger.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=14 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E-waste dump site GDP per capita.png|thumb|Map of GDP PPP per-capita with known e-waste dump sites added in 2013.]]
The world map shown here illustrates how e-waste dump sites (or sites where citizens or multinational corporations of industrialized nations dump their used electronic devices) along with the [[Purchasing power parity|GDP PPP per-capita]] of those countries.&lt;ref name="e-waste dump locations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Where does e-waste end up?|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Used EEE &amp; E-Waste Import and E-Waste Generated in Kyoto Protocol Non-Annex I Countries.png|thumb|Shows an estimated amount of Used EEE and E-Waste imported into [[Kyoto Protocol]] Non-Annex 1 countries, with the E-Waste generated by each country's own domestic supplies.]] While GDP PPP per-capita is not a perfect indicator of economic development, and e-waste dump sites are only one small facet of what could be a greater pollution haven, this map does illustrate how e-waste dump sites are often located in poorer, relatively pre-industrial nations, which provides some rudimentary support for the Pollution Haven Hypothesis.

==Areas of controversy ==
The first area of controversy with respect to the Pollution Haven Theory has to do with the formulas above.  Finding an appropriate measure of regulatory stringency (R) is not simple, because we want to know how much more costly production is in a given jurisdiction relative to others due to that jurisdiction's environmental regulations.  The compliance costs stemming from these regulations, however, could come in the form of environmental taxes, regulatory delays, the threat or execution of lawsuits, product redesign, or emissions limits.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; This proliferation of cost styles makes R hard to quantify.

Another major critique of the second formula is that it is difficult to measure regulatory stringency and trade barriers because the two effects are likely endogenous, so few studies have attempted to estimate the indirect effect of trade liberalization on pollution havens.  Furthermore, governments at times engage in inefficient competition to actually attract polluting industries through weakening their environmental standards.  However, as per conventional economic theory, welfare-maximizing governments should set standards so that the benefits justify the costs at the margin.  This does not mean that environmental standards will be equal everywhere, as jurisdictions have different assimilative capacities, costs of abatement, and social attitudes regarding the environment, meaning heterogeneity in pollution standards is to be expected.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; By extension, this means that industry migration to less stringent jurisdictions may not raise [[efficiency]] concerns in an economic sense.

A final area of controversy is whether the Pollution Haven Hypothesis has empirical support.  For example, studies have found [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] evidence that countries with poor air quality do have higher net factor exports of coal, but the magnitude of the impact is small relative to other variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellogg|first=Ryan|title=The Pollution Haven Hypothesis: Significance and Insignificance|year=2006|publisher=Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, UC Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]], a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]–winning economist, is skeptical as to whether pollution havens have empirical support in economic theory, as he writes, "At this point it's hard to come up with major examples of industries in which the pollution haven phenomenon, to the extent that it occurs, leads to international negative externalities. This does not, however, say that such examples cannot arise in the future."&lt;ref name="International Economics Theory &amp; Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=International Economics Theory and Policy|year=2006|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=9780321451347}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scale 3 above has had empirical arguments made specifically against it, especially in the last 20 years.  Some economists argue that once higher environmental standards are introduced in a country, larger multinational firms present in the country are likely to push for enforcement so as to reduce the cost advantage of smaller local firms.  This effect would make countries with strict environmental standards a haven for the large companies often associated with higher levels of pollution, meaning the polluting agents may be smaller companies, rather than the larger MNCs as theorized by other proponents of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Where Are The Pollution Havens?"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birdsall|first=Nancy|author2=Wheeler, David|title=Trade Policy and Industrial Pollution in Latin America: Where Are the Pollution Havens?|journal=The Journal of Environment &amp; Development|date=January 1993|volume=2|issue=1|pages=137–149|doi=10.1177/107049659300200107|url=http://jed.sagepub.com/content/2/1/137.full.pdf+html|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14520">'''Religious education''' is the term given to  [[education]] concerned with [[religion]]. It may refer to education provided by a [[Church body|church]] or religious organization, for instruction in [[doctrine]] and [[faith]], or for  education in various aspects of religion, but without explicitly religious or [[moral]] aims, e.g. in a [[school]] or [[college]]. The term is often known as [[religious studies]].

==England==
Religious Education (RE) is a compulsory subject in the [[public education|state education]] system in [[England]].  Schools are required to teach a programme of religious studies according to local and national guidelines.

Religious Education in [[England]] is mandated by the [[Education Act 1944]] as amended by the [[Education Reform Act 1988]] and the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]]. The provision of Religious Education is compulsory in all state-funded schools, but it is not compulsory for any of the children to take the subject. The subject consists of the study of different religions, religious leaders, and other religious and moral themes. However, the curriculum is required to reflect the predominant place of Christianity in religious life and hence Christianity forms the majority of the content of the subject. All parents have the right to withdraw a child from religious education, which schools must approve.&lt;ref name="withdraw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/r/recollectiveworshipandtherighttowithdraw/|title=Religious Education&amp;nbsp;— collective worship and the right to withdraw|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|author=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=Teachernet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630193803/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/r/recollectiveworshipandtherighttowithdraw/|archivedate=2008-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, all schools are required by law to provide a daily act of [[Collective Worship (schools in England and Wales)|collective worship]], of which at least 51% must be Christian in basis over the course of the academic year.&lt;ref name="collwors"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/c/collectiveworship/|title=Collective worship|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|year=2005|author=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=Teachernet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112044304/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/c/collectiveworship/|archivedate=2008-01-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Smalley, the chair of the Association of Religious Education inspectors, advisors and consultants, stated that some "schools did have problems fulfilling the requirement for worship" due to what they thought was "a lack of space to gather the entire school for worship" although Smalley noted that "there is actually no requirement for such a gathering, as smaller groups are allowed."&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4693129.stm|title=School worship: from sports to death|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=BBC|author=Lucy Wilkins|work=BBC News website | date=2005-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Union of Teachers]] suggested in 2008 that parents should have a right to have specific schooling in their own faith and that imams, rabbis and priests should be invited to offer religious instruction to pupils in all state schools.&lt;ref name="nutbbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7311178.stm|title=Call to offer faith class choice|accessdate=2008-03-27|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|author=Hannah Goff|work=BBC News website | date=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[England]] has a Local Agreed [[Syllabus]] which mandate subject teaching for each [[Key Stage]] and possibly for each school year. The [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] has also produced the non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education, which provides guidelines for the provision of RE at all key stages, and models the eight-levels as applied in National Curriculum subjects.&lt;ref name="nc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nc.uk.net/webdav/harmonise?Page/@id=6004&amp;Subject/@id=7881|title=Religious Education: non-statutory framework|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|year=2004|author=Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|work=National Curriculum Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211211245/http://www.nc.uk.net/webdav/harmonise?Page%2F%40id=6004&amp;Subject%2F%40id=7881|archivedate=2007-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
In France, RE is replaced by a non-religious moral teaching (called civic, legal and social education : ''éducation civique, juridique et sociale'', ECJS). Children can additionally receive, on a voluntary basis, a religious education, either at school in private religious school, or outside of school, in their religious community, if they are in a public (State) school. Although in some rare regions, namely Alsace-Moselle, the old Concordat of 1801 being still valid because of the German occupation at the time of the separation of Church and State in France and the strong stand of population in favour of this, religious education is compulsory, and a dispense is necessary if the child refuses to be following (Catholic or Protestant) religious education.

==Ireland==
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] religion is taught in a subject called Religious Education which is compulsory in many schools for the Junior Certificate, but available as an option for the Leaving Certificate{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. The course educates students about communities of faith, the foundations of the major world religions, the sacred texts, religious practices and festivals for Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Students also learn about religious change in Ireland, meaning in life, religious and non-religious responses to the search for meaning, atheism, agnosticism and other forms of belief. Students are also educated about morality in a number of different faiths and their moral codes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Israel==
Israeli school system includes State Schools; Religious State Schools; Recognized Schools and Exempt Schools, whose students are regarded as fulfilling the obligatory education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/taulwps/fp/art44 A. Maoz, "Religious Education in Israel", 83  U. Det. Mercy L. Rev (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;679-728.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
The prevailing view is that the religious education would contravene the constitutional [[Secularism|separation of state and religion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In place of RE, there is a short but nonetheless compulsory subject called {{nihongo|"Ethics"|{{ruby-ja|道徳|どうとく}}|doutoku|''lit.'' "morality"}} in [[primary school]], where the purpose is to teach [[moral values]] rather than to teach ethics as an academic subject. However, despite the stated [[secular]] stance, references to the majority religions of Shinto and Buddhism are sometimes made in class texts.

==Lebanon==
Being a secular country, with no state religion, Lebanon is expected to have a neutral position regarding religious education in its schools, which is not the case in the country, as well as many European and American countries. Lebanon doesn't have a law concerning RE in its educational establishments. Schools have the right to either give RE classes, or do the opposite. Religious classes are not obligatory, nor banned, and they are not replaced by "ethics" classes.
Private Schools (Christian and Muslim) give mandatory religious classes, reflecting their religious identification. Students from other religions don't take any classes during the religious ones, but they always can sign up for the RE class. Catholic schools give only Catholic classes, mandatory for Christian students, but can be signed up for by Muslim students, if not, Muslims do not take any classes in parallel to Christian ones. Public schools kind of have a more liberal religious program. A Lebanese public school may give, or not give RE classes, which regard the predominant religion of the population in the area the school is located in. Students have to take these classes, whether they are Christian or Muslim. A public school located in a mixed area would prefer not to give RE classes, unless voted oppositely by locals, RE classes may be both Christian and Muslim at the same time in this case, and students divide when this happens.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Malaysia==
The Malaysian education system makes ''Moral Studies'' compulsory for non-Muslim students at secondary and primary schools. Muslim students instead partake in ''Islamic Studies'' lessons. Both subjects figure among the seven compulsory subjects undertaken by students for the [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia]]. There has been considerable debate about the usefulness of the "Moral" subject, primarily due to the strict exam-oriented marking-schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2377731/Article/index_html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019192539/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2377731/Article/index_html |archivedate=2008-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2007}} Article 2 of the [[Constitution of Norway]] mandates Evangelical-Lutheran parents to provide a religious upbringing for their children.&lt;ref&gt;

==Scotland ==
{{Main|Education in Scotland}}
In [[Scotland|Scottish]] state schools, Religious Education is called ''Religious and Moral Education'' from ages 5 to 14, and ''Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies'' from 14 to 18.

The majority of [[state school]]s in are [[Secular Education|non-denominational]], but as a result of the [[Education Act 1918]], separate denominational [[state school]]s were also established. The vast majority of denominational state schools are [[Roman Catholic]] but there are also a number of [[Scottish Episcopal]] schools. The school buildings are built and maintained by the Roman Catholic Church were handed over to the state under the Education Act. Since then,the Catholic schools are fully funded by the [[Scottish Government]] and administered by the [[Education and Lifelong Learning Directorate]]. As part of the deal, there are specific legal provisions to ensure the promotion of a Catholic ethos in such schools: applicants for positions in the areas of Religious Education, Guidance or Senior Management must be approved by the [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland]], which also appoints a [[chaplain]] to each of its schools. There is also one Jewish state primary school.

==South Africa==
The [[South Africa]]n National Policy on Religion and Education adopted in September 2003 provides for Religion Education, i.e. education about diverse religions, which does not promote any particular religion in the [[State school|public school]] curriculum. The policy does not apply to [[private school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Policy on Religion and Education|url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70211|publisher=info.gov.za|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131232848/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70211|archivedate=31 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeenah|first=Na'eem|editor1-first=Brian|editor1-last=Ramadiro|editor2-first=Salim|editor2-last=Vally|title=Education Rights for Learners, Parents and Educators Book 5: Religion and Schools|url=http://www.erp.org.za/pdf/religion%20booklet_WEB.pdf|publisher=Education Rights Project|accessdate=20 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030181341/http://www.erp.org.za/pdf/religion%20booklet_WEB.pdf|archivedate=30 October 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle East ==
The majority of middle eastern countries provide compulsory religious studies in both private and public schools. The religious studies in private schools can be based on the religious beliefs of the student and can be complied with by the school.

'''Scientistic materialism''' is a philosophical stance which posits a limited definition of [[consciousness]] to that which is observable and subject to the [[scientific method]]. The term is used as a pejorative by proponents of [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]].

==History==
The "[[Wedge Document]]" produced by the [[Discovery Institute]], described "materialism" as denial of "the proposition that human beings are created in the image of God," and that humans are instead "animals or machines who inhabited a universe ruled by purely impersonal forces and whose behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the unbending forces of biology, chemistry and environment." The document states that materialism leads inevitably to "[[moral relativism]]" and denounce its "stifling dominance" in modern culture. By this definition, scientific materialism is linked to the more general version of [[materialism]] which declares that the physical world is the only thing that exists and that nothing [[supernatural]] exists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41885">The '''seven rays''' is an [[occult]] concept that has appeared in several religions and [[esoteric]] philosophies in both Western culture and in India since at least the sixth century BCE. Also they are known as gods or angels from different planets or can be called fallen angels.

In the west, it can be seen in early [[western mystery tradition]]s such as [[Gnosticism]] and [[Mithraism]]; and in texts and [[icon]]ic art of the [[Catholic Church]] as early as the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets |author=Barbara G.

Beginning in the late 19th century, the seven rays appeared in a modified and elaborated form in the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], first presented by [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref name="long"/&gt;  The Theosophical concept of the seven rays was further developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the writings of Theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], and by other authors such as [[Alice Bailey]], [[Manly P. Hall]], and others, including notably the teachings of [[Benjamin Creme]] and his group [[Share International]];&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin.

As the [[New Age]] movement of the mid-to-late 20th century developed, the seven rays concept appeared as an element of metaphysical healing methods such as [[Reiki]] and other modalities,&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of Reiki|author=Carolyn E.

In ancient [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] takes the bull-form known as Taurus in order to win [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. Taurus is also associated with [[Aphrodite]] and other goddesses, as well as with [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and [[Dionysus]]. The face of Taurus "gleams with seven rays of fire."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', v.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chaldean Oracles]] of the 2nd century CE feature the seven rays as purifying agents of [[Helios]], symbolism featured in [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraic]] liturgy as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ow0VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=chaldean+Seven+Rays&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=08IwTY6kLMG88gaB-MGdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chaldean%20Seven%20Rays&amp;f=false "The Chaldean oracles: text, translation, and commentary" by Julianus (the Theurgist.), Ruth Dorothy Majercik, ed., p.38]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the 4th century, [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian Saturnalia]] composed a ''Hymn to the Solemn Sun'', and in his ''Hymn to the Mother of the Gods'' spoke of "unspeakable mysteries hidden from the crowd such as Julian the Chaldean prophesied concerning the god of the seven rays."  In Greek Gnostic magic of the same era, colored gemstones were often used as [[amulet|talisman]]s for medicine or healing; they were often engraved with a symbol borrowed from the Egyptian deity [[Chnuphis]]: a hooded serpent or great snake. The snake was shown with a lion's head, from which emanated either twelve or seven rays. The twelve rays represented the [[zodiac]], and the seven rays represented the planets, usually with the seven Greek vowels engraved at the tips of the seven rays. The reverse sides of the talismans were engraved with a snake twisting around a vertical rod. These were known as "Gnostic [[amulet]]s" and were sometimes also engraved with the names ''Iao Sabao'' ([[Archon#Gnosticism|the Archon Iao]]).&lt;ref name="Thorndike"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Magic and Experimental Science|author=Lynn Thorndike |publisher=Columbia University Press |year= 1958 |pages=317–318, 379 |isbn= 0-231-08794-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gnostic gems with [[Abraxas]] also featured the seven rays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/gno/gar/gar31.htm#page_218 "Part III.

[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|The Annunciation]] is an oil painting by [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Jan van Eyck]], from around 1434-1436. The picture depicts the [[Annunciation]] by the [[Archangel Gabriel]] to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she will bear the Son of God ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:26-38). In a prominent element of the complex iconographic work, the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] descend to her on seven rays of light from the upper window to the left, with the dove symbolising the [[Holy Spirit]] following the same path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan van Eyck, Netherlandish, c. 1390 - 1441, The Annunciation, c. 1434/1436|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg39/gg39-49.0.html |publisher=National Gallery of Art|quote=The Holy Spirit descends to her on seven rays of light.

==In Hindu scripture==
[[File:Agni and consort.jpg|thumb|The seven-armed Agni with his wife.]]
[[Agni]] is a [[Hindu]] and [[Rigvedic deities|Vedic deity]] depicted in three forms: fire, lightning and the sun. In Hindu art, Agni is depicted with two or seven hands, two heads, and three legs. In each head, he has seven fiery tongues with which he licks sacrificial butter. He rides a ram or a chariot harnessed by fiery horses. His attributes are an axe, a torch, prayer beads and a flaming spear. Agni is represented as red and two-faced, suggesting both his destructive and his beneficent qualities, and with black eyes and hair. Seven rays of light emanate from his body.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning By Eva Rudy Jansen p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vishnu Purana]], a [[vedas|post-vedic]] scripture, describes how [[Vishnu]] "enters into the seven solar rays which dilate into seven suns." These are the "seven principal solar rays," the source of heat even to the planet Jupiter, and the "seven suns into which the seven solar rays dilate at the consummation of all things..."&lt;ref name="Garrett"/&gt;

20th century Hindu scholar, poet and mystic, [[Sri Aurobindo]], described the Vedic seven rays of knowledge, or [[Agni]], as "the seven forms of the Thought-principle" and wrote that "the seven brilliant horses of the sun and their full union constitutes the seven-headed Thought of Ayasya by which the lost sun of Truth is recovered. That thought is again established in the seven rivers, the seven principles of being divine and human, the totality of which founds the perfect spiritual existence."&lt;ref name="Aurobindo"/&gt;

==Syncretistic interpretations==

Egyptologist [[Gerald Massey]] wrote in 1881 of what he described as connections between Vedic scripture, ancient Egyptian mythology and the Gospel stories.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Massey Collection-Upper Norwood Joint Library&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that [[Archon#Gnosticism|the Archon Iao]], the "Seven-rayed Sun-God of the Gnostic-stones" was also the "Serpent Chnubis," and "the Second Beast in the Book of Revelation."&lt;ref name="massey-genesis"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Natural Genesis |author=Gerald Massey  |publisher=Black Classic Press |year= 1998 |edition=from original published circa 1881 |pages=366, 369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, he elaborated further, describing the unity of "the seven souls of the Pharaoh," "the seven arms of the Hindu god [[Agni]]," "the seven stars in the hand of the Christ in Revelation," and "the seven rays of the Chaldean god Heptaktis, or Iao, on the Gnostic stones."&lt;ref name="massey-lectures"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gerald Massey's Lectures |author=Gerald Massey  |publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year= 1992 |edition=from original published posthumously circa 1900 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Fales Dunlap, wrote in 1894:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moses was of the race of the Chaldeans. The Chaldean Mithra had his Seven Rays, and Moses his Seven Days. The other planets which circling around the sun lead the dance as round the King of heaven receive from him with the light also their powers; while as the light comes to them from the sun so from him they receive their powers that he pours out into the Seven Spheres of the Seven Planets of which the sun is the centre.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dunlap wrote that the idea of spirit as the ultimate cause is present in all of the great religions of the East (which in the terminology of his time included the area now known as the Near East or Middle East), and that this idea can be found in "the Seven Rays of the Chaldaean [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithra]] and the Seven Days of Genesis. From the Sun came fire and spirit." According to Dunlap, "this was the astronomical religion of the Chaldeans, Jews, Persians, Syrians, Phoenicians and Egyptians."&lt;ref name="dunlap"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ghebers of Hebron: An Introduction to the Gheborim in the Lands of the Sethim, the Mithra mysteries &amp;c.|author=Samuel Fales Dunlap | publisher=G Redway &amp; JW Bouton |year= 1894 |pages=reface, iii-vi |edition=Original from the University of California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunlap compared the [[Halo (religious iconography)#Ancient Greek world|nimbus]] of [[Apollo]] to the seven rays of [[Dionysus]], presiding over the orbits of the seven planets. The seven rays are found also in the Chaldean mystery of "the God of the Seven Rays, who held the Seven Stars in his hand, through whom (as Chaldaeans supposed) the souls were raised." Prior to the Christian era, this deity was known as Iao (the first birth) or  [[Sabaoth]] (the Sun), and later described as "Christos of the Resurrection of Souls."&lt;ref name="dunlap2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ghebers of Hebron: An Introduction to the Gheborim in the Lands of the Sethim, the Mithramsyteries &amp;c.|author=Samuel Fales Dunlap |publisher=G.

In the late 1940s, art historian and writer [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] was curator in the department of Asiatic Art at the Boston [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] and built the first large collection of Indian art in the United States. His writings in the field of [[perennial philosophy]] and the [[Traditionalist School]] included complex essays collating symbols of ancient wisdom and metaphysics from widely diverse cultures including Indian, Islamic, Chinese, Hellenic, and Christian sources. He wrote that the seven rays of the sun appear in both Hindu and Christian symbolism, representing similar concepts, and in particular the symbolism of the seventh ray that "corresponds to the distinction of transcendent from immanent and of infinite from finite." He added that of "our Axis of the Universe ([[Stambha|skambha]], divo dharuna, etc.) and Islamic [[Qutb]] ..... The seventh ray alone passes through the Sun to the suprasolar Brahma worlds, "where no sun shines" ('all that is under the Sun being in the power of Death, and all beyond immortal')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Door in the Sky: Coomaraswamy on Myth and Meaning |author=Ananda K.

==In Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Syncretism is one of the core principles of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], a religious philosophy originating with [[Madame Blavatsky|Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] from the 1870s, and the seven rays appear repeatedly in the related writings. Theosophy holds that all [[religion]]s are attempts by the "[[Spiritual Hierarchy]]" to help humanity in evolving to greater perfection, and that each religion therefore has a portion of the truth.

Blavatsky wrote in the first book of ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' of an " analogy between the Aryan or Brahmanical and the Egyptian esotericism" and that the "seven rays of the Chaldean Heptakis or Iao, on the Gnostic stones" represent the seven large stars of the Egyptian "Great Bear" constellation, the seven elemental powers, and the Hindu "seven Rishis." She stated that the seven rays of the Vedic sun deity Vishnu represent the same concept as the "astral fluid or 'Light' of the Kabalists," and that the seven emanations of the lower seven [[sephirot]]h are the "primeval seven rays," and "will be found and recognized in every religion."&lt;ref name="doctrine1-129"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 1, p 129–130, 523, 573–4 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second volume of the ''Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky discusses the "seven nervous plexuses of the body" and the seven rays they radiate, stating that this principle is found in the [[Rig Veda]], in the mythology of [[Ahura Mazda]], in the beliefs of the Incas, the Chinese Yao, and the Egyptian Osiris, who "when he enters the ark, or solar boat, takes seven Rays with him." She describes the "seven wise ones" of the Veda as "the seven Rays which fall free from the macrocosmic centre".&lt;ref name="doctrine2-564"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 2, p 143, 191 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blavatsky summarizes the syncretistic principle of her doctrine as it relates to the seven rays:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...a key which reveals to us on indisputable grounds of comparative analogy... the Indian phœnix, the emblem of cyclic and periodical time, the "man-lion" Singha, of whose representations the so-called "gnostic gems" are so full. Over the seven rays of the lion's crown, and corresponding to their points, stand, in many cases, the seven vowels of the Greek alphabet AEHIOYW, testifying to the Seven Heavens. This is the Solar lion and the emblem of the Solar cycle, as Garuda is that of the great cycle, the "Maha-Kalpa" co-eternal with Vishnu, and also, of course, the emblem of the Sun, and Solar cycle. ... As well remarked by C. W. King: — "Whatever the primary meaning (of the gem with the solar lion and vowels) it was probably imported in its present shape from India, that true fountain head of gnostic iconography." (Gnostics, p. 218)&lt;ref name="Doctrine 2-564"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 2, p 564–5 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the third volume of the ''Secret Doctrine'', published posthumously, Blavatsky described the "Seven Primeval Rays" as a group of celestial beings also known as "Gods" or "[[Deva (New Age)|Angels]]" or "Powers". She stated that this symbolism was "adopted later on by the Christian Religion as the 'Seven [[Angel of the Presence|Angels of the Presence]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Occultism Of The Secret Doctrine  |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year= 2004 |edition=originally published in 1897 |isbn= 1-4179-1104-2 |page=art I, page 369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Theosophy, the seven rays are said to be seven major types of ''Light-Substance'' (spirit/matter) (waves/particles) that compose the created universes. These are also believed to convey "Divine Qualities".&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Reed. [http://www.blavatsky.net/confirm/ev/other/photon.htm ''Blavatsky' Foreknowledge of The Wave/Particle Duality of Light''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927044457/http://blavatsky.net/confirm/ev/other/photon.htm |date=2006-09-27 }} 1997. "It would also be incorrect to claim light is fully explained as a particle. Rather it has a dual nature possessing the properties of both [[wave]] and [[Elementary particle|particle]]. In general, [[electromagnetic radiation]] acts more like waves in the [[radio wave]] end of the [[spectrum]], more like particles in the [[x-ray]] end of the spectrum, and usually (but not always) like a wave in the "middle" light area of the spectrum in our everyday experience. Her ambiguity, then, reflects a fact in nature, the wave/particle duality of nature."&lt;/ref&gt;

===C.W. Leadbeater===

[[C.W. Leadbeater]] gave a list showing the characteristic type of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] for each ray. This list indicates what he regarded as the most compatible type of magic to be performed by persons on each ray (although anyone of any ray can do any of these various types of magic).&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925--The Theosophical Publishing House. Chart on P. 229 lists Characteristic Magic of each Ray.&lt;/ref&gt;

* First ray: Magic of [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] of [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]]
* Second ray: Magic of [[Raja Yoga]] (Development of Mind)
* Third ray: Magic of [[Astrology]] (Natural Magnetic Forces)
* Fourth ray: Magic of [[Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga]] (physical development)
* Fifth ray: Magic of [[Alchemy]] (Manipulation of Material Substances)
* Sixth ray: Magic of [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti Yoga]] (Selfless Service and Altruistic Love; [[agape]])
* Seventh ray: [[Ceremonial magic]] (Invocation of Elementals, and [[Deva (New Age)|Devas]])

==New Age teachings==

According to [[Alice A. Bailey]], each person has a ''soul ray'' that remains the same through all their incarnations, and a ''personality ray'' that is different for each incarnation. Each ray is also correspondent with certain Masters of Wisdom, and with particular planets, cycles, nations, etc. The seven rays are the basis for what Alice A. Bailey called ''New Age Psychology''—she divides everyone in the human race into these seven [[psychological type]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Seven Rays of Life'' New York: 1995—Lucis Publishing Co. Compilation from all the [[Alice A. Bailey]] books of material about the seven rays.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey stated that the seven rays that reach us on [[Earth]] locally originate within the "Solar Logos," i.e., the consciousness of the "Divine Being" of the [[Sun]]. According to Alice A. Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]], the seven rays are focused to the Solar Logos, through [[Sirius]], the seven stars of the [[Big Dipper]] in the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]], and the seven major stars of the [[Pleiades]] form the "Galactic Logos," (the consciousness of the "Divine Being" of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]), and have their ultimate origin within the mind of [[God]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On the local planetary level, it is believed that the seven rays are transmitted from the Solar Logos through the God of our planet, [[Sanat Kumara]], then through the spiritual hierarchy of our planet which includes the "Masters of Wisdom" &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;(Some writings term them the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] or the [[Great White Brotherhood]]).

Each of the seven rays is believed to be associated with a different kind of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult energy]], and a different [[color]].

===Qualities of the seven rays===
The ''seven rays'' are listed below:

[[Alice A. Bailey]] and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] assign different colors and in some cases different Masters to each of the seven rays. In ''Letters on Occult Meditation'', Alice Bailey indicates that there is no simple correspondence between the rays and these colors. The colors, Masters, and Retreats indicated here are those indicated by both Alice Bailey and the Church Universal and Triumphant.

According to Alice A. Bailey the Masters live in immortal bodies at a ''residence'' on the [[physical plane]] at the indicated location (although a given Master may physically travel extensively incognito to various locations, become [[Invisibility|invisible]], [[Teleportation in theology|teleport]] to various locations, and walk through walls, as well as influence humans [[telepathy|telepathically]] and travel on the [[Plane (metaphysics)|inner planes]], as required by the demands of his spiritual work).

According to the Church Universal and Triumphant, and other ''[[Ascended Master Teachings|Ascended Master Activities]]'', each Master is believed to serve at a ''Retreat'' on the physical or [[etheric plane]] at the geographical location shown after their name.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Prophet, Elizabeth Clare (Compiled and edited by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press "The Retreats of the Ascended Masters" Pages 395-492&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Gifts of the Holy Spirit" of the Church Universal and Triumphant for each ray are shown. For both Alice A. Bailey and the Church Universal and Triumphant, each ray has a [[Gemstone|jewel]] which is believed to focus the energy of that ray, which is indicated.

In the mid-to-late 20th century, as the [[New Age]] movement gained in popularity, the concept and imagery of the seven rays appeared in a variety of settings.

In [[esoteric astrology]], the seven rays are considered to be split into three groups: the first two rays represent Will and Wisdom, respectively, and the remaining five rays together form the group that represents Activity.&lt;ref name="Leo" /&gt; In a style of Reiki adapted by Carolyn E. Jackson the student passes through a sequence of levels by mastering the "key" to each level. The key for the second level is known as the key of "oneness" and is attained by passing through each of the seven rays.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; This, however, is not part of traditional [[Reiki]] or other versions of the Reiki system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascensionreiki.com/Usui%20Reiki%20Manual.pdf The Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakkai Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reiki Sourcebook |author=Bronwen &amp; Frans Steine|publisher=O Books |year= 2003|isbn= 1-903816-55-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[psychic]] counselor Samantha Stevens, an individual can use [[affirmative prayer|affirmations]], candles, [[Chromotherapy|color therapy]], vibrational medicines and other methods to contact "archangels," which she defines as the "seven rays," based on Buddhist and Christian theories: "The Rays or Divine Flames (as they are sometimes called) represent elements in the perfectly integrated human being - one whose heart is aligned with their will and inspired by the Divine Imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seven Rays: A Universal Guide to the Archangels |author=Samantha Stevens |publisher=Insomniac Press |year= 2003|isbn= 1-894663-49-7 |page=22 et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light therapy|Light therapist]] and [[Radionics]] Practitioner Primrose Cooper writes that in using light as a healing modality, she finds it helpful to use the seven rays as defined in Theosophy to assist her clients in finding "psychological insight into their soul's purpose."&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;

In recent years, there was the creation of a secretive group named "The Keepers of the Seven Rays". Their philosophy is the human being has seven emanations in which it finds itself, or connects with the Higher Self. These emanations are extensions of the Higher Self or otherwise called the Higher Will. These emanations reach out like arms and grasp onto the knowledge(of all types) needed for the full development of the individual into his/her Higher Potential. All a human has to do to use these emanations is to know basic moral law, what their body and/or psyche can and cannot handle, and listen.

Metaphysical philosopher Gurdjieff writes frequently of his "Seven Rays of Creation".   According to Gurdjieff, the Seven Rays of Creation are the seven manifestations of Energy in our Universe. The first Ray contains all things (THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE) and all things obey the laws inherent in the First Ray. The First Ray then manifests itself in the 2nd Realm, the realm of Galaxies. From Galaxies to Solar Systems, Solar Systems to Planets. From Planets to Organisms on the planets, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjieff-legacy.org/ Gurdjieff Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
;Music
* The [[progressive rock]] band [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] performed a song entitled "The Seven Rays." The lyrics of the song center around the philosophies associated with the seven rays concepts popular with the new age movement, with much focus on the colors associated with each ray.
* Another progressive rock band, [[Hawkwind]], have a song about the seven rays titled ''Seven by Seven''.
* [[Mike Pinder]] of [[The Moody Blues]] refers heavily to the "seven rays" and the "Light of Seven" in his solo album "The Promise".
* The pop band [[Erasure]] refers to the Violet Flame through the title of their 2014 album, ''[[The Violet Flame]]''.

;Literature

* [[S.M. Stirling]]'s fictionalized and changed [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] believes that the "Light of the Seven Rays" has become stronger since The Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=S.M.

{{Vedas and Shakhas}}A '''shakha''' ([[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|[[wikt:शाखा#Sanskrit|śākhā]]}}'', "branch" or "limb"), is a [[Hindu]] theological school that specializes in learning certain [[Vedas|Vedic]] texts, or else the traditional texts followed by such a school.&lt;ref name="S. Apte. A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary p. 913"&gt;V. S. Apte. A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, p. 913, left column.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams, A Sanskit-English Dictionary 1062"&gt;Monier-Williams, A Sanskit-English Dictionary, p. 1062, right column.&lt;/ref&gt; An individual follower of a particular school or recension is called a ''{{IAST|śākhin}}''.&lt;ref&gt;V. S. Apte. A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, p. 913, left column&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is also used in [[Hindu philosophy]] to refer to an adherent of a particular [[nastika|orthodox system]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Radhakrishnan, Sarvepalli;  and Moore, Charles A. ''A Source Book in Indian Philosophy''.  Princeton University Press; 1957. Princeton paperback 12th edition, 1989. {{ISBN|0-691-01958-4}}. p. 560.  The example is given here of a text which refers to a dispute involving ''śākhins'' [followers] who do not accept a particular position.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related term ''{{IAST|caraṇa}}'', ("conduct of life" or "behavior") is also used to refer to such a Vedic school:&lt;ref&gt;V. S. Apte. ''A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary''. p. 429, middle column&lt;/ref&gt; "although the words ''{{IAST|caraṇa}}'' and ''{{IAST|śākhā}}'' are sometimes used synonymously, yet ''{{IAST|caraṇa}}'' properly applies to the sect or collection of persons united in one school, and ''{{IAST|śākhā}}'' to the traditional text followed, as in the phrase ''{{IAST|śākhām adhite}}'', (''"he recites a particular version of the Veda"'')".&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams, A Sanskit-English Dictionary 1062"/&gt; The schools have different points of view, described as "difference of (Vedic) school" (''{{IAST|śākhābhedaḥ}}''). Each school would learn a specific Vedic {{IAST|Saṃhita}} (one of the "four [[Vedas]]" properly so-called), as well as its associated [[Brahmana]], [[Aranyaka]]s, [[Shrautasutra]]s,  [[Grhyasutra]]s and [[Upanishad]]s.&lt;ref name="S. Apte. A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary p. 913"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams, A Sanskit-English Dictionary 1062"/&gt;

In traditional Hindu society affiliation with a specific school is an important aspect of class identity. By the end of the Rig Vedic period the term [[Brahmin|{{IAST|Brāhmaṇa}}]] had come to be applied to all members of the priestly class, but there were subdivisions within this order based both on [[caste]] and on the shakha (branch) with which they were affiliated.&lt;ref&gt;Basham, A. L. ''The Wonder That Was India: A Survey of the Culture of the Indian Sub-Continent Before The Coming Of The Muslims''. (Grove Press, Inc.: New York, 1954) p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Brahmin|{{IAST|Brāhmaṇa}}]] who changed school would be called "a traitor to his ''śākhā''" (''{{IAST|śākhāraṇḍaḥ}}'').&lt;ref name="S. Apte. A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary p. 913"/&gt;

==Summary of schools==
[[Image:Map of Vedic India.png|thumb|410px|Map of early Iron Age [[Vedic India]] after Witzel (1989).  Location hypotheses for Vedic ''shakhas'' are shown in green.]]

The traditional source of information on the shakhas of each Veda is the ''{{IAST|Caraṇa-vyūha}}'', of which two, mostly similar, versions exist: the 49th [[Parisista|''{{IAST|pariśiṣṭa}}'']] of the Atharvaveda, ascribed to [[Shaunaka]], and the 5th ''{{IAST|pariśiṣṭa}}'' of the Śukla (White) Yajurveda, ascribed to [[Katyayana|Kātyāyana]].  These have lists of the numbers of recensions that were believed to have once existed as well as those still extant at the time the works were compiled.  Only a small number of recensions have survived.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief summary of the shakhas as given in Shaunaka's ''{{IAST|Caraṇa-vyūha}}'' see: Monier-Williams, ''A Sanskit-English Dictionary'', p. 1062, right column.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saraswati Gangadhar]]'s devotional poetry written in Marathi called [[Shri Guru Charitra|Shri Gurucharitra]] describes different shakhas of 4 Vedas in 27th chapter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mr.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0/%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF_%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE|title=गुरूचरित्र/अध्याय सव्विसावा - विकिस्रोत|website=mr.wikisource.org|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools are enumerated below, categorised according to the Veda each expounds.

===Rig Veda===

{{IAST|Śaunaka}}'s ''{{IAST|Caraṇa-vyuha}}'' lists five shakhas for the Rig Veda, the {{IAST|Śākala}}, {{IAST|Bāṣkala}}, {{IAST|Aśvalāyana}}, {{IAST|Śaṅkhāyana}}, and {{IAST|Māṇḍukāyana}}  of which only the {{IAST|Śākala}} and {{IAST|Bāṣkala}} and very few of Asvalayana are now extant.
The Bashkala recension of the Rigveda has the [[Khilani]] which are not present in the Shakala text but is preserved in one Kashmir manuscript (now at Pune). 
The ''Shakala'' has the [[Aitareya-Brahmana]], The Bashkala has the [[Kausitaki-Brahmana]].

[[Shri Guru Charitra|Shri Gurucharitra]] mentions 12 shakhas for the Rig Veda namely śrāvakā, śravaṇiyā, jaṭā, śaphaṭa, pāṭhakrama(2), daṇḍa, aśvalāyanī, śāṃkhāyanī, śākalā, bāṣkalā and māṇḍūkā (श्रावका, श्रवणिया, जटा, शफट, पाठक्रम(2), दण्ड, अश्वलायनी, शांखायनी, शाकला, बाष्कला, माण्डूका) in [[Ovi (poetry)|Ovi]] 35 to 38.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is, however, [[Kalpa (Vedanga)|Sutra literature]] from the {{IAST|Aśvalāyana}} shakha, 
both a shrauta sutra and a grhya sutra, both surviving with a commentary (''vrtti'') by Gargya Naranaya.
Gargya Naranaya's commentary was based on the longer commentary or ''bhashya'' by [[Devasvamin]], written in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue of Sanskrit, Pali, and Prakrit Books in the British Museum'' (1876) [https://archive.org/stream/cataloguesanskr03manugoog#page/n20/mode/2up p. 9].
B.K. Sastry, [http://yabaluri.org/TRIVENI/CDWEB/reviewsjul83.htm review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314084413/http://yabaluri.org/triveni/cdweb/reviewsjul83.htm |date=2016-03-14 }} of K. P. Aithal (ed.), ''Asvalayana Grihya Sutra Bhashyam of Devasvamin'', 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{IAST|Śaṅkhāyana}} shakha has been recently rediscovered in Banswada in Rajasthan where two septuagenarians are the last surviving practitioners. &lt;ref&gt; [http://indiafacts.org/after-millenia-tradition-reborn-vaidika-bharata]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yajur Veda===

{{IAST|Śaunaka}}'s ''{{IAST|Caraṇa-vyuha}}'' lists forty-two or forty-four out of eighty-six shakhas for the Yajur Veda, but that only five of these are now extant, with a sixth partially extant.
For the Yajur Veda the five (partially in six) shakhas are the (Vajasaneyi Madhandina, Kanva; [[Taittiriya]], Maitrayani, Caraka-Katha, Kapisthala-Katha).

The Yajurvedin shakhas are divided in ''Shukla'' (White) and ''Krishna'' (Black) schools. The White recensions have separate Brahmanas, while the Black ones have their(much earlier)  Brahmanas interspersed between the Mantras.
* Shukla Yajurveda: ''{{IAST|Vājasaneyi Samhita Madhyandina}}'' (VSM), ''{{IAST|Vājasaneyi Samhita Kānva}}'' (VSK): [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (ShBM, ShBK)
*Krishna Yajurveda: ''{{IAST|Taittirīya Saṃhita}}'' (TS) with an additional Brahmana, [[Taittiriya Brahmana]] (TB), ''{{IAST|Maitrayani Saṃhita}}'' (MS), ''{{IAST|Caraka-Katha Saṃhita}}'' (KS), ''{{IAST|Kapiṣṭhala-Katha Saṃhita}}'' (KapS).

===Sama Veda===
{{IAST|Śaunaka}}'s ''{{IAST|Caraṇa-vyuha}}'' lists twelve shakhas for the Sama Veda out of a thousand that are said to have once existed, but that of these only one or perhaps two are still extant.
The two Samaveda recensions are the Jaiminiya and Kauthuma.

In [[Ovi (poetry)|Ovi]] 203 to 210 of chapter 27, [[Shri Guru Charitra|Shri Gurucharitra]] mentions 8 of the thousands of shakhas namely āsurāyaṇīyā, vāsurāyaṇīya़ā, vātāntareyā, prāṃjalī, ṛjñagvainavidhā, prācīna yogyaśākhā, jñānayoga and rāṇāyaṇīyā (आसुरायणीया, वासुरायणीय़ा, वातान्तरेया, प्रांजली, ऋज्ञग्वैनविधा, प्राचीन योग्यशाखा, ज्ञानयोग, राणायणीया). Of these rāṇāyaṇīyā (राणायणीया) has 10 shakhas namely rāṇāyaṇīyā, sāṃkhyāyanī, śāṭhyā, mugdala, khalvalā, mahākhalvalā, lāṅ‌galā, kaithumā, gautamā and jaiminī (राणायणीया, सांख्यायनी, शाठ्या, मुग्दल, खल्वला, महाखल्वला, लाङ्‌गला, कैथुमा, गौतमा, जैमिनी).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Kauthuma shakha has the PB, SadvB, the [[Jaiminiya]] shakha has the [[Jaiminiya Brahmana]].

===Atharva Veda===

Only one shakha of an original nine is now extant for the Atharvaveda. The nine sakhas were Paippalada, Tauda, Mauda, Shaunakiya, Jajala, Jalada, Brahmavada, Devadarsa and Chaarana-Vaidya. In [[Ovi (poetry)|Ovi]] 217 to 219 of chapter 27, [[Shri Guru Charitra|Shri Gurucharitra]] mentions 9 shakhas namely paippalā, dāntā, pradāṃta, stotā, autā, brahmadā yaśadā, śaunakī, vedadarśā and caraṇavidyā (पैप्पला, दान्ता, प्रदांत, स्तोता, औता, ब्रह्मदा यशदा, शौनकी, वेददर्शा, चरणविद्या)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Shaunaka is the only shakha of the Atharvaveda for which both printed texts and an active oral tradition are known to still exist.

For the Atharvaveda, both the Shaunakiya and the Paippalada traditions contain textual corruptions, and the original text of the Atharvaveda may only be approximated from comparison between the two.

The Paippalada tradition was discontinued, and its text is known only from manuscripts collected since the 20th century. However some Orissa Brahmins [https://web.archive.org/web/20090106205840/http://www.vedamu.org/Media/audio/Atharvaveda.asp]  still continue the tradition of Paippalada.
No Brahmana is known for the Shaunaka shakha.
The Paippalada is possibly associated with the [[Gopatha Brahmana]].

In [[mathematics]] and its applications, the '''signed distance function''' (or '''oriented distance function''') of a set ''Ω'' in a [[metric space]] determines the distance of a given point ''x'' from the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of ''Ω'', with the sign determined by whether ''x'' is in ''Ω''. The function has positive values at points ''x'' inside ''Ω'', it decreases in value as ''x'' approaches the boundary of ''Ω'' where the signed distance function is zero, and it takes negative values outside of ''Ω''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1467575 | title=Level set based shape prior segmentation | author1=Chan, T. | author2=Zhu, W. | year=2005 | conference=IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the alternative convention is also sometimes taken instead (i.e., negative inside ''Ω'' and positive outside).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=368173 | title=Shape modeling with front propagation: a level set approach | author1=Malladi, R. | author2=Sethian, J.A. | author3=Vemuri, B.C. | journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence | volume=17 | issue=2 | year=1995 | doi = 10.1109/34.368173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

If ''Ω'' is a subset of a [[metric space]], ''X'', with metric, ''d'', then the ''signed distance function'', ''f'', is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
   d(x, \partial \Omega) &amp; \mbox{ if } x\in\Omega \\
  -d(x, \partial \Omega)&amp;  \mbox{ if } x\in\Omega^c
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt; d(x, \partial \Omega) := \inf_{y \in \partial \Omega}d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''inf'' denotes the [[infimum]].

==Properties in Euclidean space==

If ''Ω'' is a subset of the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with [[piecewise]] [[smooth function|smooth]] boundary, then the signed distance function is differentiable [[almost everywhere]], and its [[gradient]] satisfies the [[eikonal equation]]

: &lt;math&gt;|\nabla f|=1.&lt;/math&gt;

If the boundary of ''Ω'' is ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''k''≥2 (see [[differentiability classes]]) then ''d'' is ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; on points sufficiently close to the boundary of ''Ω''.{{sfn|Gilbarg|1983|loc=Lemma 14.16}} In particular, '''''on''''' the boundary ''f'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x) = N(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the inward normal vector field. The signed distance function is thus a differentiable extension of the normal vector field. In particular, the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] of the signed distance function on the boundary of ''Ω'' gives the [[Weingarten map]].

If, further, ''Γ'' is a region sufficiently close to the boundary of ''Ω'' that ''f'' is twice continuously differentiable on it, then there is an explicit formula involving the Weingarten map ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; for the Jacobian of changing variables in terms of the signed distance function and nearest boundary point. Specifically, if ''T''(∂''Ω'',''μ'') is the set of points within distance ''μ'' of the boundary of ''Ω'' (i.e. the [[tubular neighbourhood]] of radius ''μ''), and ''g'' is an absolutely integrable function on ''Γ'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{T(\partial\Omega,\mu)} g(x)\,dx = \int_{\partial\Omega}\int_{-\mu}^\mu g(u+\lambda N(u))\, \det(I-\lambda W_u) \,d\lambda \,dS_u,&lt;/math&gt;

where det indicates the [[determinant]] and ''dS''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that we are taking the [[surface integral]].{{sfn|Gilbarg|1983|loc=Equation (14.98)}}

==Algorithms==
[[Algorithm]]s for calculating the signed distance function include the efficient [[fast marching method]], [[fast sweeping method]]&lt;ref&gt;[ZHAO, Hongkai. A fast sweeping method for eikonal equations. Mathematics of Computation, 2005, 74. Jg., Nr. 250, S. 603-627.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the more general [[level-set method]].

== Applications ==
Signed distance functions are applied, for example, in [[computer vision]].

They have also recently been used in a method (advanced by [[Valve Corporation]]) to render [[smooth font]]s at large sizes (or alternatively at [[Pixel density#Named pixel densities|high DPI]]) using [[GPU]] acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1145/1281500.1281665 | title=Improved alpha-tested magnification for vector textures and special effects | journal=ACM SIGGRAPH 2007 courses on - SIGGRAPH '07 | pages=9 | date=2007 | first=Chris | last=Green| isbn=9781450318235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valve's method computed signed [[distance field]]s in [[Raster graphics|raster space]] in order to avoid the computational complexity of solving the problem in the (continuous) vector space. More recently piece-wise approximation solutions have been proposed (which for example approximate a Bézier with arc splines), but even this way the computation can be too slow for [[real-time rendering]], and it has to be assisted by grid-based [[discretization]] techniques to approximate (and cull from the computation) the distance to points that are too far away.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tHv6mcIIeo&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swarm Development Group''' ('''SDG''') is an American non-profit organization to advance the development of [[complex adaptive system]]-oriented [[agent-based model]]ing (ABM) tools initiated at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, US. It was formed in 1999 by a group of multidisciplinary scientists, researchers, and software developers, led by [[Chris Langton]]. Langton was also the founder of the emerging field of research called [[artificial life]].  The initial, primary, role for the SDG was to house continued development of the [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] simulation software after the software become independent of the SFI in 1999.

The role of the Swarm Development Group, has since expanded to include the co-ordination of a long-running conference SwarmFest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm:_SwarmFest SwarmFest]&lt;/ref&gt; during May, June, or July each summer – typically hosted by a different research university each year. Developers, users, and researchers gather to present research papers and discuss the state of Swarm and other agent-based modeling platforms like [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] (University of Chicago) and Ascape&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/es/dynamics/models/ascape/ Ascape]&lt;/ref&gt; (Brookings).  Typically, a wide range of academic, corporate, and government organizations are represented at SwarmFest.   The first SwarmFest was in 1998 while Swarm was still sponsored by the Santa Fe Institute.   From SwarmFest 2000 onwards, after the SDG was formed in late 1999, SwarmFests were organized directly by the SDG.

Recent SwarmFests have been held at a variety of institutions.  SwarmFest 2007 was held at DePaul University's School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.depaul.edu/news/default.asp School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown Chicago, Illinois.  SwarmFest 2008 was held at Northwestern Memorial Hospital/Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in downtown Chicago, Illinois.  Swarmfest 2008 had special focus areas on [[agent based modeling]] in [[Systems Biology]], and the implementation of [[agent based model]]s in [[high-performance computing]] environments. Between 2009 and 2012, SwarmFest was held at the Santa Fe Complex in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].  Swarmfest 2013 was held at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida July 8–9.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ucf.edu/swarmfest2013.html SwarmFest2013]&lt;/ref&gt; SwarmFest 2014 was held at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, IN from June 29 – July 1, 2014;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarmfest2014.org/ |title=SwarmFest2014 |accessdate=2014-05-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001230/http://www.swarmfest2014.org/ |archivedate=May 9, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC (in 2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarmfest2015.org/ |title=SwarmFest2015 |accessdate=2018-02-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117084740/http://www.swarmfest2015.org/ |archivedate=January 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Vermont in Burlington, VT (in 2016),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/swarmfest2016/ SwarmFest2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and Old Dominion University in Suffolk, VA (in 2017),&lt;ref&gt;[http://swarmfest2017.org/ SwarmFest2017]&lt;/ref&gt; were the selected venues.

'''''The Name of the Rose''''' ({{lang-it|Il nome della rosa}} {{IPA-it|il ˈnoːme della ˈrɔːza|}}) is the 1980 [[debut novel]] by [[Italy|Italian]] author [[Umberto Eco]]. It is a [[historical novel|historical]] [[murder mystery]] set in an Italian [[monastery]] in the year 1327; an intellectual mystery combining [[semiotics]] in fiction, biblical analysis, medieval studies and literary theory. It was translated into English by [[William Weaver]] in 1983.

The novel has sold over 50 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books]] ever published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Name-of-the-Rose/Umberto-Eco/e/9780156001311 Library Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921060952/http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Name-of-the-Rose/Umberto-Eco/e/9780156001311/ |date=2008-09-21 }} (no date)&lt;/ref&gt; It has received many international awards and accolades, such as the [[Strega Prize]] in 1981 and [[Prix Médicis|Prix Medicis Étrangère]] in 1982, and was ranked 14th on [[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|''Le Monde''{{'s}} 100 Books of the Century list]].

== Plot summary ==
In 1327, [[Franciscan|Franciscan friar]] [[William of Baskerville]] and Adso of [[Stift Melk|Melk]], a [[Benedictine]] [[Novice#Christianity|novice]] travelling under his protection, arrive at a Benedictine monastery in [[Northern Italy]] to attend a [[Disputation|theological disputation]]. This abbey is being used as an embassy between [[Pope John XXII]], and the Friars Minor, who are suspected of heresy. 

The monastery is disturbed by the death of Adelmo of Otranto, an illuminator revered for his illustrations. Adelmo was skilled at comical artwork, especially concerning religious matters. William is tasked by the monastery's [[abbot]], Abo of Fossanova to investigate the death, and he has a debate with one of the oldest monks in the abbey, Jorge of Burgos, about the theological meaning of laughter, which Jorge despises. 

The next day, a scholar of Aristotle and translator of Greek and Arabic, Venantius of Salvamec, is found dead in a vat of pig's blood. Previously, William and Adso had been prohibited from the library by the book keeper Malachi of Hildesheim, so they penetrate the labyrinth, discovering that there must be a hidden room, entitled the ''finis Africae.'' Bencio of Uppsala, a rhetoric scholar, reveals to William that Malachi, and his assistant Berengar of Arundel, had a homosexual relationship, until Berengar seduced Adelmo, who committed suicide out of religious shame. The only other monks who knew about the indiscretions were Jorge and Venantius.

By the day after, Berengar has gone missing, which puts pressure onto William. William learns of how Salvatore of Montferrat, and Remigio of Varagine, two cellarer monks, had a history with the [[Dulcinian|Dulcinian heretics]]. Meanwhile, Adso is seduced by a peasant girl, with whom he has his first sexual experience. After confessing to William, Adso is absolved, although he still feels guilty. Severinus of Sankt Wendel, the herbalist, tells William that Venantius's body had ink stains on the tongue and fingers, which suggests poison. William and Adso penetrate the library once more, discovering that Venantius had a book stolen from him, which they pursue. 

On the fourth day, Berengar is found drowned in a bath, although he bears ink stains similar to those of Venantius. Bernard Gui, a member of the [[Inquisition]], arrives to search for the murderer via Papal deduction. Due to this arrival, Gui arrests the peasant girl Adso loved, as well as Salvatore, accusing them both of heresy.

Remigio is interrogated by Gui, who scares him into revealing his heretic past, as well as falsely confessing to the crimes of the Abbey. Severinus then is found dead in his room, to which Jorge responds by leading a sermon about the coming of the Antichrist. 

Malachi returns to the early sermon that day near death, and his final words concern scorpions. Nicholas of Morimondo, the glazier, tells William that whoever is the librarian would then become the Abbot, and with new light, William goes to the library to search for evidence. The Abbot is distraught that William has not solved the crime, and that the Inquisition is undermining him, so he fires William. That night, William and Adso penetrate the library once more in search of the ''finis Africae.''

William and Adso discover Jorge waiting for them in the forbidden room. He says that he has been masterminding the Abbey for years, and his last victim is the Abbot himself, who has been led into the library. The Abbot suffocates, and Jorge tells them that Venantius's hidden book was [[Poetics_(Aristotle)|Aristotle's Second ''Poetics'']], which speaks of the virtues of laughter, something Jorge despises. Jorge poisoned the ink on the book, which is consumed when one turns the pages. Venantius was translating the book and died. Berengar found the body and disposed of it in pig's blood, fearing exposure, before reading the book himself and dying. Malachi was convinced by Jorge to retrieve the book, which was stashed with Severinus, so he kills Severinus and retrieves the book, before getting curious and dying as well. 

All of the murders time out with the [[Seven_trumpets|Seven Trumpets]], which call for objects falling from the sky (Adelmo threw himself from a tower), pools of blood, poison from water, bashing of the stars (Severinus was killed with his head bashed in with a celestial orb), scorpions, locusts, and fire. Jorge consumes the book's poisoned pages and uses Adso's lantern to start a fire, which burns down the library. As the fire spreads to the rest of the abbey, William laments his failure. Confused and defeated, William and Adso escape the abbey. Years later, Adso, now aged, returns to the ruins of the abbey and collects books that were salvaged from the fire, creating a lesser library.

== Major themes ==
{{essay-like|section|date=July 2011}}
Eco was a professor of [[semiotics]], and employs techniques of [[metanarrative]], partial fictionalization, and linguistic ambiguity to create a world enriched by layers of meaning. The solution to the central murder mystery hinges on the contents of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|book on Comedy]], which has been [[Lost work|lost]]. In spite of this, Eco speculates on the content and has the characters react to it. Through the motif of this lost and possibly suppressed book which might have aestheticized the farcical, the unheroic and the skeptical, Eco also makes an ironically slanted plea for tolerance and against dogmatic or self-sufficient metaphysical truths—an angle which reaches the surface in the final chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lars Gustafsson]], postscript to Swedish edition ''The Name of the Rose''&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Name of the Rose'' has been described as a work of [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref name=butler&gt;[[Christopher Butler]]. ''Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction''. [[OUP]], 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-280239-2}} — see pages 32 and 126 for discussion of the novel.&lt;/ref&gt; The quote in the novel, "books always speak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told", refers to a postmodern idea that all texts perpetually refer to other texts, rather than external reality, while also harkening back to the medieval notion that citation and quotation of books was inherently necessary to write new stories. The novel ends with irony: as Eco explains in his ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', "very little is discovered and the detective is defeated."&lt;ref name="postscript"&gt;"Postscript to the Name of the Rose", printed in ''The Name of the Rose'' (Harcourt, Inc., 1984), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; After unraveling the central mystery in part through coincidence and error, William of Baskerville concludes in fatigue that there "was no pattern." Thus Eco turns the modernist quest for finality, certainty and meaning on its head, leaving the overall plot partly the result of accident and arguably without meaning.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt;

== The aedificium's labyrinth ==
The mystery revolves around the abbey library, situated in a fortified tower—the aedificium. This structure has three floors—the ground floor contains the kitchen and [[refectory]], the first floor a [[scriptorium]], and the top floor is occupied by the library.&lt;ref&gt;First Day, Terce, paragraph 37&lt;/ref&gt; The two lower floors are open to all, while only the librarian may enter the last. A catalogue of books is kept in the scriptorium, where [[manuscript]]s are read and copied. A monk who wishes to read a book would send a request to the librarian, who, if he thought the request justified, would bring it to the scriptorium. Finally, the library is in the form of a labyrinth, whose secret only the librarian and the assistant librarian know.&lt;ref&gt;First Day, Terce, paragraph 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The aedificium has four towers at the four cardinal points, and the top floor of each has seven rooms on the outside, surrounding a central room. There are another eight rooms on the outer walls, and sixteen rooms in the centre of the maze. Thus, the library has a total of fifty-six rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Third Day, Vespers, paragraphs 50-56&lt;/ref&gt; Each room has a scroll containing a verse from the [[Book of Revelation]]. The first letter of the verse is the letter corresponding to that room.&lt;ref&gt;Third Day, Vespers, paragraphs 64-68&lt;/ref&gt; The letters of adjacent rooms, read together, give the name of a region (e.g. [[Hibernia]] in the West tower), and those rooms contain books from that region. The geographical regions are:
[[File:Labyrinthus Aedificium.svg|thumb|The aedificium's labyrinth]]
* ''Fons Adae'', 'The earthly paradise' contains Bibles and commentaries, East Tower
* ''Acaia'', Greece, Northeast
* ''Iudaia'', Judea, East
* ''Aegyptus'', Egypt, Southeast
* ''Leones'', 'South' contains books from Africa, South Tower
* ''Yspania'', Spain, Southwest outer
* ''Roma'', Italy, Southwest inner
* ''Hibernia'', Ireland, West Tower
* ''Gallia'', France, Northwest
* ''Germania'', Germany, North
* ''Anglia'', England, North Tower
Two rooms have no lettering - the easternmost room, which has an altar, and the central room on the south tower, the so-called ''finis Africae,'' which contains the most heavily guarded books, and can only be entered through a secret door. The entrance to the library is in the central room of the east tower, which is connected to the scriptorium by a staircase.&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Day, After Compline&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title ==
Much attention has been paid to the mystery the book's title refers to. In fact, Eco has stated that his intention was to find a "totally neutral title".&lt;ref name="postscript"/&gt; In one version of the story, when he had finished writing the novel, Eco hurriedly suggested some ten names for it and asked a few of his friends to choose one. They chose ''The Name of the Rose''.&lt;ref name="onLiterature"&gt;[[Umberto Eco]]. ''On Literature''. Secker &amp; Warburg, 2005, p. 129-130. {{ISBN|0-436-21017-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In another version of the story, Eco had wanted the neutral title ''Adso of Melk'', but that was vetoed by his publisher, and then the title ''The Name of the Rose'' "came to me virtually by chance." In the ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', Eco claims to have chosen the title "because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left".&lt;ref name="postscript" /&gt;

The book's last line, {{lang|la|"Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus"}} translates as: "the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names." The general sense, as Eco pointed out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Name of the Rose: Title and Last Line | url = http://www.umbertoeco.com/id-39/UmbertEco_Name_of_the_Rose_Umberto_Eco.html | accessdate = 2007-03-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070121024505/http://www.umbertoeco.com/id-39/UmbertEco_Name_of_the_Rose_Umberto_Eco.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that from the beauty of the past, now disappeared, we hold only the name. In this novel, the lost "rose" could be seen as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|book on comedy]] (now forever lost), the exquisite library now destroyed, or the beautiful peasant girl now dead.

The title is also an allusion to the [[nominalist]] position in the [[problem of universals]], taken by [[William of Ockham]]. According to nominalism, universals are bare names: there is not a universal rose, only the name ''rose''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crisismagazine.com/1987/war-of-the-rose-the-historical-context-of-the-name-of-the-rose&lt;/ref&gt;

This text has also been translated as "Yesterday's rose stands only in name, we hold only empty names." This line is a verse by twelfth century monk [[Bernard of Cluny]] (also known as Bernard of Morlaix). Medieval manuscripts of this line are not in agreement: Eco quotes one Medieval variant verbatim,&lt;ref&gt;Eco would have found this reading in, for example, the standard text edited by H.C. Hoskier (London 1929); only the Hiersemann manuscript preserves "Roma". For the verse quoted in this form before Eco, see e.g. Alexander Cooke, ''An essay on the origin, progress, and decline of rhyming Latin verse'' (1828), [https://books.google.com/books?id=u2_DthwIpvsC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22stat+rosa+pristina%22 p. 59], and Hermann Adalbert Daniel, ''Thesaurus hymnologicus sive hymnorum canticorum sequentiarum'' (1855), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6ScPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=%22stat+rosa+pristina%22 p. 290]. See further Pepin, Ronald E. "Adso's closing line in The Name of the Rose." ''American notes and queries'' (May–June 1986): 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; but Eco was not aware at the time of the text more commonly printed in modern editions, in which the reference is to [[Rome]] (''Roma''), not to a rose (''rosa'').&lt;ref&gt;As Eco wrote in [http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_author.html "The Author and his Interpreters"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101231523/http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_author.html |date=2008-01-01 }} "Thus the title of my novel, had I come across another version of Morlay's poem, could have been ''The Name of Rome'' (thus acquiring fascist overtones)".&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative text, with its context, runs: ''Nunc ubi Regulus aut ubi Romulus aut ubi Remus? / Stat Roma pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus''. This translates as "Where now is Regulus, or Romulus, or Remus? / Primordial Rome abides only in its name; we hold only naked names."&lt;ref name="cluny"&gt;See the source edition of 2009: Bernard of Cluny, De contemptu mundi: Une vision du monde vers 1144, ed. and trans. A. Cresson, Témoins de notre histoire (Turnhout, 2009), p.&amp;nbsp;126 (bk. 1, 952), and note thereto p.&amp;nbsp;257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the title of the book may be related to a poem by the Mexican poet and mystic [[Nun|Sor]] [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]] (1651–1695):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rosa que al prado, encarnada,&lt;br /&gt;
te ostentas presuntuosa&lt;br /&gt;
de grana y carmín bañada:&lt;br /&gt;
campa lozana y gustosa;&lt;br /&gt;
pero no, que siendo hermosa&lt;br /&gt;
también serás desdichada.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

which appears in Eco's ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', and is translated into English in "Note 1" of that book as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Red rose growing in the meadow,&lt;br /&gt;
you vaunt yourself bravely&lt;br /&gt;
bathed in crimson and carmine:&lt;br /&gt;
a rich and fragrant show.&lt;br /&gt;
But no: Being fair,&lt;br /&gt;
You will be unhappy soon.&lt;ref name="postscript" /&gt;&lt;!-- "soon", not "too", is the translation provided in Note 1; please do not alter it --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}

=== To other works ===
The name of the central character, William of Baskerville, alludes both to the fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] (compare ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' – also, Adso's description of William in the beginning of the book resembles, almost word for word, Dr. Watson's description of Sherlock Holmes when he first makes his acquaintance in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'') and to [[William of Ockham]] (see the next section). The name of the narrator, his apprentice Adso of Melk is among other things a pun on Simplicio from [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ''Dialogue''; Adso deriving from "ad Simplicio" ("to Simplicio"). Adso's putative place of origin, Melk, is the site of a famous medieval library, at [[Melk Abbey]]. And his name echoes the narrator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Watson (omitting the first and last latters, with "t" and "d" being phonetically similar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ipbOrcd8q9UC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq|title=Reading Eco: An Anthology|editor-first=Rocco|editor-last=Capozzi|date=February 22, 1997|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|isbn=9780253112828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blind librarian Jorge of [[Burgos]] is a nod to [[Argentina|Argentinian]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]], a major influence on Eco. Borges was blind during his later years and was also director of [[National Library of the Argentine Republic|Argentina's national library]]; his [[short story]] "[[The Library of Babel]]" is an inspiration for the secret library in Eco's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44089369|title=The library of Babel|last=1899-1986.|first=Borges, Jorge Luis,|date=2000|publisher=David R. Godine|others=Desmazières, Erik, 1948-, Hurley, Andrew, 1944-, Giral, Angela.|isbn=156792123X|location=Boston|oclc=44089369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Borges's stories, "[[The Secret Miracle]]", features a blind librarian. In addition, a number of other themes drawn from various of Borges's works are used throughout ''The Name of the Rose'': [[labyrinth]]s, mirrors, sects and obscure manuscripts and books.

The ending also owes a debt to Borges' short story "[[Death and the Compass]]", in which a detective proposes a theory for the behavior of a murderer. The murderer learns of the theory and uses it to trap the detective. In ''The Name of the Rose'', the librarian Jorge uses William's belief that the murders are based on the [[Revelation of John]] to misdirect William, though in Eco's tale, the detective succeeds in solving the crime.

The "poisoned page" motif may have been inspired by [[Alexandre Dumas]]' novel ''[[La Reine Margot (novel)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1845). It was also used in the film ''[[Il giovedì]]'' (1963) by Italian director [[Dino Risi]].&lt;ref name="Lolito"&gt;notes to {{cite book|title=Lolito|author=Daniele Luttazzi|pp=514–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar story is associated with the Chinese erotic novel ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]'', translated as ''The Golden Lotus'' or ''The Plum in the Golden Vase''.

Eco seems also to have been aware of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s short story "[[Debits and Credits (Kipling)|The Eye of Allah]]", which touches on many of the same themes, like optics, manuscript illumination, music, medicine, priestly authority and the Church's attitude to scientific discovery and independent thought, and which also includes a character named John of Burgos.

Eco was also inspired by the 19th century Italian novelist [[Alessandro Manzoni]], citing ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' as an example of the specific type of historical novel he purposed to create, in which some of the characters may be made up, but their motivations and actions remain authentic to the period and render history more comprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postscript to The name of the rose|last=Umberto.|first=Eco,|date=1984|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|others=Eco, Umberto.|year=|isbn=9780151731565|edition=1st|location=San Diego|pages=|oclc=10996520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the book, there are [[Latin]] quotes, authentic and apocryphal. There are also discussions of the philosophy of [[Aristotle]] and of a variety of [[Millenarism|millenarist]] heresies, especially those associated with the [[fraticelli]]. Numerous other philosophers are referenced throughout the book, often anachronistically, including [[Wittgenstein]].

=== To actual history and geography ===
[[File:La Sacra ammantata dalla neve.jpg|thumb|[[Sacra di San Michele|Saint Michael's Abbey]], in the [[Susa Valley]], [[Piedmont]]]]

William of Ockham, who lived during the time at which the novel is set, first put forward the principle known as [[Ockham's Razor]], often summarised as the ''[[dictum]]'' that one should always accept as most likely the simplest explanation that accounts for all the facts (a method used by William of Baskerville in the novel).

The book describes monastic life in the 14th century. The action takes place at a [[Benedictine]] abbey during the controversy surrounding the [[Apostolic poverty]] between branches of [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]; (see [[Franciscan#Renewed controversy on the question of poverty|renewed controversy on the question of poverty]]). The setting was inspired by monumental [[Sacra di San Michele|Saint Michael's Abbey]] in [[Susa Valley]], [[Piedmont]] and visited by Umberto Eco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avosacra.it/sito/curiosita_sulla_sacra.html|title=AVOSacra - Associazione volontari Sacra di San Michele|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2014}} The Spirituals abhor wealth, bordering on the [[Apostolics]] or [[Dulcinian]] [[heresy]]. The book highlights this tension that existed within [[Christianity]] during the medieval era: the Spirituals, one faction within the Franciscan order, demanded that the Church should abandon all wealth, and some heretical sects began killing the well-to-do, while the majority of the Franciscans and the clergy took to a broader interpretation of the gospel. Also in the background is the conflict between [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] and [[Pope John XXII]], with the Emperor supporting the Spirituals and the Pope condemning them.

A number of the characters, such as the [[Inquisitor]] [[Bernard Gui]], [[Ubertino of Casale]] and the [[Minorite]] [[Michael of Cesena]], are historical figures, though the novel's characterization of them is not always historically accurate. Eco notes in a companion book that he had to situate the monastery in mountains so it would experience early frosts, in order for the action to take place at a time when the historical Bernard Gui could have been in the area. For the purposes of the plot, Eco needed a quantity of pig blood, but at that time pigs were not usually slaughtered until a frost had arrived. Later in the year, Gui was known to have been away from Italy and could not have participated in the events at the monastery.

Part of the dialogue in the inquisition scene of the novel is lifted bodily from the historical Gui's own Manual for Inquisitors, the ''Practica Inquisitionis Heretice Pravitatis'', for example the dialogue: "What do you believe?" "What do you believe, my Lord?" "I believe in all that the Creed teaches." "So I believe, my Lord." Bernardo then points out that what Remigius the cellarer is saying is not that Remigius believes in the Creed, but that Remigius believes that ''Bernardo'' believes in the Creed. This is an example given by the historical Gui in his book to warn inquisitors against the slipperiness and manipulation of words by heretics. This use of Gui's own book by Eco is self-consciously of a piece with his perspective that "books always speak of other books". In this case, the author integrates the historical Bernard Gui's text into his own through the fictional character of Bernardo.

Adso's description of the portal of the monastery is recognizably that of the portal of the church at [[Moissac|Moissac, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=cJRV1c57xfgC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=eglise+moissac+eco&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j21a4pin7R&amp;sig=DD4AIlhaW9YeYpObKApyUXvVsYE&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4-uj62f_YAhUxja0KHc0TBR4Q6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=eglise%20moissac%20eco&amp;f=false|title=Signs of Change: Transformations of Christian Traditions and Their Representation in the Arts, 1000-2000|last=Petersen|first=Nils Holger|last2=Clüver|first2=Claus|last3=Bell|first3=Nicolas|date=2004|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9042009993|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Alighieri]] and his ''[[Divine Comedy|Comedy]]'' are mentioned once in passing. There is also a quick reference to a famous "Umberto of Bologna"—Umberto Eco himself.

'''Tickling games''' are interpersonal or social activities involving the [[tickling]] of one person by another. Some people find tickling to not only be a pleasurable experience, but also an [[erotic]] one. They may be [[sexual arousal|sexually excited]] by being tickled or by tickling another person.&lt;ref name=Love&gt;Love B., ''Encyclopedia of Unusual Sex Practices.'' New York: Barricade Books Inc.; 1992. p280-281.&lt;/ref&gt; Some engage in tickling games as part of a social act.

==Terminology==
'''[[Knismesis and gargalesis|Knismolagnia]]''' is the experience of "arousal from [[tickling]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page=375 |title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unususal Sexual Practices|first=Anil|last=Aggrawal|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|year=2009|ISBN=978-1-4200-4308-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Acarophilia]]''', often confused{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} with knismolagnia, refers to arousal from scratching.

Excessive tickling has been described as a primary sexual obsession and, under these circumstances, is sometimes considered a form of [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis|Ellis H.]] ''Studies in the psychology of sex.'' Vol. iii. Philadelphia: FA Davis Co.; 1926&lt;/ref&gt; People whose [[human sexuality|sexuality]] is based almost solely on tickling can be said to have a tickling fixation. This [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] may also exist outside of sexual contexts.

==Overview==
Consensual tickling can be regarded as a form of [[physical intimacy]] as it involves the touching of one person's body by another. It could serve as a [[human bonding|bonding experience]] between friends, or a simple act of familiarity and trust. Between adults, it sometimes functions as an outlet for sexual energy, with [[erotic]] games, [[foreplay]] and [[Human sexual activity|sex]] being the primary methods of doing such.

==Tickling games==

Some people take part in tickling games or contests which test their endurance to being tickled, for amusement, erotic pleasure, or other reasons. These games may involve some form of [[Bondage (BDSM)|physical restraint]] of the person to be tickled to prevent them protecting the ticklish spots or otherwise interfering with the game. Common positions for tickling are the [[over-arm tie]], the [[hogtie bondage|hogtie]], [[Spreadeagle (position)|spread-eagle]], with the person being [[rope bondage|tied up]], [[Bondage cuffs|cuffed]] or in [[stocks]]. The restraints may be left loose to increase the amount of possible movement, but short of the person being able to protect the ticklish spots. On the other hand, some participants prefer very tight bondage. The tied person may also be [[blindfold]]ed to increase the anxiety and surprise element.

The objective of such games is to generate uncontrollable writhing, struggling, laughing and vocalizations etc., from the person being tickled, while the person tries to control such reactions, without the ability to physically defend the ticklish spots.

In [[dominance and submission]] scenarios, [[sexual partner]]s may agree upon a [[safeword]] such as "falafel", "watermelon", or "bicycle" to signal that tickling should stop.

'''Trait leadership''' is defined as integrated patterns of personal characteristics that reflect a range of individual differences and foster consistent leader effectiveness across a variety of group and organizational situations (Zaccaro, Kemp, &amp; Bader, 2004).&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Zaccaro"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen J. Zaccaro|first1=George Mason University|title=Trait-Based Perspectives of Leadership|date=January 2007|url=http://depts.washington.edu/nwphli/2006/docs/Trait_based_perspectives_of_leadership-2.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of trait leadership is developed from early leadership research which focused primarily on finding a group of heritable attributes that differentiate leaders from nonleaders. [https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1133&amp;context=ojwed Leader effectiveness] refers to the amount of influence a leader has on individual or group performance, followers’ satisfaction, and overall effectiveness (Derue, Nahrgang, Wellman, &amp; Humphrey, 2011). &lt;ref name="The Leadership Quarterly"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=The Leadership Quarterly|title=Personality predictors of leadership styles and the self–other agreement problem|date=13 March 2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Reinout_De_Vries/publication/229316315_Personality_predictors_of_leadership_styles_and_the_self-other/links/0fcfd50f9718514c46000000/Personality-predictors-of-leadership-styles-and-the-self-other.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have argued that leadership is unique to only a select number of individuals and that these individuals possess certain immutable traits that cannot be developed (Galton, 1869). Although this perspective has been criticized immensely over the past century, scholars still continue to study the effects of personality traits on leader effectiveness. Research has demonstrated that successful leaders differ from other people and possess certain core personality traits that significantly contribute to their success. Understanding the importance of these core personality traits that predict leader effectiveness can help organizations with their leader selection, training, and development practices (Derue et al., 2011).

== History of research ==
The emergence of the concept of trait leadership can be traced back to [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s [[Great Man theory|"great man" theory]], which stated that "The History of the World [...] was the Biography of Great Men."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequent commentators interpreted this view to conclude that the forces of extraordinary leadership&lt;ref&gt;
Carlyle in [[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History|''On Heroes'']] did not use the word "leadership" in his discussion of the hero as divinity, as prophet, as poet, as priest, as man of letters, and as "king" ; he mentions "leader" and "leaders" only 6 times (once quite disparagingly) in that work.

shape history (Judge, Piccolo, &amp; Kosalka, 2009). Influenced by Carlyle, [[Francis Galton]] in ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) took this idea further. Galton found that leadership was a unique property of extraordinary individuals and suggested that the traits which leaders possessed were immutable and could not be developed. Throughout the early 1900s, the study of leadership focused on traits.  Cowley (1931) commented that the approach to the research of leadership has usually been and should always be through the study of traits (Cowley, 1931). Many theorists, influenced by Carlyle and Galton, believed that trait leadership depended on the personal qualities of the leader, however, they did not assume that leadership only resides within a select number of people (Judge, Bono, Ilies, &amp; Gerhardt, 2002). This trait perspective of leadership was widely accepted until the late 1940s and early 1950s, when researchers began to deem personality traits insufficient in predicting leader effectiveness (Stogdill, 1948; Mann, 1959).

In 1948, Stogdill stated that leadership exists between persons in a social situation, and that persons who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. This statement has been cited ubiquitously as sounding the death knell for trait-leadership theory. Furthermore, scholars commented that any trait's effect on leadership behavior will always depend on the situation (Huges, Ginnett, &amp; Curphy, 1996; Yukl &amp; Van Fleet, 1992).  Subsequently, leadership stopped being characterized by individual differences, and behavioral and situational analyses of leadership took over and began to dominate the field of leadership research (Bass, 1990). During this period of widespread rejection, several dominant theories took the place of trait leadership theory, including Fiedler's (1967) contingency model, Blake and Mouton's (1964) managerial grid, Hersey and Blanchard's (1969) situational leadership model, and transformational and transactional leadership models (Avolio, Sosik, Jung, &amp; Berson, 2003; Bass, 1985; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, &amp; Fetter, 1990).

Despite the growing criticisms of trait leadership, the purported basis for the rejection of trait-leadership models began to encounter strong challenges (Kenny &amp; Zaccaro, 1983; Lord, DeVader, &amp; Alliger, 1986) in the 1980s. Zaccaro (2007) pointed out that even Stogdill's (1948) review, although cited as evidence against leader traits, contained conclusions supporting that individual differences could still be predictors of leader effectiveness. With an increasing number of empirical studies directly supporting trait leadership (Judge et al., 2002; Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies, 2004), traits have reemerged in the lexicon of the scientific research into leadership. In recent years, the research about leader traits has made some progress in identifying a list of personality traits that are highly predictive of leader effectiveness. Additionally, to account for the arguments for situational leadership, researchers have used the [[round-robin design methodology]] to test whether certain individuals emerge as leaders across multiple situations (Kenny &amp; Zaccaro, 1983). Scholars have also proposed new ways of studying the relationship of certain traits to leader effectiveness. For instance, many{{quantify|date=September 2014}} suggest the integration of trait and behavioral theories to understand how traits relate to leader effectiveness (Derue et al., 2011). Furthermore, scholars have expanded their focus and have proposed looking at more malleable traits (ones susceptible to development) in addition to the traditional dispositional traits as predictors of leader effectiveness (Hoffman, Woehr, Maldagen-Youngjohn, &amp; Lyons, 2011). Context is only now beginning to be examined as a contributor to leaders' success and failure. [[Productive narcissism|Productive narcissistic]] CEOs like [[Steven Jobs]] of Apple and [[Jack Welch]] of GE have demonstrated a gift for creating [[innovation]], whereas leaders with idealized traits prove more successful in more stable environments requiring less innovation and [[creativity]] (Maccoby, 2007).

Cultural fit and leadership value can be determined by evaluating an individual’s own behavior, perceptions of their employees and peers, and the direct objective results of their organization, and then comparing these findings against the needs of the company (Bass, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. and Riggio, R. E. (Eds.). (2006). Transformational Leadership (2nd ed). Mahwah,  NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leader traits ==
The investigations of leader traits are always by no means exhaustive (Zaccaro, 2007). In recent years, several studies have made comprehensive reviews about leader traits which have been historically studied (Derue et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2011; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007). There are many ways that traits related to leadership can be categorized; however, the two most recent categorizations have organized traits into (1) demographic vs. task competence vs. interpersonal and (2) distal (trait-like) vs. proximal (state-like): 

=== Demographic, task competence and interpersonal leadership ===
Based on a recent review of the trait leadership literature, Derue and others (2011) stated that most leader traits can be organized into three categories: demographic, task competence, and interpersonal attributes. For the demographics category, gender has by far received the most attention in terms of leadership; however, most scholars have found that male and female leaders are both equally effective. Task competence relates to how individuals approach the execution and performance of tasks (Bass &amp; Bass, 2008). Hoffman grouped intelligence, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and Emotional Stability into this category. Lastly, interpersonal attributes are related to how a leader approaches social interactions. According to Hoffman and others (2011), Extraversion and Agreeableness should be grouped into this category.

=== Distal (trait-like) vs. proximal (state-like) ===
Recent research has shifted from focusing solely on distal (dispositional/trait-like) characteristics of leaders to more proximal (malleable/state-like) individual differences often in the form of knowledge and skills (Hoffman et al., 2011). The hope is that emergence of proximal traits in trait leadership theory will help researchers answer the ancient question: are leaders born or made?  Proximal individual differences suggest that the characteristics that distinguish effective leaders from non-effective leaders are not necessarily stable through the life-span, implying that these traits may be able to be developed. Hoffman and others (2011) examined the effects of distal vs. proximal traits on leader effectiveness. He found that distal individual differences of achievement motivation, energy, flexibility, dominance, honesty/integrity, self-confidence, creativity, and charisma were strongly correlated with leader effectiveness. Additionally, he found that the proximal individual differences of interpersonal skills, oral communication, written communication, management skills, problem solving skills, and decision making were also strongly correlated with leader effectiveness. His results suggested that on average, distal and proximal individual differences have a similar relationship with effective leadership (Hoffman et al., 2011).

== Trait-leadership model ==
Zaccaro and colleagues (2004) created a model to understand leader traits and their influence on leader effectiveness/performance. This model, shown in the figure below, is based on other models of leader traits and leader effectiveness/performance (Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, Fleishman, &amp; Reiter-Palmon, 1993; Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al., 2000) and rests on two basic premises about leader traits. The first premise is that leadership emerges from the combined influence of multiple traits as opposed to emerging from the independent assessment of traits. Zaccaro (2001) argued that effective leadership is derived from an integrated set of cognitive abilities, social capabilities, and dispositional tendencies, with each set of traits adding to the influence of the other. The second premise is that leader traits differ in their proximal influence on leadership. This model is a multistage one in which certain distal attributes (i.e. dispositional attributes, cognitive abilities, and motives/values) serve as precursors for the development of proximal personal characteristics (i.e. social skills, problem solving skills and expertise knowledge) (Ackerman &amp; Humphreys, 1990; Barrick, Mitchell, &amp; Stewart, 2003; Chen, Gully, Whiteman, &amp; Kilcullen, 2000; Schneider, Hough, &amp; Dunnette, 1996; Kanfer, 1990, 1992; Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al., 2000). Adopting this categorization approach and based on several comprehensive reviews/meta-analysis of trait leadership in recent years (Derue et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2010; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007), we tried to make an inclusive list of leader traits (Table 1). However, the investigations of leader traits are always by no means exhaustive (Zaccaro, 2007).

'''Table 1. Leader Traits based on Zaccaro’s (2004) Model'''
|-
| [[Extraversion]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; represents the tendency to be sociable, assertive, active, and to experience positive affects, such as energy and zeal. In Judge and other’s (2002) [[meta-analysis]], Extraversion was significantly positively related to leadership ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|r]] = .31).
|-
| [[Agreeableness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; refers to the tendency to be trusting, compliant, caring, and gentle. The relationship between Agreeableness and leadership is still ambiguous. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Agreeableness was not significantly related to leadership (r = .08).
|-
| [[Conscientiousness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; it comprises two related facets, namely achievement and dependability. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Conscientiousness was significantly positively related to leadership (r = .28).
|-
| [[Openness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; the disposition to be imaginative, nonconforming, unconventional, and autonomous. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Openness was found to be significantly positively related with leadership (r = .24).
|-
| [[Neuroticism]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; represents the tendency to exhibit poor emotional adjustment and experience negative affects, such as anxiety, insecurity, and hostility. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Neuroticism was significantly negatively correlated with (r = -.24).
|-
| [[Honesty]]/[[integrity]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| Defined as the correspondence between work and deed, and as being truthful and non deceitful (Locke, 1991). In Hoffman and other’s (2011) meta analysis, honesty/integrity was found to be positively related to leadership effectiveness of others and surrounding factors(r = .29).
|-
| [[Charisma]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| Charismatic leaders are able to influence followers by articulating a compelling vision for the future, arousing commitment to organizational objectives and inspiring commitment and a sense of self-efficacy among followers. Hoffman and others (2011) found it has a significant influence on leadership (r = .57).
|-
| [[Intelligence]] (Distal - Cognitive Abilities)|| Intelligence is regarded as the most important trait in psychology. It has been identified as one of the most critical traits that must be possessed by all leaders (Judge et al., 2004).
|-
| [[Creativity]] (Distal - Cognitive Abilities)|| Creativity has been proposed as an important component of effective leadership; Hoffman and others (2011) found a significant relationship between creativity and leader effectiveness (r = .31).
|-
| Achievement motivation (Distal - Motive/Value)|| The motivation to achieve has been proved to have significant relationship with leader effectiveness (r = .23) (Judge et al., 2002).
|-
| [[Need for power]](Distal - Motive/Value)|| Characterized by the satisfaction leaders derive from exerting influence over the attitudes and behaviors of others. Need for power has a positive relationship with leader effectiveness (McClelland &amp; Boyatzis, 1982).
|-
| Oral/written communication (Proximal - Social Skills)|| Oral and written communication skills are found to be significantly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| [[Interpersonal skills]] (Proximal - Social Skills)|| Including a broad range of skills associated with un understanding of human behavior and the dynamics of groups (Locke, 1991; Yukl, 2006), interpersonal skills were found to be significantly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| General [[problem solving]] (Proximal - Problem Solving)|| General problem solving skills were found to be one of the factors most strongly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| [[Decision making]] (Proximal - Problem Solving)|| Decision skills were also found to be one of the factors most strongly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| Technical knowledge (Proximal - Expertise Knowledge)|| Technical knowledge includes methods, processes, and equipment for conducting the specialized activities of the managers’ organizational unit (Yukl, 2006). It has been proved to be positively correlated with leader effectiveness (Bass, 1990).
|-
| [[Management]] skills (Proximal - Expertise Knowledge)|| Given that leaders’ key responsibilities involve coordinating the work of multiple constituents, the ability to manage is likely crucial to leader effectiveness. This relationship has also been proved significant (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|}

== Other models of trait leadership ==
Multiple models have been proposed to explain the relationship of traits to leader effectiveness.  Recently, integrated trait leadership models were put forward by summarizing the historical findings and reconciling the conflict between traits and other factors such as situations in determining effective leadership (Derue et al., 2011; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007). In addition to Zaccaro’s Model of Leader Attributes and Leader Performance described in the previous section, two other models have emerged in recent trait leadership literature. The Leader Trait Emergence Effectiveness (LTEE) Model, created by Judge and colleagues (2009), combines the behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology theories of how personality traits are developed into a model that explains leader emergence and effectiveness. Additionally, this model separates objective and subjective leader effectiveness into different criterion. The authors created this model to be broad and flexible as to diverge from how the relationship between traits and leadership had been studied in past research. Another model that has emerged in the trait leadership literature is the Integrated Model of Leader Traits, Behaviors, and Effectiveness (Derue et al., 2011). This model combines traits and behaviors in predicting leader effectiveness and tested the mediation effect of leader behaviors on the relationship between leader traits and effectiveness. The authors found that some types of leader behaviors mediated the effect between traits and leader effectiveness. The results of Derue and colleagues' (2011) study supported an integrated trait-behavioral model that can be used in future research.

== Criticisms of trait leadership ==
Although there has been an increased focus by researchers on trait leadership, this theory remains one of the most criticized theories of leadership. Over the years, many reviewers of trait leadership theory have commented that this approach to leadership is “too simplistic” (Conger &amp; Kanugo, 1998), and “futile” (House &amp; Aditya, 1997). Additionally, scholars have noted that trait leadership theory usually only focuses on how leader effectiveness is perceived by followers (Lord et al., 1986) rather than a leader’s actual effectiveness (Judge et al., 2009). Because the process through which personality predicts the actual effectiveness of leaders has been relatively unexplored (Ng, Ang, &amp; Chan, 2008), these scholars have concluded that personality currently has low explanatory and predictive power over job performance and cannot help organizations select leaders who will be effective (Morgeson &amp; Ilies, 2007). Furthermore, Derue and colleagues (2011) found that leader behaviors are more predictive of leader effectiveness than are traits.

Another criticism of trait leadership is its silence on the influence of the situational context surrounding leaders (Ng et al., 2008). Stogdill (1948) found that persons who are leaders in one situation may not be leaders in another situation. Complimenting this situational theory of leadership, Murphy (1941) wrote that leadership does not reside in the person, and it usually requires examining the whole situation. In addition to situational leadership theory, there has been growing support for other leadership theories such as transformational, transactional, charismatic, and authentic leadership theories. These theories have gained popularity because they are more normative than the trait and behavioral leadership theories (Schaubroeck, Lam, &amp; Cha, 2007).

Further criticisms include the failure of studies to uncover a trait or group of traits that are consistently associated with leadership emergence or help differentiate leaders from followers (Kenny &amp; Zacarro, 1983). Additionally, trait leadership’s focus on a small set of personality traits and neglect of more malleable traits such as social skills and problem solving skills has received considerable criticism.  Lastly, trait leadership often fails to consider the integration of multiple traits when studying the effects of traits on leader effectiveness (Zaccaro, 2007).

== Implications for practice ==
Given the recent increase in evidence and support of trait leadership theory (Ng et al., 2008), scholars have suggested a variety of strategies for human resource departments within organizations.  Companies should use personality traits as selection tools for identifying emerging leaders (Ng et al., 2008). These companies, however, should be aware of the individual traits that predict success in leader effectiveness as well as the traits that could be detrimental to leader effectiveness. For example, while Derue and colleagues (2011) found that individuals who are high in Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness are predicted to be more likely to be perceived as successful in leadership positions, Judge, Woolf, Hurst, &amp; Livingston (2006) wrote that individuals who are high in narcissism are more likely to be a liability in certain jobs. Narcissism is just one example of a personality trait that should be explored further by HR practitioners to ensure they are not placing individuals with certain traits in the wrong positions.

Complementing the suggestion that personality traits should be used as selection tools, Judge and colleagues (2002) found that the Big Five Personality traits were more strongly related to leadership than intelligence. This finding suggests that selecting leaders based on their personality is more important than selecting them based on intelligence. If organizations select leaders based on intelligence, it is recommended by Judge and colleagues (2002) that these individuals be placed in leadership positions when the stress level is low and the individual has the ability to be directive.

Another way in which HR practitioners can use the research on trait leadership is for leadership development programs. Although inherent personality traits (distal/trait-like) are relatively immune to leadership development, Zaccaro (2007) suggested that proximal traits (state-like) will be more malleable and susceptible to leadership development programs. Companies should use different types of development interventions to stretch the existing capabilities of their leaders (Zaccaro, 2007).

There is also evidence to suggest that Americans have an Extrovert Ideal, which dictates that people, most times unconsciously, favor the traits of extroverted individuals and suppress the qualities unique to introverts (Cain, 2012). Susan Cain's research points to a transition sometime around the turn of the century during which we stopped evaluating our leaders based on character and began judging them instead based on personality. While both extroverted and introverted leaders have been shown to be effective, we have a general proclivity towards extroverted traits, which when evaluating trait leadership, could skew our perception of what's important.

'''Transition Engineering''' is the professional engineering discipline that deals with the application of the principles of science to the design, innovation and adaptation of engineered systems that meet the needs of today without compromising the ecological, societal and economic systems on which future generations depend to meet their own needs. Just as [[safety]] considerations are incorporated into design parameters in all engineering fields, [[sustainability]] thinking is built into Transition Engineering. Transition engineering is emerging as a field to give engineers the tools necessary to address sustainability in design and management of engineered systems. Transition engineering is a cross-disciplinary field that addresses the issues of future resource availability and identifies, then realizes opportunities to increase [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]].

== Overview ==

Engineering professions emerge when new technologies, new problems or new opportunities arise. This was the case when [[safety engineering]] grew in the early 1900s to combat the high workplace injury and fatality rates. In the 1960s, [[Environmental engineering]] emerged as a discipline to reduce industrial pollution and mitigate impacts on [[environmental health]] and [[water quality]]. [[Quality engineering]] came about with the increase in [[mass production]] techniques during WWII and the need to confirm the quality of the products.

There are two serious problems driving the emergence of Transition Engineering; the exponential growth in the concentration of [[carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere]] and the lack of growth and imminent decline of conventional oil production known as [[peak oil]]. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere recently exceeded 400ppm, a level that Earth has not known for 800,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=carbon_ppm_milestone&gt;{{cite news|last=Montaigne|first=Fen|title=Record 400ppm CO2 milestone 'feels like we're moving into another era'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/14/record-400ppm-co2-carbon-emissions|publisher=Guardian Environment Network|accessdate=2013-05-19|location=London|date=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Transition engineering aims to take advantage of the current access to the remaining lower cost and higher [[EROI]] energy resources to re-develop all aspects of urban and industrial engineered systems to adapt as fossil fuel use is dramatically reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Susan Krumdieck|Krumdieck]]|first=Susan|title=Transition Engineering of Urban Transportation for Resilience to Peak Oil Risks|journal=ASME 2011 International Mechanical Engineering Congress|date=2011-11-17|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The idea behind transition engineering has sprouted from many different roots, both technical and non-technical. The concept of [[sustainable development]] has been around since 1987 and the problem of [[sustainability]] was a driving force in the development of transition engineering. The [[Transition Town]] movement provided further inspiration as it showed that there were many groups of people around the world motivated to prepare for [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]]. [[Transition towns]] and [[ecovillages]] demonstrate the need for engineers to build systems that manage un-sustainable risks and provide people with [[sustainable]] options. Engineers are ethically required to "hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public" and answer society's need for sustainable development&lt;ref name=Code_of_ethics&gt;{{cite web|last=National Society of Professional Engineers|title=NSPE Code of Ethics for Engineers|url=http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/CodeofEthics/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of [[safety engineering]] provided much of the inspiration for transition engineering. At the beginning of the 1900s, business owners viewed workplace safety as a wasted investment and politicians were slow to change. After the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire]] in [[New York City]] killed 156 trapped workers, 62 engineers came together to investigate how to make the workplace a safer place to be. This eventually lead to the formation of the [[American Society of Safety Engineers]].&lt;ref name=ASSE_history&gt;{{cite web|last=American Society of Safety Engineering|title=About ASSE -History|url=http://www.asse.org/about/history.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As safety engineering manages the risks of unsafe conditions, transition engineering manages the risks of unsustainable conditions. To give engineers a better grasp of sustainability, transition engineering defines the problem as UN-sustainability. This is similar to the problem of un-safe conditions that is the purpose of safety engineering. We do not necessarily know what a perfectly safe system looks like, but we do know what unsafe systems look like and how to improve them; the same applies to unsustainability of systems. By reducing unsustainability issues we take steps in the right direction&lt;ref name=survival_spectrum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krumdieck|first=Susan|title=The Survival Spectrum, the key to Transition Engineering of Complex Systems|journal=University of Canterbury, Mechanical Engineering|year=2010|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Seven Step Method ==

The Transition Engineering method involves 7 steps to help engineers develop projects to deal with changing unsustainable activities. As a discipline, Transition Engineering recognizes that "Business as Usual" projections of future scenarios from past trends are not valid because the underlying conditions have changed sufficiently from the conditions of the past. For example, the projection of future oil supply in 2050 from data prior to 2005 would give an expectation of a 50% increase in demand over that time-frame. However, the actual production rate of conventional oil has not increased since 2005 and is projected to decline by more than 50% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krumdieck|first=Susan |author2=Page, S. |author3=Dantas, A.|title=Urban form and long-term fuel supply decline: A method to investigate the peak oil risks to essential activities|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|year=2010|volume=5|issue=44|pages=306–322|doi=10.1016/j.tra.2010.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#History: First, historical data are gathered and historical trends understood in cultural and political contexts. All historical aspects of the system are considered. Transition Engineering investigates the effects that technology and social developments have on energy and resource demand. How did we get to where we are now? Why are we here? What factors put us here?
#Present: This step assesses the current situation. All current capabilities, investments, assets and condition/age of the assets, and liabilities are considered. Energy use is audited and its end-use behavior is assessed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Organisation for Standardisation|title=ISO 500001 Energy Management|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso50001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Future: Scenarios from all areas of study are considered to get a consensus view of both inertial trajectories of current trends, and limitations of carrying capacity and resource scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Shift Project|title=Science for Energy Scenarios|url=http://science-and-energy.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transition Engineers apply the science of climate change, petroleum geology, ecology, hydrology etc. to describe the "forward operating environment". Determining the probability of each future outcome creates a future operating environment envelope. This gives engineers and decision makers constraints with varying levels of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Energy Agency|title=IEA Scenarios and Projections|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/scenariosandprojections/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US Energy Information Administration|title=International Energy Outlook|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Path Break Concepts: Innovation takes place in this step when current assumptions about behavior and economics are set aside in favor of consideration of the forward operating environment at the end-point of the time-frame of study. The TE innovator places him/herself in the future and uses the future design constraints to come up with realistic and workable concepts. The path-break concept is not futuring.
#Backcasting: The path break concepts are analysed to see how they differ from the current situation. In this step, the barriers and strategies to change existing systems are also analysed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=The Natural Step|title=Backcasting|url=http://www.naturalstep.org/backcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Trigger Events: Although existing systems carry a large amount of inertia, if the right trigger is applied at the right time, a great amount of change is possible. Triggers can be either disastrous events such as economic collapse, or external changes such as a corporate merger, new law, or new staff. They can also be engineered change projects. The trigger event for safety engineering was the “Triangle shirtwaist factory fire.” (reference) The challenge is to communicate the advantages and benefits of adaptive change, and to initiate a disruptive event that enables an organization to get out of the rut. See [[Change Management]]
#Shift Projects: Finally, by planning for future supply and demand, change projects are realized to make best use of the current available resources. Through these projects, society will be more resilient to peak oil and climate change events.

== Global Association for Transition Engineering (GATE) ==

GATE opened the first group in the UK in Feb 2014. GATE is a Professional Engineering Institution; a membership association and learned society, and comprises an emerging network of engineers and non-engineers that share the idea that engineers are responsible for changing engineered systems in order to adapt to reducing fossil fuel and other unsustainable resources. Transition Engineering is a change management discipline. Like Safety Engineering, Transition Engineering uses and audit and stock-take of current system design and operation to quantify the risks to essential activities and resources over a time-frame of study. The time-frame of study should be commensurate with the lifetime of the assets involved in the activity. An activity is anything that the engineered system supports, for example manufacturing, sewage treatment, mobility, or food preservation. Transition Engineering recognizes that the analytical methods of strategic analysis over a life-cycle time-frame are at odds with most economic analyses that discount values with time. The strategic analysis carried out by Transition Engineers seeks to avoid stranded investment by recognizing resource risks. A classic example of stranded investments is the North Atlantic Cod Fishery - where the largest number of bottom trawling ships (e.g. those ships responsible for destroying the Cod spawning beds) were manufactured in the year that the fish stocks collapsed.&lt;ref name="fishwatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishwatch.gov/seafood_profiles/species/cod/species_pages/atlantic_cod.htm|title=NOAA - FishWatch: Atlantic Cod|publisher=fishwatch.gov|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=International Society of Transition Engineering|title=ISTE|url=http://www.transitionengineering.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Global Association for Transition Engineering is registered charity number 1166048, registered with the UK Charity Commission on 14 March 2016. It is a "Charitable Incorporated Organisation" or CIO.

The '''Under2 Coalition''' is a coalition of subnational governments that aims to achieve [[Climate change mitigation|greenhouse gases emissions mitigation]]. It started as a [[memorandum of understanding]], which was signed by twelve founding jurisdictions on May 19, 2015 in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article21407862.html |title=Jerry Brown signs non-binding climate pact with other leaders|newspaper=sacbee|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was originally called the '''Under2 MOU''', it became known as the '''Under2 Coalition''' in 2017. As of September 2018, the list of signatories has grown to over 220 jurisdictions which combined encompasses 1.3 billion people and 43% of the [[world economy]].&lt;ref name=coalition&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.under2coalition.org/news/biggest-ever-gathering-global-states-and-regions-climate-action|title=Under2 Coalition|newspaper=Under2 Coalition |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Under2 MOU was conceived through a partnership between the governments of [[California]] and [[Baden-Württemberg|Baden-Wurttemberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://prospect.org/article/california-champions-cross-border-climate-innovations |title=California Champions Cross-Border Climate Innovations|newspaper=The American Prospect|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[The Climate Group]] acting as secretariat.&lt;ref name="The Climate Group"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Under2 Coalition |url=https://www.theclimategroup.org/project/under2-coalition|newspaper=The Climate Group|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and intent==
The intent of the memorandum signatories is for each to achieve [[Greenhouse gas]] "emission reductions consistent with a trajectory of 80 to 95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 and/or achieving a per capita annual emission goal of less than 2 metric tons by 2050.&lt;ref name="MOU"&gt; [http://under2mou.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Under2-MOU-English.pdf Under2 MOU, "Global Climate Leadership Memorandum Of Understanding"], section II.A.&lt;/ref&gt; The signatories believe these actions are consistent with findings of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) of what is necessary to avoid a 2 degree Celsius rise in average global temperatures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Industry/2015/07/02/California-driving-global-low-carbon-effort/5581435831547/ |title=California driving global low-carbon effort|newspaper=UPI|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Climate Panel Cites Near Certainty on Warming|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/science/earth/extremely-likely-that-human-activity-is-driving-climate-change-panel-finds.html|last=Gillis|first=Justin|date=2013-08-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MOU"/&gt; Organizers are concerned that a rise in global temperature above 2 degrees Celsius would cause widespread environmental harm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Signatories to the memorandum are asked to submit a plan to meet the target reduction of green house gas emissions by 2 metric tons per capita by 2050.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each of the governments also pledges to assist each other with scientific research, sharing of the available technologies and best practices in energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=David|year=2016|title=Cross-Border Constraints on Climate Change Agreements: Legal Risks in the California-Quebec Cap-and-Trade Linkage|url=|journal=Environmental Law Reporter|volume=46|pages=10478–10495|via=Fusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorandum was developed just before the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] also known as [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 21]] or [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Paris Agreement]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Under2 MOU allows subnational governments such as cities, counties and states to highlight their work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
Subnational governments like cities, states and provinces have traditionally relied on national governments to take the lead on transnational climate governance aimed at addressing climate change mitigation through inter-governmental agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/eba672c654472911b7c57372d3d413b0/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1586351|title=Common But Differentiated Responsibilities Beyond the Nation State: How Is Differential Treatment Addressed in Transnational Climate Governance Initiatives? - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some subnational governments have expressed frustration at the inaction of national leaders and took it upon themselves to create the subnational Under2 MOU agreement.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnosky|first=Anthony D.|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul R.|last3=Hadly|first3=Elizabeth A.|date=2016-03-15|title=Avoiding collapse: Grand challenges for science and society to solve by 2050|url=http://assets.elementascience.org/articles/94|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420225121/http://assets.elementascience.org/articles/94|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-04-20|journal=Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.12952/journal.elementa.000094|issn=2325-1026}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major difference between an international treaty and the Under2 MOU agreement between subnational governments is that the Under2 MOU is non-binding.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

In December 2015, [[California]] and [[Baden-Württemberg|Baden-Wurttemberg]], who spearheaded the Under 2 MOU, announced that [[The Climate Group]] would take on the role of secretariat for the pact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theclimategroup.org/news/baden-wurttemberg-and-california-welcome-43-new-signatories-under-2-mou-initiative|title=Baden-Württemberg and California welcome 43 new signatories to the Under 2 MOU|newspaper=The Climate Group|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been efforts in the past to organize subnational governments to address climate change most notably through the [[Cities for Climate Protection program|Cities for Climate Protection Program]] - an effort associated with the International Union of Local Authorities and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. At its peak in 2010 the program had 700 municipal members who were required to provide among other things inventories and targets for greenhouse emissions. the International Union of Local Authorities provided technical assistance to the municipalities engaged in this planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2015/08/13/how-us-cities-dropped-climate-protection-commitments-in-response-to-mainstream-political-opposition-and-programmatic-stagnation/|title=How US cities dropped climate protection commitments in response to mainstream political opposition and programmatic stagnation|date=2015-08-13|newspaper=USAPP|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Under2 MOU was conceived many subnational governments had taken the initiative to create a [[List of climate change initiatives|climate action plan]].  The purpose of a climate action plan is to identify the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by the jurisdiction and, in many cases, provide strategies to lower or stop greenhouse gas emissions altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bassett |first=Ellen|last2=Shandas|first2=Vivek|date=2010-09-29|title=Innovation and Climate Action Planning |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2010.509703|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=76|issue=4|pages=435–450 |doi=10.1080/01944363.2010.509703|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some governments have found that the data produced by the climate action plan increases transparency and helps with longterm planning to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=El gobernador de Jalisco da conferencia durante COP22|url=http://www.animalpolitico.com/2016/11/gobernador-jalisco-da-una-conferencia-cop22-soluciones-bajas-emisiones/ |website=www.animalpolitico.com|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since signatories to the Under2 MOU submit their action plans as an appendix to the document this is the first time some cities and states around the world are coming up with plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their jurisdiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">'''Virtual reality sex''' (in short: VR sex) is a technology that allows the user to receive tactile sensations from remote participants, or fictional characters through the use of computer-controlled [[sex toys]]. Usually the user also wears a [[virtual reality headset]] so he/she can see and interact with the partner.

==Examples==

===BKK Cybersex Cup===
The BKK Cybersex Cup consists of a [[virtual reality headset]] and masturbation cup. It also comes with a mobile app which allows the users to customize their own 3D girlfriend based on their preferred body, skin tone, hairstyle and outfit. The masturbation cup has a built in motion sensor which is capable of simulating the movement and transmission of the action via Bluetooth to any smartphone that runs the 3D girlfriend app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ean-online.com/company-news/crowdfunging-campaign-for-bkk-cybersex-cup/ |title=Crowdfunding Campaign for BKK Cybersex Cup – EAN Online Erotic Industry News |publisher=Ean-online.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Mandy Stadtmiller2015-05-30 03:04:23 UTC |url=http://mashable.com/2015/05/29/virtual-reality-sex/#tG.aEr8Wkkqn |title=Virtual reality sex is coming — and the toys are already here |publisher=Mashable.com |date=2015-05-29 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/for-science-i-tested-one-of-the-worlds-first-virtual-reality-sex-toys |title=For Science, I Tested the Latest Virtual Reality Sex Toy |publisher=VICE |date=2015-11-27 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===VirtuaDolls===
The American company Eos created the VirtuaDolls which consists a silicone sheath into which a man inserts his [[penis]]. In concert with a mechanized gripper for “intelligent stroke movement,” this allows for the VirtuaDolls controller to sync up the sensation to the action. For immersive experience, it also comes with six interchangeable sleeves with different textures to allow for varying sensations and contains a pressure sensor that determines the occupant’s position within the sheath. An optional vacuum attachment adds suction capabilities and an easy-clean system. The VirtuaDolls controller is also bundled with a video game titled ''Girls of Arcadia'' in which users carry out missions to rescue girls and are rewarded by the end of the missions in having sex with them. In January 2016, the company launched an [[Indiegogo]] campaign to raise funds for the product, but after being swamped with orders, the creators suspended the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jasper Hamill |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/virtual-reality-male-sex-toy-7299079 |title=Makers of 'mindblowing' sex robot with virtual vagina swamped with orders - Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fulton |first=Will |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/virtuadolls-indiegogo/ |title=Why VirtuaDolls VR Porn Controller Suspended Its Indiegogo |publisher=Digital Trends |date=2016-02-04 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, it was relaunched on Indiegogo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris |first=Tatiana |url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/the-adult-vr-game-controller-virtuadolls-is-back-on-indiegogo-3433313 |title=The adult VR game controller 'VirtuaDolls' is back on IndieGoGo |publisher=Gamezone.com |date=2016-02-05 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, women in the [[United States]] have been represented at lower rates than men in both [[science]] and [[engineering]] [[college]] programs and careers.  Over time, this pattern has led to a significantly higher concentration of male professional engineers compared to women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Rossi, Alice 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Polacheck, Soloman 1978&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, this disparity has led to careers in [[Education]], [[History]], [[English language|English]], [[Humanities]] and the like to be seen as “feminine” careers and areas of study.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt; Some Feminist theorists suggest that these social and historical factors have perpetuated women’s low participation rates in engineering over time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt; Numerous explanations and points of view have been offered to explain women's participation rates in this field. These explanations include beliefs regarding women's lack of interest in science and engineering, their physiological inability to succeed as engineers, and environmental factors in women's [[childhood]]s that discourage them from entering science and engineering fields.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;

Negative perceptions of female engineers may play a role in explaining their low numbers within the field.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Graham, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent statistics, college-educated women are less than half as likely as men to be employed in science and engineering jobs.

Two forms of [[activism]] tasked with raising awareness include both organizations on college campuses and those geared towards society at large.

==History==

In the early 1960s, a President’s Commission on the Status of Women emphasized the need for women to fill a shortage of jobs in [[teaching]], science, and engineering.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; In 1960, however, less than 1% of recorded engineers were women. Furthermore, female engineers that were employed were less likely to have obtained advanced degrees in their field than men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; Research has shown that these trends were reflective of both men's and women's dominant opinions regarding women's role in the workforce throughout this period. At the time, both groups largely emphasized women’s roles as traditional homemakers and mothers rather than as serious scientists or engineers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pendleton, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite changing political views towards women and minorities during the [[civil rights movement]], college women’s enrollment rates into engineering were still relatively low when compared to men's.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; For example, in a study of over 440 college campuses nationwide throughout 1971-72, approximately 17% of polled Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) majors were women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Montinelli, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; This coincides with the fact that, throughout this period, there was little recorded formal discrimination in the American educational system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;Cole, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Women who actually applied to engineering programs were enrolled at similar rates to men. Early increases in these numbers did occur, though, throughout 1968-78. During this period, there was an estimated 100% increase in the number of female science and engineering majors throughout the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated11/&gt; However, it was also estimated that they still accounted for less than 4.9% of such majors throughout this period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11/&gt;

Despite women’s increasing numbers in science and engineering fields, [[affirmative action]] and similar efforts were implemented throughout the U.S. to increase STEM enrollment rates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated10/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;Cummings,1970&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed, among other factors, that early socialization by elementary schools and social stereotyping was to blame for this issue.  In the mid 1980s, a shortage of qualified engineers was predicted by the year 2000, further instigating efforts to both recruit and retain women in these fields.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;Freckman, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  Existing groups that promote women in engineering: ASCE Task force Committee on Women in Civil Engineering, Extraordinary Women Engineers Project Coalition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=dKptTDl6eUcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=changing+our+world++hatch&amp;ots=bwbqjKQJTG&amp;sig=KktAZNNjtdSF8EqIbchgJKGNvM8|title=Changing Our World: True Stories of Women Engineers|last=Hatch|first=Sybil E.|date=2006-01-01|publisher=ASCE Publications|isbn=9780784408353|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics and relevant data==
[[File:Percentage of Engineering Bachelor’s Degrees Awarded to Women by School.png|right|300px|Percentage of Engineering Bachelor’sDegrees Awarded to Womenby School]]
According to the [[National Science Foundation]], overall, women have higher college graduation rates compared to men. However, men disproportionately outnumber women in the number of Science and Engineering (STEM) degrees received.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;National Science Foundation, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1989 and 2008, the approximate percentages of women receiving their [[Bachelor’s degree]] in any engineering field were 17% and 19.6%, respectively. The percentage increase in the computer science industry displayed was larger, increasing from approximately 10% in 1989 to 21% in 2008.

Concerning [[ethnic group|minority]] ([[African American]], [[Hispanic]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]) women, the percentages of engineering bachelor’s recipients increased from approximately 7% in 1989 to 12% in 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14/&gt; The percentages of minority  women with engineering [[doctoral degrees]] were much lower, however, barely increasing from 1% throughout this period. [[Southeast Asians|Asian]] women actually accounted for a lower rate of engineering bachelor's degree during this time period, from approximately 2.5% to 5%. PhD  recipient rates from 1989 to 2008 were nearly identical to minority women’s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14/&gt;

According to the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] in 2004, there were approximately 192,900 female engineers throughout the country, compared with over 1,515,000 men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;National Society of Professional Engineers, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Of these women, approximately 1/3 of them were [[software engineers]] (62,900). Women were also employed in higher rates than men in [[environmental engineering]] (9% to 4%) and [[chemical engineering]] (7% to 4%). However, they were less likely than men to be employed in [[mechanical engineering]] (8% to 17%) and [[electrical engineering]] (12% to 18%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated15/&gt;

In 1999, women made up approximately one quarter of all engineers under the age of 25, whereas they constituted one-twentieth of those over age 49. This age discrepancy has been attributed to women's notable, but recent, movement into engineering within the past few decades.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15/&gt; According to the Society of Women Engineers, women and other minorities constituted approximately 16%-17% of engineering graduate students from 1990-2003. Furthermore, in 2003 approximately 20% (approximately 12,000)of new engineers were women, compared with about 80% of men (approximately 49,000).&lt;ref name=autogenerated16&gt;Society of Women Engineers, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations for low participation rates==

Numerous explanations have come forth to account for the lack of women engineering majors in college. Historically, women have both majored and remained in college engineering programs at lower rates than men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated26&gt;Corell, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons used to explain this trend has been a supposed overemphasis on the traditional "male breadwinner" household model when it comes to organizing families today.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt; Although the percentage of families organized according to this model has declined considerably in recent decades, many individuals, including women, still see adult men as the primary [[wage]] earners in households where men were present.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27&gt;Seymore, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Even if this is the case women represent close to  60% of university graduates, including biology mayors. [https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=72 IES:  What is the percentage of degrees conferred by race and sex?]

Recently, greater emphasis has been given to women’s socialization throughout their childhoods and [[adolescence]]s. Socialized early in their childhoods, girls are said to be raised in societies where science, engineering, and mathematics are largely promoted as “male [[professions]]”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt; The [[media (communication)|media]] has also been criticized for giving little representation of prominent female engineers.  Instead, some scholars feel the media is guilty of perpetuating [[gender stereotype]]s by representing women in traditionally “female occupations” such as [[nurses]], school teachers, [[housewives]], etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated24/&gt;

[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has suggested that subjects such as Engineering may be less popular among women because they do not accommodate some of their typical interests: caring for/interaction with living beings may be one example. This is not necessarily to suggest, with [[Lawrence Summers]], that women are incapable, or less fundamentally capable than men at Engineering, but rather that they tend to be less interested in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-6usiN4uoA&amp;list=PLytTJqkSQqtr7BqC1Jf4nv3g2yDfu7Xmd&amp;index=19&lt;/ref&gt; The principle strength of this argument is that it explains the phenomenon without drawing tenuous links with difficult-to-measure influences such as 'culture' and 'role-models', but it is also to some degree reinforced by academic consensus, which was identified in the 'Social and Political views of American Professors' paper as 75% in favor of the claim that differing interests between men and women caused the disparity, rather than discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.147.6141&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of [[role model]]s, and especially female role models, has also been emphasized as a means of increasing women’s numbers in engineering.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated28"&gt;Seymore, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Women with one or two engineering parents are said to be moderately more likely to major in such a field themselves.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt; Additionally, encouragement from teachers, [[school counselor|counselor]]s, [[Academic administration|administrator]]s, etc. are all said to positively impact women's chances at moving into engineering. Better high school preparation in mathematics, [[biology]], and [[chemistry]] were also said to better women's chances for an engineering career. However, according to some scholars, the above factors do not occur in a great enough number to compensate for women's current disadvantages.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated28/&gt; Thus, generally speaking, it is said that hopeful women engineers will remain largely [[discriminate]]d against and have inadequate resources at improving their outlook unless substantial [[social change]]s are made.

==Socialization and societal outcomes==

===Educational outcomes===
It has been suggested that, due to the social and environmental factors described above, [[high school]] and college women tend to have lower [[confidence]] levels in their mathematical ability compared to men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated26/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated24/&gt; Shelley Correll's observations using the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS) revealed that, on average, women who positively assessed their math ability before testing had a higher average score than women who did not rate themselves well. Moreover, [[longitudinal studies]] on both sets of women also revealed that the ones who did rate themselves highly were more likely to subsequently enroll in college-level [[calculus]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated26/&gt;

Goldman later discovered that positive [[math]] assessments played an important role in women's choices to enroll in engineering.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24/&gt; However, other studies have before and since emphasized women’s early life experiences in shaping their career aspirations. Feeling they are not skilled enough to successfully complete an engineering program or other advanced mathematical and/or science courses, some women perform poorly and thus complete a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated26/&gt; If at all, differences in men’s and women’s innate spatial memories were reported to account for about a 2:1 ratio of male-female engineers. Instead, in the U.S [[labor force]], there is approximately less than 1 female engineer for every 10 males.&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&amp;#x5D;&lt;/sup&gt; According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2011, 13.6% of those employed in Architecture and engineering occupations were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/cps/wlf-databook-2012.pdf|title=Women in the Labor Force: A Databook|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies have also shown that a lack of pre-degree training in high school did not sufficiently explain women engineer's [[dropping out|dropout]] rates later in college.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt; Analyses of males' and females' grades revealed that, on average, women who had dropped out of engineering programs were either approximately as qualified or even more qualified than their male peers who continued their studies. Additionally, surveyed female dropouts revealed that very few (approximately 9.8% to 11.5%) actually dropped out because they viewed the work as too difficult.&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated28/&gt; Among their primary reasons for dropping were: loss of interest in the field, the inability to see themselves as professional engineers, inappropriate behavior from male [[peer group|peer]]s, and the highly pressured environment professional engineers worked under.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt; A phenomenon called "[[stereotype threat]]" may also help explain women's educational outcomes. Because of existing stereotypes regarding women's ability to excel in mathematics-intensive coursework, they are sometimes said to perform worse than they originally would have had the stereotypes not existed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated34&gt;Ceci and Williams, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace outcomes===

According to Hersch, a significant number of [[corporation]]s have increased the number of women engineers hired in the past couple of decades in response to [[political]] and social pressures.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30&gt;Hersh, Marion 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their engineering expertise, women engineers are said to bring unique [[ethics of care|caring]] and non-technical problem solving skills along with an enlarged customer support base. Typically preceding these management changes were other policy shifts such as: 1) a company move from heavy to light [[manufacturing]]; 2) a greater emphasis on service and professional jobs; 3) improved working conditions, and 4) a general improvement of women’s status on the job.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated31&gt;Preston, Anne 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, however, engineering is said to remain a highly gender-stratified occupation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated16/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt; Among the engineers currently employed, men substantially outnumber women. On average, men are also said to hold higher supervisory and [[management]] positions than females, whose [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] prospects are usually more limited.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated31/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated32&gt;Devine, Fiona 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This reason, family and child obligations, and [[layoff]]s combined to account for a drop-out rate of approximately 20% among all female engineers from 1982-1990—a statistic over twice of that of men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated31/&gt;

It has been suggested by Crompton and Sanderson that discrimination in high-level technical jobs is actually ''decreasing'' on the whole.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;  Moreover, they suggest that [[equal opportunity|equal-opportunities]] legislation ensures that men and women with appropriate [[human capital]] are treated equally in recruitment chances. Direct and indirect forms of exclusion were no longer said to be significant in sustaining gender segregation in engineering positions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt; Statistically, [[gender pay gap]]s in engineering are actually lower than the national average. In STEM jobs, female wages are approximately 84% of men’s, compared to 71% in non-STEM jobs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated12/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt; Moreover, it has also been stated that traditionally stereotypical images of engineering as “dirty”, “rugged”, or “manly” jobs are gradually being eroded—opening employment opportunities for prospective women nationwide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated31/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated21/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated23/&gt;

However, recent evidence suggests that gender discrimination is still a significant issue affecting women’s confidence and performance in STEM careers. According to Logel, interacting with [[sexist]] men may trigger a stressed-induced phenomenon called “social identity threat” in women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated33&gt;Logel, Christine 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Women engineers who faced regular exposure to sexist men on the job were said perform worse on aptitude tests than women who weren’t exposed to such individuals. While women who worked in low-[[stress (psychological)|stress]] environments reported higher levels of confidence and [[self-actualization|self-fulfillment]], discriminated women were reportedly more likely to suppress their feelings and/or let their problems go unannounced.&lt;ref name=autogenerated33/&gt; Such behavior is said to be detrimental to both the women engineers themselves and the workplace, where sexist behavior is likely to persist.

==Initiatives to promote engineering to women==

As science and engineering have become more pervasive in [[society]], women's participation rates in these fields have not seen a proportionate increase.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated18&gt;Cuny and Aspray, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cuny and Aspray, this may potentially result in a lack of women's [[aptitude|talent]] in the fields, which may further reduce employment opportunities for both employer and employee &lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt; In order to make engineering more appealing to young women, a broader acceptance criteria into such programs has been proposed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt; Specifically, admissions boards are encouraged to take other admissions factors into account such as: [[extracurricular]] accomplishments, applicants' desire to be admitted into the program, and [[communication skills]]. Additionally, it has been strongly suggested that admissions boards prioritize ethnic diversity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated19&gt;Milgrim, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has revealed that [[high school]]- and college-age women commonly see the STEM environment as a "chilly, male-dominated" environment that is highly impersonal and unsympathetic to women's unique needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated22&gt;Vrcelj and Krishnan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated21&gt;Morganson and Jones, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated23&gt;Bona and Kelly, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "Social [[coping (psychology)|coping]]" has thus been a mechanism which has been cited to help women deal with the challenges and [[stress (psychological)|stress]] associated with engineering's rigorous coursework and careers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21/&gt; [[Multiple regression]] analysis has revealed that high levels of social coping were a stronger predictor of commitment to staying in engineering studies for women than men. Put more simply, women who used social coping were less likely than men (who were actually found to be ''more'' likely) to drop out of college engineering programs. Consequently, school [[teacher]]s, staff, parents, and other figures have been encouraged to provide a more accommodating environment for social coping.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated19/&gt;

An increase in influential female role models has also been cited as a way to increase women's engineering enrollment rates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23/&gt; [[Survey methodology|survey]]s collected among 141 female engineering students across the country have shown that many women who placed high confidence levels in their math and science ability also had parents who modeled less traditional [[gender roles]]. Thus, to increase women's enrollment and retention rates in engineering, scholars have suggested that a de-emphasis away from the highly popularized "[[nuclear family]]" model is crucial.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated25&gt;Haines and Wallace,2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated24&gt;Goldman and Hewitt, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) was established in May 27, 1950&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by [[Elsie Eaves]] as a non-profit educational and service organization that attempted both to raise awareness of female engineers and increase their enrollment rates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16/&gt; SWE held their first meeting with 50 engineers at Cooper Union in NJ.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With membership now exceeding 17,000 members in over 300 student organizations across the United States, the SWE's principal aims are to inform female students about opportunities in the field of engineering and to encourage female engineers to attain high levels of achievement.
