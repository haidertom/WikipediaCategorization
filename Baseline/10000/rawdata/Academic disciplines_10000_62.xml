      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5360">'''Astronomical Image Processing System''' ''++'' is a software package whose development was started in the early nineties, written almost entirely in [[C++]], and which initial goal was to replace the by then already aging [[Astronomical Image Processing System|AIPS]] software. It has now been reborn as CASA and is the basis of the image processing systems for several next-generation radio telescopes including [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]], [[eVLA]], and [[ASKAP]].

==Early history==
In 1988-89, the Director of [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] (NRAO), Paul Vanden Bout, convened an independent review panel, the Software Advisory Group (SWAG) to produce recommendations for the future of processing software for NRAO. SWAG was chaired by Tim Cornwell, and its members included Geoff Croes, Gareth Hunt, Jan Noordam, and [[Ray Norris (astrophysicist)|Ray Norris]].  SWAG recommendations were that:

* All data processing in NRAO should be coordinated by a new Assistant Director for Computing
* AIPS should be re-designed and re-implemented following certain general guidelines
* An equal amount of attention should be devoted to single-dish software.

In late 1990 the NRAO Director accepted the recommendations, and the task of defining the new package began.

The project was originally an effort by several astronomical institutes together in a consortium, the [[Australia Telescope National Facility]] (ATNF), the [[Jodrell Bank]] Observatory (JBO) and the [[MERLIN]]/VLBI National Facility (MERLIN/VLBI), the [[Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association]] ([[BIMA]]), the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] (NRAO) and the Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy [[ASTRON]].

==Features==
AIPS++ provides facilities for calibration, editing, image formation, image enhancement, and analysis of images and other [[astronomy|astronomical]] data. A major focus is on reduction of data from both single-dish and [[aperture synthesis]] [[radio telescopes]]. Although the tools provided in AIPS++ are mainly designed for processing data from varieties of radio telescopes, the package is expected to also be useful for processing other types of astronomical data and images. However, the reduction of most data from imaging array detectors is performed using [[IRAF]] instead.

AIPS++ is structured as a library of tools at the lower levels, designed to replace AIPS of more monolithic applications. In general, the counterpart of an AIPS task is an AIPS++ tool function, although the toolkit structure of AIPS++ will generally mean that these functions are more fine-grained, except for the more integrated tools at the higher levels (such as map). The counterparts of AIPS adverbs are the parameters of AIPS++tool functions. The command-line interpreter in AIPS is POPS, while the counterpart in AIPS++ is [[Glish]]. The code used as standard in most astronomical institutes is still AIPS, as AIPS++ is usually not yet considered sufficiently reliable and usable.

Like most research astronomy software, it is available for all major operating systems except Microsoft Windows.

==AIPS++/CASA==
On August 25, 2004 the AIPS++ code base was re-organized to a more modular structure; since then it is referred to as CASA ("Common Astronomy Software Applications"). CASA consists of a suite of C++ libraries derived from the original AIPS++ tasks. The Glish scripting system is being replaced by Python bindings, a system known as "CASApy". The CASA software is no longer developed by the consortium, but mainly within NRAO for use on the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]].

The core of the old AIPS++ libraries, now known as [https://github.com/casacore/casacore CasaCore] are still being maintained and developed by the original consortium members. A separate Python interface is available known as [https://github.com/casacore/python-casacore python-casacore] (formerly "Pyrap"). Python-casacore is mainly developed within ATNF and ASTRON for replacing Glish for the [[Australia Telescope Compact Array]], [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope|WSRT]] and [[LOFAR]]. CASA also uses these core libraries but not python-casacore.

'''Alternative Energy Institute''' (also known as '''AEI''') was [[West Texas A&amp;M University]]'s alternative energy research branch. Formed in 1977, the program was nationally and internationally recognized, and along with research provides education and outreach around the U.S. and the globe.

==History==
[[Image:Panorama Czarnkow.jpg|thumb|The Alternative Energy Institute Regional Wind Test Center]]

'''AEI''' was founded at '''West Texas State University''' (now ''West Texas A&amp;M University'') in 1977 by
Dr. Vaughn Nelson, Dr. Earl Gilmore and Dr. Robert Barieau during the [[1973 oil crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Carr | first = David | title = Regional Wind Test Center - Our History | work = Windtestcenter.org | publisher = Alternative Energy Institute | date = February 22, 2010 | url = http://www.windtestcenter.org/history/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120313193942/http://www.windtestcenter.org/history/ | archivedate = March 13, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The physics department at West Texas State was already experimenting with wind power and these three individuals took the initiative to found a department to concentrate upon the study of wind. The basic goals of the department were:
* To test wind turbine designs.
* Improve on current aerodynamic design.
* Teach public about the state of wind &amp; solar technology.

===First Decade: 1977 - 1987===
Initially, much of the organization's focus was on small wind turbine research and improving blade designs. At this time they installed test turbines and water pumping applications throughout Texas. These projects allowed AEI to develop and improve upon blade design theory and production. During this period the organization also provided consulting in Latin America, Jamaica, Hawaii, and Europe. There, AEI trained villages and groups in wind energy systems.

At this time AEI operated from three locations: one off-campus and two on-campus. At these locations they customized testing on blade designs, turbine generator units, and complete designs.

===Second Decade: 1987 - 1997===
[[Image:Solbuilding-15.jpg|thumb|AEI's Solar Energy Building]]

During this decade the organization focused on green building projects. The most notable of these was AEI's Solar Energy Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Solar Building 1993 Photo Gallery | work = Windenergy.org | publisher = Alternative Energy Institute | date = May 11, 2009 | url = http://www.windenergy.org/multimedia/?page_id=195&amp;album=5&amp;gallery=17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611131747/http://www.windenergy.org/multimedia/?page_id=195&amp;album=5&amp;gallery=17 | archivedate = June 11, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finished in 1993, the building served as the main site for AEI's operations for seventeen years. The building covered all of the organization's energy usage, including an on-site 10&amp;nbsp;kW Bergey wind turbine installation, and 3&amp;nbsp;kW of photovoltaics.

Several electric vans were donated to the organization at this time, two of which were maintained for several years. These vans were used to collect data and complete local wind energy projects, as well as to give campus and test site tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = LaFleur | first = Oral | contribution = Proceedings of the 2002 ASEE Gulf-Southwest Annual Conference | date = 2002 | title = Exploring Renewable Energy Education | editor = The University of Louisiana at Lafayette | volume = 4 | pages = 11 | publisher = American Society for Engineering Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1995, AEI began working with the [[Texas General Land Office]] to provide Texas Wind Data to the public. While the GLO data sites have since been decommissioned,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mapping and Monitoring Sustainable Energy |date=September 20, 2010 |url=https://roadwaytocollege.com/go/page.pl/000000A/http/www.glo.state.tx.us/sustain/mapping.html |format=Cached |accessdate=December 7, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the organization still collects, analyzes and publishes Texas Wind Data for the general public.

===Now: 1998 - Present===
AEI is currently focusing on developing a new degree plan at WTAMU&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Ranaivo | first = Yann | title = New WT research head focused on turbines, degree program | work = Amarillo Globe-News | publisher = Morris Publishing Group | date = September 16, 2010 | url = http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2010-09-16/new-wt-research-head-focused-turbines-degree-program}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as continuing its research on green energy systems. In terms of turbine testing, the organization focuses on small blade and turbine testing, particularly innovative horizontal and vertical axis designs.

In 2010, the AEI test site was moved to the Nance Ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Welch | first = Kevin | title = Energy institute: Change afoot: Vaughn's departure among the shifts | work = Amarillo Globe-News | publisher = Morris Publishing Group | date = July 2, 2010 | url = http://amarillo.com/stories/070210/new_news2.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the organization's offices were also moved, to WTAMU's Palo Duro Research Facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Palo Duro Research Facility | publisher = West Texas A&amp;M University | url = http://www.wtamu.edu/academics/palo-duro-research-facility.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 90s, AEI also began developing a fortran program called ROTOR. The program could predict theoretical power curves for blade designs and produce screen and printed output of this. The program has been modified a few times since then and is still being used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Clark | first = R.N | date = 1979 | title = Irrigation Pumping with Wind Energy | editor-last = Schneider | editor-first = A.D. | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | page = 30 | publisher = Transactions of the ASABE | id = 0002-1458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, AEI's Wind Data program has greatly expanded. In addition to working with wind farmers to provide data for the public, the organization also analyzes and publishes data for private organizations. In total, the organizations now collects data from 75 sites scattered across Texas. 50 of these data sites are archived online, 31 of which offer data for public use by researchers and developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tangler | first = JL | date = 2002 | title = The nebulous art of using wind tunnel aerofoil data for predicting rotor performance | volume = Wind Energy | pages = 11 | publisher = Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===Courses===
Since 2009, AEI has been offering online alternative energy courses at WTAMU on [[Wind energy]], [[Solar energy]] and [[Renewable energy]]. Currently, WT offers one course per semester, with alternating subjects. The courses are taught by AEI staff and are open to WT students and those seeking certification.

In addition to the online courses offered by WTAMU, AEI has also authored renewable energy textbooks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Vaughn | first = Nelson | title = Wind energy: Renewable energy and the environment | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | date = 2009 | pages = 304 | isbn = 978-1-4200-7568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and educational CDs. The CDs cover the subjects of wind energy, wind turbines, solar energy and wind water pumping. Some CDs are also available in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = University Bookstore: West Texas A&amp;M University | url = http://www.wtbookstore.com/home.aspx | accessdate = December 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101101180126/http://www.wtbookstore.com/home.aspx| archivedate= 1 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seminars &amp; Symposiums===

====Windy Land Owners====
Started in 1989, AEI has been giving annual '''Windy Land Owners''' seminars. Designed to teach land owners and other interested parties general information about the wind industry, most of the seminars took place in the states surrounding Texas. Due to increased interest, AEI began giving seminars in Texas starting in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Romig | first = Georgia | title = Seminar blows wind farmers away | newspaper = The Prairie | date = October 22, 2009 | url = http://www.theprairienews.com/2009/10/22/seminar-blows-wind-farmers-away/ | accessdate = December 6, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717024247/http://www.theprairienews.com/2009/10/22/seminar-blows-wind-farmers-away/ | archivedate = July 17, 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics covered at these seminars include:
* Wind farm basics
* Wind resources in Texas
* Potential problem and contract considerations

Starting in 2009, AEI also began offering presentations from the WLO Seminars online for general information.

====WEATS====
[[Image:Weats07-60.jpg|thumb|AEI's Assistant Director of Training, Education and Outreach lecturing at WEATS 2007.]]

AEI's Solar Energy Building

Launched in 1998, The Wind Energy Applications Training Symposium (WEATS) is an internationally acclaimed workshop for the  [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American community]]. Designed for project planners, developers, utility officials, and engineers directly involved with energy projects, it is both a good resource for networking and developing practical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Wind Energy Applications Training Symposium (WEATS), September 28–30, 2010 in Golden, CO | work = TEEIC News and Events | publisher = Tribal Energy and Environmental Information Clearing House | date = August 25, 2010 | url = http://teeic.anl.gov/news/index.cfm | accessdate = December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics covered at this symposium include:
* Practical knowledge and analytical tools for conducting project pre-feasibility and identification analysis
* Implementation of small and large wind energy projects
* Lectures from [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] and local experts about the capabilities of the technology and the economic and financial aspects of sustainable project development
* Site visits

== Community Involvement ==

In addition to its seminars and workshops, AEI also regularly offers consulting to potential wind farmers and hosts tours of its research facilities.

As part of its community outreach, the organization also presents at the Caprock Science Fair&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Beck | first = Bruce | title = Science Fair: Students show off projects at Caprock | newspaper = Amarillo Globe-News | date = June 4, 2008 | url = http://amarillo.com/stories/060408/our_10402501.shtml | accessdate = December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other local schools, informing students about wind energy via displays, demonstrations and brochures at the elementary, junior high and high school levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5640">The '''Art Elective Program (AEP)''' is offered by schools in [[Singapore]] that have obtained permission from the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]]. This programme is also known as Higher Art and can also be offered as a [[Singapore]]-[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] [[General Certificate of Education]] [[GCE Ordinary Level|Ordinary Level]] (O-level) subject.

Lessons for the AEP are usually conducted in a separate classroom, sometimes after regular classes. Schools that offer AEP as a subject normally have an art room, a media lab and facilities to store and use art materials. In AEP, students learn how to design or work with digital art programs such as [[Adobe Illustrator]]. Techniques with basic media such as pencil, pen, and paint are taught.

The lessons also include Study Of the Visual Arts (SOVA), in which the students are taught to analyze works by renowned artists. 

==History==
AEP was announced in 1983 by the Ministry of Education. It was conceived as an enrichment programme for students with an artistic flair. It was started in January 1984 by the Chinese High School and the Nanyang Girls' High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19830825-1.2.61.aspx|title=Two schools to start flair for art programme|date=25 August 1983|newspaper=The Straits Times|page=14|access-date=10 April 2016|via=NewspaperSG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEP is designed to enable students with artistic abilities to undertake an enriched art programme. The AEP curriculum aims to develop students’ conceptual and analytical thinking and creativity. Samples of the AEP curriculum and students’ creative processes and artworks can be found in the catalogue published for the AEP exhibition.

==Projects==
Every year, students create at least two projects within the spectrum of art and design, such as photography or designing a logo. Projects are weighted heavily in the overall grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seab.gov.sg/pages/nationalExaminations/GOL/School_Candidates/2016_GCE_O.asp|title=SEAB list of O'level subject syllabus|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.seab.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examinations==
Throughout the year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/education-system/ |title= SEAB Education System Website|publisher=www.moe.gov.sg|date= |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;the students prepare SOVA and Drawing and Painting papers. The four exams are Continual Assessments 1 and 2, Semester Assessments 1 and 2. Drawing and Painting examinations vary in duration and students are allowed to create an art piece over around 2–3 hours. Two weeks before the Drawing and Painting exams, students are given several themes to choose from. They then have two weeks to complete their assigned task. The exam is marked according to five components: Investigation and Interpretation of Theme, Exploration and Development of Theme, Aesthetic Qualities, Control of Materials and Technical Processes and Personal Response. For the SOVA examination, students are tested on several artists whom they have studied. They examine selected artworks by these artists and interpret their styles and the methods applied to produce the artwork. This paper is considered a "theory" examination.

'''CalCOFI''' ('''California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations''') is a multi-agency partnership formed in 1949 to investigate the collapse of the [[sardine]] population off California.
The organization's members are from [[NOAA]] Fisheries Service, [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and [[California Department of Fish and Wildlife]].  The scope of this research has evolved into the study of [[marine ecosystems]] off [[California]] and the management of its [[fisheries]] resources. 
In 2004, the CalCOFI survey area became one of 26 [[LTER]] (Long Term Ecological Research, www.lternet.edu) research sites.
This time-series of oceanographic and fisheries data allows scientists to assess the human impact and effects of climate change on the coastal ocean ecosystem.

==Origin==
The Pacific [[Sardine]] Fishery was once the largest fishery by volume of the North American Pacific Coast. The fishery developed in the 1920s, peaking in the 1930s with Sardine landings reaching over 700,000 tons in California, but was followed by a precipitous collapse in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=Radovich82/&gt; Recommendations and early warnings of a fishery collapse were given throughout the period with an emphasis of setting annual catch limits given by fishery scientists for example Scofield and [[Frances Naomi Clark|Frances Clark]].&lt;ref name=Scofield31/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark39/&gt;  Disregarding the early warnings the Pacific [[Sardine]] fishery continued in part driven by the wartime requirement for cheap sources of protein and by the 1940s and 1950s catches declined by an order of magnitude to 80,000 tons. In the decade that followed sardine catches continued to decline to 20,000 tons in the 1960s.

The Sardine Fishery collapse was a major catalyst to the development of the California Cooperative Sardine Research Program- a precursor to the CalCOFI program. The consensus concern for the program was whether this collapse was due to increased fishing pressure or [[environmental change]]. The program was initially led by [[Oscar Elton Sette]], who forged a collaboration between research institutions ([[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]) and government agencies ([[California Fish and Game Commission]]- recently renamed the [[California Department of Fish and Wildlife]]- and the [[United States Fish Commission]]- now known as the [[NOAA Fisheries]] Service) with the goal of resource management and fisheries conservation of the Eastern Pacific.&lt;ref name=Kendall98/&gt;

The CalCOFI program was initially met with skepticism. The program was seen as a diversionary tactic initiating further picayune studies of sardine abundance to delay sardine catch regulations.&lt;ref name=Scofield/&gt; Nevertheless, after the sardine fishery reached a low point in 1947 efforts were focused on the investigation of the underlying forces that govern sardine abundance.&lt;ref name=MRC/&gt;

==Sampling Pattern==
The CalCOFI Station pattern was based on a centric-systematic-area design&lt;ref name=Milne59/&gt;

CalCOFI sampling lines were designed to be normal to the central [[California coast]] centered at [[Point Conception]], designated as CalCOFI Line 80. The original sampling pattern extended from Line 10 at the US-Canada border to Line 120 off Point Eugenia, Baja California Mexico with a spacing of 120 miles between lines (i.e. distance between line 80 and 90 is 120 miles). Since its conception, additional lines were added within the domain creating a 40-mile spacing between lines which are now numbered in fractions of 3s and 7s (80, 83, 87, 90, etc.).&lt;ref name=Kramer72/&gt;

Regular surveying began in 1951, however CalCOFI data go back to 1949. Like all research and fishery surveys, there are many variables which play a role in the design of the survey pattern. The CalCOFI program has surveyed a wide variety of spatial ranges. Thus, CalCOFI surveys are generally grouped into sampling domains which are commonly covered over the duration of this ecological study&lt;ref name=Kramer72 /&gt;

The largest sampling domain, which has been covered multiple times, is the area from the California-Oregon border to the tip of Baja California Sur, Mexico. This region was heavily surveyed in the 1950s (1951, 1952, 1954, 1956, 1958-1960, and 1972). Another large domain runs from [[San Francisco]] to southern [[Baja California]] (surveyed in 1953, 1955, 1957, 1961-1966, 1968, 1974, 1975, 1978, 1980, and 1981).

The sampling domain extending from [[San Diego]] to [[Avila Beach]] is today called the "core CalCOFI area". These 66 stations have been covered over the entire time series, with exceptions only due to years where no cruises were conducted. A series of inshore southern stations all at a water depth of approximately 20 m have been added to the core CalCOFI pattern in 2004, resulting in a 75 station pattern.

Less common sampling patterns of intermediate domain have also been conducted. This includes a survey region from [[San Francisco]] to [[San Diego]] which has become increasingly sampled during the spring survey, because the domain covers an expanded region of known sardine spawning grounds. The data from these spring cruise are heavily relied upon for sardine stock assessment and other related research.

Every line apart from the CalCOFI sampling scheme and its corresponding stations has experienced some degree of difference and variation in spatial and temporal sampling frequency. Furthermore, technological advances have allowed increasing amounts of new chemical, physical, and biological properties to be measured within the water column. Line 90, which is a part of the core CalCOFI station domain positioned across the mid-[[Southern California Bight]], is the best-sampled and most visited line in the time series. The data from Line 90 is used in many transect figures and analyses.

There are a variety of similar survey programs collecting analogous data across the west coast. These programs range in temporal and spatial extent. One such program is the Investigaciones Mexicanas de la Corriente de California (IMECOCAL) program out of Mexico which samples the Eastern Pacific around [[Baja California]].&lt;ref name=Barlow2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baumgartner2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Emmett2005/&gt;

==Gear Used==
A variety of nets and related instrumentation has been deployed on CalCOFI cruises over the years. many of these have been developed for use by the CalCOFI program. Oblique tows using a bongo net are employed to sample for micronekton, [[mesozooplankton]] and [[ichthyoplankton]]. Vertical tows for [[icthyoplankton]] and [[mesozooplankton]] are conducted using a Pairovet and PRPOOS nets. Finally, surface tows with a Manta net are used to sample [[neuston]]. Supplementary sampling focuses on collection of juvenile and small fish via trawling techniques. This includes using a Modified Isaacs Kidd Net, a Matsuda Oozeki Hu trawl (MOHT), and the Nordic rope trawl.

===CalCOFI Nets===
{| class="wikitable"
|+ CalCOFI Nets
|-
! scope="col" | Net Name
! scope="col" | Description
|-
! [[Bongo Net]]
| Paired ringed nets towed obliquely from a depth of approx. 210m to the surface with ship speed at approx. 1-2 knots. Water is filtered through the 505 [[micron]] [[nylon]] mesh nets with a mouth [[diameter]] of 0.71m.&lt;ref name=Kramer72 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith77 /&gt; The right side net is preserved in buffered 5% [[formalin]] and the left side in 90% [[ethanol]]. The [[bongo net]] is designed to collect [[mesozooplankton]] and its samples are critical in determining [[Egg (biology)|egg]] and [[larval]] [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. The data is used in the [[Daily Egg Production Method]] for estimating the [[spawning stock biomass]] of sardine.&lt;ref name=Lo89 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lo2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lo2010/&gt;  The net functions more efficiently at night due to the decreased amount of net avoidance by the [[zooplankton]].&lt;ref name=Ohman95 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lavaniegos2003/&gt; Tow depth, net configuration, mesh size and materials have been evolving since the program began. Comparisons of different net methodology and potential ramifications have been published.&lt;ref name=Kramer72 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ahlstrom54/&gt;
|-
! [[Pairovet]]
| The [[Pairovet]] is used to collect [[ichthyoplankton]] via vertical tows from 70m to the [[sea-surface]] using paired 0.05m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 150 [[micron]] [[nylon]] mesh nets. The smaller nylon mesh is specially designed to retain [[fish eggs]] which are found in the upper 70m.&lt;ref name=Ahlstrom59/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moser98/&gt;  The net is employed specifically to collect [[anchovy]] [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] with 100% efficiency.&lt;ref name=Smith85/&gt;  The aim of the Pairovet is to sample a constant [[volume]] of water at each site, thus it is crucial to keep the net straight up and down. Ship pitch and roll, water currents, net clogs, wire angle, and dragging in the [[neuston]] layer all are possible sources of variance and error. These potential [[variable (research)|variable]]s may force sample out of the mouth of the device, and/or sample loss due to destruction of eggs.&lt;ref name=Hewitt83/&gt;
|-
! [[Manta Net]]
| The [[manta net]] was developed to sample the [[sea-surface]] over a range of oceanic conditions. The net is able to veer away from the side of the vessel to avoid ship wake and have a mouth unobstructed by a bridle that might cause avoidance by organisms.&lt;ref name=Brown81/&gt; The net collects [[neuston]] or the animals found on the sea-surface via filtering water over a 505 [[micron]] net fixed with a 333 micron codend. A variety of [[fish]] species have a prolonged [[Metamorphosis|transformation]] between [[larval]] and [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] stages of development during which time the organisms can be found in the surface layer.

===Supplementary Nets===
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Supplementary Nets
|-
! scope="col" | Net Name
! scope="col" | Description
|-
! [[Nordic Surface Trawl]]
| Trawl aimed to sample and collect [[pelagic fish]].&lt;ref name=Griffith2008/&gt; Samples the water using wide trawl doors with a 600m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; mouth area filtering water with an 8mm mesh. The net retains juveniles and certain large larval fish. Recently the net has been fastened with a [[marine mammal excluder device (MMEL)]] to decrease the amount of mammalian impact and mortality.&lt;ref name=Dotson2010/&gt; Data retrieved by the net is used to better understand fishery species [[spawning stock biomass]], in particular the data is important for the [[Daily Egg Production Method]] as it samples a wide distribution of species and size-classes.&lt;ref name=Lo2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lasker85/&gt;  Additionally, size structure data is paramount in the use of acoustic biomass estimates.&lt;ref name=Zwolinski2012/&gt;
|-
! [[Modified Isaacs Kidd Trawl]]
| Trawl designed to sample [[juvenile pelagic fish]] which can avoid other sampling nets by mid-water trawls. The primary target is mid-sized [[anchovy]] (15 – 60mm).&lt;ref name=Methot86 /&gt; The frame samples a large volume of water while minimizing avoidance by the target organisms. The net filters about 7,000m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 100 times as much water per tow as a standard [[bongo net]].&lt;ref name=Methot86/&gt;
|-
! [[Matsuda-Oozeki-Hu (MOHT) Trawl]]
| Trawl designed to capture a multitude of mesopelagic organisms including: [[krill]], late larval and juvenile fishes, and [[micronekton]]. Collects juvenile and small fish assemblages in conjunction with [[multifrequency acoustics]] to estimate the distribution and biomass of sampled species. The [[MOHT]] has a 5.5m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; mouth opening, and filters the water at up to 4.5 knots in a variety of oceanic conditions. The MOHT is fixed with a range of codend filters to sample a variety of different size classes. It samples the mesopelagic community in a better manner then the bongo or the rope trawl and its data is highly valuable in the determination of health and abundance of important fisheries.&lt;ref name=Oozeki2004/&gt;
|-
! [[PRPOOS]]
| The name of the PRPOOS net is derived from its use during the Planktonic Rate Processes in Oligotrophic Ocean Systems program.  It was formerly known as the Soutar-Hemmigway Animal Trap or “SHAT”.  The net was introduced to CalCOFI cruises by the CCE-LTER program and it is a net designed to sample zooplankton using a 202 micron mesh net with a 50&amp;nbsp;cm diameter. The net is towed vertically to a depth of 210 m.&lt;ref name=Kramer72/&gt;
|-
! [[Continuous Underway Fish Egg Sampler (CUFES)]]
| Developed in the mid-1990s to identify fish eggs using video/[[optical plankton counter]]. The sampler functions by constantly pumping water from about 3m depth. The water passes through a variety of sampling collectors including an optical plankton counter.&lt;ref name=Checkley97/&gt;  Conceived to automate the collection and sorting of fish species, but though it gave promising results, manual identification is still required of the samples to minimize error and misidentification.&lt;ref name=Checkley2000/&gt; The problem is that many pelagic fish eggs share similar optical properties with copepod. Despite this hiccup, the [[CUFES]] is invaluable in the sampling of [[sardine]] and [[anchovy]] [[habitats]].&lt;ref name=Checkley97 /&gt; CUFES data from cruises are commonly used with surface [[temperature]] and [[salinity]] data to show water mass characteristics where sardine, anchovy, and other important fishery species [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].&lt;ref name=Checkley2000 /&gt; The common use of the CUFES at sea is to inform where patches of high egg density are located which can be sampled via nets. The CUFES also impacts the relative [[confidence level]] of net sampling.&lt;ref name=Lo2001/&gt; A variety of research is conducted to determine the relationship between CUFES egg data and net ([[pairvet]], [[PRPOOS]], etc.) sampled data. Confidence in relations determined is still in question. Thus, CUFES data alone cannot be used to determine estimates of stock biomass.&lt;ref name=Checkley97 /&gt; Nevertheless, the CUFES is an important tool in describing surface patchiness, providing extra data by designating an area as high or low surface egg density.&lt;ref name=Lo2001 /&gt;

==History==

At an October 2005 conference sponsored by the [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]] and held in Aspen, Colorado, more than a hundred scientists, policymakers, journalists, and leaders from business, religion and civil society identified the critical need for a central authoritative source for [[climate change]] information. A broad group of climate experts later confirmed this need during a November 2006 New York meeting convened by [[James Gustave Speth]], Dean of the [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]]. At roughly the same time, in Palo Alto, California, [[The 11th Hour Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.11thhourproject.org/partners |title=Grantees |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=11thhourproject.org |publisher=11th Hour Project |access-date=August 31, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; began organizing with the mission to popularize reliable information about [[Climate change mitigation|global warming solutions]], using the power of Silicon Valley scientists, entrepreneurs, and inventors.

These meetings inspired the idea for Climate Central, which took shape early in 2008 with seed money from The Flora Family Foundation and development funds from 11th Hour Project. The founding board included [[Jane Lubchenco]], Steven Pacala and Wendy Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatecentral.org/about/people/#founding_board] Climate Central's Founding Board&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate Central also sponsors classes for meteorologists and provides climate graphics to television stations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26585">'''Cofactor engineering''', A
 subset of [[metabolic engineering]], is defined as the manipulation of the use of [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] in an  organism’s [[metabolic pathways]].  In cofactor engineering, the concentrations of cofactors are changed in order to maximize or minimize metabolic fluxes.  This type of engineering can be used to optimize the production of a [[metabolite]] product or to increase the efficiency of a [[metabolic network]].  The use of engineering single celled organisms to create lucrative chemicals from cheap raw materials is growing, and cofactor engineering can play a crucial role in maximizing production. The field has gained more popularity in the past decade and has several practical applications in chemical manufacturing, bioengineering and pharmaceutical industries.&lt;ref name=ABE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raab|first=Michael|author2=Keith Tyro |author3=Gregory Stephanopoulos |title=Metabolic Engineering|journal=Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology|year=2005|volume=100|issue=763|pages=1–17|doi=10.1007/b136411}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Cofactor (biochemistry)|Cofactors]] are non-[[protein]] compounds that bind to proteins and are required for the proteins normal [[catalytic]] functionality. Cofactors can be considered “helper molecules” in biological activity, and often affect the functionality of enzymes. Cofactors can be both organic and inorganic compounds.   Some examples of inorganic cofactors are iron or magnesium, and some examples of organic cofactors include [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] or [[coenzyme A]]. Organic cofactors are more specifically known as [[coenzymes]], and many enzymes require the addition of coenzymes to assume normal catalytic function in a metabolic reaction.  The coenzymes bind to the active site of an enzyme to promote catalysis.  By engineering cofactors and coenzymes, a naturally occurring metabolic reaction can be manipulated to optimize the output of a metabolic network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pollak|first=N|author2=C Dolle |author3=M Ziegler |title=The power to reduce: pyridine nucleotides - small molecules with a multitude of functions|pmid=17295611|pmc=1798440|doi=10.1042/BJ20061638|journal=Biochemistry|year=2006|issue=2|pages=205–218|volume=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heux&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heux|first=Stephanie|author2=Remy Cachon |author3=Sylvie Dequin |title=Cofactor engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Expression of a H2O-forming NADH oxidase and impact on redox metabolism|journal=Metabolic Engineering|year=2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=303–314|doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2005.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vadali&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vadali|first=Ravishankar|author2=George Bennett|title=Cofactor engineering of intracellular CoA/acetyl-CoA and its effect on metabolic flux redistribution in Escherichia coli|journal=Metabolic Engineering|date=April 2004|volume=6|issue=2|pages=133–139|doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2004.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Cofactors were discovered   by [[Arthur Harden]] and [[William John Young|William Young]] in 1906, when they found that the rate of [[alcoholic fermentation]] in  unboiled [[yeast]] extracts increased when boiled yeast extract was added.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Harden and William John Young. "The Alcoholic Ferment of Yeast-Juice". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character,'' Vol. 77, No. 519 (Apr. 12, 1906), pp. 405-420 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/80032  JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  A few years after, [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]] identified the cofactor in the boiled extract as [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.   Other cofactors, such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and coenzyme A, were discovered later in the 1900s. The mechanism of [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] activity was discovered when, [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]] determined in 1936 that [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; functioned as an [[electron acceptor]]. Well after these initial discoveries, scientists began to realize that the manipulation of  cofactor concentrations could be used as tools for the improvement of [[metabolic pathways]].&lt;ref name=ABE /&gt;

An important group of organic [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] is the family of [[molecules]] referred to as [[vitamins]]. [[Vitamin B12]] (cobalamin), for example, plays a crucial role in the human body, while [[coenzyme B12]], its derivative, is found in the [[metabolism]]s of every type of cell in our bodies. Its presence affects the synthesis and regulation of cellular [[DNA]] as well as taking part in [[fatty acid synthesis]] and energy production.  Cofactors are required by many important [[metabolic pathways]], and it is possible for the concentrations of a single type of cofactor to affect the fluxes of many different pathways .

[[Minerals]] and metallic ions that organisms uptake through their diet provide prime examples of [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] cofactors. For instance Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is needed to assist the [[enzyme]] [[carbonic anhydrase]] as it converts [[carbon dioxide]] and water to [[bicarbonate]] and protons. A widely recognized mineral that acts as a cofactor is iron, which is essential for the proper function of [[hemoglobin]], the oxygen transporting protein found in [[red blood cells]].  This example in particular highlights the importance of cofactors in animal [[metabolism]].

==Significance==
Cofactor engineering is significant in the manipulation of [[metabolic pathways]]. A metabolic pathway is a series of chemical reactions that occur in an organism. [[Metabolic engineering]] is the subject of altering the fluxes within a metabolic pathway.  In metabolic engineering, a metabolic pathway can be directly altered by changing the functionality of the [[enzymes]] involved in the pathway. Cofactor engineering, offers a distinct approach, and some advantages, to altering a metabolic pathway. Instead of changing the enzymes used in a pathway, the cofactors can be changed. This may give metabolic engineers an advantage due to certain properties of cofactors and how they can be modified.

Metabolic pathways can be used by metabolic engineers to create a desired product. By modifying the types of cofactors used and the times at which they are used, the outcome of the metabolic network can change. To create a greater production of a product, metabolic engineers have the ability to supply the network with whichever cofactor is best suited for that specific process. This leads to the optimization of networks to give a higher production of desired products. Also, changing the cofactors used in a network may be an ingenious solution to a complicated problem.  A network that is present in the cell, but is often unused, may have a desirable product.  Instead of engineering a completely new set of pathways to produce the product, cofactor engineering can be applied.  By replacing enzymes to use cofactors readily available in a cell, the typically unused network is no longer cofactor-limited, and production may be increased.

In addition to modifying the yield of metabolic networks, changing the cofactors used in a network can reduce operation costs when trying to form a desired product. NADH and NADPH are two extremely common cellular cofactors, differing only by the presence of a phosphate group. However, this phosphate group makes NADPH much less stable than NADH, and therefore more expensive to synthesize. Thus, it is advantageous to try and use NADH is some cellular networks because it is often cheaper, more readily available, and accomplishes the same task as NADPH.

== Tools and processes ==
Cofactor engineering most often deals with the manipulation of [[microorganisms]] such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', and as such requires the use of [[recombinant DNA]] techniques.  These techniques utilize small circular segments of [[DNA]] called [[plasmids]], which can be introduced and incorporated by microorganisms such as ''Escherichia coli''.  These plasmids are specifically designed in labs to  be easily incorporated, and affect the expression of various [[protein]], [[metabolites]] and [[enzymes]].  For instance, a particular plasmid may cause a change in an enzyme's [[amino acid]] sequence, which could increase its affinity for a particular [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]].

Microorganisms require a medium to grow in, and one commonly used for cultures of ''Escherichia coli'' is Luria-Bertani (LB) broth.  This medium is often supplemented with [[glucose]] and will often contain additional [[molecules]] designed to facilitate optimal culture growth.  Pre-cultures may then be grown in shake flasks.  These are simply plugged [[Erlenmeyer flasks]] which are left on an orbital shaker machine, which revolves at very high [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]. This process aerates the culture, which is necessary for optimal growth.  Once the pre-cultures are ready, the plasmids needed by specific experiments are added to each culture separately, and then each culture is transferred to a bio-reactor.  Bio-reactors are systems which allow cultures to grow in a controlled environment. This leaves the introduced plasmids as the only independent variable. The required temperature, [[pH]], metabolite concentrations, and various other environmental factors can be maintained by the bio-reactor ensuring identical growth conditions for each culture.

Once samples are allowed to grow in the reactor for a specified period, they can be removed and studied to determine whether the intended alterations to the organism are evident.  Since cofactor engineering most often deals with [[metabolic pathways]], these organisms are often studied but introducing specific tagged [[fluorescent]] [[metabolites]] and documenting their progression through various pathways.  In other cases results are more obvious and easily observable, such as with the decreased [[ethanol]] production of [[yeast]] referred to below.

==Applications==

===Changing an Enzyme's Cofactor From NADPH to NADH===
[[Biocatalysts]] are required for the production of [[chiral]] building blocks needed in pharmaceuticals and other chemicals used by society. Many such biocatalysts require [[NADPH]] as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]. NADPH, a cofactor quite similar to NADH, is both more expensive and less stable than its counterpart [[NADH]]. For these reasons, manufacturers would prefer that the biocatalysts they use in their production lines accept NADH over NADPH. Cofactor engineering has recently been successful in altering enzymes to prefer NADH as a cofactor instead of NADPH. In 2010, a group of scientists performed cofactor engineering on the [[enzyme]] Gre2p, an NADPH-preferring [[dehydrogenase]] found in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. Gre2p reduces the compound diketone 2,5-hexanedione into the chiral building blocks (5S)-hydroxy-2-hexanone and (2S,5S)-hexanediol. The scientists determined that Asn9 ([[Asparagine]], position 9) was an important [[amino acid]] the active site of Gre2p. Specifically, Asn9 binds to the 3’-hydroxyl group and the 2’-oxygen atom of adenyl ribose [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]]. Through direct [[mutagenesis]], the scientists exchanged the Asn9 for both Asp ([[Aspartic Acid]]) and Glu ([[Glutamic Acid]]). This change caused Gre2p to have a decreased dependency on NADPH, and an increased affinity for NADH.  This resulted in increased Gre2p activity when using NADH. It was observed that substituting Asn9 with Glu produced a greater effect than changing Asn9 to Asp.  Asn contains a polar uncharged side chain, while both Asp and Glu contain a polar charged side chain. The increased effect of Glu is caused by the extra carbon in its side chain that brings it closer to adenyl ribose moiety. This allows for stronger [[hydrogen bonding]] between the 2’- and 3’- ribose [[hydroxyl]] groups and the side chain [[carboxyl]] group. The maximum velocity of the reaction doubled, while using NADH, when Asn9 was substituted with Glu. With these results, the scientists successfully engineered Gre2p to prefer NADH over NADPH and increased the speed of 2,5-hexanedione reduction. This will allow chemical companies to decrease their manufacturing costs by using NADH instead of NADPH at least for this particular reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katzberg|first=Michael |author2=Nadia Skorupa-Parachin |author3=Marie-Francoise Gorwa-Grauslund |author4=Martin Bertau|title=Engineering Cofactor Preference of Ketone Reducing Biocatalysts: A Mutagenesis Study on a γ-Diketone Reductase from the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|year=2010|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1735–1758|doi=10.3390/ijms11041735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing a Network's Cofactor Preference===
An alternative example of changing an enzyme’s preference for cofactors is to change NADH dependent reaction to NADPH dependent reactions. In this example, the enzymes themselves are not changed, but instead different enzymes are selected that accomplish the same reaction with the use of a different cofactor. An engineered pathway was created to make [[1-butanol]] from [[Acetyl-CoA]] by changing enzymes in the metabolic pathway of [[Synechococcus|S. elongatus]]. The [[Clostridium]] genus is known to produce 1-butanol, providing a pathway that could be inserted in S. elongatus. This pathway synthesizes 1-butanol using the reverse β-oxidation pathway. The enzymes involved in this newly engineered pathway were NADH specific, which was problematic for replicating the pathway in S. elongatus as cyanobacteria produce much more NADPH than NADH.

The research group then identified enzymes that utilize NADPH or both NADPH and NADH by [[bioprospecting]]. Acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB) was found to be a suitable replacement for hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase (Hbd). To replace AdhE2, the researchers found that NADP-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (YqhD) from E. coli to be effective for the pathway. Furthermore, the researchers needed a dehydrogenase to replace the aldehyde dehydrogenase capacity of AdhE2. CoA-acylating butyraldehyde dehydrogenase (Bldh) from C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum was found to be a good suit. Together, PhaB, Bldh, YqhD can replace Hbd and AdhE2, respectively, to change the cofactor preference of 3-ketobutyryl-CoA reduction from using NADH to using NADPH. The authors then constructed various combinations of the different enzymes (of those found in the reverse oxidation pathway and the NADPH utilizing enzymes) by overexpressing different genes in cultures of S. elongatus PCC 7942. In order to do so, they constructed [[plasmids]] containing the genes corresponding to the enzymes and combined them into the genome of S. elongates. After enzyme assays, the strain of cyanobacteria expressing the NADPH utilizing enzymes produced the greatest amount of 1-butanol (29.9&amp;nbsp;mg/L), exceeding that of strains that did not consist of the NADPH utilizing enzymes by four times. Overall, 1-butanol was produced in S. elongatus using a pathway from another organism. This pathway was modified in order to match the preferred reducing cofactor for the cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATP Drives Direct Photosynthetic Production of 1-butanol in Cyanobacteria|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/16/6018.short|publisher=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=11 December 2012|author=Ethan Lan|author2=James Liao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modifying Metabolite Flux with Cofactor Equilibrium===
In cofactor engineering, a metabolic pathway is altered by changing the concentrations of specific cofactors that are produced either in that particular pathway or in a separate pathway. For example, an hypothetical organism could have two arbitrary pathways called A and B where some enzymes in both A and B utilize the same cofactors.  If scientists wanted to decrease the output of pathway A, they may first consider directly engineering the enzymes involved in A, perhaps to decrease a particular [[Active site|active site's]] affinity for its [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]].  In some cases however, the enzymes in A may be difficult to engineer for various reasons, or it may be impossible to engineer them without dangerously affecting some third metabolic pathway C, which utilizes the same enzymes.  As a separate option, scientists could increase the flux of B, which may be easier to engineer.  This in turn could "tie up" the cofactors needed by A, which would slow [[enzymatic activity]], decreasing output in A. This is one hypothetical example of how cofactor engineering can be used, but there are many other unique cases where scientists use cofactors as a way of altering metabolic pathways. A major advantage to cofactor engineering is that scientists can use it to successfully alter metabolic pathways that are difficult to engineer by means of ordinary metabolic engineering.  This is achieved by targeting more easily engineered enzymes in separate pathways, which use the same cofactors.  Since many cofactors are used by different enzymes in multiple pathways, cofactor engineering may be an efficient, cost effective alternative to current methods of metabolic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=San|first=Ka-Yiu |author2=George N.

{{See also|Yeast in winemaking}}
[[Yeast]] are commonly used in the beer and wine industry because they are capable of efficiently producing [[ethanol]] through the [[metabolic pathway]] [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] in the absence of oxygen.  Fermentation requires the enzyme [[glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (GPDH) which depends on the cofactor [[NADH]].  This pathway involves the conversion of [[glucose]] to both ethanol and [[glycerol]], both of which use NADH as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].  Scientists engineered ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' to overproduce GPDH, which shifted the cells [[metabolic flux]] away from ethanol and toward glycerol, by limiting NADH availability in the ethanol production portion of the pathway.  The opposite effect was achieved by influencing a separate pathway in the cell, the [[Glutamate]] Synthesis pathway.   Inactivating the expression of the enzyme [[glutamate dehydrogenase]], which is [[NADPH]] dependent, and over expressing the enzymes [[glutamine synthetase]] and [[glutamate synthetase]], which rely on NADH as a cofactor shifted the cofactor balance in glutamate synthesis pathway. The pathway is now dependent on NADH rather than NADPH, which decreases NADH availability in the fermentation pathway.  This in turn causes increased ethanol production and decreased [[glycerol]] production. This method of manipulating [[metabolic flux]]es could be visualized much like global fuel markets, where the increased production of ethanol for use in the automotive industry would decrease its availability in the food industry.  Essentially, producing more engines which run on ethanol could result in decreased consumption of processed sweets, which contain [[high fructose corn syrup]].  This engineering of cofactors is applicable to the beer and wine industry since it allows for the  regulation of ethanol levels in alcoholic beverages. Advancements in the wine industry have caused a steady increase in ethanol content, so winemakers in particular would be interested in the possibility of reducing the ethanol levels of some of their wines.&lt;ref name=Heux/&gt;

===Citric acid cycle===
[[Coenzyme A]] (CoA) and [[acetyl-CoA]] are two intermediate [[metabolites]], most notably found in the [[Citric Acid Cycle]], which participate in over 100 different reactions in the [[metabolism]] of microorganisms.   Recent experiments have shown that over expression of the [[enzyme]] [[pantothenate kinase]] and supplementation of [[pantothenic acid]] in the CoA biosynthesis pathway have allowed adjustments of both CoA and acetyl-CoA fluxes. This increased concentration of cofactors resulted in an increased carbon flux in the [[isoamyl acetate]] synthesis pathway, increase the production efficiency of isoamyl acetate. Isoamyl acetate is used industrially for artificial flavoring and for testing the effectiveness of [[respirators]]. In addition to the production of isoamyl acetate, the manipulation of CoA biosynthesis during the [[pyruvate]] [[hydrogenase]] reaction also causes an increase in the production of both [[succinate]] and [[lycopene]], each of which have beneficial effects on the human body. An increase in succinate concentration, which is used as a [[catalyst]], may lead to an increase in the speed of the Citric Acid Cycle, and consequently  an individual's [[metabolism]].  Increasing lycopene concentrations, has been shown to decrease the risk of [[prostate cancer]].  The potential rewards of repeating such feat of cofactor engineering and successfully incorporating them into industry practices are innumerable.&lt;ref name=Vadali/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giovannucci|first=Edward|author2=Alberto Ascherio |author3=Eric Rimm |author4=Meir Stampfer |author5=Graham Colditz |author6=Walter Willett |title=Intake of Carotenoids and Retino in Relation to Risk of Prostate Cancer|journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute|date=May 1995|volume=87|issue=23|pages=1767–1776|doi=10.1093/jnci/87.23.1767 |pmid=7473833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Potera|first=Carol|title=Making Succinate More Successful|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=December 2005|issue=12|pages=A832-A835|doi=10.1289/ehp.113-a832|volume=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper manufacturing===
Many important [[industrial enzymes]] use cofactors to catalyze reactions. By using cofactors to manipulate [[metabolic pathways]], it is possible to reduce material cost, eliminate steps in production, reduce production time, decrease pollution, and increase overall production efficiency.  One case that demonstrates several of these manufacturing benefits involves the genetic engineering of [[aspen]] trees. In the paper production process, manufacturing plants must break down [[lignin]], a biochemical compound that gives a tree trunk its stiffness, in order to form the pulp used throughout the rest of production. The chemical pulping process requires the manufacturing plant to use a significant amount of energy, as well as many expensive and toxic chemicals.  A group of genetic engineers, through '''cofactor engineering''', engineered a genetically superior [[aspen]] tree that produced less lignin. These genetically engineered trees have allowed for paper mills to reduce their costs, pollution, and manufacturing time.&lt;ref name=ABE /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horvath|first=Laszlo|author2=Ilona Peszlen |author3=Perry Peralta |author4=Bohumil Kasal |author5=Laigeng Li |title=Mechanical Properties of Genetically Engineered Young Aspen with Modified Lignin Content and/or Structure|journal=Wood and Fiber Science|year=2010|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36857">'''Computational chemistry''' is a branch of [[chemistry]] that uses [[computer simulation]] to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of [[theoretical chemistry]], incorporated into efficient [[computer program]]s, to calculate the structures and properties of [[molecule]]s and solids. It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion ([[dihydrogen cation]], see references therein for more details), the quantum [[many-body problem]] cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form.  While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical [[experiment]]s, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical [[phenomena]]. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials.

Examples of such properties are structure (i.e., the expected positions of the constituent atoms), absolute and [[interaction energy|relative]] (interaction) [[energy|energies]], [[electron]]ic [[charge density]] distributions, [[dipole]]s and higher [[multipole moment]]s, [[vibrational spectroscopy|vibrational frequencies]], [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], or other [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] quantities, and [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]] for [[scattering theory|collision]] with other particles.

The methods used cover both static and dynamic situations. In all cases, the computer time and other resources (such as memory and disk space) increase rapidly with the size of the system being studied.  That system can be one molecule, a group of molecules, or a solid.  Computational chemistry methods range from very approximate to highly accurate; the latter are usually feasible for small systems only. [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''Ab initio'' methods]] are based entirely on [[quantum mechanics]] and basic [[physical constant]]s. Other methods are called empirical or [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry method|semi-empirical]] because they use additional empirical parameters.

Both ''[[ab initio]]'' and semi-empirical approaches involve approximations.  These range from simplified forms of the first-principles equations that are easier or faster to solve, to approximations limiting the size of the system (for example, [[periodic boundary conditions]]), to fundamental approximations to the underlying equations that are required to achieve any solution to them at all.  For example, most ''ab initio'' calculations make the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]], which greatly simplifies the underlying [[Schrödinger equation]] by assuming that the nuclei remain in place during the calculation.  In principle, [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' methods]] eventually converge to the exact solution of the underlying equations as the number of approximations is reduced.  In practice, however, it is impossible to eliminate all approximations, and residual error inevitably remains.  The goal of computational chemistry is to minimize this residual error while keeping the calculations tractable.

In some cases, the details of electronic structure are less important than the long-time [[phase space]] behavior of molecules. This is the case in conformational studies of proteins and protein-ligand binding thermodynamics. Classical approximations to the [[potential energy surface]] are used, as they are computationally less intensive than electronic calculations, to enable longer simulations of [[molecular dynamics]]. Furthermore, [[cheminformatics]] uses even more empirical (and computationally cheaper) methods like [[machine learning]] based on physicochemical properties. One typical problem in cheminformatics is to predict the binding affinity of drug molecules to a given target.

== History ==
Building on the founding discoveries and theories in the [[history of quantum mechanics]], the first theoretical calculations in chemistry were those of [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]] in 1927. The books that were influential in the early development of computational quantum chemistry include [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Edgar Bright Wilson|E. Bright Wilson]]'s 1935 ''Introduction to Quantum Mechanics – with Applications to Chemistry'', [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Eyring]], Walter and Kimball's 1944 ''Quantum Chemistry'', Heitler's 1945 ''Elementary Wave Mechanics – with Applications to Quantum Chemistry'', and later [[Charles Coulson|Coulson]]'s 1952 textbook ''Valence'', each of which served as primary references for chemists in the decades to follow.

With the development of efficient [[computer]] technology in the 1940s, the solutions of elaborate [[wave equation]]s for complex [[atom]]ic systems began to be a realizable objective.  In the early 1950s, the first semi-empirical atomic orbital calculations were performed. Theoretical chemists became extensive users of the early digital computers. One major advance came with the 1951 paper in Reviews of Modern Physics by Clemens C. J. Roothaan in 1951, largely on the "LCAO MO" approach (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals Molecular Orbitals), for many years the second-most cited paper in that journal. A very detailed account of such use in the United Kingdom is given by Smith and Sutcliffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Smith |first= S. J. |last2= Sutcliffe |first2= B. T. |title= The development of Computational Chemistry in the United Kingdom |journal= Reviews in Computational Chemistry |volume= 10 |pages= 271–316 |year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''ab initio'' [[Hartree–Fock method]] calculations on diatomic molecules were performed in 1956 at MIT, using a [[Basis set (chemistry)|basis set]] of [[Slater orbital]]s. For diatomic molecules, a systematic study using a minimum basis set and the first calculation with a larger basis set were published by Ransil and Nesbet respectively in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schaefer |first =Henry F. III |title= The electronic structure of atoms and molecules |publisher= Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. |year= 1972 |page= 146 |location= Reading, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first polyatomic calculations using [[Gaussian orbital]]s were performed in the late 1950s. The first [[configuration interaction]] calculations were performed in Cambridge on the [[EDSAC]] computer in the 1950s using Gaussian orbitals by [[Francis Boys|Boys]] and coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Boys |first= S.

In 1964, [[Hückel method]] calculations (using a simple [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO) method to determine electron energies of molecular orbitals of π electrons in conjugated hydrocarbon systems) of molecules, ranging in complexity from [[butadiene]] and [[benzene]] to [[ovalene]], were generated on computers at Berkeley and Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Streitwieser |first= A. |last2=Brauman |first2= J.

In the early 1970s, efficient ''ab initio'' computer programs such as ATMOL, [[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]], IBMOL, and POLYAYTOM, began to be used to speed ''ab initio'' calculations of molecular orbitals. Of these four programs, only Gaussian, now vastly expanded, is still in use, but many other programs are now in use. At the same time, the methods of [[molecular mechanics]], such as MM2 [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]], were developed, primarily by [[Norman Allinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Allinger |first= Norman |authorlink= Norman Allinger

One of the first mentions of the term ''computational chemistry'' can be found in the 1970 book ''Computers and Their Role in the Physical Sciences'' by Sidney Fernbach and Abraham Haskell Taub, where they state "It seems, therefore, that 'computational chemistry' can finally be more and more of a reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fernbach |first= Sidney |last2=Taub |first2= Abraham Haskell |title= Computers and Their Role in the Physical Sciences |publisher= Routledge |year= 1970 |isbn= 0-677-14030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, widely different methods began to be seen as part of a new emerging discipline of ''computational chemistry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/bookhome/114034476 |title=Reviews in Computational Chemistry |chapter=vol 1, preface|doi=10.1002/9780470125786}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Journal of Computational Chemistry]]'' was first published in 1980.

Computational chemistry has featured in several Nobel Prize awards, most notably in 1998 and 2013. [[Walter Kohn]], "for his development of the density-functional theory", and [[John Pople]], "for his development of computational methods in quantum chemistry", received the 1998 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1998/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1998|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Karplus]], [[Michael Levitt]] and [[Arieh Warshel]] received the 2013 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry for "the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems".&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite press release

== Fields of application ==

The term ''theoretical chemistry'' may be defined as a mathematical description of chemistry, whereas ''computational chemistry'' is usually used when a mathematical method is sufficiently well developed that it can be automated for implementation on a computer. In theoretical chemistry, chemists, physicists, and mathematicians develop [[algorithm]]s and computer programs to predict atomic and molecular properties and reaction paths for [[chemical reaction]]s. Computational chemists, in contrast, may simply apply existing computer programs and methodologies to specific chemical questions.

Computational chemistry has two different aspects:
* Computational studies, used to find a starting point for a laboratory synthesis, or to assist in understanding experimental data, such as the position and source of spectroscopic peaks.
* Computational studies, used to predict the possibility of so far entirely unknown molecules or to explore reaction mechanisms not readily studied via experiments.

Thus, computational chemistry can assist the experimental chemist or it can challenge the experimental chemist to find entirely new chemical objects.

Several major areas may be distinguished within computational chemistry:
* The prediction of the molecular structure of molecules by the use of the simulation of forces, or more accurate quantum chemical methods, to find stationary points on the energy surface as the position of the nuclei is varied.
* Storing and searching for data on chemical entities (see [[chemical database]]s).
* Identifying [[correlation]]s between [[chemical structure]]s and properties (see ''quantitative structure–property relationship'' (QSPR) and ''[[quantitative structure–activity relationship]]'' (QSAR)).
* Computational approaches to help in the efficient synthesis of compounds.
* Computational approaches to design molecules that interact in specific ways with other molecules (e.g. [[drug design]] and [[catalysis]]).

== Accuracy ==
The words ''exact'' and ''perfect'' do not apply here, as very few aspects of chemistry can be computed exactly. However, almost every aspect of chemistry can be described in a qualitative or approximate quantitative computational scheme.

Molecules consist of nuclei and electrons, so the methods of [[quantum mechanics]] apply. Computational chemists often attempt to solve the non-relativistic [[Schrödinger equation]], with relativistic corrections added, although some progress has been made in solving the fully relativistic [[Dirac equation]]. In principle, it is possible to solve the Schrödinger equation in either its time-dependent or time-independent form, as appropriate for the problem in hand; in practice, this is not possible except for very small systems. Therefore, a great number of approximate methods strive to achieve the best trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.

Accuracy can always be improved with greater computational cost. Significant errors can present themselves in [[ab initio]] models comprising many electrons, due to the computational cost of full relativistic-inclusive methods. This complicates the study of molecules interacting with high atomic mass unit atoms, such as transitional metals and their catalytic properties. Present algorithms in computational chemistry can routinely calculate the properties of small molecules that contain up to about 40 electrons with errors for energies less than a few kJ/mol. For geometries, bond lengths can be predicted within a few picometres and bond angles within 0.5 degrees. The treatment of larger molecules that contain a few dozen atoms is computationally tractable by more approximate methods such as [[density functional theory]] (DFT).

There is some dispute within the field whether or not the latter methods are sufficient to describe complex chemical reactions, such as those in biochemistry. Large molecules can be studied by semi-empirical approximate methods. Even larger molecules are treated by [[classical mechanics]] methods that use what are called [[molecular mechanics]] (MM).  In QM-MM methods, small parts of large complexes are treated quantum mechanically (QM), and the remainder is treated approximately (MM).

== Methods ==
One molecular formula can represent more than one molecular isomer: a set of isomers. Each isomer is a local minimum on the energy surface (called the [[potential energy surface]]) created from the total energy (i.e., the electronic energy, plus the repulsion energy between the nuclei) as a function of the coordinates of all the nuclei. A stationary point is a geometry such that the derivative of the energy with respect to all displacements of the nuclei is zero. A local (energy) minimum is a stationary point where all such displacements lead to an increase in energy. The local minimum that is lowest is called the global minimum and corresponds to the most stable isomer. If there is one particular coordinate change that leads to a decrease in the total energy in both directions, the stationary point is a [[Transition state|transition structure]] and the coordinate is the [[reaction coordinate]]. This process of determining stationary points is called [[geometry optimization]].

The determination of molecular structure by [[geometry optimization]] became routine only after efficient methods for calculating the first derivatives of the energy with respect to all atomic coordinates became available. Evaluation of the related second derivatives allows the prediction of vibrational frequencies if harmonic motion is estimated. More importantly, it allows for the characterization of stationary points. The frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the [[Hessian matrix]], which contains second derivatives. If the eigenvalues are all positive, then the frequencies are all real and the stationary point is a local minimum. If one eigenvalue is negative (i.e., an imaginary frequency), then the stationary point is a transition structure. If more than one eigenvalue is negative, then the stationary point is a more complex one, and is usually of little interest. When one of these is found, it is necessary to move the search away from it if the experimenter is looking solely for local minima and transition structures.

The total energy is determined by approximate solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, usually with no relativistic terms included, and by making use of the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]], which allows for the separation of electronic and nuclear motions, thereby simplifying the Schrödinger equation. This leads to the evaluation of the total energy as a sum of the electronic energy at fixed nuclei positions and the repulsion energy of the nuclei. A notable exception are certain approaches called [[direct quantum chemistry]], which treat electrons and nuclei on a common footing. Density functional methods and semi-empirical methods are variants on the major theme. For very large systems, the relative total energies can be compared using molecular mechanics. The ways of determining the total energy to predict molecular structures are:

=== ''Ab initio'' methods ===
{{Main article|Ab initio quantum chemistry methods}}

The programs used in computational chemistry are based on many different [[quantum chemistry|quantum-chemical]] methods that solve the molecular [[Schrödinger equation]] associated with the [[molecular Hamiltonian]]. Methods that do not include any empirical or semi-empirical parameters in their equations&amp;nbsp;– being derived directly from theoretical principles, with no inclusion of experimental data&amp;nbsp;– are called ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]]''. This does not imply that the solution is an exact one; they are all approximate quantum mechanical calculations. It means that a particular approximation is rigorously defined on first principles (quantum theory) and then solved within an error margin that is qualitatively known beforehand. If numerical iterative methods must be used, the aim is to iterate until full machine accuracy is obtained (the best that is possible with a finite [[word length]] on the computer, and within the mathematical and/or physical approximations made).

[[File:Electron correlation.png|thumb|right|300px|Diagram illustrating various ''ab initio'' electronic structure methods in terms of energy. Spacings are not to scale.]]

The simplest type of ''ab initio'' electronic structure calculation is the [[Hartree–Fock method]] (HF), an extension of [[molecular orbital theory]], in which the correlated electron-electron repulsion is not specifically taken into account; only its average effect is included in the calculation. As the basis set size is increased, the energy and wave function tend towards a limit called the Hartree–Fock limit. Many types of calculations (termed [[post-Hartree–Fock]] methods) begin with a Hartree–Fock calculation and subsequently correct for electron-electron repulsion, referred to also as [[electronic correlation]]. As these methods are pushed to the limit, they approach the exact solution of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. To obtain exact agreement with experiment, it is necessary to include relativistic and [[Angular momentum coupling#Spin-orbit coupling|spin orbit]] terms, both of which are far more important for heavy atoms. In all of these approaches, along with choice of method, it is necessary to choose a [[basis set (chemistry)|basis set]]. This is a set of functions, usually centered on the different atoms in the molecule, which are used to expand the molecular orbitals with the [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO) molecular orbital method [[ansatz]]. Ab initio methods need to define a level of theory (the method) and a basis set.

The Hartree–Fock wave function is a single configuration or determinant. In some cases, particularly for bond breaking processes, this is inadequate, and several [[Multi-configurational self-consistent field|configurations]] must be used. Here, the coefficients of the configurations, and of the basis functions, are optimized together.

The total molecular energy can be evaluated as a function of the [[molecular geometry]]; in other words, the [[potential energy surface]]. Such a surface can be used for reaction dynamics. The stationary points of the surface lead to predictions of different [[isomer]]s and the [[Transition state theory|transition structures]] for conversion between isomers, but these can be determined without a full knowledge of the complete surface.

A particularly important objective, called computational [[thermochemistry]], is to calculate thermochemical quantities such as the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|enthalpy of formation]] to chemical accuracy. Chemical accuracy is the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is generally considered to be 1&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol or 4&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol. To reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post-Hartree–Fock methods and combine the results. These methods are called [[quantum chemistry composite methods]].

=== Density functional methods ===
{{Main article|Density functional theory}}

Density functional theory (DFT) methods are often considered to be ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]]'' for determining the molecular electronic structure, even though many of the most common [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]] use parameters derived from empirical data, or from more complex calculations. In DFT, the total energy is expressed in terms of the total one-[[electronic density|electron density]] rather than the wave function. In this type of calculation, there is an approximate [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] and an approximate expression for the total electron density. DFT methods can be very accurate for little computational cost. Some methods combine the density functional exchange functional with the Hartree–Fock exchange term and are termed [[hybrid functional]] methods.

=== Semi-empirical methods ===
{{Main article|Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods}}

Semi-empirical [[quantum chemistry]] methods are based on the [[Hartree–Fock method]] formalism, but make many approximations and obtain some parameters from empirical data. They were very important in computational chemistry from the 60s to the 90s, especially for treating large molecules where the full Hartree–Fock method without the approximations were too costly. The use of empirical parameters appears to allow some inclusion of correlation effects into the methods.

Primitive semi-empirical methods were designed even before, where the two-electron part of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is not explicitly included. For π-electron systems, this was the [[Hückel method]] proposed by [[Erich Hückel]], and for all valence electron systems, the [[extended Hückel method]] proposed by [[Roald Hoffmann]]. Sometimes, Hückel methods are referred to as "completely emprirical" because they do not derive from a Hamiltonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Counts|first=Richard W.|date=1987-07-01|title=Strategies I|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01676961|journal=Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=177–178|doi=10.1007/bf01676961|issn=0920-654X|bibcode=1987JCAMD...1..177C}}&lt;/ref&gt;Yet, the term "empirical methods", or "empirical force fields" is usually used to describe Molecular Mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470125793.ch4/summary|title=Reviews in Computational Chemistry|last=Dinur|first=Uri|last2=Hagler|first2=Arnold T.|date=1991|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780470125793|editor-last=Lipkowitz|editor-first=Kenny B.|pages=99–164|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470125793.ch4|editor-last2=Boyd|editor-first2=Donald B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molecular mechanics ===
{{Main article|Molecular mechanics}}

In many cases, large molecular systems can be modeled successfully while avoiding quantum mechanical calculations entirely. [[Molecular mechanics]] simulations, for example, use one classical expression for the energy of a compound, for instance the [[harmonic oscillator]]. All constants appearing in the equations must be obtained beforehand from experimental data or ''ab initio'' calculations.

The database of compounds used for parameterization, i.e., the resulting set of parameters and functions is called the [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]], is crucial to the success of molecular mechanics calculations. A force field parameterized against a specific class of molecules, for instance proteins, would be expected to only have any relevance when describing other molecules of the same class.

These methods can be applied to proteins and other large biological molecules, and allow studies of the approach and interaction (docking) of potential drug molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bio-balance.com/JMGM_article.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jmgm.2006.02.008|pmid=16574446|title=Molecular dynamics of a biophysical model for β2-adrenergic and G protein-coupled receptor activation|journal=Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling|volume=25|issue=4|pages=396|year=2006|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Lester A.|last2=Zauhar|first2=Randy J.|last3=Lanzara|first3=Richard G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bio-balance.com/GPCR_Activation.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0166-1280(98)90217-2|title=Activation of G protein-coupled receptors entails cysteine modulation of agonist binding|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure: THEOCHEM|volume=430|pages=57|year=1998|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Lester A.|last2=Lanzara|first2=Richard G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods for solids ===
{{Main article|Computational chemical methods in solid state physics}}

Computational chemical methods can be applied to [[solid state physics]] problems. The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a [[band structure]], which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the [[Brillouin zone]]. Ab initio and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies; therefore, they can be applied to band structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, it is even more time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.

=== Chemical dynamics ===
Once the electronic and [[molecular geometry|nuclear]] variables are [[separation of variables|separated]] (within the Born–Oppenheimer representation), in the time-dependent approach, the [[wave packet]] corresponding to the nuclear [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] is propagated via the [[time evolution]] [[operator (physics)]] associated to the time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] (for the full [[molecular Hamiltonian]]). In the [[complementarity (physics)|complementary]] energy-dependent approach, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is solved using the [[scattering theory]] formalism. The potential representing the interatomic interaction is given by the [[potential energy surface]]s. In general, the [[potential energy surface]]s are coupled via the [[vibronic coupling]] terms.

The most popular methods for propagating the [[wave packet]] associated to the [[molecular geometry]] are:
* the [[split operator technique]],
* the [[Chebyshev polynomials|Chebyshev (real) polynomial]],
* the [[multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree]] method (MCTDH),
* the semiclassical method.

=== Molecular dynamics ===
{{Main article|Molecular dynamics}}

Molecular dynamics (MD) use either [[quantum mechanics]], [[molecular mechanics]] or a [[QM/MM|mixture of both]] to calculate forces which are then used to solve [[Newton's laws of motion]] to examine the time-dependent behaviour of systems. The result of a molecular dynamics simulation is a trajectory that describes how the position and velocity of particles varies with time.

=== Quantum mechanics/Molecular mechanics (QM/MM) ===
{{Main article|QM/MM}}
QM/MM is a hybrid method that attempts to combine the accuracy of quantum mechanics with the speed of molecular mechanics. It is useful for simulating very large molecules such as [[enzyme]]s.

== Interpreting molecular wave functions ==

The [[atoms in molecules]] (QTAIM) model of [[Richard Bader]] was developed to effectively link the quantum mechanical model of a molecule, as an electronic wavefunction, to chemically useful concepts such as atoms in molecules, functional groups, bonding, the theory of [[Lewis pair]]s, and the [[Valence bond theory|valence bond model]]. Bader has demonstrated that these empirically useful chemistry concepts can be related to the [[topology]] of the observable charge density distribution, whether measured or calculated from a quantum mechanical wavefunction. QTAIM analysis of molecular wavefunctions is implemented, for example, in the [[AIMAll]] software package.

== Software packages ==
Many self-sufficient [[:Category:Computational chemistry software|computational chemistry software packages]] exist. Some include many methods covering a wide range, while others concentrate on a very specific range or even on one method. Details of most of them can be found in:
* [[Biomolecular]] modelling programs: [[List of protein structure prediction software|proteins]], [[Comparison of nucleic acid simulation software|nucleic acid]].
* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling|Molecular mechanics]] programs.
* [[List of quantum chemistry and solid state physics software|Quantum chemistry and solid state physics software]] supporting several methods.
* [[Molecular design software]]
* [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods|Semi-empirical]] programs.
* [[Valence bond programs]].

The '''Department of Computer Science''' is a department of the [[Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics]] at the [[Comenius University]] in [[Bratislava]], the capital of [[Slovakia]]. It is headed by Prof. RNDr. [[Branislav Rovan]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Phd]].

== Educational and scientific achievements ==

The first comprehensive computer science curriculum in [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Slovakia]]) was introduced at the Faculty in 1973. The department, established in 1974, continues to be responsible for organizing the major part of the undergraduate and graduate computer science education to this date. The distinguishing feature of the curriculum has been a balanced coverage of the mathematical foundations, theoretical computer science, and practical computer science. The part of the curriculum covered by the department at present includes courses on computer architecture, system software, networks, databases, software design, design and analysis of algorithms, formal languages, computational complexity, discrete mathematics, cryptology, data security and others.

The department succeeded several times in project applications within the TEMPUS Programme of the [[European Union|EU]]. The projects CIPRO and „Neumann Network“ helped to build the departmental hardware infrastructure and to establish the expertise in Unix workstation technology, networking, and structured document processing. The CUSTU PARLAB parallel computing laboratory run jointly with the Department of Informatics of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the [[Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava|Slovak Technical University]] also resulted from one of these projects. Furthermore, the department participated in project LEARN-ED under the COPERNICUS Programme and built a multimedia laboratory.

The department has been involved in the organization of one of the top European conferences in theoretical computer science ? MFCS ? each time it took place in Slovakia. Further conferences recently organized or co-organized by the department include SOFSEM '98 and DISC '99. Besides, the department houses the secretariat of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, of the Slovak Society for Computer Science and of the Association for Security of Information Technologies (ASIT).

== Research topics ==

Research in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics has the longest tradition in the department. Most notably, the result of [[Róbert Szelepcsényi]] on the closure of nondeterministic space under complement, independently obtained also by N. Immerman, brought the [[Gödel Prize]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] and [[EATCS]] to both of them in 1995. More recently research in parallel and distributed computing, cryptology and information security, and in software development has been initiated. The department is involved in international cooperation on the development of the structured document editor within the Euromath Project. 
The department has many international contacts, succeeded in research project application (project ALTEC ? „Algorithms for Future Technologies“) with partners from EU, and also has two research grants from the Slovak Grant Agency.

== Technical equipment ==

A network consisting of 20 workstations ([[Sun Microsystems|Sun]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]] in two workstation labs), Parsytec (with 20 [[transputer]]s and OS Parix), and standard PCs connected to a network.

A '''distributional–relational database''', or '''word-vector database''', is a database management system (DBMS) that uses distributional word-vector representations to enrich the semantics of structured data. As distributional word-vectors can be automatically built automatically from large-scale corpora,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Z. (1954). "Distributional structure". Word. 10 (23): 146–162.&lt;/ref&gt; this enrichment supports the construction of databases which can embed large-scale commonsense background knowledge into their operations. Distributional-Relational models can be applied to the construction of [[schema-agnostic databases]] (databases in which users can query the data without being aware of its schema), semantic search, schema-integration and inductive and abductive reasoners as well as different applications in which a semantically flexible knowledge representation model is needed. The main advantage of distributional–relational models over purely logical / [[Semantic Web]] models is the fact that the core semantic associations can be automatically captured from corpora in contrast to the definition of manually curated [[Ontology|ontologies]] and rule knowledge bases.

== Distributional–relational models ==

Distributional–relational models were first formalized &lt;ref&gt;Freitas, A. [http://andrefreitas.org/papers/thesis_schema_agnostic.pdf “Schema-agnostic queries over large-schema databases: a distributional semantics approach”] PhD Thesis, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freitas, A., Handschuh, S., Curry, E., Distributional-Relational Models: Scalable Semantics for Databases, AAAI Spring Symposium, Knowledge Representation &amp; Reasoning Track, Stanford, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; as a mechanism to cope with the vocabulary/semantic gap between users and the schema behind the data. In this scenario, distributional semantic relatedness measures, combined with semantic pivoting heuristics can support the approximation between user queries (expressed in their own vocabulary) and data (expressed in the vocabulary of the dataset designer).

In this model, the database symbols (entities and relations) are embedded into a distributional semantic space and have a geometric interpretation under a latent or explicit semantic space. The geometric aspect supports the semantic approximation between entities from different databases or between a query term and a database entity. The distributional relational model then becomes a double layered model where the semantics of the structured data provides the fine-grained semantics intended by the database designer, which is extended by the distributional semantic model which contains the semantic associations expressed at a broader use. 
These models support the generalization from a closed communication scenario (in which database designers and users live in the same context, e.g. the same organization) to an open communication scenario (e.g. different organizations, the Web), creating an abstraction layer between users and the specific representation of the conceptual model.

[[Image:Double Dildo.jpg|right|thumb|An 18-inch latex double dildo]]

A '''double penetration [[dildo]]''' or '''double dildo''' is a [[sex toy]] that allows for the simultaneous penetration of two bodily orifices at the same time. It is designed in the form of two penetrative stimulators ([[penis]] shaped or non-[[phallic]]) that come separately or fixed on the single shaft. Some of them include a vibrating motor that turns them into [[List of sex positions#Multiple penetration|double penetration]] [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]].

==Use==
The following three sexual configurations can be performed with using double penetration dildos.
*'''Vagina-to-vagina'''. Some women use double-ended dildos as part of their sex play with a second woman. The double-ended nature of the dildo allows penetration in two [[vagina]]s simultaneously.
*'''Vagina-to-anus'''. The majority of double-penetration dildos are designed for simultaneous stimulation of [[anus|anal]] and vaginal [[erogenous zones]], but in the case of elongated "double-headed" devices it is possible for two partners to use the same device simultaneously. This can even be used for [[pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]], when a woman penetrates the anus of a man.
*'''Anus-to-anus'''. Most double-ended dildos can be used for [[anal sex|anal penetration]] of both partners.

Simulated [[oral sex]] can also be performed on the dildo.

==Classification==
[[Image:Double dildo overview 01.jpg|thumb|right|Double dildo with remote-controlled rotating vibrator on one side]]

* '''Double-ended dildo''' aka  ''DED''.  Associated with [[lesbian]] love making devices, double-ended dildos are also used by [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] women for anal and vaginal simultaneous penetration. This dildo is usually made out of the soft flexible material (such as plastic or some form of rubber) that allows changing the shape of the shaft like the user wishes: to bend in the C-shape or to straighten it. In the past, though, they were often made of wood: Haberlandt (1899), for example, illustrates a straight double-ended dildo of this kind from late 19th century [[Zanzibar]].
* '''Anal and vaginal stimulators on the single shaft'''. These types of dildos or vibrators are intended for stimulating the user anally and vaginally. One shaft of the smaller length and width is attached to the other one that are both inserted stimulating anal and vaginal erogenous zones in a woman. In a vibrating sex toy there can be two motors in both shafts controlled together or separately.
* '''Kits of two separate vibrators or dildos used simultaneously'''. This type is a kit of vibrators and dildos that are not connected with each other or connected by a wire attached to the single control panel. They are used simultaneously or separately stimulating the erogenous zones of both partners. This type is more mobile and one can offer much more possibilities for love plays with or without partner(s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/news/a17085/dildo-christmas-tree/?src=spr_TWITTER&amp;spr_id=1440_35414494 Christmas Tree Decorated With Sex Toys In Milan]&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bondagebunnies.co.uk/ |title= Penis Dildos|accessdate=March 24, 2016 | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6gFLHugbY6g61OVjAU |archivedate=March 24, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News &amp; Commentary|work=Valley Advocate|location=Easthampton, Massachusetts|publisher=Accessed via [[NewsBank]]|date=4 November 2010|quote=The Hitachi Magic Wand , with a reputation for releasing even the most stubborn orgasm, brings a powerful buzz to all the right places (instead of uncomfortably rattling the handle).

* '''Double-ended/sided hands and strap free dildos'''. The latest technological achievement is totally new kind of strapless strap on. A special example of these are [[Feeldoe]], Sysil, Super Strapless Silicone Dildo, Share, Nexus Maximus and Transfer, which has an egg shaped bulb designed to be inserted into the vagina or anus of the wearer.

==Materials==
* Jelly rubber ("jelly"). The most popular sex toy material that is convenient for designing any shape and texture of the shaft. It features a variety of colors, though jelly tends to suffer discoloration, and physical deterioration over time. This material contains chemicals called [[phthalate]]s, which are thought to be harmful to gynecological and reproductive health. Unlike silicone (below) this material is porous, meaning that it can harbor bacteria.
* [[Silicone]]. Dildos and vibrators made of this material are durable and feature excellent non-porous properties, so they are easy to clean and maintain.
* [[Rubber]]. Many realistic dildos are made of rubber—a material that is both pliable and flexible enough for effective penetration. Like jelly, rubber is also porous.
* [[Glass]]. Glass double-ended dildos are usually created with special original designs. Glass is a smooth and firm material that delivers a cool feeling when used. It can also be used chilled and warmed for different feeling. Usually, glass dildos are made out of a special [[Borosilicate glass|borosilicate]] type of glass, of which [[Pyrex]], Schott-Duranglas and Simax are the most suited.
* [[Plastic]]. This non-porous and phthalate-free material is often used for creating double-ended dildos.

== History ==
''EASE Guidelines'' are a result of long discussions on the electronic [[European Association of Science Editors|EASE]] Forum and during the [[European_Association_of_Science_Editors#2009 conference: Integrity in Science Communication|2009 EASE conference in Pisa]], as well as subsequent consultations within the EASE Council.&lt;ref&gt;Ufnalska S. 2010.

== Contents ==

The document includes a succinct set of practical guidelines explaining how to write complete, concise and clear manuscripts (see a [http://www.ease.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Sylwia-Ufnalska-EASE-2016.pdf short presentation]). It is supplemented with a list for further reading as well as several short appendices (Abstracts; Ambiguity; Cohesion; Ethics; Plurals; Simplicity; Spelling; Text-tables) that present selected issues in greater detail or provide more examples.

''EASE Guidelines'' emphasize the need for proper structuring of the [[Academic paper#Scholarly paper|article]] (e.g. making the tested hypothesis clear in the Introduction), making the [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] highly informative (including most important [[data]] and conclusions), and writing understandably, so that the readers are not discouraged or confused. Ethical issues are also taken into account, e.g. authorship criteria, [[plagiarism]], redundant publications, and other types of [[scientific misconduct]]. The 2013 edition of the publication ethics checklist ([https://web.archive.org/web/20140810105700/http://www.ease.org.uk/sites/default/files/ease_guidelines-june2014-ethics.pdf Appendix: Ethics], page 10 of ''EASE Guidelines'') was presented at the 3rd World Conference on Research Integrity in Montreal in May 2013. It can be used routinely during submission, as one short form instead of many separate forms to be filled by authors.

== Perspectives ==

The [[European Association of Science Editors|EASE]] Council plans to add more appendices on specific subjects and more translations (made mostly by volunteers), as well as to review ''EASE Guidelines'' annually.&lt;ref name=LP /&gt;

Non-commercial [[printing]] of the document is allowed, so it can be used as a [[handout]], e.g. for [[postgraduate education|courses]] in [[scientific literature|scientific writing]] and [[scientific misconduct|publication ethics]].&lt;ref name="CSE" /&gt;

'''Ethnomethodology''' is the study of methods people use for understanding and producing the [[social order]] in which they live.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1974 pp 15–18"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1974) 'The origins of the term ethnomethodology', in R.Turner (Ed.) Ethnomethodology, Penguin, Harmondsworth, pp 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; It generally seeks to provide an alternative to mainstream [[sociology|sociological]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In its most radical form, it poses a challenge to the social sciences as a whole.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (2002) ''Ethnomethodology's Program: Working out Durkheim's Aphorism'', Rowman &amp; Littleford, Lanham.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, its early investigations led to the founding of [[conversation analysis]], which has found its own place as an accepted discipline within the academy. According to Psathas, it is possible to distinguish five major approaches within the ethnomethodological family of disciplines (see {{section link||Varieties}}).&lt;ref&gt;Psathas, G. (1995) ''Talk and Social Structure' and 'Studies of Work'', in Human Studies, 18: 139–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnomethodology provides methods which have been used in [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies to produce accounts of people's methods for negotiating everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, Michael Makowsky (1978). The discovery of society. London: Random House. Page 232&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fundamentally descriptive discipline which does not engage in the explanation or evaluation of the particular social order undertaken as a topic of study.&lt;ref&gt;Wes W. Sharrock, Bob Anderson, R. J. Anderson (1986) The ethnomethodologists. London: Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|0-85312-949-5}}. Page 18&lt;/ref&gt; However, applications have been found within many applied disciplines, such as software design and management studies.&lt;ref&gt;Rooke, J. &amp; Seymour, D. (2005) 'Studies of Work: Achieving Hybrid Disciplines in IT Design and Management Studies', Human Studies 28(2):205–221. http://usir.salford.ac.uk/642&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term's meaning can be broken down into its three constituent parts: ''ethno'' – ''method'' – ''ology'', for the purpose of explanation. Using an appropriate Southern California example: ''ethno'' refers to a particular socio-cultural group (for example, a particular, local community of surfers); ''method'' refers to the methods and practices this particular group employs in its everyday activities (for example, related to surfing); and ''ology'' refers to the systematic description of these methods and practices. The focus of the investigation used in our example is the social order of surfing, the ethnomethodological interest is in the "how" (the methods and practices) of the production and maintenance of this social order. In essence ethnomethodology attempts to create classifications of the social actions of individuals within groups through drawing on the experience of the groups directly, without imposing on the setting the opinions of the researcher with regards to social order, as is the case with sociological studies.&lt;ref name="lynch1993"&gt;Michael Lynch, Scientific Practice and Ordinary Action: Ethnomethodology and Social Studies of Science, Cambridge UP, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and scope==
The approach was originally developed by [[Harold Garfinkel]], who attributed its origin to his work investigating the conduct of jury members in 1954.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1974 pp 15–18"/&gt; His interest was in describing the common sense methods through which members of a jury produce themselves in a jury room ''as a jury''. Thus, their methods for: establishing matters of fact; developing evidence chains; determining the reliability of witness testimony; establishing the organization of speakers in the jury room itself; and determining the guilt or innocence of defendants, etc. are all topics of interest. Such methods serve to constitute the social order of being a juror for the members of the jury, as well as for researchers and other interested parties, in that specific social setting.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

This interest developed out of Garfinkel's critique of [[Talcott Parsons]]' attempt to derive a general theory of society. This critique originated in his reading of [[Alfred Schutz]], though Garfinkel ultimately revised many of Schutz's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. &amp; Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Garfinkel also drew on his study of the principles and practices of financial accounting; the classic sociological theory and methods of [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber|Weber]]; and the traditional sociological concern with the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]ian "problem of order".&lt;ref name="annerawls"&gt;Anne Rawls, "Harold Garfinkel", Blackwell Companion to Major Social Theorists, ed. G. Ritzer. Blackwell: London, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the ethnomethodologist, participants produce the order of social settings through their shared sense making practices. Thus, there is an essential natural reflexity between the activity of making sense of a social setting and the ongoing production of that setting; the two are in effect identical. Furthermore, these practices (or methods) are witnessably enacted, making them available for study.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"/&gt; This opens up a broad and multi-faceted area of inquiry. [[John Heritage]] writes, "In its open-ended reference to [the study of] any kind of sense-making procedure, the term represents a signpost to a domain of uncharted dimensions rather than a staking out of a clearly delineated territory."&lt;ref&gt;Heritage, J. (1984). ''Garfinkel and ethnomethodology.'' Cambridge, U.K: Polity Press. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and methods==

{{Synthesis|section|date=June 2012}}

Ethnomethodology has perplexed commentators, due to its radical approach to questions of theory and method.&lt;ref name="doug1991"&gt;Doug Maynard &amp; Steve Clayman, "The Diversity of Ethnomethodology", ASR, V.17, pp. 385–418. 1991. A survey of various ethnomethodological approaches to the study of social practices. Pages 413–418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Heritage, Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology, Cambridge:Polity. 1991.({{ISBN|0-7456-0060-3}}). Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to theory, Garfinkel has consistently advocated an attitude of ethnomethodological indifference, a principled agnosticism with regard to social theory which insists that the shared understandings of members of a social setting under study take precedence over any concepts which a social theorist might bring to the analysis from outside that setting. This can be perplexing to traditional social scientists, trained in the need for social theory and a multiplicity of theoretical references by Anne Rawls, in her introduction to ''Ethnomethodology's Program'' might be interpreted to suggest a softening of this position towards the end of Garfinkel's life.&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garf0742516423"&gt;[[Harold Garfinkel]] (2002). Ethnomethodology's Program. New York: Rowman and Littlefield. {{ISBN|0-7425-1642-3}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the position is consistent with ethnomethodology's understanding of the significance of "member's methods", and with certain lines of philosophical thought regarding the philosophy of science (Polanyi 1958; Kuhn 1970; Feyerabend 1975), and the study of the actual practices of scientific procedure.&lt;ref name="lynch1993"/&gt; It also has a strong correspondence with the later philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], especially as applied to social studies by Peter Winch.&lt;ref&gt;Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. &amp; Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London&lt;/ref&gt; References are also made in Garfinkel's work to Husserl (Transcendental Phenomenology), Gurwitsch ([[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt Theory]]), and, most frequently, of course, to the works of the social phenomenologist Alfred Schutz (Phenomenology of the Natural Attitude), among others. On the other hand, the authors and theoretical references cited by Garfinkel do not constitute a rigorous theoretical basis for ethnomethodology. Ethnomethodology is not Durkheimian, although it shares some of the interests of Durkheim; it is not phenomenology, although it borrows from Husserl and Schutz's studies of the [[lifeworld]] (''Lebenswelt''); it is not a form of Gestalt theory, although it describes social orders as having Gestalt-like properties; and, it is not Wittgensteinian, although it makes use of Wittgenstein's understanding of rule-use, etc. Instead, these borrowings are only fragmentary references to theoretical works from which ethnomethodology has appropriated theoretical ideas for the expressed purposes of ''doing'' ethnomethodological investigations.

Similarly, ethnomethodology advocates no formal methods of enquiry, insisting that the research method be dictated by the nature of the phenomenon that is being studied.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; Ethnomethodologists have conducted their studies in a variety of ways,&lt;ref name="doug1991" /&gt; and the point of these investigations is "to discover the things that persons in particular situations ''do'', the methods ''they'' use, to create the patterned orderliness of social life."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; [[Michael Lynch (ethnomethodologist)|Michael Lynch]] has noted that: "Leading figures in the field have repeatedly emphasised that there is no obligatory set of methods [employed by ethnomethodologists], and no prohibition against using any research procedure whatsoever, if it is ''adequate'' to the particular phenomena under study".&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lynch1989"&gt;Michael Lynch, The Social Science Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2nd Ed., 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, H. &amp; Wieder, D. L. (1992) 'Two Incommensurable, Asymmetrically Alternate Technologies of Social Analysis', in G. Watson  &amp; R. M. Seiler (eds.), Text in Context, Sage, London, pp. 175–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some leading policies, methods and definitions==

; The fundamental assumption of ethnomethodological studies : As characterised by Anne Rawls, speaking for Garfinkel: "If one assumes, as Garfinkel does, that the meaningful, patterned, and orderly character of everyday life is something that people must work to achieve, then one must also assume that they have some methods for doing so". That is, "...members of society must have some shared methods that they use to mutually construct the meaningful orderliness of social situations."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;
; Ethnomethodology is an empirical enterprise : Rawls states: "Ethnomethodology is a thoroughly empirical enterprise devoted to the discovery of social order and intelligibility [sense making] as witnessable collective achievements." "The keystone of the [ethnomethodological] argument is that local [social] orders exist; that these orders are witnessable in the scenes in which they are produced; and that the possibility of [their] intelligibility is based on the actual existence and detailed enactment of these orders."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; Ethnomethodology is not, however, conventionally empricist.  Its empirical nature is specified in the weak form of the ''unique adequacy requirement''.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (weak form) : is that the researcher should have a 'vulgar competence' in the research setting. That is, they should be able to function as an ordinary member of that setting.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (strong form) : is identical to the requirement for ethnomethodological indifference.
; Ethnomethodological indifference : This is the policy of deliberate [[agnosticism]], or indifference, towards the dictates, prejudices, methods and practices of sociological analysis as traditionally conceived (examples: theories of "deviance", analysis of behavior as rule governed, [[role theory]], institutional (de)formations, theories of [[social stratification]], etc.). Dictates and prejudices which serve to pre-structure traditional social scientific investigations independently of the subject matter taken as a topic of study, or the investigatory setting being subjected to scrutiny.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; The policy of ethnomethodological indifference is specifically not to be conceived of as indifference to the problem of social order taken as a group (member's) concern.
; First time through : This is the practice of attempting to describe any social activity, regardless of its routine or mundane appearance, as if it were happening for the very first time. This is in an effort to expose how the observer of the activity assembles, or constitutes, the activity for the purposes of formulating any particular description. The point of such an exercise is to make available and underline the complexities of sociological analysis and description, particularly the [[indexical]] and reflexive properties of the actors', or observer's, own descriptions of what is taking place in any given situation. Such an activity will also reveal the observer's inescapable reliance on the [[hermeneutic circle]] as the defining "methodology" of social understanding for both lay persons and social scientists.&lt;ref name="Mark Okrent 1988. Pages 157–172"&gt;Mark Okrent, Heidegger's Pragmatism, Cornell University Press, 1988. Pages 157–172&lt;/ref&gt;
; Breaching experiment : A method for revealing, or exposing, the common work that is performed by members of particular social groups in maintaining a clearly recognisable and shared [[social order]]. For example, [[driving the wrong way]] down a busy one-way street can reveal myriads of useful insights into the patterned social practices, and moral order, of the community of road users. The point of such an exercise—a person pretending to be a stranger or boarder in his own household—is to demonstrate that gaining insight into the work involved in maintaining any given social order can often best be revealed by breaching that social order and observing the results of that breach—especially those activities related to the reassembly of that social order, and the normalisation of that social setting.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;
; Sacks' gloss : A question about an aspect of the social order that recommends, as a method of answering it, that the researcher should seek out members of society who, in their daily lives, are responsible for the maintenance of that aspect of the social order. This is in opposition to the idea that such questions are best answered by a sociologist. Sacks' original question concerned objects in public places and how it was possible to see that such objects did or did not belong to somebody. He found his answer in the activities of police officers who had to decide whether cars were abandoned.
; [[Durkheim]]'s aphorism : Durkheim famously recommended: "...our basic principle, that of the objectivity of social facts."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; This is usually taken to mean that we should assume the [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of social facts as a principle of study (thus providing the basis of sociology as a science). Garfinkel's alternative reading of Durkheim is that we should treat the objectivity of social facts as an achievement of society's members, and make the achievement process itself the focus of study.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; An ethnomethodological respecification of Durkheim's statement via a "misreading" (see below) of his quote appears above. There is also a textual link/rationale provided in the literature. Both links involve a leap of faith on the part of the reader; that is, we don't believe that one method for this interpretation is necessarily better than the other, or that one form of justification for such an interpretation outweighs its competitor.
; Accounts : Accounts are the ways members signify, describe or explain the properties of a specific social situation. They can consist of both verbal and non-verbal objectifications. They are always both indexical to the situation in which they occur (see below), and, simultaneously reflexive—they serve to constitute that situation. An account can consist of something as simple as a wink of the eye, a material object evidencing a state of affairs (documents, etc.), or something as complex as a story detailing the boundaries of the universe.
; [[Indexicality]] : The concept of indexicality is a key core concept for ethnomethodology. Garfinkel states that it was derived from the concept of indexical expressions appearing in ordinary language philosophy (1967), wherein a statement is considered to be indexical insofar as it is dependent for its sense upon the context in which it is embedded (Bar-Hillel 1954:359–379). The phenomenon is acknowledged in various forms of analytical philosophy, and sociological theory and methods, but is considered to be both limited in scope and remedied through specification [[operationalisation]]. In ethnomethodology, the phenomenon is universalised to all forms of language and behavior, and is deemed to be beyond remedy for the purposes of establishing a scientific description and explanation of social behavior.&lt;ref name="garf1984"&gt;Harold Garfinkel, Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. ({{ISBN|0-7456-0005-0}}) (first published in 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of the degree of contextual dependence for a "segment" of talk or behavior can range from the problem of establishing a "working consensus" regarding the description of a phrase, concept or behavior, to the end-game of social scientific description itself. Note that any serious development of the concept must eventually assume a theory of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] as its foundation (see Gurwitsch 1985). Without such a foundational underpinning, both the traditional social scientist and the ethnomethodologist are relegated to merely telling stories around the campfire (Brooks 1974).
; Misreading (a text) : Misreading a text, or fragments of a text, does not denote making an erroneous reading of a text in whole or in part. As Garfinkel states, it means to denote an, "alternate reading", of a text or fragment of a text. As such, the original and its misreading do not, "...translate point to point", but, "...instead, they go together."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; No criteria are offered for the translation of an original text and its misreading—the outcome of such translations are in Garfinkel's term: "incommensurable."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; The misreading of texts or fragments of texts is a standard feature of ethnomethodology's way of doing theory, especially in regards to topics in phenomenology.
; Reflexivity : Despite the fact that many sociologists use "reflexivity" as a synonym for "[[Introspection|self-reflection]]," the way the term is used in ethnomethodology is different: it is meant "to describe the acausal and non-[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] determination of meaningful action-in-context."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/mg60u8574h414t0l/ Michael Lynch, Mark Peyrot. "Introduction: A reader's guide to ethnomethodology". ''Qualitative Sociology''. Springer Netherlands. 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Reflexivity (social theory)]].
; Documentary method of interpretation : The documentary method is the method of understanding utilised by everyone engaged in trying to make sense of their social world—this includes the ethnomethodologist. [[Garfinkel]] recovered the concept from the work of [[Karl Mannheim]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Mannheim]], "On the Interpretation of Weltanschauung" (1952),in, From Karl Mannheim (ed. Kurt Wolf), Transaction Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and repeatedly demonstrates the use of the method in the case studies appearing in his central text, Studies in Ethnomethodology.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt; Mannheim defined the term as a search for an identical homologous pattern of meaning underlying a variety of totally different realisations of that meaning. Garfinkel states that the documentary method of interpretation consists of treating an actual appearance as the "document of", "as pointing to", as "standing on behalf of", a presupposed underlying pattern.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt; These "documents" serve to constitute the underlying pattern, but are themselves interpreted on the basis of what is already known about that underlying pattern. This seeming paradox is quite familiar to hermeneuticians who understand this phenomenon as a version of the hermeneutic circle.&lt;ref name="Mark Okrent 1988. Pages 157–172"/&gt; This phenomenon is also subject to analysis from the perspective of [[Gestaltism|Gestalt]] theory (part/whole relationships), and the phenomenological theory of perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aron Gurwitsch]], The Field of Consciousness, Duquesne University Press, 1964 [out-of-print]. Pages 202–227&lt;/ref&gt;
; Social orders : Theoretically speaking, the object of ethnomethodological research is social order taken as a group members' concern. Methodologically, social order is made available for description in any specific social setting as an accounting of specific social orders: the sensible coherencies of accounts that order a specific social setting for the participants relative to a specific social project to be realised in that setting. Social orders themselves are made available for both participants and researchers through phenomena of order: the actual accounting of the partial ([[:wkit:adumbration|adumbrated]]) appearances of these sensibly coherent social orders. These appearances (parts, adumbrates) of social orders are embodied in specific accounts, and employed in a particular social setting by the members of the particular group of individuals party to that setting. Specific social orders have the same formal properties as identified by A. Gurwitsch in his discussion of the constituent features of perceptual ''noema'', and, by extension, the same relationships of meaning described in his account of Gestalt Contextures (see Gurwitsch 1964:228–279). As such, it is little wonder that Garfinkel states: "you can't do anything unless you do read his texts."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;
; Ethnomethodology's field of investigation : For ethnomethodology the topic of study is the social practices of real people in real settings, and the methods by which these people produce and maintain a shared sense of social order.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

==Differences with sociology ==

Since ethnomethodology has become anathema to certain sociologists, and since those practicing it like to perceive their own efforts as constituting a radical break from prior sociologies, there has been little attempt to link ethnomethodology to these prior sociologies.&lt;ref name="Paul Attewell 1974 pp. 179–210"&gt;Attewell, Paul. (1974). "Ethnomethodology since Garfinkel," ''Theory and Society'' '''1'''(2): 179–210.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whilst ethnomethodology is distinct from sociological methods, it does not seek to compete with it, or provide remedies for any of its practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Garfinkel]], Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. ({{ISBN|0-7456-0005-0}}) (first published in 1967). Page: viii&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethnomethodological approach differs as much from the sociological approach as sociology does from psychology even though both speak of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Mehan &amp; Houston Wood, The reality of ethnomethodology. 1975. Chichester: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-59060-6}}. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that ethnomethodology does not use traditional sociological forms as a sounding board for its own programmatic development, or to establish benchmarks for the differences between traditional sociological forms of study and ethnomethodology as it only means that ethnomethodology was not established in order to: repair, criticize, undermine, or 'poke fun' at traditional sociological forms {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. In essence the distinctive difference between sociological approaches and ethnomethodology is that the latter adopts a commonsense attitude towards knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Leiter, ''A Primer of Ethnomethodology''. 1980. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-502628-4}}. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to traditional sociological forms of inquiry, it is a hallmark of the ethnomethodological perspective that it does not make theoretical or methodological appeals to: outside assumptions regarding the structure of an actor or actors' characterisation of social reality; refer to the subjective states of an individual or groups of individuals; attribute conceptual projections such as, "value states", "sentiments", "goal orientations", "mini-max economic theories of behavior", etc., to any actor or group of actors; or posit a specific "normative order" as a transcendental feature of social scenes, etc.

For the ethnomethodologist, the methodic realisation of social scenes takes place within the actual setting under scrutiny, and is structured by the participants in that setting through the reflexive accounting of that setting's features. The job of the Ethnomethodologist is to describe the methodic character of these activities, not account for them in a way that transcends that which is made available in and through the actual accounting practices of the individual's party to those settings.

The differences can therefore be summed up as follows:

# While traditional sociology usually offers an analysis of society which takes the [[facticity]] (factual character, objectivity) of the social order for granted, ethnomethodology is concerned with the procedures (practices, methods) by which that social order is produced, and shared.
# While traditional sociology usually provides descriptions of social settings which compete with the actual descriptions offered by the individuals who are party to those settings, ethnomethodology seeks to describe the procedures (practices, methods) these individuals use in their actual descriptions of those settings

==Links with phenomenology==
{{main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}

Even though ethnomethodology has been characterised as having a "phenomenological sensibility",&lt;ref name="doug1991" /&gt; and reliable commentators have acknowledged that "there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology..." (Maynard and Kardash 2007:1484), orthodox adherents to the discipline—those who follow the teachings of Garfinkel—do not represent it as a branch, or form, of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology.

The confusion between the two disciplines stems, in part, from the practices of some ethnomethodologists (including Garfinkel), who sift through phenomenological texts, recovering phenomenological concepts and findings relevant to their interests, and then transpose these concepts and findings to topics in the study of social order. Such interpretive transpositions do not make the ethnomethodologist a phenomenologist, or ethnomethodology a form of phenomenology.

To further muddy the waters, some phenomenological sociologists seize upon ethnomethodological findings as examples of applied phenomenology; this even when the results of these ethnomethodological investigations clearly do not make use of phenomenological methods, or formulate their findings in the language of phenomenology. So called phenomenological analyses of social structures that do not have prima facie reference to any of the structures of intentional consciousness should raise questions as to the phenomenological status of such analyses.

Garfinkel speaks of phenomenological texts and findings as being "appropriated" and intentionally "misread" for the purposes of exploring topics in the study of social order.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; These appropriations and methodical "misread[ings]" of phenomenological texts and findings are clearly made for the purposes of furthering ethnomethodological analyses, and should not be mistaken for logical extensions of these phenomenological texts and findings.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

Lastly, there is no claim in any of Garfinkel's work that ethnomethodology is a form of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology. To state that ethnomethodology has a "phenomenological sensibility" or that "there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology" is not the equivalent of describing ethnomethodology as a form of phenomenology (see Garfinkel/Liberman 2007:3–7).

Even though ethnomethodology is not a form of phenomenology, the reading and understanding of phenomenological texts, and developing the capability of seeing phenomenologically is essential to the actual doing of ethnomethodological studies. As Garfinkel states in regard to the work of the phenomenologist Aron Gurwitsch, especially his "Field of Consciousness" (1964: ethnomethodology's phenomenological ''urtext''): "you can't do anything unless you do read his texts."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

== Varieties ==
According to [[George Psathas]], five types of ethnomethodological study can be identified (Psathas 1995:139–155). These may be characterised as:

# ''The organisation of practical actions and practical reasoning''. Including the earliest studies, such as those in Garfinkel's seminal ''Studies in Ethnomethodology''.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt;
# ''The organisation of talk-in-interaction''. More recently known as [[conversation analysis]], [[Harvey Sacks]] established this approach in collaboration with his colleagues [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and [[Gail Jefferson]].
# ''Talk-in-interaction within institutional or organisational settings''. While early studies focused on talk abstracted from the context in which it was produced (usually using tape recordings of telephone conversations) this approach seeks to identify interactional structures that are specific to particular settings.
# ''The study of work''. 'Work' is used here to refer to any social activity. The analytic interest is in how that work is accomplished within the setting in which it is performed.
# ''The [[haecceity]] of work''. Just what makes an activity what it is? e.g. what makes a test a test, a competition a competition, or a definition a definition?

Further discussion of the varieties and diversity of ethnomethodological investigations can be found in Maynard &amp; Clayman's work.&lt;ref name="doug1991"/&gt;

==Relationship with conversational analysis==
The relationship between ethnomethodology and conversation analysis has been contentious at times, given their overlapping interests, the close collaboration between their founders and the subsequent divergence of interest among many practitioners. In as much as the study of social orders is "inexorably intertwined" with the constitutive features of talk about those social orders, ethnomethodology is committed to an interest in both conversational talk, and the role this talk plays in the constitution of that order. Talk is seen as indexical and embedded in a specific social order. It is also naturally reflexive to and constitutive of that order. Anne Rawls pointed out: "Many, in fact most, of those who have developed a serious interest in ethnomethodology have also used conversational analysis, developed by Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, as one of their research tools."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;{{rp|143}}

On the other hand, where the study of conversational talk is divorced from its situated context—that is, when it takes on the character of a purely technical method and "formal analytic" enterprise in its own right—it is not a form of ethnomethodology.&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; The "danger" of misunderstanding here, as Rawls notes, is that conversational analysis can become just another formal analytic enterprise, like any other formal method which brings an analytical toolbox of preconceptions, formal definitions, and operational procedures to the situation/setting under study. When such analytical concepts are generated from within one setting and conceptually applied (generalised) to another, the (re)application represents a violation of the strong form of the ''unique adequacy requirement'' of methods.

{{Property law}}
In English [[common law]], '''fee tail''' or '''entail''' is a form of [[Trust law|trust]] established by deed or settlement which restricts the sale or [[inheritance]] of an [[Estate (law)|estate]] in [[real property]] and prevents the property from being sold, devised by [[Will (law)|will]], or otherwise [[Alienation (property law)|alienated]] by the tenant-in-possession, and instead causes it to pass automatically by [[operation of law]] to an heir pre-determined by the settlement deed. The term ''fee tail'' is from  [[Medieval Latin]] ''feodum talliatum'', which means "cut(-short) [[fiefdom|fee]]", and is in contrast to "[[fee simple]]" where no such restriction exists and where the possessor has an absolute title (although subject to the [[allodial title]] of the monarch) in the property which he can bequeath or otherwise dispose of as he wishes. Equivalent legal concepts exist or formerly existed in many other European countries and elsewhere.

==Purpose==
The fee tail allowed a patriarch to perpetuate his blood-line, family-name, honour and armorials&lt;ref&gt;Frequently in default of a son and heir to the tenant-in-possession, the entail required the next male heir, if via a female line, to adopt the surname and arms of the patriarch, see for example [[Mark Rolle]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the persons of a series of powerful and wealthy male descendants. By keeping his estate intact in the hands of one heir alone, in an ideally indefinite and pre-ordained chain of succession, his own wealth, power and family honour would not be dissipated amongst several male lines, as became the case for example in Napoleonic France by operation of the [[Napoleonic Code]] which gave each child the legal right to inherit an equal share of the patrimony, where a formerly great landowning family could be reduced in a few generations to a series of small-holders or peasant farmers. It therefore approaches the true [[corporation]] which is a legal body or person which does not die and continues in existence and can hold wealth indefinitely. Indeed, as a form of trust, whilst the individual trustees may die, replacements are appointed and the trust itself continues, ideally indefinitely. In England almost seamless successions were made from patriarch to patriarch, the smoothness of which were often enhanced by baptising the eldest son and heir with his father's Christian name for several generations, for example the [[Baron FitzWarin|FitzWarin family]], all named Fulk. Such indefinite inalienable land-holdings were soon seen as restrictive on the optimum productive ability of land, which was often converted to deer-parks or pleasure grounds by the wealthy tenant-in-possession, which was damaging to the nation as a whole, and thus laws against perpetuities were enacted, which restricted entails to a maximum number of lives.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

An entail also had the effect of disabling [[illegitimate child]]ren from inheriting. It created complications for many propertied families, especially from about the late 17th to the early 19th century, leaving many individuals wealthy in land but heavily in [[debt]], often due to annuities chargeable on the estate payable to the patriarch's widow and younger children, where the patriarch was swayed by sentiment not to establish a strict concentration of all his wealth in his heir leaving his other beloved relatives destitute. Frequently in such cases the generosity of the settlor left the entailed estate as an uneconomical enterprise, especially during times when the estate's fluctuating agricultural income had to provide for fixed sum annuities. Such impoverished tenants-in-possession were unable to realise in cash any part of their land or even to offer the property as security for a loan, to pay such annuities, unless sanctioned by private Act of Parliament  allowing such sale, which expensive and time-consuming mechanism was frequently resorted to. The ''beneficial owner'' (or tenant-in-possession) of the property in fact had only a [[life interest]] in it, albeit an absolute right to the income it generated, the ''legal owners'' being the trustees of the settlement, with the [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] passing intact to the next [[Inheritance|successor]] or [[heir]] in law; any purported bequest of the land by the tenant-in-possession was ineffective.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==History==
Fee tail was established during [[feudal]] times by [[landed gentry]] to attempt to ensure that the high social standing of the family, as represented by a single patriarch, continued indefinitely. The concentration of the family's wealth into the hands of a single representative was essential to support this  process. Unless the heir had himself inherited the personal and intellectual strengths of the original great patriarch, often a great warrior, which alone had brought him from obscurity to greatness, he would soon sink again into obscurity, and required wealth to maintain his social standing. This feature of English gentry and aristocracy differs from the true aristocracy which existed in pre-[[French Revolution|Revolution]] France, where all sons of a nobleman inherited his title and were thus inescapably members of a separate noble caste in society. In England all younger sons of a nobleman were born as mere gentlemen and [[commoner]]s, and without the support of wealth  could quickly descend into obscurity, the eldest son alone being a nobleman. On this eldest son was concentrated the honour of the family, and to him alone was granted all its wealth to support his role in that regard, by the process of the fee tail.

===Statute of Westminster 1285===
The [[Statute of Westminster 1285|Statute of Westminster II]], passed in 1285, created and fixed the form of this estate. The new law was also formally called the statute ''[[De Donis Conditionalibus]]'' (Concerning Conditional Gifts).

===Opponents===
Fee tail was  never popular with the monarchy, the merchant class and many holders of entailed estates themselves who wished to sell their land.

===Abolition===
Fee tail as a legal [[estate (law)|estate]] in England was abolished by the [[Law of Property Act 1925]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Law|first1=Jonathan|title=A Dictionary of Law|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199664927|page=258|edition=Eighth|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=nTrvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuing use===
A fee tail can still exist in England and Wales as an equitable interest, behind a strict settlement; the legal estate is vested in the current 'tenant for life' or other person immediately entitled to the income, but on the basis that any capital money arising must be paid to the settlement trustees. A tenant in tail in possession can bar his fee tail by a simple disentailing deed, which does not now have to be enrolled. A tenant in tail in reversion (i.e. a [[future interest]] where the property is subject to prior life interest) needs the consent of the life tenant and any 'special protectors' to vest a [[reversion (law)|reversionary]] fee simple in himself. Otherwise he can only create a [[base fee]]; a base fee only confers a right to the property on its owner, when its creator would have become entitled to it; if its creator dies before he would have received it, the owner of the base fee gets nothing.   No new "fees tail" can now be created following the [[Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/schedule/1/paragraph/5 Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 Schedule 1 Para 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[conservation easement]]s are a form of entail still in use.

==Creation==
Traditionally, a fee tail was created by a trust established in a [[deed]], often a [[marriage settlement]], or in a will "to A and the heirs of his body". The crucial difference between the words of conveyance and the words that created a [[fee simple]] ("to A and his heirs") is that the heirs "in tail" must be the children begotten by the landowner. It was also possible to have "fee tail male", which only sons could inherit, and "fee tail female", which only daughters could inherit; and "fee tail special", which had a further condition of inheritance, usually restricting succession to certain "heirs of the body" and excluding others. Land subject to these conditions was said to be "entailed" or "held in-tail", with the restrictions themselves known as ''entailments''.

==Breaking of fee tail==
The breaking of a fee tail was simplified by the [[Fines and Recoveries Act 1833]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1833/cukpga_18330074_en_1#l1g3 Fines and Recoveries Act 1833 s.15]&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced the conveyance for making a tenant to the [[praecipe]] for suffering a common recovery. This was the usual preliminary to a recovery with a disentailing assurance, which had to be enrolled. The need for this to be followed by the [[Legal fiction|fictitious proceeding]] of a common recovery was abolished.

The requirement that a disentailing assurance should be enrolled was abolished in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Law of Property Act 1925, s. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mortgage of entailed lands==
Lending upon security of a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] on land in fee tail was risky, since at the death of the tenant-in-possession, his personal estate ceased to have any right to the estate or to the income it generated. The absolute right to the income generated by the estate passed by operation of law to parties who had no legal obligation to the lender, who therefore could not enforce payment of interest on the new tenants-in-possession. The largest estate a possessor in fee tail could convey to someone else was an estate for the term of the grantor's own life. If all went as planned, it was therefore  impossible for the succession of patriarchs to lose the land, which was the idea.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Failure of issue==
{{main article|Failure of issue}}
Things did not always go as planned, however. Tenants-in-possession of entailed estates occasionally suffered "failure of issue" – that is, they had no legitimate children surviving them at the time of their deaths. In this situation the entailed land devolved to male cousins, i.e. back up and through the family tree to legitimate male descendants of former tenants-in-possession, or reverted to the last owner in fee simple, if still living. This situation produced complicated [[litigation]] and was an incentive for the production and maintenance of detailed and authoritative family pedigrees and supporting records of marriage, births, baptisms etc.

Depending on how the original deed or grant was worded, in the event of there being daughters but no sons, all the sisters might inherit jointly, it might pass to the eldest sister, it might be held in trust until one of them should produce a (legitimate) son, or it might pass to the next male-line relative (an uncle, say, or even a cousin, sometimes very distant).

==Common recovery==
In the 15th century, lawyers devised  "[[common recovery]]", an elaborate legal procedure which used collaborative lawsuits and [[legal fiction]]s to "bar" a fee tail, that is to say to remove the restrictions of fee tail from land and to enable its conveyance in fee simple.  Biancalana's book ''The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176–1502'' (2001) discusses the procedure and its history at length.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Biancalana, ''The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176-1502'', Cambridge Studies in English Legal History, 2001.  520 pages. {{ISBN|0521032946}} (2007 reprint).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resettlement==
In the 17th and 18th centuries the practice arose whereby when the son came of age (at 21), he and his father acting together could bar the existing fee tail, and could then re-settle the land in fee tail, again on the father for life, then to the son for life and his heirs male successively, but at the same time making provision for annuities chargeable on the estate for the father's widow, daughters and younger sons, and most importantly, and as an incentive for the son to participate in the re-settlement, an income for the son during his father's lifetime. This process effectively evaded the law against perpetuities, as the entail in law had been terminated, but in practice continued. In this way an estate could stay in a family for many generations, yet emerged on re-settlement often fatally weakened, or much more susceptible to agricultural downturns, from the onerous annuities now chargeable on it.

==Formedon==
Formedon (or ''form down'' etc.) was a right of writ exercisable by a holder in fee for claiming property entailed by a lessee beyond the terms of his feoffment.{{clarify|date=April 2014}} A letter dated 1539 from the [[Lisle Letters]] describes the circumstances of its use:&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) The Lisle Letters, 6 vols, University of Chicago Press, Chicago &amp; London, 1981, vol.5, letter 1359, p.408, note 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I received your ladyship's letter by which ye willed me to speak with my Lady Coffyn for her title in East Haggynton in the county of Devon who had one estate in tail to him and to his heirs of her body begotten; and now he is dead without issue of his body so that the reversion should revert to Mr John Basset and to his heirs so there be no let nor discontinuance of the same made by Sir [[William Coffin (courtier)|William Coffyn]] in his life. Howbeit Mr Richard Coffyn, next heir to Sir William Coffyn, claimeth the same by his uncle's feoffment to him and to his heirs so that the law will put Mr John Basset from his entry and to compel him to take his action of ''form down'' which is much dilatory as Mr Basset knoweth&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An English example of a fee tail may be the main estates of the wealthy art collector [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford]] (d. 1870). His only child was his illegitimate son, [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet]], to whom he left as much of his property as he could. The main land holdings and [[Ragley Hall]] were inherited by his distant cousin, [[Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford]], descended from a younger son of the [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|1st Marquess]] who had died in 1794. Most of the 4th Marquess's art collection had been acquired by himself or his father, went to Wallace, and is now the [[Wallace Collection]]. Other works were covered by the fee tail, however, and passed to the 5th Marquess.

===Earl of Pembroke===
Another example was [[George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke]], who died in 1827. He had quarreled with his eldest son, later the [[Robert Herbert, 12th Earl of Pembroke|12th Earl]], and left his unentailed estate to [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea]], his son by a second marriage.

==Fees tail in fiction==
Fees tail figure in the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s of several well known [[novel]]s and stories, particularly in the 19th century, including:

* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' by [[Jane Austen]]
* ''[[Middlemarch]]'' by [[George Eliot]]
* ''[[The Belton Estate]]'' (1866) and ''[[Ralph the Heir]]'' (1871) by [[Anthony Trollope]]
* ''[[The Master of Ballantrae]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]
* ''[[The Adventure of the Priory School]]'' by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]
* ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' by [[Evelyn Waugh]]
* ''[[Wideacre]]'' by [[Philippa Gregory]]
* ''[[The Quincunx]]'' by [[Charles Palliser]] (written in 1989, but it takes the form of a Dickensian mystery set in early-19th-century England)
* ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' by [[Julian Fellowes]]&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2015/04/The-Tale-of-the-Fee-Tail-in-Downton-Abbey.pdf The Tale of the Fee Tail in ''Downton Abbey'']", J. B. Ruhl, Vanderbilt Law Review, April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; (written in 2009–2015, but set in England in the period 1912–1927)
* ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' by Harper Lee (referred to as an "entailment")

===''Pride and Prejudice''===
''Pride and Prejudice'' contains a particularly thorny example of the kind of problems which could arise through the entailing of property. Mr. Bennet, the father of protagonist [[Elizabeth Bennet]], had only a life interest in the Longbourn estate, the family's home and principal source of income. He had no authority to dictate to whom it should pass upon his death, as it was strictly arranged to be inherited by the next male heir. Had Mr. Bennet fathered a son it would have passed to him, but since he did not it could not pass to any of his five daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixon|first1=Martin|title=Modern Land Law|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317821459|edition=Ninth|page=8 (footnote)|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=ro78AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the next nearest male heir would inherit the property—Mr. Bennet's cousin, William Collins, a boorish minister in his mid-twenties. The inheritance of the Longbourn property completely excluded the five Bennet daughters, who were thus to lose their home and income upon their father's death. The need for the daughters to make a good marriage to ensure their future security is a key motivation for many episodes in the novel. Many fees tail arose from wills, rather than from marriage settlements which usually made some provision for daughters. Austen was very familiar with the law of entail; her brother, Edward, had inherited similarly entailed estates at [[Chawton]], [[Godmersham]] and [[Winchester]] from distant cousins under the will of Elizabeth Knight, who died in 1737.&lt;ref name=grover&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grover|first1=Christine|title=Edward Knight’s Inheritance: The Chawton, Godmersham, and Winchester Estates|journal=Persuasions|date=2013|volume=34|issue=1|url=http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol34no1/grover.html|accessdate=17 April 2015|publisher=Jane Austen Society of North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==

===Scotland===
{{main article|Tailzie}}
In [[Scotland]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]] (section 50) abolished all feudal tenures including the entail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/50 ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act'' 2000, section 50.]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the doctrines of ''[[legitime|legitim]]'' and ''[[jus relictae]]'' restrict owners from willing property out of their family when they die with children or have a surviving partner.

A Scottish example of fee tail is the case of [[Alfred Douglas-Hamilton, 13th Duke of Hamilton]], who in 1895 inherited from the 12th Duke, his fourth cousin, who had attempted to marry his daughter to the heir.

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], section 13 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 abolished the fee tail in Ireland and converted existing fees tail to [[fee simple|fees simple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0027/sec0013.html#sec13 ''Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act'' 2009, section 13.]&lt;/ref&gt; For constitutional reasons, this section is subject to a saving clause which prevents the conversion of fees tail to fees simple where the protector of the settlement is still alive. Therefore, fees tail still exist in Ireland.

===United States===
The fee tail has been abolished in all but four states in the [[United States]]: [[Massachusetts]], [[Maine]], [[Delaware]] and [[Rhode Island]]. However, in the first three states, property can be sold or deeded as any other property would be, with the fee tail only applying in case of death without a will. In Rhode Island, a fee tail is treated as a life estate with remainder in the life tenant's children. [[New York (state)|New York]] abolished fee tail in 1782, while many other states within the U.S. never recognized it at all. In most states in the United States, an attempt to create a fee tail results in a [[fee simple]]; even in those four states that still allow fee tail, the estate holder may convert his fee tail to a fee simple during his lifetime by executing a deed.

In [[Louisiana]], the common law concept of estates in land never existed.  The concept of forced heirship and the marital portion protects force heirs and surviving spouses from total divestment of value of the estate of the decedent, who has a duty to provide for their care.

Fee tail-like restrictions still exist though contractual obligations. For example, owners of [[inholdings]] inside public lands may be prevented from selling or gifting their land to non-family members. In this case, the restrictions result from an agreement between the government and the land owner, and is not a part of a deed or settlement.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and later in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], fee tail estates were called ''ordynacja'' ({{IPA-pl|ɔrdɨˈnatsja|lang}}; landed property in ''fideicommis''). ''Ordynacja'' was an economic institution for governing of landed property introduced in late 16th century by king [[Stefan Batory]]. ''Ordynacja'' was abolished by the [[agricultural reform]] in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. ''Ordynat'' was the [[title]] of the principal [[heir]] of ''ordynacja''.

According to the rules of ''ordynacja'', which became a statute approved by the [[Sejm]]&lt;!--when?--&gt;, the estate was not to be divided between the heirs but inherited in full by the eldest son ([[primogeniture]]).&lt;ref name=hist&gt;Peter Paul Bajer. "[http://www.szlachta.org/2radziwill.htm Short history of the Radziwill Family]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231031433/http://www.szlachta.org/2radziwill.htm |date=2006-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were excluded from inheritance ([[Salic Law]]).&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; ''Ordynacja'' could not be sold or [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

''Ordynacja'' was similar to the French law of ''[[majorat]]'' or German and Scandinavian ''fideicommis'',&lt;!-- Link to [[fee tail]] removed - not mentioned at that article --&gt; and succession to such resembles that of British [[peerages]].

Many Polish [[magnate]]s' fortunes were based on ''ordynacja'', among them those of the [[Radziwiłł]]s, [[Zamoyski]]s, [[Czartoryski]]s, [[Potocki]]s and [[Lubomirski]]s. Most important ''ordynacja'' were veritable little [[principalities]]. The earliest and most extensive ''ordynacjas'' include:
* [[Ordynacje Radziwiłłów]], created for [[Mikołaj VII Radziwiłł]], [[Albrecht Radziwiłł]] and [[Stanisław Radziwiłł]] in 1589, centered on [[Olyka]], [[Nesvizh]], and [[Kletsk]]
* [[Ordynacja Ostrogska]], created for [[Janusz Ostrogski]] in 1609, later inherited by the [[Zaslawski]], [[Lubomirski]] and [[Sanguszko]] families, centered on [[Ostroh]]
* [[Ordynacja Zamojska]], created for [[Jan Zamoyski]] in 1589, centered on [[Zamość]]
* [[Ordynacja Jarosławska]], created for [[Rafał Jarosławski]] in 1470, centered on [[Jarosław]]
* [[Ordynacja Pińczowska]], created for Piotr and Zygmunt [[Myszkowski]] in 1601, later inherited by the [[Wielopolski family]], centered on [[Pińczów]]

===Other===
Other European legal systems had comparable devices to keep estates together, especially in Spain and Northern European countries like [[Prussia]]. They are derived from ''[[fideicommissum]]'', a legal institution in [[Roman law]]. Unlike most of the English aristocracy, the [[Prussian Junkers|Prussian ''junkers'']] supported fees tail, and succeeded in reinstating them in 1853, after they had been abolished in a recent Constitution. In Germany and Austria the ''Familienfideikommiss'' was only abolished in 1938, and in [[Scandinavia]] they persisted even later – a few old Swedish fees tail still remain in force, though no new ones may be established. For the law of German and Austrian fideicommissa in particular, an 862-page manual by the German legal scholar [[Philipp Knipschildt]], entitled ''Tractatus de fideicommissis nobilium familiarum – von Stammgütern'' ({{Google books|V2tBAAAAcAAJ|De fideicommissis}}), was the standard reference work. First published in 1654, this grand systematization of existing legal opinion was frequently reprinted and continued to be consulted until well into the 19th century.

'''Flavonoids''' (or '''bioflavonoids''') (from the Latin word ''flavus'' meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of [[plant]] and [[fungus]] [[secondary metabolite]]s.

Chemically, flavonoids have the general structure of a 15-carbon skeleton, which consists of two [[phenyl]] rings (A and B) and a heterocyclic ring (C). This carbon structure can be abbreviated C6-C3-C6. According to the [[IUPAC]] nomenclature,&lt;ref name="iupac"&gt;
{{Citation |title=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology |edition=2 |last=McNaught |first=Alan D |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Andrew | author3=IUPAC |publisher=Blackwell Scientific |place=Oxford |year=1997 |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/F02424.html |doi=10.1351/goldbook.F02424 |isbn = 978-0-9678550-9-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |chapter-url=http://goldbook.iupac.org |title=The Gold Book |doi=10.1351/goldbook |accessdate=16 September 2012 |year= 2009 |isbn= 978-0-9678550-9-7 |chapter=Flavonoids (isoflavonoids and neoflavonoids)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
they can be classified into:
*''flavonoids'' or ''bioflavonoids''
*''[[isoflavonoid]]s'', derived from 3-phenyl[[chromone|chromen-4-one]] (3-phenyl-1,4-[[benzopyran|benzopyrone]]) structure
*''[[neoflavonoids]]'', derived from 4-phenyl[[coumarine]] (4-phenyl-1,2-[[benzopyran|benzopyrone]]) structure

The three flavonoid classes above are all [[ketone]]-containing compounds, and as such, are [[anthoxanthin]]s ([[flavone]]s and [[flavonol]]s). This class was the first to be termed ''bioflavonoids''. The terms ''flavonoid'' and ''bioflavonoid'' have also been more loosely used to describe non-ketone polyhydroxy polyphenol compounds which are more specifically termed flav'''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'''noids.  The three cycle or heterocycles in the flavonoid backbone are generally called ring A, B and C. Ring A usually shows a [[phloroglucinol]] substitution pattern.

== Biosynthesis ==
{{Main|Flavonoid biosynthesis}}

==Functions of flavonoids in plants==
Flavonoids are widely distributed in plants, fulfilling many functions.  Flavonoids are the most important [[Biological pigment|plant pigment]]s for flower coloration, producing yellow or red/blue pigmentation in petals designed to attract [[pollinator]] animals.  In higher plants, flavonoids are involved in UV filtration, symbiotic nitrogen fixation and floral pigmentation.  They may also act as chemical messengers, physiological regulators, and cell cycle inhibitors.  Flavonoids secreted by the root of their host plant help ''[[Rhizobia]]'' in the infection stage of their [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with legumes like peas, beans, clover, and soy. Rhizobia living in soil are able to sense the flavonoids and this triggers the secretion of [[Nod factor]]s, which in turn are recognized by the host plant and can lead to root hair deformation and several cellular responses such as ion fluxes and the formation of a [[root nodule]].  In addition, some flavonoids have inhibitory activity against organisms that cause plant diseases, e.g. ''Fusarium oxysporum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.phytol.2007.10.001|title=Flavonoids from carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus) and their antifungal activity|year=2008|last1=Galeotti|first1=F|last2=Barile|first2=E|last3=Curir|first3=P|last4=Dolci|first4=M|last5=Lanzotti|first5=V|journal=Phytochemistry Letters|volume=1|pages=44–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgroups==
Over 5000 naturally occurring flavonoids have been characterized from various plants. They have been classified according to their chemical structure, and are usually subdivided into the following subgroups (for further reading see&lt;ref name="Ververidis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ververidis F, Trantas E, Douglas C, Vollmer G, Kretzschmar G, Panopoulos N | title = Biotechnology of flavonoids and other phenylpropanoid-derived natural products.

===Antioxidant===

Research at the [[Linus Pauling Institute]] and the [[European Food Safety Authority]] shows that flavonoids are poorly absorbed in the human body (less than 5%), with most of what is absorbed being quickly metabolized and excreted.&lt;ref name="EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies NDA2, 3 European Food Safety Authority EFSA, Parma, Italy 2010 1489"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lotito SB, Frei B | title = Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and increased plasma antioxidant capacity in humans: cause, consequence, or epiphenomenon? | journal = Free Radic.

[[Procyanidins]], a class of flavonoids, have been shown in preliminary research to have anti-inflammatory mechanisms including modulation of the [[arachidonic acid]] pathway, inhibition of [[gene transcription]], [[gene expression|expression]] and activity of inflammatory enzymes, as well as secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez-Micaelo N, González-Abuín N, Ardèvol A, Pinent M, Blay MT | title = Procyanidins and inflammation: Molecular targets and health implications | journal = BioFactors | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–265 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22505223 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/biof.1019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
[[Clinical trial|Clinical]] studies investigating the relationship between flavonoid consumption and cancer prevention/development are conflicting for most types of cancer, probably because most studies are [[retrospective]] in design and use a small [[Sample size determination|sample size]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Romagnolo DF, Selmin OI | title = Flavonoids and cancer prevention: a review of the evidence | journal = J Nutr Gerontol Geriatr | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 206–38 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22888839 | doi = 10.1080/21551197.2012.702534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two apparent exceptions are [[gastric carcinoma]] and [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]]-related cancers.

===Cardiovascular diseases===

Among the most intensively studied of general human disorders possibly affected by dietary flavonoids, preliminary [[cardiovascular disease]] research has revealed the following mechanisms under investigation in patients or normal subjects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/issues/2009-03/view_features/new-roles-for-polyphenols |title=Non-Antioxidant Roles for Dietary Flavonoids: Reviewing the relevance to cancer and cardiovascular diseases |last1=Higdon |first1=J |last2=Drake |first2=V|last3=Frei|first3=B |date=March 2009 |website=Nutraceuticals World |publisher=Rodman Media |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Dam RM, Naidoo N, Landberg R | title = Dietary flavonoids and the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases | journal = Current Opinion in Lipidology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–33 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23254472 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0b013e32835bcdff }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tangney CC, Rasmussen HE | title = Polyphenols, Inflammation, and Cardiovascular Disease | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 324 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23512608 | pmc = 3651847 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-013-0324-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siasos G, Tousoulis D, Tsigkou V, Kokkou E, Oikonomou E, Vavuranakis M, Basdra EK, Papavassiliou AG, Stefanadis C | title = Flavonoids in atherosclerosis: An overview of their mechanisms of action | journal = Current Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 20 | issue = 21 | pages = 2641–2660 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23627935 | doi = 10.2174/0929867311320210003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= pmid19572741&gt;{{cite journal| last=Cappello| first=AR, Dolce V, Iacopetta D, Martello M, Fiorillo M, Curcio R, Muto L, Dhanyalayam D. |title= Bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso) Flavonoids and Their Potential Benefits in Human Hyperlipidemia and Atherosclerosis: an Overview |journal= Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry | year=2015|volume=16| issue=8 |pages=1–11|doi=10.2174/1389557515666150709110222| pmid=26156545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antibacterial===
Flavonoids have been shown to have (a) direct [[antibacterial]] activity, (b) [[synergistic]] activity with [[antibiotics]], and (c) the ability to suppress bacterial [[virulence factors]] in numerous ''[[in vitro]]'' and a limited number of ''[[in vivo]]'' studies.&lt;ref name="pmid21514796" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19844590"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor PW, Hamilton-Miller JM, Stapleton PD | title = Antimicrobial properties of green tea catechins | journal = Food Science and Technology Bulletin | volume = 2 | issue = 7 | pages = 71–81 | year = 2005 | pmid = 19844590 | pmc = 2763290 | doi = 10.1616/1476-2137.14184 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763290/pdf/nihms-1032.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noteworthy among the ''[[in vivo]]'' studies&lt;ref name="pmid17391908 "&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi O, Yahiro K, Morinaga N, Miyazaki M, Noda M | title = Inhibitory effects of various plant polyphenols on the toxicity of Staphylococcal alpha-toxin | journal = Microbial Pathogenesis | volume =  42| issue = 5–6 | pages = 215–224 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17391908 | doi = 10.1016/j.micpath.2007.01.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20512479"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oh DR, Kim JR, Kim YR | title = Genistein inhibits Vibrio vulnificus adhesion and cytotoxicity to HeLa cells | journal = Archives of Pharmacal Research | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 787–792 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20512479 | doi = 10.1007/s12272-010-0520-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18600388"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = González-Segovia R, Quintanar JL, Salinas E, Ceballos-Salazar R, Aviles-Jiménez F, Torres-López J | title = Effect of the flavonoid quercetin on inflammation and lipid peroxidation induced by Helicobacter pylori in gastric mucosa of guinea pig | journal = Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 441–447 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18600388 | doi = 10.1007/s00535-008-2184-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the finding that oral [[quercetin]] protects [[guinea pigs]] against the [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]] ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid18600388" /&gt;  Researchers from the [[European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition]]  have speculated this may be one reason why dietary flavonoid intake is associated with reduced [[gastric carcinoma]] risk in European women.&lt;ref name="pmid23076618"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zamora-Ros R, Agudo A, Luján-Barroso L, Romieu I, Ferrari P, Knaze V, Bueno-de-Mesquita HB, Leenders M, Travis RC, Navarro C, Sánchez-Cantalejo E, Slimani N, Scalbert A, Fedirko V, Hjartåker A, Engeset D, Skeie G, Boeing H, Förster J, Li K, Teucher B, Agnoli C, Tumino R, Mattiello A, Saieva C, Johansson I, Stenling R, Redondo ML, Wallström P, Ericson U, Khaw KT, Mulligan AA, Trichopoulou A, Dilis V, Katsoulis M, Peeters PH, Igali L, Tjønneland A, Halkjær J, Touillaud M, Perquier F, Fagherazzi G, Amiano P, Ardanaz E, Bredsdorff L, Overvad K, Ricceri F, Riboli E, González CA | title = Dietary flavonoid and lignan intake and gastric adenocarcinoma risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 96 | issue = 6 | pages = 1398–1408 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23076618 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.112.037358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional ''[[in vivo]]'' and [[Clinical trial|clinical]] research is needed to determine if flavonoids could be used as [[pharmaceutical drug]]s for the treatment of bacterial infection, or whether dietary flavonoid intake offers any protection against infection.

== Synthesis, detection, quantification, and semi-synthetic alterations ==

=== Color spectrum ===
Flavonoid synthesis in plants is induced by light color spectrums at both high and low energy radiations. Low energy radiations are accepted by [[phytochrome]], while high energy radiations are accepted by [[carotenoid]]s, [[Flavin group|flavins]], [[cryptochrome]]s in addition to phytochromes. The [[Photomorphogenesis|photomorphogenic]] process of phytochome-mediated flavonoid biosynthesis has been observed in [[Amaranth|''Amaranthus'']], [[barley]], [[maize]], ''[[Sorghum]]'' and [[turnip]]. Red light promotes flavonoid synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Plant Physiology|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=03S6VbTjCmUC|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2004-01-01|isbn = 9780849317149|language = en|first = Rajiv Kumar|last = Sinha|page = 457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Availability through microorganisms ===
Several recent research articles have demonstrated the efficient production of flavonoid molecules from genetically engineered microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hwang EI, Kaneko M, Ohnishi Y, Horinouchi S | title = Production of plant-specific flavanones by Escherichia coli containing an artificial gene cluster | journal = Appl.

;Sodium hydroxide test
About 5&amp;nbsp;mg of the compound is dissolved in water, warmed and filtered. 10% aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] is added to 2 ml of this solution. This produces a yellow coloration.

; p-Dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde test
A colorimetric assay based upon the reaction of A-rings with the chromogen [[p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde]] (DMACA) has been developed for flavanoids in beer that can be compared with the [[vanillin]] procedure.&lt;ref&gt;A new colourimetric assay for flavonoids in pilsner beers.

=== Quantification ===
Lamaison and Carnet have designed a test for the determination of the total flavonoid content of a sample (AlCI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; method). After proper mixing of the sample and the reagent, the mixture is incubated for 10 minutes at ambient temperature and the absorbance of the solution is read at 440&amp;nbsp;nm. Flavonoid content is expressed in mg/g of quercetin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lamaison, JL  |author2=Carnet, A |title=Teneurs en principaux flavonoides des fleurs de Cratageus monogyna Jacq et de Cratageus Laevigata (Poiret D.C) en Fonction de la vegetation|journal=Plantes Medicinales Phytotherapie|year= 1991|volume =25| pages= 12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semi-synthetic alterations ===
Immobilized ''[[Candida antarctica]]'' lipase can be used to catalyze the [[Regioselectivity|regioselective]] [[acylation]] of flavonoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Passicos E, Santarelli X, Coulon D | title = Regioselective acylation of flavonoids catalyzed by immobilized Candida antarctica lipase under reduced pressure | journal = Biotechnol Lett. | volume = 26 | issue = 13 | pages = 1073–1076 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15218382 | doi = 10.1023/B:BILE.0000032967.23282.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Martin van Maele - Francion 15.jpg|thumb|[[Martin van Maële]]'s print ''Francion 15'' depicts a couple engaging in foreplay outdoors]]
In [[Human sexual activity|human sexual behavior]], '''foreplay''' is a set of [[emotionally intimate|emotionally]] and [[physical intimacy|physically intimate]] acts between two or more people meant to create [[sexual arousal]] and [[sexual desire|desire]] for [[sexual activity]]. Foreplay results in physiological and mental responses in both parties in anticipation of the expected sexual activity. Either or any of the [[sexual partner]]s may indicate sexual interest and initiate foreplay, and the initiator may not be the active partner during the sexual activity. Foreplay stimulates both partners' sexuality, lowers [[Sexual inhibition|inhibition]]s and increases emotional intimacy between partners, and implies a certain level of confidence and trust between the partners. In [[animal sexual behavior]], the loose equivalent is sometimes termed 'precoital activity'.

Sexual desire is an aspect of a [[Human sexuality|person's sexuality]], which varies from one person to another. A person who desires sexual activity with another person can attempt to provoke sexual arousal in the person. Depending on the type and intensity of the relationship between the two people, the stimuli may involve indicating to the person in some subtle and romantic way that he or she has that desire or by provoking other [[erotic stimuli]]. There are many potential stimuli, both [[Stimulus (physiology)|physical]] and [[Stimulus (psychology)|mental]], which can cause a person to become sexually aroused, and which stimuli are invoked will depend on circumstances at a particular time.

On the other hand, there are other things which act as turn-offs, depending on the person's preferences. The response to an indication of sexual interest may be inhibited by issues of [[sexual morality]].

==Initiating==
[[File:Nipping the Nape.png|thumb|Foreplay by [[kissing]] on female's back]]

Foreplay can begin with one person indicating in some manner to another person a desire to engage in sexual activity with that other person. Any act that creates and enhances [[sexual desire]], interest, [[sexual stimulation|stimulation]] or arousal in a sexual partner may constitute foreplay. An indication of sexual desire can be through physical intimacy, such as [[kissing]], [[Physical intimacy|touching]], [[Hug|embracing]] or nibbling the partner. Mental engagement can also create sexual interest, such as [[flirting]], talking, whispering or [[teasing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/foreplay foreplay] cambridge.org&lt;/ref&gt; It may, for example, be a non-physical gesture that indicates sexual availability. Sexual interest can be indicated and created by [[nudity]], such as by one partner [[striptease|stripping]], or by wearing sexually suggestive clothing, or by creating a romantic, intimate, or overtly sexual atmosphere. The manual or oral touching of an [[erogenous zone]] may indicate sexual interest, as does an intimate kiss on the [[mouth]], [[breast]]s, [[stomach]], [[buttocks]], back and inner [[thigh]]s or other areas of the body. A passionate or [[French kiss]] commonly indicates sexual interest,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreplaytricks.com/deep-kissing.php Foreplay Tricks To Improve Your Sexual Relations: Deep kissing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220060836/http://www.foreplaytricks.com/deep-kissing.php |date=2010-02-20 }} Retrieved on 2010-02-18&lt;/ref&gt; as does any removal of a partner's clothing.

Verbally, foreplay may include compliments, subtle comments with [[double entendre]], and intimate conversations. Non-verbally, foreplay can include provocative clothing, suggestive postures and motions, [[personal grooming|preening]] gestures, winking, licking or biting one's lips, standing inside a partner's [[personal space]], and holding a gaze longer than would be expected from only a casual interest.

Foreplay commences when the other partner indicates reciprocal sexual interest. Depending on the context, the non-objection to a partner's advances may indicate that the sexual interest is reciprocated, as may a response to a kiss or hug. The non-objection to the touching of an erogenous zone, or the taking off of an item of clothing may indicate reciprocated sexual interest. Also, the other partner may indicate reciprocal interest by engaging in intimate behaviour of their own.

There are situations which act as turn-offs or which can affect the romantic or erotic moment that may have been created. Turn-offs can range from things like bad breath, body odor, excessive noise or a reference to an ex-partner. A person's [[sexual inhibition]] can also impact on creation or maintenance of sexual interest. Some people feel uncomfortable with acts such as [[French kiss]]ing, or the possibility of someone (e.g. children) intruding, or nudity, besides other situations.

==Games==
[[Sexual role-playing]] or sex games can create sexual interest.&lt;ref name="FGames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreplaygames.net |title=Fore Play Games |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games can be played in a variety of situations, and have been enhanced by technology. This type of extended foreplay can involve SMS messaging, phone calls, [[online chat]], or other forms of distance communication, which are intended to stimulate fantasizing about the forthcoming encounter. This tantalization builds up sexual tension.

A card or board game can be played for foreplay. The objective of the game is for the partners to indulge their fantasies. The loser can, for example, be required to [[strip games|remove clothing]] or give the winner a sensual [[foot massage]] or any other thing that the winner wants to try. A sensuous atmosphere can also be enhanced by candles, drinks, sensual food or suggestive clothing. Even a suggestion of the use of [[sex toys]] or the playing of games involving [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]], [[sexual bondage]], [[blindfolding]] or [[sploshing]] is an indication of sexual interest.

Some couples create sexual interest by watching [[erotic]] and [[pornography|pornographic]] videos. [[Role play]]ing may involve the partners wearing [[costumes]], to create and maintain a [[sexual fantasy]]. For variety, the partners can make up a (sexual) story together. One of them starts with a sentence and then the other continues until the story becomes sexually explicit, and it provides an opportunity for the partners to express their sexual fantasies. 'Strangers for a day' is a role playing game which consists of the couple playing roles of the first meeting between them. In a public meeting place, the partners pretend to be strangers meeting for the first time. The objective is for them to [[flirt]] and [[seduce]] the other, without doing or saying anything that they normally would not do or say at a first meeting.

==Tantric==
Tantric foreplay is the first step in the lovemaking session, according to the [[tantra]] principles. [[Tantric sex]] is against rushing things for the purpose of reaching an [[orgasm]], so tantric foreplay is a way to prepare the body and the mind for the union between the two bodies. The tantric rules say that foreplay must be focused on the preparation before sexual intercourse. Tantric foreplay may include sensual baths between the two partners in a relaxing atmosphere. [[Fragrance oil]] and candles may also be used to set up the mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Van Lysebeth |first = Andre |title = Tantra: the cult of the feminine |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-81-208-1759-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric foreplay is only about giving each other time to connect [[Spirituality|spiritually]] and bind. Staring at each other while in a cross-legged position and touching the other's hand palms is a usual foreplay tactic used by tantra practitioners.
Tantric foreplay may also include [[Tantra massage]]s. The massage that is applied, according to the tantric philosophy, is not for reaching orgasms but for giving each other pleasure and connecting at a spiritual level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalforeplay.com/pag24.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123012018/http://mentalforeplay.com/pag24.php|archivedate=2011-11-23|title=Tantra foreplay techniques|author=Mental Foreplay online portal|date=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Foreplay is important from at least two considerations, one of which is purely physiological.&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femaleforeplay.com |title=Female Foreplay Before Intercourse |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, foreplay implies a certain level of confidence and trust between the partners and creates intimacy.

Psychologically, foreplay lowers [[Sexual inhibition|inhibitions]] and increases [[emotional intimacy]] between partners. Physically, it stimulates the process that produces [[sexual arousal]].

Foreplay has important physical and psychological effects on women. The biggest issue related to the ability of achieving orgasms is thought to be solved with the right foreplay techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreplayforwomen.net/mental.html Mental foreplay for women] Retrieved on 2010-02-24&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the subject of the effectiveness of foreplay continues to be a point of discussion. An example of this is a European survey of 2,300 women in Prague which showed that foreplay is not the key in a satisfactory sexual act. Instead "the duration of intercourse – 16.2 minutes on average – is the clincher".&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3405928/Foreplay-is-overrated-researchers-claim.html "Foreplay is overrated, researchers claim"] 2010-02-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Foreplay can vary dramatically based on age, religion, and cultural norms. In spite of the clichéd modern folklore that women demand more foreplay and require more time to become physically aroused, recent scientific research refutes that myth. Scientists from [[McGill University Health Centre]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada used the method of [[thermography|thermal imaging]] to record baseline [[temperature]] change in the genital area as the definition of the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal and concluded that, on average, women and men spend almost the same time for sexual arousal — around 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060930094145.htm Thermal Imaging Shatters Arousal Gender Gap Myth; Study Shows Women Become Aroused As Quickly As Men]&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, does not take into account the amount of time necessary to become mentally aroused. There are hypotheses that relates foreplay as a factor which would increase fertility rates although more research is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Segura-Sampedro JJ.

== History ==
There are many historical references to foreplay, with many artistic depictions. The [[History of India|Ancient Indian]] work ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' mentions different types of embracing, kissing, and marking with nails and teeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessbuildersbanquet.com/software/kamasutra.pdf translation], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama205.htm biting types], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama204.htm using nails]&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions [[BDSM]] activities such as slapping and moaning as "play".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama207.htm slapping] Kama Sutra&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]] and [[optics]], the '''Fraunhofer lines''' are a set of [[spectral line]]s named after the German physicist [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] (1787–1826). The lines were originally observed as dark features ([[absorption line]]s) in the [[optical spectrum]] of the [[Sun]].

==Discovery==
[[Image:Fraunhofer lines.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Solar spectrum with Fraunhofer lines as it appears visually.]]
In 1802, the English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]]&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;Melvyn C. Usselman: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646649/William-Hyde-Wollaston William Hyde Wollaston] Encyclopædia Britannica, retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; was the first person to note the appearance of a number of dark features in the solar spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;William Hyde Wollaston (1802) [http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/92/365.full.pdf+html "A method of examining refractive and dispersive powers, by prismatic reflection,"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'', '''92''': 365–380; see especially p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, Fraunhofer independently rediscovered the lines and began a systematic study and careful measurement of the [[wavelength]] of these features. In all, he mapped over 570 lines, and designated the principal features with the letters A through K, and weaker lines with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hearnshaw|first=J.B.|title=The analysis of starlight|date=1986|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-39916-5|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fraunhofer (1814 - 1815) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2-AAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203 "Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farben-Zerstreuungs - Vermögens verschiedener Glasarten, in Bezug auf die Vervollkommnung achromatischer Fernröhre"] (Determination of the refractive and color-dispersing power of different types of glass, in relation to the improvement of achromatic telescopes), ''Denkschriften der Königlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu München'' (Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Munich), '''5''':  193–226; see especially pages 202–205 and the plate following page 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Sources==
The Fraunhofer lines are typical spectral absorption lines. Absorption lines are dark lines, narrow regions of decreased intensity, that are the result of photons being absorbed as light passes from the source to the detector. In the Sun, Fraunhofer lines are a result of gas in the [[photosphere]], the outer region of the sun. The photosphere gas is colder than the inner regions and absorbs light emitted from those regions.

The Fraunhofer C, F, G', and h lines correspond to the alpha, beta, gamma and delta lines of the [[Balmer series]] of [[emission line]]s of the hydrogen atom.  The Fraunhofer letters are now rarely used for those lines.

The D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lines form the well-known "sodium doublet", the centre wavelength of which (589.29&amp;nbsp;nm) is given the designation letter "D". This historical designation for this line has stuck and is given to all the transitions between the ground state and the first excited state of the other alkali atoms as well.  The D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lines correspond to the [[fine structure|fine-structure]] splitting of the excited states.  This may be confusing because the excited state for this transition is the P-state of the alkali and should not be confused with the higher D-states.

The Fraunhofer H and K letters are also still used for the calcium-II doublet in the violet part of the spectrum, important in [[astronomical spectroscopy]].

Note that there is disagreement in the literature for some line designations; e.g., the Fraunhofer d-line may refer to the [[cyan]] iron line at 466.814&amp;nbsp;nm, or alternatively to the [[yellow]] helium line (also labeled D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at 587.5618&amp;nbsp;nm. Similarly, there is ambiguity with reference to the e-line, since it can refer to the spectral lines of both iron (Fe) and mercury (Hg). In order to resolve ambiguities that arise in usage, ambiguous Fraunhofer line designations are preceded by the element with which they are associated (e.g., Mercury e-line and Helium d-line).

Because of their well defined wavelengths, Fraunhofer lines are often used to characterize the [[refractive index]] and [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties of optical materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41347">'''Gender policing''' is the imposition or enforcement of [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[gender expression]]s on an individual who is perceived as [[gender variance|not adequately performing]], through appearance or behavior, the [[assigned sex|sex that was assigned to them at birth]] (see [[gender performativity]]). Gender policing serves to devalue or delegitimize expressions that deviate from normative conceptions of gender, thus reinforcing the [[gender binary]]. According to [[Judith Butler]], rejection of individuals who are non-normatively gendered is a component of creating one's own gender identity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Butler|url=http://lauragonzalez.com/TC/BUTLER_gender_trouble.pdf|editor=Laura J. Nicholson|title=Gender Trouble Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|publisher=Routledge|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gender mainstreaming]] is a [[public policy]] concept, whereas gender policing is a more general [[social phenomenon]].

It is common for normative gender performances of gender to be encouraged and rewarded, while non-normative performances are discouraged through punishment or generally negative reactions. Policing of non-normative performances ranges in intensity from relatively minor discouraging comments to brutal acts of violence. Tactics of gender policing also vary widely, depending in part on the perceived gender of the individual target.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html|title=The Roots Of Homophobia - Inside The Mind Of People Who Hate Gays - Assault On Gay America |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Heteronormativity and the gender binary==

Gender policing aims to keep gender roles rigid and aligned according to the [[gender binary]]. The gender binary is the idea that gender exists as the opposition between man and woman. [[Heteronormativity]], as an institution, is an extension of this belief that posits that gender and sexuality are expressions of biology. This functionalism of biology asserts that male and female genitalia only serve the purpose of procreation, which creates gender roles that manifest from a perceived innate desire, giving sexuality a specific purpose within society.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

[[Gayle Rubin]]'s writing in "The Traffic in Women" links the creation of the gender binary to the subordination of women in western society. Rubin studied the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Levi Strauss]] to gain a better understanding of the creation of the "sex/gender system". Rubin found that "woman" was a role created in opposition to "man" and served the purpose of building power, trade relationships, and mutual aid through the exchange of women by marriage. These [[Kinship]] systems necessitated rules, which had to be policed to ensure their continued survival. These rules crystalized into heteronormativity, culturally instilling the rules for accepted sexuality in western society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://genderstudiesgroupdu.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/the-rraffic-in-women.pdf|contribution=The Traffic in Women|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Literary Theory: An Anthology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender binary in western society was formalized from the interpretations of men and women during the [[hunter-gatherer]] ages. During this [[Mesolithic]] or Middle Stone Age in North-West Europe, hunting and gathering food was a prominent survival strategy. Early interpretations of these survival techniques is one of the main reasons for the current idea of the gender binary within western society. In his review of the ethnography of gathering shellfish, Clive Bonsall incorrectly presumed that women and children were primarily gatherers and men were the hunters do to their stronger skill set. These assumptions of past societies shaped the current structure of western society into the beliefs that men are the providers and women are the supporters. Additionally in the idea of heterosexual marriage as the societal norm came from the analysis of the interactions between different Mesolithic populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Hannah|date=2005|title=Straight down the line? A queer consideration of hunter-gatherer studies in north-west Europe|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00438240500395862|journal=World Archaeology|volume=37|issue=4|pages=630–636|doi=10.1080/00438240500395862|issn=0043-8243|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another mentality that strengthens the idea of binary gender within western society is the warrior-breeder relationship. In this mentality, masculinity is characterized by the traits of the model warrior: strong and fearless, yet disposable. Meanwhile, femininity and womanhood revolve around reproduction. In this relationship, there are only two types of people; therefore, two genders. This dichotomy is valued because it keeps society safe in times of war. The warriors fight and protect while the breeders replace the fallen warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=6.

From the works of LGB activism during the late 1980’s to 1990’s, the [[queer theory]] was created along with the influential work of Foucault and Sedgewick. The queer theory creates a space outside the gender binary. This theory deconstructs and discredits the idea of a gender binary. Disregarding the gender binary caused fears within the western society, ultimately leading to gender policing in order to maintain the idea of binary gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt183q5wt|title=Gender Politics|last=Monro|first=Surya|date=2015-11-30|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=9781849644952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Man and woman as categories can not exist without the other to enforce what they are and are not. The same can be said of heterosexuality and homosexuality. These categories are created out of their opposition, forming power dynamics. [[Michel Foucault]] referred to this creation of identities, through creating discourse surrounding the ideal, as reverse discourse. This antagonistic relationship between identities is the basis for gender policing. Deviation from normative expression, of either gender or sexuality, is often met with varying degrees violence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Spargo, Tamsin. Post Modern Encounters Foucault and Queer Theory. New York: Totem, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patriarchy and hegemonic masculinity==

[[Patriarchy|Patriarchal]] societies perpetuate masculine dominance in all aspects of life. Patriarchy privileges masculine thought and expression creating a gender hierarchy where women and the feminine are subordinated. The concept of [[hegemonic masculinity]] describes a hierarchy even within masculinity itself. Hegemonic masculinity allows for the terms and expression of masculinity to be renegotiated according to time, culture, and class status, allowing for the rationalization of its continued dominance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.W. | last2 = Messerschmidt | first2 = James W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Hegemonic masculinity: rethinking the concept | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 829–859 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243205278639 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639 | ref = harv| postscript = .}} [http://xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Connell,%20Hegemonic%20masculinity_0.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist, [[Raewyn Connell]] created the theory of hegemonic masculinity in order to explain the relationships between men and women and between the class of men within a patriarchal system. This theory is based on Antonio Gramsci’s concept of hegemony –– conformity or subordination of one group which creates class-based domination. Connell’s theory explains the ways in which ideal or normalized masculine traits have the highest values in western society. These masculine attributes include wealth, control over resources, fertility, attractiveness, heterosexuality, physical strength, and emotional detachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400842629|title=The New Arab Man|last=Inhorn|first=Marcia C.|date=2012-01-31|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400842629|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demetrakis Z. Demetriou further divided hegemonic masculinity into two types: external and internal. External hegemonic masculinity refers to the subordination of women under men. Internal hegemonic masculinity is the spectrum of masculinity seen within men. This spectrum is defined by the amount of power and masculinity a man holds. The patriarchy needs hegemonic masculinity in order to maintain power. In order to keep this power, men must be policed and women must me dominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connell|first=R. W.|last2=Messerschmidt|first2=James W.|date=2005|title=Hegemonic Masculinity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=6|pages=829–859|doi=10.1177/0891243205278639|issn=0891-2432|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ideal form of masculinity is seen by patriarchal power, men that fit in this norm are seen as what a human should embody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemon|first=Jennifer|date=1995|title=Masculinity in Crisis?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4065897|journal=Agenda|issue=24|pages=61|doi=10.2307/4065897|issn=1013-0950}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The gender hierarchy created by patriarchy and hegemonic masculinity creates competition for dominance resulting in the policing of gender and sexuality. Policing of masculinity in a heteronormative society reinforces the gender binary. Individuals seeking to reaffirm their position in a masculine hierarchy seek out and police individuals performing inadequately. Those performing inadequately must either conform to the accepted forms of gender and sexual expression or risk violence and ostracism.&lt;ref name="pbs.org" /&gt;

Fathers are more likely than mothers to enforce gender boundaries, or police the gendered expressions of their children. Second, both fathers and mothers enforce gender boundaries more frequently with sons than with daughters.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; Research on the topic of parental gender policing has shown that female children who display traditionally masculine traits or behaviors receive more social and parental acceptance than male children who exhibit traditionally feminine tendencies.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many scholars on the subject argue that this is due to the greater value assigned to "masculine" traits or behaviors compared to "feminine" ones, and/or beliefs that "tomboyism" is temporary.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At least one study indicates that parents across various social locations celebrate and encourage their preschool age daughters to engage in gender nonconformity, such as wearing sports-themed clothing and participating in traditionally male activities.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; However, other research indicates that in part due to peer and parental pressures, "tomboys", or female children with "masculine" traits or behavioral tendencies, frequently either abandon these tendencies in adolescence, or adopt a more feminine performance but retain many masculine skills and traits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pressures to conform to gender norms increase with age, and often manifest in these children being "instructed or shamed to conform to traditional femininity – in dress, appearance, posture, manner, interests, and dating."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Psychoanalysis== 

Fields of knowledge that claim to be universal are still created within societal frameworks that have their own rules and biases. A patriarchal society gives privilege to masculine thought and excludes other points of view and histories. All discourse created in a patriarchal society can be said to acquiesce to hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

Michel Foucault viewed [[Psychoanalysis]] as a secular confession concerned with finding our natural sexual selves. The problem, Foucault argued, is that sexuality is cultural and any narrative created around it gives the subject the illusion of identity rather than experience. Psychoanalysis conducted in a hetero-normative society would view any deviation as a failing to achieve that ideal. Rather than someone being seen as performing an act, they would be seen as embodying that which society deemed inadequate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Gayle Rubin wrote about Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory in "The Traffic In Women". Rubin states that [[Jacques Lacan]]'s analysis of Freud views the [[Oedipus complex]] as the crisis experienced by a child when internalizing kinship rules. The child becomes aware of the sex/gender system and organizes itself accordingly. [[Neurosis]] is seen as having an understanding of this system yet failing to adapt to it. Lacan's separation of the [[Phallus]] from the physical penis elucidates societies privileging of the masculine and gender's separation from biology. In Rubin's view psychiatry further policed accepted gender and sexual expression by deeming non normative behavior as mentally and emotionally stunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/sexandsociety/files/2015/01/Rubin-Thinking-Sex.pdf|title=Thinking Sex|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin also saw that this system of internalizing norms privileged heterosexual masculinity while outlining the psychic oppression society inflicts on women and femininity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Intersectionality ==

Gender policing affects different social identifications in different ways. Along with gender, characteristic attributes such as [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender identity]], [[Social class|class]], [[sexual orientation]], age, religion, [[creed]], and disability interact with each other and are affected differently by gender policing. The effect of intersection of these social categories are studied in [[intersectionality]] theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/topics/coloniality-of-gender/|title=Coloniality of Gender – GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|website=globalsocialtheory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Understanding intersectionality within gender policing can be done by tracing back and analyzing the relation between race and gender in history. Race and gender over time produced hierarchies within themselves. Similar to the way the classification of "man" cannot exist without "woman", "white" people cannot exist without "black" people. Race as a classification arose from European capitalist colonialism. European colonists deemed those who weren't "white", primitive and deserving of domination and "civilizing". Global colonialism by European capitalists imposed European ways of knowing and being on the peoples they colonized. This included a racialized and patriarchal conception of gender. The view of colonized peoples as primitive created a distinction between "white" (human) and "black" (property or inhuman). The view of "black" as other than human excluded "black" people from classifications of gender. In western society, being "white" and middle class continue to inform gender norms, leaving "non-white" people unable to perform accepted [[femininity]] or [[masculinity]].

In modern day times, intersectionality now touches upon various other forms of human characterizations, affecting people in countless different ways. How a white transgender woman may experience gender policing is going to differ greatly from how an asian heterosexual woman might (etc). 

==Socialization==

An individual's expression of gender is often first policed by their parent(s), as well as other elder authorities such as teachers and day care providers, at a very young age. Gender policing is part of the process of "gendering" children, or socializing them in a way considered conventionally appropriate to their assigned sex. Once children are taught gender norms and experience their enforcement, they are likely to begin policing others – both their peers and their elders.

=== Early Childhood ===
Gender policing begins with gender enforcing from parents teaching their children what is "masculine" and what is "feminine" in the traditional sense of these terms. These traditional ideas of gender are reinforced through practices such as referring to children as "boys" and "girls" which "makes sex/ gender the central component of how kids think of themselves, understand their social group, and view themselves through their parents’ eyes."&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1rrd98k|title=Chasing Rainbows: Exploring Gender Fluid Parenting Practices|last=|first=|date=2013|publisher=Demeter Press|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Green|editor-first=Fiona Joy|location=|pages=|editor-last2=Friedman|editor-first2=May}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Jane Ward, professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies at University of California, Riverside, writes in her chapter of the book ''Chasing Rainbows: Exploring Gender Fluid Parenting Practices'', even parents who hope to redefine "boyhood" or "girlhood" (such as through allowing a "tomboy" daughter, or dressing a son in dresses, for example), still reinforce the concept of gender as a binary which is biologically determined.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; The gender binary is already enforced in obvious places, such as in the segregation of toys in stores, for example.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

Ethnographic research in preschools has also contributed to the body of knowledge related to gender policing. This research has suggested that teachers give their students gendered instructions about what to do with their bodies. Across several schools, teachers gave boys explicit bodily instructions more frequently than girls, indicating that boys' bodies are policed more often than girls'.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin, K. 1998. Becoming a Gendered Body: Practices of Preschools. ''American Sociological Review'', 63(4), 494-511.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may be because teachers were more forceful with their instructions to girls, who were also usually quicker to follow instructions, thus teachers did not need to repeat themselves as often. Teachers were also more likely to direct boys to cease behaviors (e.g. running, throwing objects), whereas they were more apt to instruct girls to alter them. For example, girls were given directive bodily instructions such as "talk to her, don't yell, sit here, pick that up, be careful, be gentle, give it to me, put it down there."&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; As a result, a wider range of potential activities is available to boys than girls, because although they are dissuaded from some, they are not directed to engage in specific activities as often as girls are. According to Martin, the scholar and sociologist who conducted this research, "Gendering of the body in childhood is the foundation on which further gendering of the body occurs throughout the life course. The gendering of children's bodies makes gender differences feel and appear natural, which allows for such bodily differences to emerge throughout the life course."&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

Relatively recent efforts have been made to limit gender policing, particularly in childhood. Sweden's reformation of their school system in 1962 resulted in a new curriculum which included objectives to limit gender policing in early education. Within this new curriculum it was determined that "Pre-schools should work to counteract traditional gender and gender roles. Girls and boys in pre-schools should have the same opportunities to try and develop their abilities and interests without being limited by stereotyped gender roles." &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayne|first=Emma|date=|title=Gender Pedagogy in Swedish Pre-Schools: An Overview|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12147-009-9076-x#citeas|journal=Springer Link|volume=Vol. 26|pages=130-140|via=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; These preschools, elementary, and secondary schools aim to reduce the gender policing placed onto children, but through doing this must show how teachers and other pedagogical adults may accidentally reinforce gender stereotypes. Tools teachers use to combat this include practices such as keeping journals and videotaping classroom interactions (a practice proposed by Susanne Rithander). A general pedagogical practice in these Swedish schools in called ''compensatory pedagogy'', which plays off the idea that, per traditional gender roles, boys are encouraged to maintain autonomy while girls are encouraged to maintain closeness with others. ''Compensatory pedagogy'' challenges these traditional gender roles by encouraging girls to maintain autonomy and boys to build closeness with others.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Some parents have attempted to limit gender policing through their parenting styles, as is the case with Storm's parents, who chose no to gender their child but instead to wait until their child could decide for his/herself. Unlike the relative success so far of Swedish schools in limiting gender policing, individual efforts by Kathy and David, Storm's parents, faced huge media backlash. In the chapter titled ''Get Your Gender Binary Off My Childhood!: Towards a Movement for Childrenʹs Gender Self-Determination'', Ward shows how Storm's parents were often called deceitful and manipulative, as Ward puts it, "For not revealing what they knew about Storm’s genitals, Kathy and David were accused of hiding Storm’s very selfhood." &lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

=== Adolescence ===
Adolescence is a developmental stage in which [[peer group]]s are especially important, and peer relationships take primacy over familial relationships. It is also a stage during which gender policing amongst peers becomes increasingly common. Adolescents have already been introduced, during childhood, to normative gender expressions and social expectations therein by elders. These expectations are then reinforced during adolescence, largely by peers gender policing one another. In this (and every) stage of development, gender policing is especially prevalent in explicitly gendered environments, such as bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams.

''[[Dude, You're a Fag]]'', a book by [[CJ Pascoe]], examines [[masculinity]] and gender policing in high schools through [[ethnographic]] research. Pascoe largely focuses on high school boys' use of the [[Faggot (slang)|fag]] [[epithet]] to establish their own masculinity by questioning or challenging others'. In this context, the use of the fag epithet is a form of gender policing, frequently applied to boys who lack heterosexual prowess or are deemed inadequately masculine or strong. According to Pascoe, "[the fag identity] is fluid enough that boys police their behaviors out of fear of having the fag identity permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize a fag behavior and strive to avoid it".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dude You're A Fag: Masculinity and Sexuality in High School (2007), by C.J. Pascoe.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of male students of a co-educational, Catholic high school demonstrates insights from adolescent males themselves in regard to gender policing. This study highlights the gender policing of males by each other through exploring the types of bullying being practiced. Forms of bullying (and gender policing) come from accusations of males being homosexual. One participant in the study explains that he was bullied for dancing ballet and described his bullying as "Just a lot to do with being a woman", thus showing an association of specific activities with a specific gender (and that deviance from typical gender roles proves a perceived grounds for bullying). &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martino|first=Wayne|date=2000-01-01|title=Policing Masculinities: Investigating the Role of Homophobia and Heteronormativity in the Lives of Adolescent School Boys|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3149/jms.0802.213|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=213–236|doi=10.3149/jms.0802.213|issn=1060-8265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the practice of conducting interviews, the study briefly explores an observed policing of male behavior by females. One interviewee "appears to be drawing attention to the different norms for governing the conduct of girls who police boys’ bullying practices through a condemnation of violent behaviors".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Interviewees also draw attention to the confirmation and reinforcement of attitudes and practices considered "masculine" within males. In addition, these "masculine" identifiers are further enforced through female interaction and confirmation. In conducting these interviews, it is also found how adolescents view the stereotypical concept of masculinity as a concept which is ingrained early on in their lives and “passed on from their fathers".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Adulthood ===
During adulthood, gender policing generally becomes more subtle. However, for an individual whose gender is perceived as ambiguous, blatant forms still exist. These range from curious inquiries by children (e.g. "Are you a boy or a girl?") to gender policing in bathrooms (discussed in the following section). People who are gender-normative in appearance experience primarily behavioral gender policing, such as reminders to act in a more (or less) feminine or masculine manner. Men are more often dissuaded and shamed for feminine behavior than women are for masculine behavior. It is theorized that this is due, at least in part, to the higher societal value of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Kane"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kane, E.|year=2006|title=No Way My Boys Are Going to be like That!" Parents' Responses to Children's Gender Nonconformity|journal=Gender and Society|volume=20|issue=2|pages=149–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carr, C. L.|year=1998|title=Tomboy Resistance and Conformity: Agency in Social Psychological Gender Theory|journal=Gender and Society|volume=12|issue=5|pages=528–553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender policing has been reinforced in adults for many years. As [[Angela Davis|Angela Y. Davis]] points out, early women's prisons relied on gender policing as a means of reformation. The first women's reformatory in the U.S. opened in Indiana and included areas designed as kitchens, living rooms, and nurseries. The idea was to train women about domesticity through activities such as cooking, sewing, and cleaning.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Are Prisons Obsolete?|last=Davis|first=Angela Y.|publisher=Publishers Group Canada|year=2003|isbn=978-1-58322-581-3|location=Toronto, ON|pages=60-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex verification in sports|Sex testing]] and verification in sports and athletics shows gender policing as a practice still relevant to many countries and athletic organizations in recent history. In the case of the nineteen-year-old Missouri runner Helen Stephens in the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Olympics]], who finished first place in the 100-meter race, many questioned her sex because they could not fathom a the concept of a woman running so quickly. Sex testing and verification has existed throughout human history, even being traced back to practices in ancient Greek contests. Within these Greek traditions, women were deterred from participation and even spectatorship at times. In the examples of both Greek practices and the story of Helen Stephens of Missouri, it can be seen how women are often more likely to be subject to sex verification processes and accusations of deceit (i.e. women are often accused of actually being men disguised as women; men are not often accused of being women disguised as men).&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt18j8xsf|title=Sex Testing: Gender Policing in Women's Sports|last=PIEPER|first=LINDSAY PARKS|date=2016|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252040221|doi=10.5406/j.ctt18j8xsf.5#metadata_info_tab_contents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transgender, androgynous, and gender non-conforming individuals==
The severity of gender policing is often proportional to the extremity of non-normativity. For example, [[transgender]] individuals are likely to be victims of the most extreme and violent forms of gender policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://incite-national.org/sites/default/files/incite_files/resource_docs/3515_toolkitrev-policinggender.pdf|title=Policing Gender|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research regarding conformity pressures and gender resistance among [[transfeminine]] individuals (those who are assigned the male sex at birth but identify as more feminine than masculine) indicates that these persons experienced "intense and pervasive" pressures to conform to traditional masculinity, and feared exposure of their gender identity would result in physical danger or loss of legal, economic, or social standing.&lt;ref name="Gagne"&gt;Gagné, P., &amp; Tewksbury, R. 1998. Conformity Pressures and Gender Resistance among Transgendered Individuals. ''Social Problems'', 45(1), 81-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, transgender individuals must often choose between self-preservation and expressing their self-identified gender.&lt;ref name="Gagne" /&gt;

Gender policing is especially prevalent in bathrooms due to the increased salience of gender in explicitly gendered environments (and the forced binary of "men" and "women").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/09/02/guest-post-go-where-sex-gender-and-toilets/|title=Go Where? Sex, Gender, and Toilets - Sociological Images|first=The Society|last=Pages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this issue is frequently encountered by transgender and [[genderqueer]] individuals, to a lesser extent, it is also experienced by persons with [[androgynous]] or gender ambiguous appearances. For individuals with non-normative gender identities, the choice of which bathroom to use is often laden with "anxiety, ambivalence, and anticipated harassment."&lt;ref name="EmbodiedResistance"&gt;Embodied Resistance: Challenging the Norms, Breaking the Rules (2011), edited by C. Bobel and S. Kwan.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for gender-normative people to alert security of the presence of transgender (or androgynous) individuals in a bathroom, regardless of whether the bathroom they are using conforms to their sex or to their gender identity.&lt;ref name="EmbodiedResistance" /&gt; According to [[Judith Halberstam|Jack Halberstam]], the main distinction between gender policing in the women's room and in the men's room is that in the former, not only trans women, but all gender ambiguous females are scrutinized, whereas in the latter, biological males are less frequently deemed out of place.&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity"&gt;Female Masculinity (1998), by Judith Halberstam.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, compared to trans women in the women's room, trans men in the men's room are likely to be less scrutinized because men are less vigilant about intruders than women.&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity" /&gt; However, a trans man in the men's room is more likely to be met with violence if he does not succeed in [[Passing (sociology)|passing]].&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity" /&gt; 

Transwomen and transmen are “six times more likely to experience discrimination” than non-trans people.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bender-Baird|first=Kyla|date=2015-09|title=Peeing under surveillance: bathrooms, gender policing, and hate violence|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0966369X.2015.1073699?needAccess=true&amp;|journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture|language=en|volume=23|issue=7|pages=983–988|doi=10.1080/0966369x.2015.1073699|issn=0966-369X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2,000 incidents of anti-LGBT hate crimes were reported to the [[National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs]] in 2013. In 2014, there was a national study of trans violence discovered with the results of  “53% of respondents reporting verbal assault and 8% physical assault in a place of public accommodation”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. As a site where gender norms are policed, bathrooms are the most common public accommodation where trans people and gender non-conforming people experience hate violence. People tend to believe that there is a connection between genitals and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westbrook|first=Laurel|last2=Schilt|first2=Kristen|date=2013-09-24|title=Doing Gender, Determining Gender|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243213503203|journal=Gender &amp; Society|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=32–57|doi=10.1177/0891243213503203|issn=0891-2432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the gender segregation of bathrooms is based on genital configuration. Because of this “match” between genitals and gender, trans people often are labeled as “deceivers” and blamed for the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathers|first=Lain A. B.|date=2017-04-03|title=Bathrooms, Boundaries, and Emotional Burdens: Cisgendering Interactions Through the Interpretation of Transgender Experience|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/symb.295|journal=Symbolic Interaction|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=295–316|doi=10.1002/symb.295|issn=0195-6086}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a trans or androgynous person is questioned in the bathroom, the reaction is “not to reassess the arbitrary nature of segregating bathrooms by sex but to violently eject the trans or gender non-conforming person”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Using a public bathroom is no longer a simple matter for trans and gender non-conforming people. 

As of March 2017, 19 states (California, Nevada, Hawaii, New York, etc.), the District of Columbia and over 200 cities have enforced the anti-discrimination law toward transgender people allowing them to use any public restroom that corresponds to their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/-bathroom-bill-legislative-tracking635951130.aspx|title="Bathroom Bill" Legislative Tracking|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, most public accommodations changed their restroom signs where there are both genders and the text “Gender Neutral Restroom” or “Inclusive Restroom”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/health/transgender-bathroom-law-facts-myths/index.html|title=3 myths in the transgender bathroom debate|last=CNN|first=Emanuella Grinberg and Dani Stewart,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law was passed because of the March 2016 “[[Bathroom bill|Bathroom Bill]]” in North Carolina. The bill argued that banning people from using public restrooms of their choice due to the biological sex listed on their birth certificates (genitals vs. gender) was unreasonable, therefore, it launched transgender rights into the national spotlight. 

== Fashion and Modern Opposition of Gender Policing ==
In 1924, gender norms accepted and re enforced ideologies that shadowed Freud’s hegemonic thesis that “biology is the key determinant of gender identity”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3672297/future-gender-norms/|title=The Past, Present and Future of Gender Norms|last=|first=|date=|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These norms were imbedded into cultural regularity, affecting gender identity in everyday life, law and politics. Gender policing strategies enforced these norms, and a prevalent tactic was to use culturally obligatory [[Dress code|dress codes]] as a tool in forcing people into gender binaries. However progressive movements throughout history have worked vigorously to defy policing, combating restrictive norms through disregard and reformation of policed gender standards. Following of Freud’s theory has steadily begun to dwindle and new studies are beginning to reveal a popular uprising theory that individuals make their own decisions as to which gender distinguishments apply to them.  Modern opposition of gender norms are erasing the aged policing of conforming to the standards of one’s sex.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to a study by Intelligence Group, a consumer insights company, “More than two-thirds of people ages 14 to 34 agree that gender does not have to define a person in the way that it used to… and 6 in 10 say that men and women do not need to conform to traditional gender roles or behaviors anymore.” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/30/363345372/for-these-millennials-gender-norms-have-gone-out-of-style|title=For These Millennials, Gender Norms Have Gone Out Of Style|last=|first=|date=|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

=== Gender Policing Dress Codes ===
Older fashion protocols systematically enforced normative gender binaries, confining people to dress and accessorize in a way that connected to their sex. Society would use gender policing tactics to enforce cultural and societal acceptance of a gendered dress code. Women were to dress in a feminine style, while men had to style themselves in a masculine way. The way one dressed was meant to represent their sex and it’s stereotypes, “Circumstantial or societal norms dictate the outfits we choose to wear, often reflecting the expectations we are held to” &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uresearch.unm.edu/breaking-gender-norms-through-fashion.pdf|title=Breaking Gender Norms through Fashion: Lessons from Georgia O’Keeffe|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its only recently that most [[Sumptuary law|sumptuary]] type laws, laws used to enforce “gender appropriate clothes” and arrest people who “impersonate” another gender, have been overturned. For example, “a person perceived as male who dressed in clothing customarily designed for women could technically be arrested in New York for “impersonating a female” as recently as 2011 — the remnants of a 19th century statewide law prohibiting wearing “the dress of the opposite sex.”&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/arresting-dress-timeline-anti-cross-dressing-laws-u-s|title=Arresting dress: A timeline of anti-cross-dressing laws in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Cultural policing tactics such as slut shaming, [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]] are still used today to police fashion. There is still a long way to go for those pushing for the elimination of policed gendered dress codes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Using Fashion in Modern Opposition ====
This reformation campaign against gender policed conformity has found a focus in developing cultural acceptance for fluidity in modern cultural dress codes. Nowadays decisions on gender identity are seen as self made and a form of “self expression”. A prevalent way of expressing ones identity and not conforming to gender norms is through personal choice in style. These choices include apparel, accessories and beauty habits. Style has a “symbolic meaning” of self expression, “giving us a means to cultivate our own visions of the culture we experience around us”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;. Therefor, fashion nonconformity has expansively become wonted and accepted by a rising number of millennials who believe in bending past policed gendered binaries. They do this by ignoring the outdated dress codes that were previously used to confine someone to their gender identity. In disregarding a dress code that has been used as a weapon in enforcing gender binary, millennials have found a powerful opposition to gender policing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;


Modern gender-specific fashion has become more flexible to personal preference, becoming visibly more directed against old gendered style constraints. The refusal to conform to the rules of outdated fashion protocol is being embraced by [[a la mode]] fashion and mainstream style. A recent pattern in clothing and accessories that transcend gender style norms has become steadily vogue and evidently pioneering fashion trends have increasingly grown accepting to the fusion of normally gender specific style details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2017/06/famous-women-who-have-worn-menswear#11|title=Famous Women Have Been Defying Gender Norms and Rocking Menswear for Years|last=Weaver|first=Hilary|date=|website=Vanities|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trendy nonconforming styles empower women to dress in an inclusively “masculine” manner and enable men to adapt “feminine” attributes in their style, for example women choosing to wear suits to work, or men wearing nail polish, etc. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Global Peace Index''' ('''GPI''') measures the relative position of nations' and regions' peacefulness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index 2017|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GPI ranks 163 independent states and territories according to their levels of peacefulness.

The GPI is a report produced by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]] (IEP) and developed in consultation with an international panel of peace experts from peace institutes and [[think tank]]s with data collected and collated by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. The Index was first launched in May 2007, with subsequent reports being released annually. It is claimed to be the first study to rank countries around the world according to their peacefulness. In 2017 it ranked 163 countries, up from 121 in 2007. In the past decade, the GPI has presented trends of increased global violence and less peacefulness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicawang/2016/06/17/the-worlds-most-and-least-peaceful-countries-in-2016/#24c9f81a644f|title=The World's Most And Least Peaceful Countries In 2016|last=Wang|first=Monica|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study is the brainchild of Australian technology entrepreneur [[Steve Killelea]], founder of Integrated Research, and is endorsed by individuals such as former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]], economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], former president of Ireland [[Mary Robinson]], former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Jan Eliasson]] and former United States president [[Jimmy Carter]]. The updated index is released each year at events in London, Washington, DC; and at the United Nations Secretariat in New York between many others.

The GPI gauges global peace using three broad themes: the level of societal safety and security, the extent of ongoing domestic and international conflict and the degree of militarization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Factors are both internal such as levels of violence and crime within the country and external such as [[Military budget|military expenditure]] and wars. It has been criticised by [[Riane Eisler]] for not including indicators specifically relating to violence against women and children, however reliable international data on these subjects is either unavailable or very sparsely reported in many countries.

The 2017 GPI indicates [[Iceland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[Austria]], and [[Denmark]] to be the most peaceful countries and [[Syria]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[South Sudan]], and [[Yemen]] to be the least peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/|title=Global Peace Index Map|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|first=|date=|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term findings of the 2017 GPI include a less peaceful world over the past decade, a 2.14 per cent deterioration in the global level of peace in the past decade, growing inequality in peace between the most and least peaceful countries, a long-term reduction in the GPI Militarization domain, and a widening impact of terrorism, with historically high numbers of people killed in terrorist incidents over the past 5 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Dr Ekaterina Stepanova, ''Head, Unit on Peace and Conflict Studies, Institute of the World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO), Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia''

== Methodology ==
In assessing peacefulness, the GPI investigates the extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be suggestive of peacefulness.

In 2017, 23 indicators were used to establish each country's peacefulness score. The indicators were originally selected with the assistance of an expert panel in 2007 and are reviewed by the expert panel on an annual basis. The scores for each indicator are normalized on a scale of 1-5, whereby qualitative indicators are banded into five groupings and quantitative ones are scored from 1-5, to the third decimal point. A table of the indicators is below.&lt;ref&gt;Information about indicators and methodology "2013 Global Peace Index"(PDF). Institute for Economics and Peace.

Indicators not already ranked on a 1 to 5 scale were converted by using the following formula: x=(x-Min(x))/(Max(x)-Min(x)) where Max(x) and Min(x) are the highest and lowest values for that indicator of the countries ranked in the index. The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5 scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the expert panel's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score. ‘Negative Peace’ which is defined as the absence of violence, or fear of violence is used as the definition of peace to create the Global Peace Index. An additional aim of the GPI database is to facilitate deeper study of the concept of positive peace, or those attitudes, institutions, and structures that drive peacefulness in society. The GPI also examines relationships between peace and reliable international measures, including democracy and transparency, education and material well-being. As such, it seeks to understand the relative importance of a range of potential determinants, or "drivers", which may influence the nurturing of peaceful societies, both internally and externally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index Report, Methodology, pg. 113-136|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=Visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main findings of the 2017 Global Peace Index are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The overall score for the 2017 GPI improved slightly this year due to gains in six of the nine geographical regions represented. More countries improved their levels of peacefulness, than deteriorated: 93 compared to 68.
* Peacebuilding activities can be highly cost-effective, providing cost savings 16 times the cost of the intervention.
* The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion PPP in 2016, equivalent to 12.6 per cent of global GDP, or $1,953 per person. 
*  In Low-Peace environments, the factors that matter the most are related to Well-Functioning Government, Low Levels of Corruption, Acceptance of the Rights of Others and Good Relations with Neighbours
* Due to armed conflict in MENA, many related indicators such as deaths from internal conflict, number of refugees and IDPs, and organised internal conflict are at high levels.
* Safety and Security improved due to many countries recording a lower homicide rate and lower levels of political terror.

Statistical analysis is applied to GPI data to uncover specific conditions conducive of peace. Researchers have determined that Positive Peace, which includes the attitudes, institutions, and structures that pre-empt conflict and facilitate functional societies, is the main driver of peace. The eight pillars of positive peace are well-functioning government, sound business environment, acceptance of the rights of others, good relations with neighbors, free flow of information, high levels of human capital, low levels of corruption, and equitable distribution of resources. Well-functioning government, low levels of corruption, acceptance of the rights of others and good relations with neighbours are more important in countries suffering from high levels of violence. Free flow of information and sound business environment become more important when a country is approaching the global average level of peacefulness, also described as the Mid-Peace level. Low levels of corruption is the only Pillar that is strongly significant across all three levels of peacefulness. This suggests it is an important transformational factor at all stages of nations’ development.

== International response to the GPI  ==
The Index has received endorsements as a political project from a number of major international figures, including the former Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Kofi Annan]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], the [[Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Muhammad Yunus]], and former United States President [[Jimmy Carter]]&lt;ref&gt;"Endorsers for GPI" (PDF). Vision of Humanity. Retrieved 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Killelea]] A.M., the Australian philanthropist who conceived the idea of the Index, argues that the Index "is a wake-up call for leaders around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6704767.stm|title=Norway rated most peaceful nation|date=2007-05-30|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Index has been widely recognized. Professor [[Jeffrey Sachs]], Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University said: "The GPI continues its pioneering work in drawing the world’s attention to the massive resources we are squandering in violence and conflict. The lives and money wasted in wars, incarcerations, weapons systems, weapons trade, and more, could be directed to ending poverty, promoting education, and protecting the environment. The GPI will not only draw attention to these crucial issues, but help us understand them and to invest productively in a more peaceful world.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstockworld.com/2010/06/08/global-peace-index-world-less-peaceful-in-2010-report-violence-impacting-global-economy-7-trillion-annually/|title=Global Peace Index: World Less Peaceful in 2010 Report, Violence Impacting Global Economy $7 Trillion Annually|work=Phil's Stock World|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marla Mossman of the Peace Alliance Leadership Council said she believes that the measurements of the Global Peace Index can be useful for crafting government policy, helping governments to identify problems and develop practical and relevant policies. Furthermore, she said that she saw the Index indicators as, “the measurements of the health of the nation. So we really can take the temperature of the world: are we healthy? Do we have a fever?”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/world/201706021054260583-terrorism-conflicts-global-economy/|title=Terrorism, Conflicts Cost Over $14 Trillion to Global Economy|last=Sputnik|website=sputniknews.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of the 2015 GPI, Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman of King's College in London called the Index, “an extraordinarily useful body of information,” and its analysis “the best indicator of future conflict is past conflict. The challenge is how we break that cycle.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/news/newsrecords/gpi.aspx|title=King's College London -  2015 Global Peace Index: an increasingly divided world|website=www.kcl.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'', in publishing the first edition of the index in 2007, admitted that, "the index will run into some flak." Specifically, according to ''The Economist'', the weighting of military expenditure "may seem to give heart to freeloaders: countries that enjoy peace precisely because others (often the USA) care for their defense." The true utility of the index may lie not in its specific rankings of countries now, but in how those rankings change over time, thus tracking when and how countries become more or less peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9266967|title=Give peace a rating|date=2007-05-31|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-27|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Economist suggested that “quantifying peace is a bit like trying to describe how happiness smells.” The publication admitted that the GPI has produced some “surprising results” and argued that “part of the appeal of the index is that readers can examine each of the variables in turn and think about how much weight to add to each.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/06/daily-chart-6|title=Give peace a score|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian National University says that the GPI report “presents the latest and most comprehensive global data on trends in peace, violence and war” and “provides the world’s best analysis of the statistical factors associated with long-term peace as well as economic analysis on the macroeconomic impacts of everyday violence and war on the global economy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/events/giving-peace-a-chance-2017-global-peace-index|title=Giving peace a chance? 2017 Global Peace Index|date=2017-06-09|work=ANU|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPI has been criticised for not including indicators specifically relating to violence against women and children. Back in 2007, [[Riane Eisler]], writing in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', argued that, "to put it mildly, this blind spot makes the index very inaccurate. She mentions a number of specific cases, including [[Egypt]], where she claims 90% of women are subject to [[Female genital mutilation|genital mutilation]], and [[China]], where, she says, "female infanticide is still a problem," according to a 2000 [[UNICEF]] study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0726/p09s01-coop.html|title=Dark underbelly of the world's most 'peaceful' countries|date=2007-07-26|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-11-27|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior Analyst at the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis, Sabhat Khan, argued that the Index should “involve more context on security environments.” Referring to the UAE's GPI ranking in particular, Khan argued that “the measurement usually used by such rankings is crude data without contextualising them;”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/uae-drops-in-rank-in-annual-peace-index-amid-increasing-regional-violence-1.43077|title=UAE drops in rank in annual peace index amid increasing regional violence|work=The National|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the UAE must bolster its security apparatus to respond to turbulence in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, which all rank at the very bottom of the GPI.

== World leaders talking about the GPI ==
During a Peace Forum in August 2017, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said that “receiving such high praise from an institute that once named this country the most violent in the world is extremely significant…My administration will keep fighting to protect all Honduran citizens.” The President has recently launched an initiative to build a series of safe parks across Honduras and hopes to see further improvement reflected in future GPI rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/honduras-peace-forum-marks-national-progress-in-crime-prevention-300510731.html|title=Honduras Peace Forum Marks National Progress in Crime Prevention|last=Honduras|first=Republic of|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysia ranked 29th in the 2017 GPI. The country's Communications and Multimedia Minister, Datuk Seri Salleh Said Keruak said that this ranking along with Malaysia's high place in the 2017 World Happiness Report was proof that the “government’s efforts have made Malaysia a safe and prosperous country.” He also admitted, “there’s still much room for improvement to make Malaysia the best among the better countries and that’s what we’re doing now.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/07/254778/2017-global-peace-index-and-world-happiness-report-shows-opposition|title=2017 Global Peace Index and World Happiness Report shows Opposition leaders were wrong|date=2017-07-05|work=NST Online|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of the 2016 GPI, the Botswanan Office of the President released a proud statement, “in this year’s Index, Botswana was ranked as 28 out of 163 countries, up 3 places from last year. This continues to place Botswana above over half of the European region countries surveyed as well as all five of the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council…in addition Botswana was one of only five countries, to achieve a perfect score in the domestic and international conflict domain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://botswana-brussels.com/2016-global-peace-index-released-botswana-moves-up-3-places-still-ranked-among-the-worlds-most-peaceful-nations/|title=2016 Global Peace Index released-Botswana moves up 3 places; still ranked among the world's most peaceful nations – Embassy of the Republic of Botswana|website=botswana-brussels.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Navid Hanif, Director of the United Nations Office for ECOSOC Support and Coordination said, “it’s intuitive that peace is useful and peacefullness is a reward in itself, but the IEP is trying to make the conclusion more evidence-based. Now that the index covers 99% of the population, it has come a long way. The report systemically measures peacefulness and identifies the determinants of peace.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/ecosoc/2012gpi.html|title=Global Peace Index: Nine trillion reasons to pursue peace  {{!}} UN DESA {{!}} United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to the 2017 results of the GPI, which ranked the Philippines 138 out of 163 countries, mainly because of poor scores in societal safety and security due to President Duterte's war on drugs, Philippine Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella countered, “We’re not entirely sure where the GPI, Global Peace Index analyst… who apparently is supposed to be a local, is really coming from. Maybe there’s a political slant somewhere…based on survey results, the net satisfaction of Filipino people is quite high.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/the-philippine-star/20170610/281552290835307|title=Palace Disputes Peace Index Report|last=Romero|first=A|date=|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sierra Leone ranked 39th in the 2017 Global Peace Index. Former Chief of Staff and Office of National Security (ONS) advisor, Dr. Jonathan PJ Sandy, “Welcomed the 2017 Global Peace Index report released recently which ranked Sierra Leone in first position, as the most peaceful country in West Africa and third in the African continent…He observed that going by the report itself, [future] elections might be successfully held.” Presidential Spokesman, Abdulai Bayraytay “said the favourable Global Peace rating of Sierra Leone would serve as an impetus for the country to do more.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://slconcordtimes.com/jpj-sandy-praises-global-peace-index-report/|title=JPJ Sandy Praises Global Peace Index Report|work=Sierra Leone Concord Times|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Peace Index rankings ==
Nations considered more peaceful have lower index scores. In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database to ensure that the scores were comparable over time. The GPI Expert Panel decided that the Index would include nations and territories, but not [[Ministate|micro-states]]. Countries covered by the GPI must either have a population of more than 1 million or a land area greater than 20,000 square kilometers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Green computing''', '''green ICT''' as per International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT", '''green IT''', or '''ICT sustainability''', is the study and practice of [[environmentally sustainable]] computing or IT.

The goals of green computing are similar to [[green chemistry]]: reduce the use of hazardous materials, maximize [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] during the product's lifetime,  the [[recycling|recyclability]] or [[Biodegradation|biodegradability]] of defunct products and factory waste. Green computing is important for all classes of systems, ranging from handheld systems&lt;ref&gt;S.

Many corporate IT departments have green computing initiatives to reduce the environmental effect of their IT operations.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B.

In 1992, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] launched [[Energy Star]], a voluntary labeling program that is designed to promote and recognize the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in monitors, climate control equipment, and other technologies. This resulted in the widespread adoption of [[sleep mode]] among consumer electronics. Concurrently, the Swedish organization TCO Development launched the [[TCO Certification]] program to promote low magnetic and electrical emissions from [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-based [[computer display]]s; this program was later expanded to include criteria on energy consumption, [[ergonomics]], and the use of hazardous materials in construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TCO takes the initiative in comparative product testing |accessdate=May 3, 2008 |date=May 3, 2008 |url=http://www.boivie.se/index.php?page=2&amp;lang=eng |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723060821/http://www.boivie.se/index.php?page=2&amp;lang=eng |archive-date=July 23, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations and industry initiatives==
The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) has published a survey of over 90 government and industry initiatives on "Green ICTs", i.e. information and communication technologies, the environment and climate change. The report concludes that initiatives tend to concentrate on the greening ICTs themselves rather than on their actual implementation to tackle global warming and environmental degradation. In general, only 20% of initiatives have measurable targets, with government programs tending to include targets more frequently than business associations.&lt;ref&gt;Full report: {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/47/12/42825130.pdf|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|title=Towards Green ICT strategies: Assessing Policies and Programmes on ICTs and the Environment|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317103746/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/47/12/42825130.pdf|archive-date=March 17, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}} Summary: {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/43044065.pdf|title=Executive summary of OECD report|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317102750/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/43044065.pdf|archive-date=March 17, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
Many [[governmental]] agencies have continued to implement standards and regulations that encourage green computing. The [[Energy Star]] program was revised in October 2006 to include stricter efficiency requirements for computer equipment, along with a tiered ranking system for approved products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EPA Announces New Computer Efficiency Requirements |date=October 23, 2006 |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a8f952395381d3968525701c005e65b5/113b0c0647fee41585257210006474f1!OpenDocument |last=Jones |first=Ernesta |publisher=U.S. EPA |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212022429/http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a8f952395381d3968525701c005e65b5/113b0c0647fee41585257210006474f1!OpenDocument |archive-date=February 12, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2097558,00.asp |title=How Important Will New Energy Star Be for PC Makers? |last=Gardiner |first=Bryan |date=February 22, 2007 |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826193654/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2097558,00.asp |archive-date=August 26, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008, 26 US states established statewide recycling programs for obsolete computers and consumer electronics equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-takeback.org/docs%20open/Toolkit_Legislators/state%20legislation/state_leg_main.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306222713/http://www.e-takeback.org/docs%20open/Toolkit_Legislators/state%20legislation/state_leg_main.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |title= State Legislation on E-Waste |date=March 20, 2008 |publisher=Electronics Take Back Coalition |accessdate=March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statutes either impose an "advance recovery fee" for each unit sold at retail or require the manufacturers to reclaim the equipment at disposal.

In 2010, the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) was signed into legislation by President Obama. The bill allocated over $90 billion to be invested in green initiatives (renewable energy, smart grids, energy efficiency, etc.) In January 2010, the U.S. Energy Department granted $47 million of the ARRA money towards projects that aim to improve the energy efficiency of data centers. The projects provided research to optimize data center hardware and software, improve power supply chain, and [[computer cooling|data center cooling technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.energy.gov/news2009/8491.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527141406/http://www.energy.gov/news2009/8491.htm |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |title=Secretary Chu Announces $47 Million to Improve Efficiency in Information Technology and Communications Sectors |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
* [[Climate Savers Computing Initiative]] (CSCI) is an effort to reduce the electric power consumption of PCs in active and inactive states.&lt;ref name="CSCI_pressrel_launch"&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/press.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214140754/http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/press.html |archivedate=February 14, 2008 |title=Intel and Google Join with Dell, EDS, EPA, HP, IBM, Lenovo, Microsoft, PG&amp;E, World Wildlife Fund and Others to Launch Climate Savers Computing Initiative |publisher=Business Wire |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSCI provides a catalog of green products from its member organizations, and information for reducing PC power consumption.

* The [[Green Electronics Council]] offers the [[Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool]] (EPEAT) to assist in the purchase of "greener" computing systems. The Council evaluates computing equipment on 51 criteria - 23 required and 28 optional - that measure a product's efficiency and sustainability attributes. Products are rated Gold, Silver, or Bronze, depending on how many optional criteria they meet. On 2007-01-24, President [[George W. Bush]] issued Executive Order 13423, which requires all United States Federal agencies to use EPEAT when purchasing computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20(1-24-07).pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qCuJd6am?url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20%281-24-07%29.pdf |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |title=President Bush Requires Federal Agencies to Buy EPEAT Registered Green Electronic Products |publisher=Green Electronics Council |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-2.html |title=Executive Order: Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management |publisher=The White House: Office of the Press Secretary |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831005045/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-2.html |archive-date=August 31, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Green Grid]] is a global consortium dedicated to advancing energy efficiency in data centers and business computing ecosystems. It was founded in February 2007 by several key companies in the industry&amp;nbsp;– [[AMD]], [[American Power Conversion|APC]], [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Rackable Systems]], [[SprayCool]] (purchased in 2010 by [http://www.parker.com/portal/site/Market-Tech/menuitem.e9f921bc8ae21676de92b210237ad1ca/?vgnextoid=e7bfa7bee4a70310VgnVCM10000048021dacRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default Parker]), [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[VMware]]. The Green Grid has since grown to hundreds of members, including end-users and government organizations, all focused on improving [[data center infrastructure efficiency]] (DCIE).
* The [[Green500]] list rates supercomputers by energy efficiency ([[megaflops]]/[[watt]]), encouraging a focus on efficiency rather than absolute performance.
* [[Green Comm Challenge]] is an organization that promotes the development of energy conservation technology and practices in the field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT).
* The [[Transaction Processing Performance Council]] (TPC) Energy specification augments existing TPC benchmarks by allowing optional publications of energy metrics alongside performance results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Energy benchmarks: a detailed analysis (e-Energy 2006) |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1791314.1791336|publisher=ACM. {{ISBN|978-1-4503-0042-1}}.

==Approaches==
Modern [[Information technology|IT]] systems rely upon a complicated mix of people, networks, and hardware; as such, a green computing initiative must cover all of these areas as well. A solution may also need to address end user satisfaction, management restructuring, regulatory compliance, and return on investment (ROI). There are also considerable fiscal motivations for companies to take control of their own power consumption; "of the power management tools available, one of the most powerful may still be simple, plain, common sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Green-and-lean-it-data-centre-efficiency.cfm |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100706131340/http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Green-and-lean-it-data-centre-efficiency.cfm |archivedate =July 6, 2010 |title=The common sense of lean and green IT |work=Deloitte Technology Predictions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product longevity===
[[Gartner]] maintains that the PC manufacturing process accounts for 70% of the natural resources used in the life cycle of a PC.&lt;ref&gt;InfoWorld July 6, 2009;
{{cite web |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/used-pc-strategy-passes-toxic-buck-300?_kip_ipx=1053322433-1267784052&amp;_pxn=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121223HCFSDBIFBWETHVYUSDVFSDJB CFSDBVGZDGFCHGSDVYUFSDYVGASJDVG315/http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/used-pc-strategy-passes-toxic-buck-300?_kip_ipx=1053322433-1267784052&amp;_pxn=0 |archivedate=January 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fujitsu released a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a desktop that show that manufacturing and end of life accounts for the majority of this desktop's ecological footprint.&lt;ref&gt;GreenIT.fr Feb. 2011; http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/pc-de-bureau/quelle-est-l-empreinte-carbone-d-un-ordinateur-3478 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424020904/http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/pc-de-bureau/quelle-est-l-empreinte-carbone-d-un-ordinateur-3478 |date=April 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the biggest contribution to green computing usually is to prolong the equipment's lifetime. Another report from Gartner recommends to "Look for product longevity, including upgradability and modularity."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Mingay, Gartner: 10 Key Elements of a 'Green IT' Strategy;
{{cite web |url=http://www.onsitelasermedic.com/pdf/10_key_elements_greenIT.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730120749/http://www.onsitelasermedic.com/pdf/10_key_elements_greenIT.pdf |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, manufacturing a new PC makes a far bigger [[ecological footprint]] than manufacturing a new [[RAM]] module to upgrade an existing one.

===Data center design===
Data center facilities are heavy consumers of energy, accounting for between 1.1% and 1.5% of the world’s total energy use in 2010 [1]. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that data center facilities consume up to 100 to 200 times more energy than standard office buildings.&lt;ref name="https://energy.gov"&gt;“Best Practices Guide for Energy-Efficient Data Center Design”, prepared by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy, Federal Energy Management Program, March 2011.[https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/10/f3/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220151305/https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/10/f3/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf |date=December 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficient data center design should address all of the energy use aspects included in a data center: from the IT equipment to the HVAC(Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) equipment to the actual location, configuration and construction of the building.

The U.S. Department of Energy specifies five primary areas on which to focus energy efficient data center design best practices:&lt;ref&gt;Koomey, Jonathon. “Growth in data center electricity use 2005 to 2010,” Oakland, CA: Analytics Press. August 1. {{cite web |url=http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111082558/http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Information technology (IT) systems
* Environmental conditions
* Air management
* Cooling systems
* Electrical systems

Additional energy efficient design opportunities specified by the U.S. Department of Energy include on-site electrical generation and recycling of waste heat.&lt;ref&gt;Junaid Shuja, Abdullah Gani, Shahaboddin Shamshirband, Raja Wasim Ahmad, Kashif Bilal, Sustainable Cloud Data Centers: A survey of enabling techniques and technologies, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Volume 62, September 2016, Pages 195-214, ISSN 1364-0321, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.034&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficient data center design should help to better utilize a data center’s space, and increase performance and efficiency.

In 2018, three new US Patents make use of facilities design to simultaneously cool and produce electrical power by use of internal and external waste heat. The three patents use silo design for stimulating use internal waste heat, while the recirculation of the air cooling the silo's computing racks. US Patent  [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=4&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 9,510,486], uses the recirculating air for power generation, while sister patent, US Patent [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=2&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 9,907,213], forces the recirculation of the same air, and sister patent, US Patent [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 10,020,436], uses thermal differences in temperature resulting in negative power usage effectiveness.  Negative power usage effectiveness, makes use of extreme differences between temperatures at times running the computing facilities, that they would run only from external sources other than the power use for computing. 

===Software and deployment optimization===

====Algorithmic efficiency====
{{Main article|Algorithmic efficiency}}
{{Further|Analysis of algorithms}}
The efficiency of algorithms affects the amount of computer resources required for any given computing function and there are many efficiency trade-offs in writing programs.  Algorithm changes, such as switching from a slow (e.g. linear) search algorithm to a fast (e.g. hashed or indexed) search algorithm can reduce resource usage for a given task from substantial to close to zero. &lt;!-- algorithmic efficiency personal example: I re-coded a SQL report query (that was run several times a day) that took 30 minutes to run in 15 seconds.  Impressive?  Sure!  Unusual?  Hardly.  I'm sure there are citeable examples.--&gt; In 2009, a study by a physicist at [[Harvard]] estimated that the average Google search released 7&amp;nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide (CO₂).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479127,00.html | title=Research reveals environmental impact of Google searches. | accessdate=January 15, 2009 | work=Fox News | date=January 12, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112195017/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479127,00.html | archive-date=January 12, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Google disputed this figure, arguing instead that a typical search produced only 0.2&amp;nbsp;grams of CO₂.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html | title=Powering a Google search | accessdate=October 1, 2009 | work=Official Google Blog | publisher=Google | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729054622/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html | archive-date=July 29, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resource allocation====
{{Main article|Resource allocation}}
Algorithms can also be used to route data to data centers where electricity is less expensive. Researchers from MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and Akamai have tested an energy allocation algorithm that successfully routes traffic to the location with the cheapest energy costs. The researchers project up to a 40 percent savings on energy costs if their proposed algorithm were to be deployed. However, this approach does not actually reduce the amount of energy being used; it reduces only the cost to the company using it. Nonetheless, a similar strategy could be used to direct traffic to rely on energy that is produced in a more environmentally friendly or efficient way. A similar approach has also been used to cut energy usage by routing traffic away from data centers experiencing warm weather; this allows computers to be shut down to avoid using air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Rear don |first= Marguerite |title= Energy-aware Internet routing coming soon |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10312408-54.html |date= August 18, 2009 |accessdate= August 19, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110617075237/http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10312408-54.html |archive-date= June 17, 2011 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger server centers are sometimes located where energy and land are inexpensive and readily available. Local availability of renewable energy, climate that allows outside air to be used for cooling, or locating them where the heat they produce may be used for other purposes could be factors in green siting decisions.

Approaches to actually reduce the energy consumption of network devices by proper network/device management techniques are surveyed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author1=Aruna Prem Bianzino |author2=Claude Chaudet |author3=Dario Rossi |author4=Jean-Louis Rougier|title=A Survey of Green Networking Research |arxiv= 1010.3880 |class=cs.NI|date= October 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors grouped the approaches into 4 main strategies, namely (i) Adaptive Link Rate (ALR), (ii) Interface Proxying, (iii) Energy Aware Infrastructure, and (iv) Max Energy Aware Applications.

====Virtualizing====
{{Main article|Platform virtualization}}
{{See also|Comparison of platform virtualization software}}
Computer virtualization refers to the abstraction of computer resources, such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one set of physical hardware. The concept originated with the IBM [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] operating systems of the 1960s, but was commercialized for [[x86 architecture|x86]]-compatible computers only in the 1990s. With virtualization, a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single, powerful system, thereby unplugging the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption. Virtualization can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power sleep state. Several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing. [[Intel Corporation]] and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] have also built proprietary [[x86 virtualization#Hardware support|virtualization enhancements]] to the x86 [[instruction set]] into each of their CPU product lines, in order to facilitate virtual computing.

New virtual technologies, such as [[Linux Containers]] can also be used to reduce energy consumption. These technologies make a ore efficient use of resources, thus reducing energy consumption by design. Also, the consolidation of virtualized technologies is more efficient than the one done in [[Virtual machine|virtual machines]], so more services can be deployed in the same physical machine, reducing the amount of hardware needed. &lt;ref&gt;Ismael Cuadrado-Cordero, Anne-Cécile Orgerie, Jean-Marc Menaud., [https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01578325v2 “Comparative Experimental Analysis of the Quality-of-Service and Energy-Efficiency of VMs and Containers' Consolidation for Cloud Applications,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233816/https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01578325v2 |date=June 28, 2018 }} International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM 2017), Sep 2017, Split, Croatia. pp.1-6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminal servers====
{{Main article|Terminal server}}
Terminal servers have also been used in green computing. When using the system, users at a terminal connect to a central server; all of the actual computing is done on the server, but the end user experiences the operating system on the terminal. These can be combined with [[thin client]]s, which use up to 1/8 the amount of energy of a normal workstation, resulting in a decrease of energy costs and consumption.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} There has been an increase in using terminal services with thin clients to create virtual labs. Examples of terminal server software include [[Terminal Services]] for Windows and the [[Linux Terminal Server Project]] (LTSP) for the [[Linux operating system]]. Software-based remote desktop clients such as [[Windows Remote Desktop]] and [[RealVNC]] can provide similar thin-client functions when run on low power, commodity hardware that connects to a server.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hci.stanford.edu/cstr/reports/2011-02.pdf|title=Software or Hardware: The Future of Green Enterprise Computing|last=Kazandjieva|first=Maria|date=|work=|access-date=|last2=Heller|first2=Brandon|last3=Gnawali|first3=Omprakash|last4=Hofer|first4=Wanja|last5=Levis|first5=Philip|last6=Kozyrakis|first6=Christos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619190042/http://hci.stanford.edu/cstr/reports/2011-02.pdf|archive-date=June 19, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power management===
{{Main article|Power management}}
The [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface]] (ACPI), an open industry standard, allows an operating system to directly control the power-saving aspects of its underlying hardware. This allows a system to automatically turn off components such as [[computer display|monitors]] and [[hard drive]]s after set periods of inactivity. In addition, a system may [[Hibernation (computing)|hibernate]], when most components (including the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and the system RAM) are turned off. ACPI is a successor to an earlier Intel-Microsoft standard called [[Advanced Power Management]], which allows a computer's [[BIOS]] to control power management functions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Some programs allow the user to manually adjust the voltages supplied to the CPU, which reduces both the amount of heat produced and electricity consumed. This process is called [[undervolting]]. Some CPUs can automatically undervolt the processor, depending on the workload; this technology is called "[[SpeedStep]]" on Intel processors, "[[PowerNow!]]"/"[[Cool'n'Quiet]]" on AMD chips, [[LongHaul]] on [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] CPUs, and [[LongRun]] with [[Transmeta]] processors.

====Data center power====
Data centers, which have been criticized for their extraordinarily high energy demand, are a primary focus for proponents of green computing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceGCS9"&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/6982393/Power_Management_Techniques_for_Data_Centers_A_Survey Power Management Techniques for Data Centers: A Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114005435/http://www.academia.edu/6982393/Power_Management_Techniques_for_Data_Centers_A_Survey |date=November 14, 2017 }}", 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kurp, Patrick."Green Computing," ''Communications of the ACM''51(10):11.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a [[Greenpeace]] study, data centers represent 21% of the electricity consumed by the IT sector, which is about 382 billion kWh a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/35f0ac1a-clickclean2016-hires.pdf|title=CLICKING CLEAN: WHO IS WINNING  THE RACE TO BUILD  A GREEN INTERNET|last=Greenpeace|first=|date=2017|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706161712/https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/35f0ac1a-clickclean2016-hires.pdf|archive-date=July 6, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data centers can potentially improve their energy and space efficiency through techniques such as storage consolidation and virtualization. Many organizations are aiming to eliminate underutilized servers, which results in lower energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/green-it-over.aspx|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110211120149/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/green-it-over.aspx|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 11 February 2011|title= Is Green IT Over?|publisher=Dell.com | accessdate=21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step toward this aim will be training of data center administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sdiwc.net/digital-library/towards-green-computing-application-for-measuring-the-sustainability-of-data-centers-an-analytical-survey.html|title= Towards Green Computing Application for Measuring the Sustainability of Data Centers: An Analytical Survey, Zohreh Gandomi, Salmiah Amin|publisher= SDIWC Digital Library|access-date= November 1, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402210100/http://sdiwc.net/digital-library/towards-green-computing-application-for-measuring-the-sustainability-of-data-centers-an-analytical-survey.html|archive-date= April 2, 2015|dead-url= no|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. federal government has set a minimum 10% reduction target for data center energy usage by 2011.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; With the aid of a self-styled ultraefficient evaporative cooling technology, Google Inc. has been able to reduce its energy consumption to 50% of that of the industry average.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Operating system support====
&lt;!-- Needs Mac and Linux coverage. Also, this may be too detailed for a summary--&gt;
Microsoft Windows, has included limited [[PC power management]] features since Windows 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810046.aspx |title=Windows 95 Power Management |access-date=April 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311193319/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810046.aspx |archive-date=March 11, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These initially provided for stand-by (suspend-to-RAM) and a monitor low power state. Further iterations of Windows added hibernate (suspend-to-disk) and support for the [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] standard. Windows 2000 was the first NT-based operating system to include power management. This required major changes to the underlying operating system architecture and a new hardware driver model. Windows 2000 also introduced [[Group Policy]], a technology that allowed administrators to centrally configure most Windows features. However, power management was not one of those features. This is probably because the power management settings design relied upon a connected set of per-user and per-machine binary registry values,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/csd/greenit/powerdown |title=Windows power-saving options are, bizarrely, stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127034201/http://www.liv.ac.uk/csd/greenit/powerdown/ |archivedate=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively leaving it up to each user to configure their own power management settings.

This approach, which is not compatible with Windows Group Policy, was repeated in Windows XP. The reasons for this design decision by Microsoft are not known, and it has resulted in heavy criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php |title=How Windows XP Wasted $25 Billion of Energy |date=November 21, 2006 |accessdate=November 21, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127051214/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php |archive-date=November 27, 2006 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this section, while quite possibly true, sounded like OR so I cut it out. In fact, the treehugger source is basically a blog... can we do better?

The support offered is limited to a single per-computer policy. The most recent release, Windows 7 retains these limitations but does include refinements for [[timer coalescing]], [[processor power management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/ProcPowerMgmtWin7.mspx |title=Windows 7 Processor Power Management |access-date=April 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510015949/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/procpowermgmtwin7.mspx |archive-date=May 10, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/TimerCoal.mspx |title=Windows 7 Timer Coalescing |access-date=April 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416215821/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/TimerCoal.mspx |archive-date=April 16, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and display panel brightness. The most significant change in Windows 7 is in the user experience. The prominence of the default High Performance power plan has been reduced with the aim of encouraging users to save power.

There is a significant market in third-party [[PC power management]] software offering features beyond those present in the Windows operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/buyers-guide/Power-Management-Software-for-Windows-Workstations-Buyers-Guide|title=Power Management Software for Windows Workstations|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426175620/http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/buyers-guide/Power-Management-Software-for-Windows-Workstations-Buyers-Guide|archivedate=April 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_comm_packages|title=Energy Star Commercial Packages List|access-date=October 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102002142/https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_comm_packages|archive-date=November 2, 2008|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|author1=The Headmasters'|author2=Headmistresses' Conference|title=HMC: A Practical Guide to Sustainable Building for Schools|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315230900/http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|archivedate=March 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; available.

As hard drive prices have fallen, storage farms have tended to increase in capacity to make more data available online. This includes archival and backup data that would formerly have been saved on tape or other offline storage. The increase in online storage has increased power consumption. Reducing the power consumed by large storage arrays, while still providing the benefits of online storage, is a subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/1255635/IBM-chief-engineer-talks-green-storage IBM chief engineer talks green storage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502041656/http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/1255635/IBM-chief-engineer-talks-green-storage |date=May 2, 2013 }}, SearchStorage - TechTarget&lt;/ref&gt;

A drawback to many of these schemes is that computers gathered through recycling drives are often shipped to [[developing countries]] where environmental standards are less strict than in North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Green Tech: Reduce, Reuse, That's It |last=Segan |first=Sascha |journal=PC Magazine |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2183977,00.asp |volume=26 |issue=19 |page=56 |date=October 2, 2007 |accessdate=November 7, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025050427/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2183977,00.asp |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition]] estimates that 80% of the post-consumer e-waste collected for recycling is shipped abroad to countries such as [[China]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash |last=Royte |first=Elizabeth |pages=169–170 |year=2006 |publisher=Back Bay Books |isbn=0-316-73826-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the collection rate of e-waste is still very low, even in the most ecology-responsible countries like France. In this country, e-waste collection is still at a 14% annual rate between electronic equipment sold and e-waste collected for 2006 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/recyclage/deee-l-europe-revoit-ses-objectifs-a-la-hausse-3482 |title=e-waste take-back still very low |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2011 |publisher=GreenIT.fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213031911/http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/recyclage/deee-l-europe-revoit-ses-objectifs-a-la-hausse-3482 |archive-date=February 13, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recycling of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, and credit card numbers, which can be recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive. Before recycling a computer, users should remove the hard drive, or hard drives if there is more than one, and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/articles/features/green-computing-and-privacy-issues.html |title=Green Computing and Privacy Issues |publisher=MySecureCyberspace |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028214220/http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/articles/features/green-computing-and-privacy-issues.html |archive-date=October 28, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud computing===
{{Main article| Cloud computing }}
Cloud computing addresses two major ICT challenges related to Green computing – energy usage and [[resource consumption]]. [[Virtualization]], [[Dynamic provisioning environment]], multi-tenancy, green data center approaches are enabling cloud computing to lower carbon emissions and energy usage up to a great extent. Large enterprises and small businesses can reduce their direct energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30% and 90% respectively by moving certain on-premises applications into the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-backed-research-suggests-big-energy-reductions-from-cloud/ |title= Microsoft-backed research suggests big energy reductions from cloud |publisher= ZDNet |date= November 4, 2010 |accessdate= September 3, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151208073045/http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-backed-research-suggests-big-energy-reductions-from-cloud/ |archive-date= December 8, 2015 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One common example includes [[Online shopping]] that helps people purchase products and services over the Internet without requiring them to drive and waste fuel to reach out to the physical shop, which, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emission related to travel.&lt;ref name="Google Scholar Citations"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=tWRIBtoAAAAJ&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=tWRIBtoAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC|title=Google Scholar Citations|website=scholar.google.com.pk|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edge Computing===
{{Main article| Edge computing }}
New technologies such as [[Edge computing| Edge]] and [[Fog computing]] are a solution to reducing energy consumption. These technologies allow redistributing computation near the use, thus reducing energy costs in the network.&lt;ref&gt;Cuadrado-Cordero, Ismael, [http://www.theses.fr/2017REN1S003 “Microclouds: an approach for a network-aware energy-efficient decentralised cloud,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233846/http://www.theses.fr/2017REN1S003 |date=June 28, 2018 }} PhD thesis, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, having smaller data centers, the energy used in operations such as refrigerating and maintenance gets largely reduced. 

===Telecommuting===
{{Main article|Telecommuting}}
[[Teleconference|Teleconferencing]] and [[telepresence]] technologies are often implemented in green computing initiatives. The advantages are many; increased worker satisfaction, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions related to travel, and increased profit margins as a result of lower overhead costs for office space, heat, lighting, etc.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B. Donnellan, [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/MISQE_SustainableIT_Intel_2012.pdf “Developing an Sustainable IT Capability: Lessons From Intel’s Journey,”] MIS Quarterly Executive, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 61–74, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The savings are significant; the average annual energy consumption for U.S. office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot, with heat, air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70% of all energy consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/documents/sector-meeting/4bi_officebuilding.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306130237/http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/documents/sector-meeting/4bi_officebuilding.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |format=PDF|title=EPA Office Building Energy Use Profile |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=March 17, 2008 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other related initiatives, such as [[Hoteling]], reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only when they need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/06/what_is_green_it_data_centers.php|title=What Is Green IT?|access-date=March 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415091508/http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/06/what_is_green_it_data_centers.php|archive-date=April 15, 2008|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of jobs, such as sales, consulting, and field service, integrate well with this technique.

[[Voice over Internet Protocol|Voice over IP (VoIP)]] reduces the telephony wiring infrastructure by sharing the existing Ethernet copper. VoIP and phone extension mobility also made [[hot desking]] more practical.

===Telecommunication network devices energy indices===
The information and communication technologies (ICTs) energy consumption, in the USA and worldwide, has been estimated respectively at 9.4% and 5.3% of the total electricity produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/app/docs/itu-icts-for-e-environment.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507123122/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/app/docs/itu-icts-for-e-environment.pdf |archive-date=May 7, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy consumption of ICTs is today significant even when compared with other industries. Some study tried to identify the key energy indices that allow a relevant comparison between different devices (network elements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Virgilio |last1=Puglia |title=Energy indices for environmental sustainability |journal=International Journal of Technology Marketing |date=January 2013 |volume=8 |issue=1/2013 |url=http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/n2w5530544110065/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530121855/http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/n2w5530544110065/ |archivedate=May 30, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis was focused on how to optimise device and network consumption for carrier telecommunication by itself. The target was to  allow an immediate perception of the relationship between the network technology and the environmental effect. These studies are at the start and the gap to fill in this sector is still huge and further research will be necessary.

===Supercomputers===

The inaugural [[Green500]] list was announced on November 15, 2007 at SC|07. As a complement to the TOP500, the unveiling of the Green500 ushered in a new era where supercomputers can be compared by performance-per-watt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.green500.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826075608/http://www.green500.org/ |archive-date=August 26, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tsubame (supercomputer)|TSUBAME-KFC-GSIC Center]] by Tokyo Institute of Technology, Made in Japan was with a great advantage to the second, the Top 1 Supercomputer in the World with 4,503.17 MFLOPS/W and 27.78 Total Power (kW)++

Today a new supercomputer, [[L-CSC]] from the [[GSI Helmholtz Center]], Made in Germany emerged as the most energy-efficient (or greenest) supercomputer in the world. The L-CSC cluster was the first and only supercomputer on the list to surpass 5 gigaflops/watt (billions of operations per second per watt). L-CSC is a heterogeneous supercomputer that is powered by Dual Intel Xeon E5-260 and GPU accelerators, namely AMD FirePro™ S9150 GPUs. It marks the first time that a supercomputer using AMD GPUs has held the top spot. Each server has a memory of 256 gigabytes. Connected, the server via an Infiniband FDR network.

The General Assembly of the United Nations approved by consensus two resolutions presented by [[Bolivia]]. The first, entitled “Harmony with Nature,” asks to convene an interactive dialogue on [[International Mother Earth Day]] on April 22, 2011. Topics will include methods for promoting a holistic approach to harmony with nature, and an exchange of national experiences regarding criteria and indicators to measure sustainable development in harmony with nature.

This resolution recognizes that “human beings are an inseparable part of nature, and that they cannot damage it without severely damaging themselves.” It also seeks to contribute to the preparatory process for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?cat=136 |title=Rights of Mother Earth « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/president/65/initiatives/HarmonywithNature.html |title=Initiatives of the President of the 65th Session - General Assembly of the United Nations |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherearthrights.org/2009/12/22/the-united-nations-approved-the-resolution-%E2%80%9Charmony-with-nature%E2%80%9D-proposed-by-bolivia/ |title=The United Nations approved the resolution "Harmony with Nature" proposed by Bolivia « Mother Earth |publisher=Motherearthrights.org |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=1975 |title=UN Approves Two More Resolutions by Bolivia / ONU aprueba dos resoluciones más propuestas por Bolivia « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2010-12-23 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=2016 |title=UN General Assembly Debates Harmony With Nature « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/speech-by-bolivia-at-un-dialogue-on-harmony-with-nature/ |title=Speech by Bolivia at UN Dialogue on Harmony with Nature « World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the proposal==

The proposal in its entirety, verbatim, follows.

'''Preliminary Proposal of the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)'''

The achievement of [[sustainable development]] in the 21st Century requires a Social and Ecological Contract among human beings and our Mother Earth that brings together and builds upon the progress made in the [[World Charter for Nature]] (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm |title=A/RES/37/7. World Charter for Nature |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rio Declaration]] (1992),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_sids/sids_pdfs/BPOA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Earth Charter]] (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ECI Sec 3 |url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html |title=Read the Charter |publisher=Earthcharterinaction.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/ |title=World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would include the following premises:

'''I. WE ARE BREAKING THE BALANCE OF THE EARTH SYSTEM'''

1. Twenty years after the “Rio Declaration,” it is necessary to update its First Principle such that it would state: “Human beings and nature are at the center of concerns for sustainable development.” It is essential to get beyond this [[anthropocentric]] vision. Not only do human beings “have the right to a healthy life,” but so too does nature, which is the basis of survival for all species including humans.

2. Nature is not just a set of resources that can be exploited, modified, altered, privatized, commercialized and transformed without any consequences. Earth is the only home we have. The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth.

3. The Earth is a living system. It is an indivisible, interdependent and interrelated community {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} human beings, nature, the atmosphere, the [[hydrosphere]], and the [[geosphere]]. Any substantive alteration of one of its components can affect other areas and the entire system. The Earth is the source of life. It is a system that coordinates physical, chemical, biological and ecological elements in a manner that makes life possible. Through the term ''[[wikt:Mother Earth|Mother Earth]]'', we express this relationship of belonging to a system and respect for our home.

4. Human activity is altering the dynamics and functioning of the Earth system to a degree never before seen. We have exceeded the limits of our system. We have broken harmony with nature. We are living through a series of rising crises that could cause the collapse of the system. It is essential to restore, affirm and guarantee the existence, integrity, interrelation, interaction and regeneration of the Earth system as a whole and of all of its components.

'''II. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY'''

5. In this century, the two central challenges of sustainable development are to overcome poverty and inequality, and to reestablish balance within the Earth system. Both objectives are intrinsically linked, and one cannot be achieved without the other.

6. It is essential to recognize and affirm that growth has limits. The pursuit of unending development on a finite planet is unsustainable and impossible. It is unsustainable and impossible. The limit to development is defined by the regenerative capacity of the Earth’s vital cycles. When growth begins to break that balance, as we see with global warming, we can no longer speak of it as development, but rather, the deterioration and destruction of our home. A certain level of growth and industrialization is needed to satisfy basic needs and guarantee the human rights of a population, but this level of “necessary development” is not about permanent growth, but rather, balance among humans and with nature.

7. Sustainable development seeks to [[eradicate poverty]] in order to live well, not generate wealthy people who live at the expense of the poor. The goal is the satisfaction of basic human needs in order to allow for the development of human capabilities and human happiness, strengthening community among human beings and with Mother Earth. In a world in which 1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth of the planet, it will not be possible to eradicate poverty or restore harmony with nature.

8. To end poverty and achieve an equitable distribution of well being, the basic resources and firms should be in the hands of the public sector and society. Only a society that controls its principal sources of income can aspire to a just distribution of the benefits needed to eliminate poverty.

9. The so-called “developed” countries must reduce their levels of over-consumption to reestablish harmony among human beings and with nature, allowing for the sustainable development of all developing countries. The ecological footprint of the developed countries is between 3 and 5 times larger than the average ecological footprint that the Earth system can sustain without an impact on its vital cycles.

10. The developing countries should follow new paradigms different from those used by developed countries in order to attend to the basic needs of their populations and reestablish harmony with nature. It is not sustainable or viable for all countries to follow the example of developed countries without causing our system to collapse.

11. Sustainable development cannot happen only at the national level. The well being of a country is only sustainable if it contributes to the well being of the entire system. The pillar of sustainable development can only be achieved from a global perspective. The so-called developed countries are still far from reaching sustainable development.

'''III. TOOLS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT'''

12. In an interdependent and interconnected system like that of Earth, we cannot recognize the rights of the human part of the system without affecting the rest of the system. To reestablish balance with nature, we must acknowledge its intrinsic value and clearly establish the obligations of humans toward nature, and also recognize that nature has rights that should be respected, promoted, and defended. Just as human beings have rights, the Mother Earth also has the right to exist, the right to maintain its vital cycles, the right to regeneration, the right to be free from structural alteration, and the right to relate to the other parts of the Earth system. Without respecting and guaranteeing the rights of nature, it is not possible to guarantee human rights and achieve sustainable development.

13. We have to end the system of consumption, waste and luxury. Millions of people are dying of hunger in the poorest parts of the globe, while in the richest areas, millions of dollars are spent to combat obesity. We must change the unsustainable patterns of consumption, production, and waste through public policy, regulations, and the conscious and active participation of society. This includes promoting ethics that value human beings for what they are, not what they have.

14. To guarantee the human right to water, education, health, communication, transportation, energy and sanitation, above all in the very poor and marginalized sectors, the provision of these services must be essentially public and based on efficient social management, not private business.

15. States should ensure the right of their populations to proper nutrition by strengthening food sovereignty policies that promote: a) food production by farmers, indigenous peoples and small agricultural producers; b) access to land, water, seeds, credit and other resources for family and community producers; c) the development of social and public enterprises for food production, distribution, and sale that prevent hoarding and contribute to the stability of food prices in domestic markets, thus halting speculative practices and the destruction of local production; d) the right of citizens to define what goods they wish to consume, the origins of those goods and how they are produced; e) consumption of what is necessary and the prioritization of local production; f) practices that contribute to reestablishing harmony with nature, avoiding greater desertification, deforestation, and destruction of biological diversity; g) the promotion of the use of indigenous seeds and traditional knowledge. Food production and commercialization must be socially regulated and cannot be left to free market forces.

16. Without water, there is no life. Humans and all living things have the [[right to water]], but water also has rights. All States and peoples worldwide should work together in solidarity to ensure that loss of vegetation, deforestation, the pollution of the atmosphere and contamination are prevented from continuing to alter the hydrological cycle. These cause [[desertification]], lack of food, temperature increase, [[sea level rise]], migrations, [[acid rain]], and physical-chemical changes that can cause ecosystems to die.

17. Forests are essential to the balance and integrity of planet Earth and a key element in the proper functioning of its ecosystems and the broader system of which we are a part. Thus we cannot consider them as simple providers of goods and services for human beings. The protection, preservation and recuperation of forests is required to reestablish the balance of the Earth system. Forests are not plantations that can be reduced to their capacity to capture carbon and provide environmental services. The maintenance of native forests and woodlands is essential for the water cycle, the atmosphere, biodiversity, the prevention of flooding, and the preservation of ecosystems. Forests are also home to indigenous peoples and communities. The preservation of forests should be pursued through integral and participatory management plans financed with public funding from developed countries.

18. It is essential to guarantee a real and effective reduction of [[greenhouse gases]], particularly on the part of the developed countries historically responsible for climate change, in order to stabilize the increase in temperature to 1&amp;nbsp;°C during this century. We must therefore strengthen the [[Kyoto Protocol]], not replace it with a more flexible voluntary agreement in which each country does what it chooses. It is necessary to eliminate carbon market mechanisms and offsets so that real domestic reductions are made within the countries with said obligations.

19. All forms of violence against women are incompatible with sustainable development, including violence done to women in militarily occupied territories and domestic or sexual violence that treats women as objects.

20. In order for sustainable development to exist, is essential to guarantee the full application of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].

21. Under the framework of common but differentiated responsibilities established in the 1992 Rio Declaration, the so-called developed countries must assume and pay their historical [[ecological debt]] for having contributed the most to the deterioration of the Earth system. The payment of this ecological debt to developing countries and the sectors most affected among their own populations consists of the transfer financial resources from public sources and also the effective transfer of appropriate technologies required by developing countries.

22. The resources developed countries dedicate to their defense, security and war budgets should be used to address the effects of climate change and the imbalance with nature. It is inexcusable that 1.5 trillion dollars in public funding are used on these budgets, while, to address the impacts of climate change in developing countries, they want to dedicate just 100 billion dollars from public and private funds as well as market sources by 2020.

23. To address the challenge of achieving sustainable development in the so-called developing countries, a [[financial transaction tax]] should be created to help build a Sustainable Development Fund that would be managed by developing countries.

24. Sustainable development requires a new international financial architecture to replace the [[World Bank]] and the [[IMF]] with entities that are democratic and transparent, that refrain from imposing conditions or structural adjustments, are controlled by the developing countries, and are based on the principles of solidarity and complementarity rather than commercialization and privatization.

25. It is essential to promote the exchange of scientific and technical knowledge and to remove intellectual property barriers to allow a true transfer of environmentally friendly technologies from developed countries to developing countries. An effective Technology Transfer Mechanism should be created based on the need for socially, culturally, and ecologically appropriate technologies in the countries of the South. This mechanism should not be a showcase for the sale of technologies by rich countries.

26. [[Intellectual property rights]] over genes, microorganisms and other forms of life are a threat to [[food sovereignty]], [[biodiversity]], access to medicine and other basic elements of the survival of low-income populations. All forms of [[intellectual property over life]] should be abolished.

27. [[Gross Domestic Product]] is not an adequate means of measuring the development and well being of a society. Thus it is necessary to create indicators for measuring the environmental destruction caused by certain economic activities in order to advance toward sustainable development in harmony with nature, integrating social and environmental aspects that are not aimed at the commercialization of nature and its functions.

28. Respect for the [[sovereignty of States]] is essential in the management and protection of nature under the framework of cooperation among States.

29. There is no single solution for all peoples. Human beings are diverse. Our peoples have their own unique cultures and identities. To destroy a culture is to threaten the identity of an entire people. Capitalism attempts to homogenize us all to convert us into consumers. There has not been, nor will there ever be, a single model for life that can save the world. We live and act in a pluralistic world, and a pluralistic world should respect diversity, which is itself synonymous with life. Respect for peaceful and harmonious complementarity among the diverse cultures and economies, without exploitation or discrimination against any single one, is essential for saving the planet, humanity, and life.

30. Peace is essential for sustainable development. There is no worse aggression against humanity and Mother Earth than war and violence. War destroys life. Nobody and nothing is safe from war. Those that fight suffer, as do those that are forced to go without bread in order to feed the war. Wars squander life and natural resources.

31. An International Tribunal of [[Environmental justice|Environmental]] and [[Climate Justice]] must be established to judge and sanction crimes against nature that transcend national borders, violating the rights of nature and affecting humanity.

32. The problems affecting humanity and nature are global in nature, and to address them requires the exercise of global democracy through the development of mechanisms of consultation and decision-making such as referendums, plebiscites, or popular consultations so that the citizens of the world as a whole may speak.

33. Sustainable development is incompatible with all forms of imperialism and neocolonialism. It is essential to end the imposition of conditionalities, military interventions, coups and different forms of blackmail in order to stop imperialism and neocolonialism.

34. The collective global response needed to confront the crisis we face requires structural changes. We must change the system, not the climate or the Earth system. In the hands of capitalism, everything is converted into merchandise: water, earth genomes, ancestral cultures, justice, ethics, life. It is essential to develop a pluralistic system based on the culture of life and harmony among human beings and with nature; a system that promotes sustainable development in the framework of solidarity, complementarity, equity, social and economic justice, social participation, respect for diversity, and peace.

'''IV. DANGEROUS AND FALSE SOLUTIONS'''

35. Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that is labeled “green” is environmentally friendly. We must use the precautionary principle and deeply analyze the different “green” alternatives that are presented before proceeding with their experimentation and implementation.

36. Nature cannot be subject to manipulation by new technologies without consequences in the future. History shows us that many dangerous technologies have been released in the market before their environmental or health impacts are known, or before their social and economic impacts on poor people and developing countries are understood. This is currently the case with genetically modified organisms, agrochemicals, biofuels, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. These technologies should be avoided.

37. [[Climate engineering|Geoengineering]] and all forms of artificial manipulation of the climate should be prohibited, for they bring the enormous risk of further destabilizing the climate, biodiversity and nature.

38. It is necessary to create public and multilateral mechanisms within the United Nations to evaluate in an independent manner and without conflict of interest the potential environmental, health, social, and economic impacts of new technologies before they are spread. This mechanism must involve transparency and social participation by potentially affected groups.

39. The current ecological and climate crisis has put in jeopardy all of life on planet Earth, and thus it requires deep solutions based on the real causes of the climate crisis. It cannot be reduced to a simple market failure, which is a reductionist and narrow view.

40. The solution is not to put a price on nature. Nature is not a form of capital. The green economy should not distort the fundamental principles of sustainable development. It is wrong to say that we only value that which has a price, an owner, and brings profits. The market mechanisms that permit exchange among human beings and nations have proven incapable of contributing to an equitable distribution of wealth. To use an approach based on market principles and private appropriation to try to resolve the problem of inequality – itself a product of capitalism – is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline.

41. It is wrong to fragment nature into “environmental services” with a monetary value for market exchange. It is wrong to put a price on the capacity of forests to act as [[carbon sinks]], and worse to promote their commercialization as does [[REDD]] (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). The market for carbon credits based on forests will lead to: a) noncompliance with effective emission reduction commitments by developed countries; b) the bulk of resources being appropriated by intermediaries and financial entities and rarely benefiting countries, indigenous peoples and forests themselves; c) the generation of speculative bubbles based on the sale and purchase of said certificates; and d) the establishment of new property rights over the capacity of forests to capture carbon dioxide, which will clash with the sovereign rights of States and the indigenous peoples that live in forests. To promote market mechanisms based on the economic needs of developing countries is a new form of neocolonialism.

42. [[“Green” capitalism]] will bring about natural resource grabbing, displacing humanity and nature from the essential elements needed for their survival. The drive for profit, instead of reestablishing harmony within the system, will provoke even greater imbalances, [[wealth condensation|concentrations of wealth]], and speculative processes.

'''V. GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION'''

43. It is necessary to establish a United Nations organization to promote sustainable development in harmony with nature. This organization should articulate and unite the different authorities involved in order to avoid overlapping efforts and achieve effective coordination. Developing countries should have majority representation in said organization, and its functioning should be democratic, transparent, and accountable.

44. This organization should articulate all of the conventions regarding nature without leaving aside issues central to the United Nations, such as water.

45. Social participation is essential in this new organization. Workers, women, farmers, indigenous peoples, young people, scientists, and all sectors of society should be represented. The private sector cannot have the same amount of influence as the social sectors, given that, by definition, its goal is to create profit rather than social wellbeing. Effective mechanisms for interaction among all social actors are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402182458/http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-04-02 |title=Rio+20 - United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=Uncsd2012.org |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Heliophysics''''' is an aspect of '''''NASA science''''' that enables understanding the [[sun]], [[heliosphere]], and [[planetary environment]]s as a single connected system. In addition to [[sun|solar processes]], this domain of study includes the interaction of [[solar plasma]] and [[solar radiation]] with Earth, the other planets, and [[milky way galaxy|the galaxy]]. By analyzing the connections between the sun, [[solar wind]], planetary space environments, and human's place in the [[milky way galaxy]], the fundamental physical processes that occur throughout the universe are uncovered. Understanding the connections between the Sun and its planets will allow for predicting the impacts of solar interaction on humans, technological systems, and even the presence of life itself. This is also the stated goal of Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research.&lt;ref name=helionasa&gt;

==Local effects==

Furthermore, ''[[heliophysics]]'' of ''NASA science'' views [[sun|the sun]] as an [[star| active star]], and that the earth is physically located within its [[solar atmosphere|atmosphere]]. This view also encompasses the interaction of the earth's [[geophysics|geophysical properties]] with this active star. For example, the sun' light influences all life and processes on Earth.  It is an energy provider that allows and sustains [[life]] on earth. However, the sun also produces streams of [[charged particles | high energy particles]] known as the [[solar wind]], and radiation that can harm life or alter its evolution. Additionally, under the protective shield of [[earth's magnetic field]] and its atmosphere, NASA science sees the Earth as an island in the universe where life has developed and flourished. The origins and fate of life on Earth are intimately connected to the sun's behavior. Hence, NASA science studies [[Heliophysics]] from this perspective.&lt;ref name=helionasa/&gt;&lt;ref name=pesnell&gt;{{cite journal

==Heliophysics research program==

[[Sun#History_of_observation|Methods have been developed]] to see into the internal workings of the sun and understand how the [[earth's magnetosphere]] responds to [[solar activity]]. Further studies are concerned with exploring the full system of complex interactions that characterize the relationship of the Sun with the [[solar system]]. According to NASA, understanding these connections is especially critical as we contemplate our destiny in the third millennium. Heliophysics is needed to facilitate the accelerated expansion of human experience beyond the confines of our earthly home. Recent advances in technology allow us, for the first time, to realistically contemplate voyages beyond the solar system.&lt;ref name=helionasa/&gt;&lt;ref name=pesnell/&gt;

There are three primary objectives that define the multi-decadal studies needed: &lt;ref name=helionasa/&gt;&lt;ref name=burch/&gt;

* To understand the changing flow of energy and matter throughout the Sun, Heliosphere, and Planetary Environments. 
* To explore the fundamental physical processes of space plasma systems. 
* To define the origins and societal impacts of variability in the Earth-Sun System. 
* A combination of interrelated elements is used to achieve these objectives. They include complementary missions of various sizes; timely development of enabling and enhancing technologies; and acquisition of knowledge through research, analysis, theory, and modeling.

== A variable star ==
Earth is located within the extended atmosphere of a [[magnetic]] [[variable star]] that drives the local [[solar system]] and sustains [[Life|life on Earth]]. The Sun is observed to vary from multiple perspectives. The Sun emits light in the [[infrared]], visible, [[ultraviolet]], and at x-ray energies, and it emits a [[magnetic field]], bulk plasma ([[solar wind|the solar wind]]) and energetic particles moving up to nearly the [[speed of light]], and all of these emissions vary.&lt;ref name=big-q-s/&gt;

The intertwined response of the earth and [[heliosphere]] are studied because this planet is immersed in this unseen yet exotic and inherently dangerous environment. Above the protective cocoon of Earth’s lower atmosphere is a plasma soup composed of electrified and magnetized matter entwined with penetrating radiation and energetic particles. The sun has an impact because modern society depends heavily on a variety of technologies that are susceptible to the extremes of [[space weather]] — severe disturbances of the upper atmosphere and of the near-Earth space environment that are driven by the magnetic activity of the Sun. Strong electrical currents driven in the Earth’s surface during auroral events can disrupt and damage modern electric power grids and may contribute to the corrosion of oil and gas pipelines. &lt;ref name=big-q-s&gt;

==Main focus==

Building on NASA’s rich history of exploration of Earth’s neighborhood and distant planetary systems, we are poised to provide a predictive understanding of our place in the solar system. We do not live in isolation; we are intimately coupled with the Sun and the space environment through Earth’s climate system, our technological systems, the habitability of planets and solar system bodies we plan to explore, and ultimately the fate of Earth itself. Variability in this environment affects the daily activities that constitute the underpinning of modern society, including communication, navigation, and weather monitoring and prediction. Because the space environment matters to humans and their technological systems both on Earth and in space, it is essential as a space-faring Nation that we develop an understanding of these space plasma processes. &lt;ref name=focus&gt;
{{NASA
|article=Focus Areas 
|url=https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas//}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Heliosphere===

Plasmas and their embedded magnetic fields affect the formation, evolution and destiny of planets and planetary systems. The heliosphere shields the solar system from galactic cosmic radiation. Our habitable planet is shielded by its [[magnetic field]], protecting it from solar and cosmic particle radiation and from erosion of the atmosphere by the solar wind. Planets without a shielding magnetic field, such as Mars and Venus, are exposed to those processes and evolve differently. And on Earth, the magnetic field changes strength and configuration during its occasional polarity reversals, altering the shielding of the planet from external radiation sources. &lt;ref name=focus/&gt;

===Magnetospheres===

Determine changes in the Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and upper atmosphere in order to enable specification, prediction, and mitigation of their effects. Heliophysics seeks to develop an understanding of the response of the near-Earth plasma regions to space weather. This complex, highly coupled system protects Earth from the worst solar disturbances while redistributing energy and mass throughout. &lt;ref name=burch/&gt;&lt;ref name=focus/&gt;

===Space environment===

Understand the causes and subsequent evolution of solar activity that affects Earth's space climate and environment. The climate and space environment of Earth are significantly determined by the impact of plasma, particle, and radiative outputs from the Sun. Therefore, it is essential to understand the Sun, determine how predictable solar activity truly is, and develop the capability to forecast solar activity and the evolution of disturbances as they propagate to Earth. &lt;ref name=focus/&gt;

''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''-microbe interactions are here broadly defined and encompass the associations with all microbes that are temporarily or permanently living in or on this nematode. The [[microbe]]s might engage in a [[commensal]], [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or [[pathogenic]] interaction with the host and include bacteria, viruses, unicellular eukaryotes, and fungi. In nature ''C. elegans'' harbours a variety of different microbes. In contrast, ''C. elegans'' strains that are cultivated in laboratories for research purposes have lost their naturally associated microbial communities and are commonly maintained on a single bacterial strain, ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' OP50.

The effect of microbes on ''C. elegans'' can vary from beneficial to lethal.

==Beneficial microbes ==

In its natural habitat ''C. elegans'' is constantly confronted with a variety of bacteria that could have both negative and positive effects on its fitness. To date, most research on ''C. elegans''-microbe interactions focused on interactions with pathogens. Only recently, some studies addressed the role of commensal and mutualistic bacteria on ''C. elegans'' fitness. In these studies, ''C. elegans'' was exposed to various soil bacteria, either isolated in a different context or from ''C. elegans'' lab strains transferred to soil.&lt;ref name=Coolon2009&gt;{{cite journal|author=Coolon, J.D., Jones, K.L., Todd, T.C., Carr, B.C., and Herman, M.A. |year=2009|volume=  5 |issue=6|pages=e1000503.|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000503|pmid=19503598|pmc=2684633|title=Caenorhabditis elegans Genomic Response to Soil Bacteria Predicts Environment-Specific Genetic Effects on Life History Traits|journal=PLoS Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MontalvoKatz2013&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Montalvo-Katz, Sirena |author2=Huang, Hao |author3=Appel, Michael David |author4=Berg, Maureen |author5=Shapira, Michael |journal = Infection and Immunity | doi=10.1128/IAI.00653-12 |pmid=23230286 |volume=81 |issue=2 |title=Association with Soil Bacteria Enhances p38-Dependent Infection Resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans |pages=514–520|year=2012 |pmc=3553824}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bacteria can affect ''C. elegans'' either directly through specific metabolites, or they can cause a change in the environmental conditions and thus induce a physiological response in the host.&lt;ref name=Coolon2009 /&gt;
Beneficial bacteria can have a positive effect on the lifespan, generate certain pathogen resistances, or influence the development of ''C. elegans''.

=== Lifespan extension ===

The lifespan of ''C. elegans'' is prolonged when grown on plates with ''[[Pseudomonas]] sp.'' or ''[[Bacillus megaterium]]'' compared to individuals living on ''E.coli''.&lt;ref name="Coolon2009"/&gt; The lifespan extension mediated by ''B. megaterium'' is greater than that caused by ''Pseudomonas sp.''. As determined by microarray analysis (a method, which allows the identification of ''C. elegans'' genes that are differentially expressed in response to different bacteria), 14 immune defence genes were up-regulated when ''C. elegans''was grown on ''B. megaterium'', while only two were up-regulated when fed with ''Pseudomonas sp.'' In addition to immune defence genes, other upregulated genes are involved in the synthesis of [[collagen]] and other [[cuticle]] components, indicating that the cuticle might play an important role in the interaction with microbes. Although some of the genes are known to be important for ''C. elegans'' lifespan extension, the precise underlying mechanisms still remain unclear.&lt;ref name="Coolon2009"/&gt;

===Protection against microbes ===

The microbial communities residing inside the host body have now been recognized to be important for effective immune responses.&lt;ref name=MontalvoKatz2013 /&gt; Yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. Bacteria can help the host to fight against pathogens either by directly stimulating the immune response or by competing with the pathogenic bacteria for available resources.&lt;ref name=Sekirov2010&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sekirov I, Russell SL, Antunes LC, Finlay BB |title=Gut microbiota in health and disease. Physiol. Rev |year=2010|volume=  90|issue=3 |pages=859 –904|doi=10.1152/physrev.00045.2009|pmid=20664075 |journal=Physiological Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stecher2011&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stecher B, Hardt WD |title=Mechanisms controlling pathogen colonization of the gut |journal = Curr. Opin. Microbiol.|year= 2011|volume= 14|issue=1 |pages=82–91|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2010.10.003|pmid=21036098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''C. elegans'', some associated bacteria seem to generate protection against pathogens. For example, when ''C. elegans'' is grown on ''Bacillus megaterium'' or ''[[Pseudomonas mendocina]]'', worms are more resistant to infection with the pathogenic bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' [21], which is a common bacterium in ''C. elegans’ ''natural environment and therefore a potential natural pathogen.&lt;ref name=Tan1999&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tan MW, Mahajan-Miklos S, Ausubel FM |title=Killing of Caenorhabditis elegans by Pseudomonas aeruginosa used to model mammalian bacterial pathogenesis |journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |year=1999|volume= 96|issue=2 |pages=715–720|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.2.715|pmid=9892699 |pmc=15202 |bibcode=1999PNAS...96..715T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This protection is characterized by prolonged survival on ''P. aeruginosa'' in combination with a delayed colonization of ''C. elegans'' by the pathogen. Due to its comparatively large size ''B. megaterium'' is not an optimal food source for ''C. elegans'',&lt;ref name=Avery2003&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Avery L, Shtonda BB |title=Food transport in the C. elegans pharynx |journal = J. Exp. Biol. |year=2003|volume= 206|issue=14 |pages=2441–2457|doi=10.1242/jeb.00433}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a delayed development and a reduced reproductive rate. The ability of ''B. megaterium'' to enhance resistance against the infection with ''P. aeruginosa'' seems to be linked to the decrease in reproductive rate. However, the protection against ''P. aeruginosa'' infection provided by ''P. mendocina'' is reproduction independent, and depends on the [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway]].'' P. mendocina'' is able to activate the p38 MAPK pathway and thus to stimulate the immune response of ''C. elegans'' against the pathogen.&lt;ref name="MontalvoKatz2013"/&gt;

=== Effects on development ===

Under natural conditions it might be advantageous for ''C. elegans'' to develop as fast as possible to be able to reproduce rapidly. The bacterium ''[[Comamonas]]'' DA1877 accelerates the development of ''C. elegans''.&lt;ref name=MacNeil2013&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacNeil, L.T., Watson, E., Arda, H.E., Zhu, L.J., and Walhout, A.J.M|title=Diet-induced developmental acceleration independent of TOR and insulin in C. elegans |journal = Cell |year=2013|volume=153|issue=1 |pages= 240–252.|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.049|pmid=23540701 |pmc=3821073 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither [[Target of rapamycin|TOR]] (target of rapamycin), nor [[Insulin signal transduction pathway and regulation of blood glucose|insulin signalling]] seem to mediate this effect on the accelerated development. It is thus possible that secreted metabolites of ''Comamonas'', which might be sensed by ''C. elegans'', lead to faster development. Worms that were fed with ''Comamonas'' DA1877 also showed a reduced number of offspring and a reduced lifespan.&lt;ref name="MacNeil2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Altun2008&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Altun, Z.F.  |author2=Hall, D.H|title=Introduction. In WormAtlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathogenic microbes ==

In its natural environment ''C. elegans'' is confronted with a variety of different potential pathogens. ''C. elegans'' has been used intensively as a model organism for studying host-pathogen interactions and the immune system.&lt;ref name="Troemel2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SchulenburgKurz2004&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schulenburg, H., Kurz, C.L., Ewbank, J.J.|title=Evolution of the innate immune system: the worm perspective. |journal = Immunological Reviews |year=2004|volume= 198 |pages=36–58 |doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0125.x |pmid=15199953}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies revealed that ''C. elegans'' has well-functioning [[Innate immune system|innate immune defences]]. The first line of defence is the extremely tough cuticle that provides an external barrier against pathogen invasion.&lt;ref name=Hodgkin2008&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hodgkin J, Partridge FA |title=Caenorhabditis elegans Meets Microsporidia: The Nematode Killers from Paris.

pathways, which activate physiological immune responses.&lt;ref name=Ewbank2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1895/wormbook.1.83.1|title=Signaling in the immune response|journal=WormBook|year=2006|last1=Ewbank|first1=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, pathogen avoidance behaviour represents another line of ''C. elegans'' immune defence.&lt;ref name=Schulenburg2007&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schulenburg, H., Ewbank, J.J|title=the genetics of pathogen avoidance in Caenorhabditis elegans |journal=Molecular Microbiology |year=2007 |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=563–570|pmid=17877707 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2007.05946.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; All these defence mechanisms do not work independently, but jointly to ensure an optimal defence response against pathogens.&lt;ref name="SchulenburgKurz2004"/&gt; Many microorganisms were found to be pathogenic for ''C. elegans'' under laboratory conditions. To identify potential ''C. elegans'' pathogens, worms in the L4 larval stage are transferred to a medium that contains the organism of interest, which is a bacterium in most cases. Pathogenicity of the organism can be inferred by measuring the lifespan of worms. There are several known human pathogens that have a negative effect on ''C. elegans'' survival. However, only very few natural ''C. elegans'' pathogens are currently known.&lt;ref name="Troemel2008"/&gt;

=== Eukaryotic microbes ===

One of the best studied natural pathogens of ''C. elegans'' is the [[microsporidium]] ''[[Nematocida parisii]]'', which was directly isolated from wild-caught ''C. elegans''. ''N. parisii'' is an intracellular parasite that is exclusively [[Horizontal gene transfer|transmitted horizontally]] from one animal to another. The microsporidian spores are likely to exit the cells by disrupting a conserved [[cytoskeletal]] structure in the intestine called the terminal web. It seems that none of the known immune pathways of ''C. elegans'' is involved in mediating resistance against ''N. parisii''. Microsporidia were found in several nematodes isolated from different locations, indicating that microsporidia are common natural parasites of ''C. elegans''. The ''N. parisii''-''C. elegans'' system represents a very useful tool to study infection mechanisms of intracellular parasites.&lt;ref name="Troemel2008"/&gt; Additionally, a new species of microsporidia was recently found in a wild caught ''C. elegans'' that genome sequencing places in the same genus ''Nematocida'' as prior microsporidia seen in these nematodes. This new species was named ''Nematocida displodere,'' after a phenotype seen in late infected worms that explode at the vulva to release infectious spores. ''N. displodere'' was shown to infect a broad range of tissues and cell types in ''C. elegans'', including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, intestine, seam cells, and coelomocytes. Strangely, the majority of intestinal infection fails to grow to later parasite stages, while the muscle and epidermal infection thrives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Luallen |first1=Robert |last2=Reinke |first2=Aaron |last3=Tong |first3=Linda |last4=Botts |first4=Michael |last5=Felix |first5=Marie-Anne |last6=Troemel |first6= Emily |title= Discovery of a Natural Microsporidian Pathogen with a Broad Tissue Tropism in Caenorhabditis elegans |journal= PLOS Pathogens |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=e1005724 |date=2016 |biorxiv=047720 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005724|pmid=27362540 |pmc=4928854}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in stark contrast to ''N. parisii'' which infects and completes its entire life cycle in the ''C. elegans'' intestine. These related ''Nematocida'' species are being used to study the host and pathogen mechanisms responsible for allowing or blocking eukaryotic parasite growth in different tissue niches. 
Another eukaryotic pathogen is the fungus ''Drechmeria coniospora'', which has not been directly co-isolated with ''C. elegans'' from nature, but is still considered to be a natural pathogen of ''C. elegans''. ''D. coniospora'' attaches to the cuticle of the worm at the vulva, mouth, and anus and its [[hyphae]] penetrate the cuticle. In this way ''D. coniospora'' infects the worm from the outside, while the majority of bacterial pathogens infect the worm from the intestinal lumen &lt;ref name=Barron1977&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barron GL.|title=Nematophagous destroying fungi. Topics in Mycobiology [serial on the Internet] 1977; 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jansson1994&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jansson HB.|title=Adhesion of conidia of Drechmeria coniospora to Caenorhabditis elegans wild type and mutants. |journal = J Nematol |year=1994|volume= 26|pages=430‐5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viral pathogens ===

In 2011 the first naturally associated [[virus]] was isolated from wild ''C. elegans''. The Orsay virus is an RNA virus that is closely related to [[Nodaviridae|nodaviruses]]. The virus is not stably integrated into the host genome. It is transmitted horizontally under laboratory conditions. An anti-viral [[RNAi]] pathway is essential for ''C. elegans'' resistance against Orsay virus infection &lt;ref name=Felix2011&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Félix MA, Ashe A, Piffaretti J, Wu G, Nuez I |title=Natural and Experimental Infection of Caenorhabditis Nematodes by Novel Viruses Related to Nodaviruses |journal = PLoS Biol |year=2011 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000586 |pmid=21283608 |pmc=3026760 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=e1000586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bacterial pathogens ===

[[File:''Caenorhabditis elegans'' intestine infected with ''Bacillus thuringiensis''.jpg|thumb|''Caenorhabditis elegans'' intestine infected with ''Bacillus thuringiensis'']]

Two bacterial strains of the genus ''Leucobacter'' were co-isolated from nature with the two ''Caenorhabditis'' species ''[[Caenorhabditis briggsae|C. briggsae]]'' and ''C. n. spp 11'', and named Verde1 and Verde2. These two ''Leucobacter'' strains showed contrasting pathogenic effects in ''C. elegans''. Worms that were infected with Verde2 produced a deformed anal region (“Dar” phenotype), while infections with Verde1 resulted in slower growth due to coating of the cuticle with the bacterial strain. In liquid culture Verde1 infected worms stuck together with their tails and formed so called “worm stars”. The trapped worms cannot free themselves and eventually die. After death ''C. elegans'' is then used as a food source for the bacteria. Only larvae in the L4 stage seem to be able to escape by [[autotomy]]. They split their bodies into half, so that the anterior half can escape. The “half-worms” remain viable for several days.&lt;ref name=Hodgkin2013&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hodgkin, J., Félix, MA., Clark, L.C., Stroud, D., Gravato-Nobre, M.J.,|title=Two Leucobacter Strains Exert Complementary Virulence on Caenorhabditis Including Death by Worm-Star Formation |journal = Curr.

The Gram-positive bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' is likely associated with ''C. elegans'' in nature. ''B. thuringiensis'' is a soil bacterium that is often used in infection experiments with ''C. elegans''.&lt;ref name="Höfte1989"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Höfte, H., Whiteley, H.R.,|title=Insecticidal crystal proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis |journal = Microbiol.

These are jointly taken up by ''C. elegans'' orally. Inside the host, the toxins bind to the surface of intestinal cells, where the formation of pores in intestinal cells is induced, causing their destruction. The resulting change in milieu in the gut leads to [[germination]] of the spores, which subsequently proliferate in the worm body.&lt;ref name=Wei2003&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wei J.Z. |author2=Hale K. |author3=Carta L. |author4=Platzer E. |author5=Wong C. |author6=Fang S-C. |author7=Aroian R.V. |title=Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins that target nematodes |journal = PNAS| volume= 100 |issue=5 |year=2003|pages= 2760–2765|doi=10.1073/pnas.0538072100|pmid=12598644|pmc=151414|bibcode=2003PNAS..100.2760W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Borgonie1995&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Borgonie G. |author2=Van Driessche R. |author3=Leyns F. |author4=Arnaut G. |author5=De Waele D. |author6=Coomans A |title=Germination of Bacillus thuringiensis Spores in Bacteriophagous Nematodes (Nematoda: Rhabditida) |journal = Journal of Invertebrate Pathology |volume= 65 |issue=1 |year=1995|pages= 61–67 |doi=10.1006/jipa.1995.1008|pmid=7876593 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Salamitou2000&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Salamitou S. |author2=Ramisse F. |author3=Brehélin M. |author4=Bourget D. |author5=Gilois N. |author6=Gominet M. |author7=Hernandez E. |author8=Lereclus D. |title=the plcR regulon is involved in the opportunistic properties of Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus cereus in mice and insects |journal = Microbiology|volume=  146 |issue=11 |year=2000|pages= 2825–2832|doi=10.1099/00221287-146-11-2825 |pmid=11065361}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aspect of the ''C. elegans''–''B. thuringiensis'' system is the high variability in pathogenicity between different strains.&lt;ref name="Schulenburg2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salamitou2000"/&gt; There are highly pathogenic strains, but also strains that are less or even non-pathogenic.&lt;ref name="Schulenburg2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salamitou2000"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7765">The '''Implication-Realization''' ('''I-R''') model of [[melodic expectation]] was developed by Eugene Narmour as an alternative to [[Schenkerian analysis]] centered less on music analysis and more on [[cognitive]] aspects of expectation. The model is one of the most significant modern theories of melodic expectation, going into great detail about how certain melodic structures arouse particular expectations.

==History==
Meyer (1956) applied [[Gestalt psychology]] [[Gestalt effect|principles]] to musical expectation, resulting in his ideas about completion, closure, and his Law of Good Continuation. In 1977, Narmour's book explicated problems he had with Schenkerian analysis and sketched ideas for a new model of analysis based on  musical expectation as informed by the work of Meyer. Narmour mentioned a forthcoming book, ''The Melodic Structure of Tonal Music'', but it did not appear. Much time passed without the alternative theory, but finally in 1989 Narmour published his I-R model, detailed in the 1990 and 1992 books.

As of 2007, Narmour is working on a new book, which will extend the I-R theory to the parameters of harmony and rhythm and explore potential applications to the analysis of performance.

==Theory==
Narmour's I-R model was published in two separate books, dealing with "basic melodic structures" and "melodic complexity". Each book is quite complex; only a few key points are mentioned here. The ''Music Perception'' review by Ian Cross and the article by Schellenberg provide introductions to the theory.

===Basic melodic structures===

====General claims====
''The Analysis and Cognition of Basic Melodic Structures: The Implication-Realization Model'' begins with two general claims. The first is given by "two universal formal hypotheses" describing what listeners expect. The process of melody perception is based on "the realization or denial" of these hypotheses (1990, 3):

# A + A → A
# A + B → C

Here, A, B, and C are melodic items of either form, interval patterns, or pitches. A + A → A indicates that hearing two similar items yields an expectation of repetition of the item. A + B → C, on the other hand, indicates that hearing two different items yields an expected change in the implied item.

The second claim is that the "forms" above function to provide either closure or nonclosure. Narmour goes on to describe the five '''melodic archetypes''' of his theory:

# process '''[P]''' or iteration (duplication) '''[D]''' (A + A without closure)
# reversal '''[R]''' (A + B with closure)
# registral return '''[aba]''' (exact or nearly exact return to same pitch)
# dyad (two implicative items, as in 1 and 2, without a realization)
# monad (one element which does not yield an implication)

Central to the discussion is the notion of registral direction (direction of motion) and size of intervals between pairs of pitches.  '''[P]''' (process) refers to motion in the same registral direction combined with similar intervallic motion (two small intervals or two large intervals). '''[D]''' refers to identical intervallic motion with lateral registral direction. '''[R]''' refers to changing intervallic motion (large to smaller) with different registral directions.

'''P''', '''D''', and '''R''' only account for cases where registral direction and intervalic motion are working in unison to satisfy the implications. When one of these two factors is denied, there are more possibilities, the five '''archetypal derivatives''':

# intervallic process '''[IP]''': small interval to similar small interval, different registral directions
# registral process '''[VP]''': small to large interval, same registral direction
# intervallic reversal '''[IR]''': large interval to small interval, same registral direction
# registral reversal '''[VR]''': large interval to larger interval, different registral direction
# intervallic duplication '''[ID]''': small interval to identical small interval, different registral directions

Each of these 8 fundamental symbols can refer to a "prospective or retrospective dimension". The symbols are enclosed in parentheses like so: '''(VR)''' to indicate a "retrospective realization". Narmour (1990, 6) considers these symbols to be representative of cognitive structures: "As symbological tokens, all sixteen prospective and retrospective letters purport to represent the listener's encoding of many of the basic structures of melody."

From these foundations, the theory gets more detailed, and problems of style, pitch, harmony, rhythm, etc. are all discussed.

====Syntactic parametric scale====

====Top-down and bottom-up processing====

====Five principles====
Schellenberg's work has involved testing and simplifying specific implementations of the I-R model. His 1997 article gives an overview of the I-R theory that describes it in terms of five governing principles:

# Registral direction
# Intervallic difference
# Registral return
# Proximity
# Closure

=====1. Registral direction=====
* Small intervals imply continuation of pitch direction
* Large intervals imply a change of direction

=====2. Intervallic difference=====
* Small intervals imply similar-sized realized intervals
** When the registral direction changes, a "small" realized interval is defined as the original interval size +/- 2 semitones
** In the absence of direction change, a "small" interval is the original interval +/- 3 semitones
* Large implicative intervals imply smaller realized intervals

=====3. Registral return=====
This is the melodic archetype '''aba''' or '''aba\'''' where the second tone of a realized interval is very similar to the original pitch (within 2 semitones). This archetype describes symmetric or near-symmetric patterns such as C-G-C#. Patterns are less archetypical as they deviate more from this symmetry.

=====4. Proximity=====
* Small realized intervals are more implied than large intervals. Also, implications are stronger for smaller-sized intervals.

=====5. Closure=====
Closure describes how listeners segment melodies based on pitch direction and interval size.  Closure occurs in two cases:
* Melody changes direction. That is, implicative and realized intervals are in different directions.
* A larger implicative interval is followed by a smaller realized interval.

'''Soil Test Crop Response (STCR) Project''' : The beginning of the project was in 1967 and 13 centres are participating in the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stcr.gov.in/HTML/html/diary_fset.html Stcr Based Online Fertilizer Recommendation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PCM Project''': The purpose of the project was to study the effects of micronutrient efficiency on various crop varieties and was started in 1967, with active participation from [[Punjab Agricultural University|Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana]]. Eleven centres are participating in the project.

'''AINPB Project''': The mandate of the project is set as:
* To exploit the soil biodiversity in various agro-ecologies for biofertilizer applications in diverse cropping systems.
* To study the impact of soil management practices on functional diversity of microorganisms involved in key microbial functions and soil health using genomic tools.
* Formulation and testing of mixed biofertilizers in diverse cropping systems.
* To improve biofertilizer technology with particular reference to quality, carriers, consortia and delivery systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">[[NATO]] has defined the concept of an '''Information Exchange Gateway''' (IEG) to facilitate secure communication between different security and management domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO IEG|url=http://www.afcea.org/europe/events/tne/08/documents/03_InteroperableStandardsProfiles-EWells.pdf|publisher=AFCEA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IEG is designed to provide a standard and [[secure communication|secure method of communication]] between NATO, NATO nations, non-NATO nations, [[coalition force]]s, [[Non Government Organisation]]s (NGOs), and other International Organisations (IOs).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cso.nato.int/ACTIVITY_META.asp?ACT=2226&lt;/ref&gt;

An Information Exchange Gateway provides '''Information Exchange Services''' (IES) to facilitate the exchange of information between networks, including data and protocol translation where necessary, and '''Information Protection Services''' (IPS) that ensure only intended information is exchanged. In addition, '''Node Protection Services''' (NPS) ensure information is exchanged in a safe and secure way and that only intended information which has been validated by the IPS can be exchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Guidance Document on the Implementation of Gateways for Information Exchange between NATO CIS and External CIS, AC/322-D(2005)0054-REV2, NATO, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO has defined five main IEG scenarios&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Exchange Gateways|url= https://www.nexor.com/information-exchange-gateways/ |publisher=Nexor}}&lt;/ref&gt; each with scenario variants for transferring [[Classified information|classified information]]. The scenarios take account of the security classifications of the domains that they connect, as well as the security policy, the owners and the administrators of those domains.

In some scenarios, an IEG must include a [[Guard (information security)|guard]] to provide the IPS and NPS functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Exchange Gateways|url= http://www.deep-secure.com/information-exchange-gateway |publisher=Deep-Secure}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used with a guard, the IEG's [[DMZ (computing)|DMZ]] is split into two.

The '''interconnect bottleneck''' comprises limits on [[integrated circuit]] (IC) performance due to connections between components instead of their internal speed.
In 2006 it was predicted to  be a "looming crisis" by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060417124542.htm |title= Quantum Paint-on Laser Could Rescue Computer Chip Industry |work= Science Daily |date= April 17, 2006 |accessdate= May 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improved performance of computer systems has been achieved, in large part, by downscaling the IC minimum feature size. This allows the basic IC building block, the [[transistor]], to operate at a higher frequency, performing more computations per second. However, downscaling of the minimum feature size also results in tighter packing of the wires on a [[microprocessor]], which increases [[parasitic capacitance]] and signal propagation delay. Consequently, the delay due to the communication between the parts of a chip becomes comparable to the computation delay itself. This phenomenon, known as an “interconnect bottleneck”, is becoming a major problem in high-performance computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ece.rochester.edu/~weiss/SMW%20papers/MH_SPIE2004.pdf Dynamically tunable 1D and 2D photonic bandgap structures for optical interconnect applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

This interconnect bottleneck can be solved by utilizing optical interconnects to replace the long metallic interconnects.&lt;ref name="iptronics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iptronics.com/36209/Optical%20interconnects.html|title=Parallel Optical Interconnects|last=Bek|first=Jesper|date=2008-06-09|publisher=[[IPtronics]]|accessdate=2010-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305124306/http://www.iptronics.com/36209/Optical%20interconnects.html|archivedate=2011-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such hybrid optical/electronic interconnects promises better performance even with larger designs. Optics has widespread use in long-distance communications; still it has not yet been widely used in chip-to-chip or on-chip interconnections because they (in centimeter or micrometer range) are not yet industry-manufacturable owing to costlier technology and lack of fully mature technologies. As optical interconnections move from computer network applications to chip level interconnections, new requirements for high connection density and alignment reliability have become as critical for the effective utilization of these links. There are still many materials, fabrication, and packaging challenges in integrating optic and electronic technologies.

{{Fiqh |sexual}}

'''Islamic sexual jurisprudence''' concerns the Islamic laws of [[sexuality]] in [[Islam]], as largely predicated on the [[Quran|Qur'an]], the sayings of [[Muhammad]] (''[[hadith]]'') and the rulings of religious leaders' (''[[fatwa]]'') confining [[sexual activity]] to [[marriage|marital]] relationships [[Heterosexuality|between men and women]]. While most traditions discourage [[celibacy]], all encourage strict [[chastity]], [[modesty]] and [[privacy]] with regard to any relationships between [[gender]]s, holding forth that their [[intimate relationship|intimacy]] as perceived within Islam{{spaced ndash}}encompassing a swath of life broader than sexual activity{{spaced ndash}}is largely reserved for marriage. This sensitivity to gender difference and modesty outside of marriage can be seen in current prominent aspects of Islam, such as interpretations of [[list of types of sartorial hijab|Islamic dress]] and degrees of [[sex segregation and Islam|gender segregation]].

While prohibitions against [[extramarital sex]] are strong, sexual activity itself is not a taboo subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islam-usa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=289&amp;Itemid=301 | title=Sex education, teenage pregnancy, sex in Islam and marriage | publisher=/www.islam-usa.com | accessdate=13 June 2015 | author=Dr. Shahid Athar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myummah.co.za/site/2008/03/15/sunnah-of-the-wedding-night/|title=Sunnah of the Wedding Night|date=15 March 2008|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317145545/http://myummah.co.za/site/2008/03/15/sunnah-of-the-wedding-night/|archivedate=17 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permissible sexual relationships are described in [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] as great wells of love and closeness. Even after marriage, there are limitations: a man should not have intercourse during his wife's menstruation and afterbirth periods. He is also considered to be sinning when [[anal sex|penetrating anally]]. Islam itself is a [[natalist]] religion, therefore it encourages increasing procreation through marital sexual relationships. Actions and behaviours such as [[abortion]] (other than for medical risk to the pregnant woman) {{additional citation needed|date=June 2018}} and [[homosexuality]] are also [[Haram|strictly forbidden]]; temporary [[contraceptive]] use is permitted for [[birth control]].

==Sex education==
===Adult===
Muslim men and women asked Muhammad about issues concerning sexual behavior, so as to know the teachings and rulings of their religion. Muslims could pose their questions either to Muhammad directly or to his wives.&lt;ref name=ii&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex education: An Islamic Perspective |url=https://www.islamicity.org/2191/sex-education-an-islamic-perspective/ |website=www.islamicity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ii2&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex Education in Islam |url=https://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/education.html |website=islamawareness.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hadith]] attributed to Muhammad's wife [[Aisha]] states that the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] women in particular were not shy about asking questions regarding sexual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari, Book 3, Number 0649&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
Parents are responsible for the upbringing of their children,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bukhaari (853) and Muslim (1829)&lt;/ref&gt; and that responsibility includes protecting them from anything that may corrupt their morals. Early sex education for children is not recommended by Islamic scholars, as the knowledge contained in such curricula may be a negative influence on a young child's mind.&lt;ref name=iqa&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the appropriate age to teach children sex education? |url=https://islamqa.info/en/138101 |website=islamqa.info |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=He studies in a mixed school in a foreign country and is asking about attending "sex education" classes |website=islamqa.info |url=https://islamqa.info/en/113970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid]], young children should instead be taught Islamic rules involving covering the [[Intimate parts in Islam|‘awrah]], controlling one's gaze, and asking permission before entering private spaces.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

Munajjid also suggested to separate the bed of children at the age of ten according to hadith:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;
{{quote|It was narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, that his grandfather said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Instruct your children to pray when they are seven years old, and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten years old, and separate them in their beds.”| Abu Dawood (495)}}

Shaykh Muhammad Shams al-Haqq al-‘Azeemabaadi said:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

{{quote|Al-Mannaawi said in Fath al-Qadeer Sharh al-Jaami‘ as-Sagheer: That is, separate your children in the beds in which they sleep when they reach the age of ten, as a precaution against provocation of desire, even in the case of sisters. At-Teebi said: Allah mentioned together the ideas of instructing them to pray and separating them in their beds in childhood, so as to discipline them and obey all the commands of Allah, and to teach them, to show them proper etiquette with people, and to teach them not to put themselves in suspicious situations and to keep away from sin.|Awn al-Ma‘bood (2/115)}}

Munajjid stated, this ''advice and guidance'' from this verse has to do with protecting and concealing the ‘awrah and avoiding provocation of desire which begins, as we have seen, in the tenth year, which is the age at which most children reach discernment.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

When puberty approaches, children should be taught the signs of puberty and the characteristics which distinguish men from women, and the types of discharge that may be emitted from the front passage of both sexes. They should also be taught the rulings on wudoo’ and ghusl, paying attention to the phrases used in teaching and ensuring that it is taught according to what the child needs to know. Munajjid has maintained two as important matters which should begin at a very early age – around the age of three years – that have a basic connection to the issue of sex education. They are:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

# The necessity for the boy or girl to be able to distinguish between male and female. Confusion between them at that early age could lead to troubles and confusion in concepts, characteristics and actions, in both sexes. Hence it is essential to make a boy understand that he cannot wear his sister’s clothes, or wear earrings or bracelets, because these are for females, not for males. By the same token, a girl should be told similar things about her brother’s actions and characteristics.

# Teaching children that the ‘awrah is private, and that it should not be uncovered for anyone. Teaching them this, and bringing them up with it, is a way of instilling in them the characteristics of chastity and modesty, and will help prevent perverts from transgressing against them.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;  
 
Finally he stated, “With regard to the issue of sex education having to do with intercourse, or what happens between spouses in general, this should come when there is a need for it, such as when marriage is approaching, or when he is mature enough to understand some issues of fiqh, such as the rulings on zina (fornication or adultery) and the like, which have to do with intercourse and ‘awrahs. It should be noted that what is needed of that knowledge is basically something that is natural and instinctive in the first place, and what you need to point out must be taught to children gradually, in accordance with the stages of their development, by means of lessons of fiqh, study circles and classes in school. We should be conservative in the words and phrases we use, and attention must be paid to the appropriate ages and stages to discuss this topic. We must also warn against the promiscuous practices of the disbelievers and contrast them with the beauty of Islam, with regard to urging Muslims to cover up and be modest, and to guard their chastity and avoid that which is haraam."&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

==Circumcision==
{{See also|Khitan (circumcision)|Khafd}}
''Khitan'' or ''Khatna'' ({{lang-ar|ختان}}, {{lang-ar|ختنة}}) is the term for male [[circumcision]] carried out as a [[Islamic culture|cultural rite]] by Muslims and is considered a sign of belonging to the wider [[Islam]]ic community.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |title=Circumcision of boys |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work=Religion &amp; ethics&amp;mdash;Islam |publisher=BBC |date=2006-03-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305204605/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not it should be carried out after [[converting to Islam]] is debated among Islamic scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://convertingtoislam.com/circum.html |title=Male circumcision - the Islamic View |publisher=www.convertingtoislam.com |accessdate=2013-02-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214054917/http://convertingtoislam.com/circum.html |archivedate=2013-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicinvitationcentre.com/FAQ/converts/FAQ_converts.html#Anchor-34662circumcision|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227151507/http://islamicinvitationcentre.com/FAQ/converts/FAQ_converts.html#Anchor-34662circumcision|archivedate=2010-12-27 |title=Is Circumcision obligatory after conversion? |publisher=Islamicinvitationcentre.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1731&amp;CATE=115 |title=Considering Converting: Is it necessary to be circumcised? |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716152023/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1731&amp;CATE=115 |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=13339&amp;hd=3&amp;cate=0&amp;t=rss |title=Circumcision for Converts |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180532/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=13339&amp;hd=3&amp;cate=0&amp;t=rss |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an itself does not mention circumcision explicitly in any verse. Some hadith mentions circumcision in a list of practices known as ''[[fitra]]'' (acts considered to be of a refined person). [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Hurayra]], a companion of Muhammad, was quoted saying, {{quote|"Five things are fitra: circumcision, shaving pubic hair with a razor, trimming the mustache, paring one's nails and plucking the hair from one's armpits" |(reported in  the  ''hadiths'' of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and  [[Sahih Muslim]]).}} 
So, despite its absence from the Qur'an, it has been a [[Religious male circumcision|religious]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; custom from the beginning of Islam. However, there are other ''hadiths'' which do not name circumcision as part of the characteristics of ''fitra''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/107|title=Hadith - Book of Dress - Sahih al-Bukhari - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=www.sunnah.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916095339/http://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/107|archivedate=2013-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet another ''hadith'' which names ten characteristics, again without naming circumcision; in Sahih Muslim, Aisha is quoted, {{quote|"The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Ten are the acts according to fitra: clipping the mustache, letting the beard grow, using toothpicks, snuffing water in the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the armpits, shaving pubic hair and cleaning one's private parts with water. The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/muslim/2/71|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification - Sahih Muslim - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=www.sunnah.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018144335/http://sunnah.com/muslim/2/71|archivedate=2013-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Hence, the different hadiths do not correspond on whether circumcision is part of fitra or not. According to some traditions Muhammad was born without a [[foreskin]] ([[Aposthia|aposthetic]]), while others maintain that his grandfather [[Abdul-Muttalib]] circumcised him when he was seven days old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |title=Religions - Islam: Circumcision of boys |publisher=BBC |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629074142/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |archivedate=2012-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Halabi, Ali Ibn-Burhan-al-Din. Alsirah al-halabiyyah. Vol.1 Beirut: Al-maktabah al-islamiyyah. (n.d.): 54-5&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his early disciples were circumcised to symbolize their inclusion within the emerging Islamic community.&lt;ref name="source"&gt;source?&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst ''[[Ulema]]'' (Muslim legal scholars), there are differing opinions about the compulsion of circumcision in ''[[Sharia]]'' (Islamic law). [[Imam]]s [[Abū Ḥanīfa]], founder of the [[Hanafi]] school of ''[[Fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), and [[Malik ibn Anas]], maintain that circumcision is a ''[[Sunnah]] Mu'akkadah''—not obligatory but highly recommended. The [[Shafi`i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools see it as binding on all Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530090925/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archivedate=2010-05-30 |title=Medical Ethics of Male Circumcision |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-05-30 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic sources do not fix a particular time for circumcision. It depends on family, region and country. A majority of Ulema however take the view that parents should get their child circumcised before the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamicvoice.com/may.2000/dialogue.htm |title=Circumcision |publisher=Islamicvoice.com |date=2000-03-28 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626223309/http://www.islamicvoice.com/may.2000/dialogue.htm |archivedate=2012-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred age is usually seven although some Muslims are circumcised as early as on the seventh day after birth and as late as at the commencement of [[puberty]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

{{See also|Islamic theological jurisprudence|Islam and children}}

''Bāligh'' or ''bulūgh'' ({{lang-ar|بالغ or بُلوغ}}) refers to a person who has reached [[adulthood|maturity]] or [[puberty]], and has full responsibility under [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

For example, in issues pertaining to [[Marriage in Islam|marriage]], ''baligh'' is related to the [[Arabic]] legal expression, ''hatta tutiqa'l-rijal'', which means that a wedding may not take place until the girl is physically fit to engage in [[sexual intercourse]]. In comparison, ''baligh'' or ''balaghat'' concerns the reaching of [[sexual maturity]] which becomes manifest by the [[menses]]. The age related to these two concepts can, but need not necessarily, coincide. Only after a separate condition called ''rushd'', or intellectual maturity to handle one's own property, is reached can a girl receive her [[bridewealth]].&lt;ref&gt;Masud, ''Islamic Legal Interpretation, Muftis and Their Fatwas'', [[Harvard University]] Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

A boy may reach maturity from the age of 10 lunar years (nine years, eight months and twenty days) and will be considered mature at the age of 15 lunar years (14 years, 6 months and 22 days) if no signs of maturity are found. Signs of maturity for a boy include: wet dreams and ejaculation. A girl may reach maturity from the age of 9 lunar years (approximately eight years and eight months) and will be considered mature at the age of 15 lunar years (14 years, 6 months and 22 days) if no signs of maturity are found. Signs of maturity for a girl: menstruation, wet dream or pregnancy.

==Conservatism==
{{see also|Awrah|Mahram|Islam and clothing}}
Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of conservatism, decency and [[modesty]]; besides the lawful sexuality, priority is given to modesty and chastity both inside and outside the marital relationships. In the [[hadith|hadith literature]], modesty has been described as "a part of faith.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://40hadithnawawi.com/index.php/the-hadiths/hadith-20 | title=Hadith 20 :: Modesty is from Faith | publisher=40hadithnawawi.com | accessdate=27 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150729011802/http://40hadithnawawi.com/index.php/the-hadiths/hadith-20 | archivedate=29 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) passed by an Ansari (man) who was admonishing to his brother regarding Haya'. On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Leave him as Haya'(self-respect, modesty, bashfulness) is a part of faith."|Sahih Bukhari: 24}}

Modesty is verily required in the interaction between members of the opposite sex and in some case between the members of same sex also. [[Islam and clothing|Dress-code]] is part of that overall teaching.&lt;ref name="Marital privacy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quran.mu/marital-privacy-in-islam.html | title=Marital privacy in Islam | accessdate=1 December 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208211244/http://www.quran.mu/marital-privacy-in-islam.html | archivedate=8 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/138101 | title=What is the appropriate age to teach children sex education? | publisher=[[islamqa.info]] | accessdate=27 November 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208044332/http://islamqa.info/en/138101 | archivedate=8 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Quran, the subjects deal with modesty and privacy of men and women has been mostly described in [[An-Nur]]. For example, it has been mentioned,

{{quotation|"Say to the believing men that they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions. That is purer for them. Surely Allah is Aware of what they do. And say to the believing women that they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions and do not display their adornment except what appears thereof. -- And let them wear their head-coverings over their bosoms. And they should not display their adornment except to their husbands or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or those whom their -- right hands possess, or guileless male servants, or the children who know not women's nakedness. And let them not strike their feet so that the adornment that they hide may be known. And turn to Allah all, O believers, so that you may be successful. And marry those among you who are single, and those who are fit among your male slaves and your female slaves. If they are needy, Allah will make them free from want out of His grace. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing. And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste, until Allah makes them free from want out of His grace."|[[An-Nur]] 24:30-33}}

{{quotation|"O you who believe, let those whom your right hands possess and those of you who have not attained to puberty ask permission of you three times: Before the morning prayer, and when you put off your clothes for the heat of noon, and after the prayer of night. These are three times of privacy for you; besides these it is no sin for you nor for them -- some of you go round about (waiting) upon others. Thus does Allah make clear to you the messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. And when the children among you attain to puberty, let them seek permission as those before them sought permission. Thus does Allah make clear to you His messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. And (as for) women past childbearing, who hope not for marriage, it is no sin for them if they put off their clothes without displaying their adornment. And if they are modest, it is better for them. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. There is no blame on the blind man, nor any blame on the lame, nor blame on the sick, nor on yourselves that you eat in your own houses, or your fathers' houses, or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or your sisters' houses; or your paternal uncles' houses, or your paternal aunts' houses, or your maternal uncles' houses, or your maternal aunts' houses, or (houses) whereof you possess the keys, or your friends' (houses). It is no sin in you that you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses, greet your people with a salutation from Allah, blessed (and) goodly. Thus does Allah make clear to you the messages that you may understand."|[[An-Nur]] 24:58-61}}

Hadith also describes the laws of modesty. Along with Quran it has also emphasized marriage as a requirement for modesty and chastity. For example,

{{quotation|Narrated by Abdullah ibn Masud, the prophet said, "O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, as it lower the eyesight and guard his modesty and whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for that will be a shield for him."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|bukhari|7|62|4}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|bukhari|4778}}, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1400}}}}

It has been mentioned in [[Hadith]] ranging about men's and women's [[Intimate parts in Islam|private parts]] that,
Regarding women follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Asma, daughter of Abu Bakr, entered upon the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) wearing thin clothes. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) turned his attention from her. He said: O Asma’, when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this, and he pointed to her face and hands." Abu Dawud&lt;ref&gt;http://veil.unc.edu/religions/islam/hadith/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"After Muhammad issued the command (Quran 24:31) for women to cover themselves, the women responded by tearing up sheets [or outer garments] to cover their faces." Sahih Bukhari (60:282)&lt;ref name="sahih-bukhari.com"&gt;https://www.sahih-bukhari.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding men follows:
{{quotation|Narrated by Muawiah ibn Haydah, " I said : Apostle of Allah, from whom should we conceal our private parts and to whom can we show? He replied : conceal your private parts except from your wife and from whom your right hand possesses (concubines). I then asked: Apostle of Allah, (what should we do), if the people are assembled together? He replied: If it is within your power then no one will look at it, then you should try that no one can look it. I then asked: Apostle of Allah, if one of us is alone? He replied: Allah is more entitled than people that bashfulness should be shown to him (feel shy more to Allah than to people)."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|31|4006}}}}

{{quotation|Narrated Jarhad: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) sat with us and my thigh was uncovered. He said: Do you not know that thigh is a private part.|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|31|4003}}}}

{{quotation|The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Do not uncover you thigh, and do not look at the thigh of the living and the dead.|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|31|4004}}}}

It is forbidden for both spouses to spread the secrets of what happens between them in their private marital life; indeed, this is one of the most evil things. Quran says,&lt;ref name="Marital privacy"/&gt;
{{quotation|So the good women are obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded.|[[An-Nisa]] 4:34}}

{{quotation|“Among the most evil of people before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who comes to his wife and has intercourse with her, then he spreads her secrets.” |Muslim, 4/157}}

{{quotation|It was reported from Asmaa’ bint Yazeed that she was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and men and women were sitting with him, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Would any man say what he did with his wife? Would any woman tell others what she did with her husband?” The people kept quiet and did not answer. I [Asmaa’] said: “Yes, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah, they (women) do that, and they (men) do that.” He said, “Do not do that. It is like a male devil meeting a female devil in the road and having intercourse with her whilst the people are watching.”|Abu Dawood, no. 1/339}}

{{quotation|Allah's Messenger said: The most wicked among the people in the eye of Allah on the Day of judgment is the men who goes to his wife and she comes to him, and then he divulges her secret (to others).| [http://sunnah.com/muslim/16/145 Sahih Muslim - 3369]}}&lt;ref name="Marital privacy"/&gt;

Privacy between unmarried man and woman is not allowed following:
{{quote|Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A woman should not travel except with a Dhu-Mahram (her husband or a man with whom that woman cannot marry at all according to the Islamic Jurisprudence), and no man may visit her except in the presence of a Dhu-Mahram." A man got up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I intend to go to such and such an army and my wife wants to perform Hajj." The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "Go along with her (to Hajj).| Muslim 1740}}

The following hadiths also commands maintaining basic privacy in societal gathering: 
{{quotation|Narrated by Abu Said Khudri: The prophet said, "A man should not look at the private part of another man, and a woman should not look at the private parts of another woman.

In another [[hadith]] it has been mentioned,
{{quotation|The Messenger of Allah said: "Instruct your children to pray when they are seven years old, and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten years old, and separate them in their beds."|Narrated by Abu Dawood (495)}}

There is also prescription of modesty and privacy in case of unlawful sexual acts. It is mentioned in the hadith below from [[Muwatta Imam Malik]]:

{{quotation|Malik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam that a man confessed to fornication in the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called for a whip, and he was brought a broken whip. He said, "Above this," and he was brought a new whip whose knots had not been cut yet. He said, "Below this," and he was brought a whip which had been used and made flexible. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave the order and he was flogged. Then he said, "People! The time has come for you to observe the limits of Allah.

Whoever reveals to us his wrong action, we perform what is in the Book of Allah against him."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muwatta|41|2|12}}}}

Some hadith warn against immodesty including as follows,
{{quotation|"The Messenger of Allah said: ‘ ... There are five things with which you will be tested, and I seek refuge with Allah lest you live to see them: Promiscuity (sexual immorality) never appears among a people to such an extent that they commit it openly, but plagues and diseases that were never known among the predecessors will spread among them. ..."| [http://www.sunnah.com/urn/1291190 Sunan Ibn Majah - 4,019]}}

==Marriage==
{{main|Marriage in Islam}}

Marriage (Nikah) is a contract between Muslim men and his wife. Marriage has been described in tradition (hadith) as half of the religion with the regards of preserving chastity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marriage half of faith? |url=https://eshaykh.com/hadith/general-2/ |website=eshaykh.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is marriage half of religion? - islamqa.info |url=https://islamqa.info/en/11586 |website=isamqa.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex within marriage ==
{{further|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}

In Islamic law, marriage legalizes sexual intercourse between the husband and wife. Marriage is not restricted to a platonic relationship nor is it only for procreation. Marriage is greatly encouraged in Islam, partially because it provides a lawful institution in which to fulfill one's sexual urges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/5560 | title=Etiquette of intimate relations | publisher=islamqa.info | work=Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724204418/http://islamqa.info/en/5560 | archivedate=24 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_and_marriage_q-and-a.html | title=Sex &amp; Marriage in Islam | publisher=zawaj.com | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710223229/http://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_and_marriage_q-and-a.html | archivedate=10 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-syed-athar-husain-sh-rizvi/importance-marriage-islam | title=Importance of Marriage in Islam | publisher=Al-Islam.org | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724205547/http://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-syed-athar-husain-sh-rizvi/importance-marriage-islam | archivedate=24 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam does provide extensive rules regarding sex; however, within the conditional institution of marriage, there are sources in both the Qur'an and hadith, which promote the well being of humans and their natural sexual instincts. In the Surah Baqarah, sex in married life is openly recommended: {{quote|"When they [i.e. wives] have cleansed themselves [after menstruation], you go into them as Allah has commanded."|(2:222)}}&lt;ref group="Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project"&gt;{{cite web |title=Importance of Marriage in Islam |url=http://www.al-islam.org/marriage-handbook/3.htm |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504205154/http://www.al-islam.org/marriage-handbook/3.htm |archivedate=May 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been also said: {{quote|"Those who guard their chastity (ie. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for them, they are free from blame."|[al-Mu’minoon 23:5-6]}} Additionally, sources of hadith illustrate similar promotion of fulfilling sexual urges in lawful ways within a marriage. The Wasaelush Shia quotes Muhammad as encouraging his followers to marry, saying: {{quote|"O, you young men! I recommend marriage to you."|The Wasaelush Shia (vol. 14, p.&amp;nbsp;25)}}&lt;ref group="Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project"&gt;{{cite web |last=S.H.

Prophet Muhammad also declared marital sex as charity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Having intercourse (with one's wife) is a charity. |url=https://salaficentre.com/2014/05/having-intercourse-with-ones-wife-is-a-charity/ |website=The Salafi Centre of Manchester |accessdate=19 June 2018|date=2014-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"When one of you have sex with your wife, it is a rewarded act of charity." The Companions were surprised and said, "But we do it purely out of our desire. How can it be counted as charity?" The Prophet replied, "If you had done it with a forbidden woman, it would have been counted as a sin, but if you do it in legitimacy, it is counted as charity.”|Muslim. Number 1674}}

=== Sexual techniques ===

One of the areas of Islamic sexual jurisprudence in which there are not many restrictions is the discussion of sexual techniques. Almost all of what is practiced under Islamic law concerning sexual techniques and the act of sexual intercourse come from 'hadith'', which are not restrictive in nature, but followed by a mutual etiquette known as foreplay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turning Sex Into Sadaqa An excerpt from 'The Muslim Marriage Guide.' |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/islam/2001/04/turning-sex-into-sadaqa.aspx |website=beliefnet.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kissing and Foreplay |url=https://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/kissf.htm |website=central-mosque.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE RULES OF NIKAH: BEDROOM ETIQUETTES IN ISLAM |url=http://www.authentictauheed.com/2011/07/112-bedroom-etiquettes-in-islam.html |website=authentictauheed.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the hadith follows:

{{quote|Imam al-Daylami records a narration on the authority of Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him &amp; give him peace) is reported to have said:  "Not one of you should fulfil one’s (sexual) need from/fall upon his wife like an animal; but let there first be a messenger between you." "And what is that messenger?" they asked, and he replied: "Kisses and words".”|Musnad al-Firdaws Of al-Daylami, 2/55}}

{{quote|Imam Ibn al-Qayyim reports from Jabir ibn Abd Allah in his famous “Tibb al-Nabawi” that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him &amp; give him peace) forbade from engaging in sexual intercourse before foreplay.|al-Tibb al-Nabawi, 183}}
The main tendency within these ''hadith'' are saying for Muslims to follow in the bedroom, saying which "clearly show that the husband and the wife should feel completely free when they are engaged in mutual stimulation which is known as foreplay. These sayings recommend [[foreplay]] and put no real restrictions on the type of techniques used during foreplay or during intercourse.&lt;ref name="foreplay 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic bedroom fiqh|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-basic-fiqh.html|work=Hanafi fiqh|publisher=themodernreligion.com|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Sidi Faraz Rabbani|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819080707/http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-basic-fiqh.html|archivedate=19 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kiss 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kissing and Foreplay in Islam|url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/kissing-and-foreplay.html|work=Sex in Islam|publisher=Zawaj.com|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624135953/http://www.zawaj.com/articles/kissing-and-foreplay.html|archivedate=24 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/826 | title=Masturbation between husband and wife | publisher=[[islamqa.info]] | work=Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid | accessdate=2 August 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708043554/http://islamqa.info/en/826 | archivedate=8 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allah says in the Qur'an: {{quote|Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus), when or how you will, and send (good deeds, or ask Allah to bestow upon you pious offspring) for your own selves beforehand. And fear Allah, and know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give good tidings to the believers (O Muhammad).|{{cite quran|2|223|s=ns}}}}

In the foregoing verse the word harth (tilth) indicates that any kind of vaginal sex is permissible in Islam, because it is from this place children are produced; and it is also regardless any of sexual positions, because although top to bottom position has been encouraged most, but none of the vaginal sexual positions has been mentioned as prohibited in scripture and tradition.&lt;ref name=alis&gt;{{cite web |title=1.What are the positions and ways of having sex are legal in islam? |url=http://www.islamhelpline.net/node/3692 |website=islamhelpline.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual Techniques |url=https://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-handbook-syed-athar-husayn-sh-rizvi/sexual-techniques |website=www.al-islam.org |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semen lodged in the womb from which offspring comes is likened to the seeds that are planted in the ground, bringing vegetation. Both of them are substances from which something else is produced. Hence, conversely, one area of sexual techniques that is generally prohibited is [[anal intercourse]].&lt;ref name=alis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=There is nothing in Islam to say that anal intercourse is permissible |url=https://islamqa.info/en/91968 |website=islamqa.info |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Ruling on Anal Sex |url=https://archive.islamonline.net/?p=669 |website=islamonline.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Muslim jurists agree that anal sex is haram (prohibited), based on the hadith of Muhammad: {{quote|Do not have anal sex with women.|Reported by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah}}

{{quote|Muhammad also said, "Cursed he. ..who has sex with a woman through her back passage."|Ahmad}}

{{quote|Khuzaymah Ibn Thabit also reported that the Messenger of Allah said: "Allah is not too shy to tell you the truth: Do not have sex with your wives in the anus."|Reported by Ahmad, 5/213}}

{{quote|Ibn Abbas narrated: "The Messenger of Allah said: "Allah will not look at a man who has anal sex with his wife."|Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 3/529; At-Tirmidhi classified it as an authentic hadith, 1165}}

Further, it is reported that Muhammad referred to such an act as "minor sodomy". (Reported by Ahmad and An-Nasa'i)

{{quote|It is reported that `Umar Ibn Al-Khattab came one day to Muhammad and said, "O Messenger of Allah, I am ruined!" "What has ruined you?" asked the Prophet. He replied, "Last night I turned my wife over," meaning that he had had vaginal intercourse with her from the back. The Prophet did not say anything to him until the verse cited above was revealed. Then he told him, "[Make love with your wife] from the front or the back, but avoid the anus and intercourse during menstruation." (Reported by Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/technique.html | title=Sex Technique | publisher=islamawareness.net | accessdate=27 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721002113/http://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/technique.html | archivedate=21 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Sexual obligations ===
In Islam, the husband should have intercourse with his wife according to what satisfies her, so long as that does not harm him physically or keep him from earning a living. The husband is obliged to treat his wife in a kind and reasonable manner. Part of that kind and reasonable treatment is intercourse, which he has to do. The majority of scholars set the time limit beyond which it is not permissible for the husband to forego intercourse at four months, but according to some scholars, the view is that there is no time limit.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Qudaamah, Malik, [[Al-Mughni]], 7/30, Al-Jassaas, Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 1/374, Shaykh al-Islam, Al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the scholars have said that, It is obligatory on women alike not to refuse their husbands if they call them, so long as the woman who is called is not menstruating or sick in such a way that intercourse will be harmful to her, or observing an obligatory fast. If she refuses with no excuse, then she is cursed.&lt;ref&gt;al-Fataawa al-Islamiyyah, 3/145, 146, Kashf al-Qinaa’, 5/189, [[Al-Muhalla]], 10/40, Kashf al-Qinaa’, 5/189&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said: "If a man calls his wife to his bed, and she refuses to come, the angels curse her until morning comes."|al-Bukhari, 3065; Muslim, 1436.}}

But it is not permissible for a husband to force his wife to do more than she is able to bear of intercourse. If she has an excuse such as being sick or unable to bear it, then she is not sinning if she refuses to have intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/9602 | title=Her husband has strong desire; what should she do? | publisher=[[islamqa.info]] | work=Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid | accessdate=2 August 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811224131/http://islamqa.info/en/9602 | archivedate=11 August 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procreation===
In Islamic jurisprudence, the primary purpose of sex between marriage is [[procreation]].&lt;ref name=jawaz2/&gt; Islam recognizes the strong sexual urge and desire for reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Shahid Athar |title=Sex Education: An Islamic Perspective |url=https://www.islamicity.org/2191/sex-education-an-islamic-perspective/ |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. M.A. Rauf from his book 'Marriage in Islam'. In this excerpt, he discusses in great detail the advantages and possible disadvantages of marriage. Among the advantages that he discusses are procreation, fulfilment of the natural urge, companionship, comfort and relief to the soul, and so on. He also discusses the disadvantages and the types of burdens and risks involved with marriage. All of the advantages or benefits are in effect meant to be regarded as the secondary purpose of marriage which supplement its major aim or purpose, namely procreation. To beget children. This is the main purpose for marriage. The aim is to engender and preserve the human race. Four objectives are accomplished through procreation: - (i) to increase mankind (ii) Islam is propagated by increasing the number of followers of the prophet Muhammad (iii)parents will hope to leave behind children who will pray for them (iv) and According to Islamic belief, if a child dies before the parents, the prayers of the child in paradise will be very beneficial for the parents.&lt;ref name=jawaz2&gt;{{cite web |author1=Syed Mumtaz Ali &amp; Rabia Mills |title=Sex in Islam: Its Role and Purpose |url=https://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_mumtaz.html |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children born of the matrimonial union become legitimate and mutual rights of inheritance are established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Mohammad Mazhar Hussaini |authorlink1=Marriage and Family in Islam" by Mohammad Mazhar Hussaini |title=Purpose and obligation of marriage life |url=https://www.soundvision.com/article/purpose-and-obligation-of-marriage-life |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam also supposts a [[natalism|pro-natalist]] view of procreation through many hadith.

{{quote| Ma’qil ibn Yasaar said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “I have found a woman who is of good lineage and is beautiful, but she does not children. Should I marry her?” He said, “No.” Then he came again with the same question and he told him not to marry her. Then he came a third time with the same question and he said: “Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations.|Abu Dawood (2050)}}

This hadeeth indicates that it is encouraged to marry women who are fertile, so that the numbers of the ummah will increase, and so the Prophet Muhammad will feel proud of his [[Ummah|followers]] before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children.&lt;ref name="IQA2"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=Fiqh of the family. arur 13492: Encouragement to have a lot of children |url=https://islamqa.info/en/13492 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=8 October 2018 |date=5 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Narrated 'Abdullah: We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Messenger and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, "Shall we get ourselves castrated?" He forbade us that and then allowed us to marry women with a temporary contract (2) and recited to us: -- 'O you who believe ! Make not unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, but commit no transgression.' (5.87) Narrated Abu Huraira: I said, "O Allah's Messenger! I am a young man and I am afraid that I may commit illegal sexual intercourse and I cannot afford to marry." He kept silent, and then repeated my question once again, but he kept silent. I said the same (for the third time) and he remained silent. Then repeated my question (for the fourth time), and only then the Prophet said, "O Abu Huraira! The pen has dried after writing what you are going to confront. So (it does not matter whether you) get yourself castrated or not."|Bukhari, 4705}}

{{quote|the Messenger of Allah said: "Marriage is part of my sunnah, and whoever does not follow my sunnah has nothing to do with me.

{{quote|"The Messenger of Allah disapproved of Uthman bin Mazun's desire to remain celibate; if he had given him permission, we would have gotten ourselves castrated."|Ibn Majah, 1848}}

== Fornication and adultery ==
{{main|Zina}}

Just as Islamic law fosters sexual actions within a marriage or lawful concubinage with wholly owned female slaves, there is also judicial opinion concerning sexual relations outside of these institutions. These laws, however, observe much stricter restrictions. Additionally, these laws have textual confirmation from the Qur'an.
{{quote|Fornicatoress and fornicator flog each one of them one hundred lashes; and do not take pity on them in the application of God's law if you believe in God and last day; and their punishment should be witnesses by a party of believers. Fornicator does not marry except a fornicatoress or polytheist women; and fornicatoress no one marry her except fornicator or polytheist man;and it is prohibited to believers. And those who accuse chaste women and then never bring four witness flog them eighty lashes; and do not accept their testimony for ever; they themselves are disobedient. Except those who repent after this and become good then God is forgiving and merciful. And those who accuse their wives and do not have witness except themselves then witness of each of them are four witnesses by God that he is of truthfuls. And fifth that curse of God be on him if he is of lier. And it can save her from punishment that she witnesses by God four times that he is of liers. And fifth time that wrath of God be on her if he is of truthfuls. (al-Qur'an 24:2-9)}}

Verse 24:2-3 states that outside marriage and [[concubinage]], Islamic law prohibits sexual relations as ''zina'' [fornication]. Verse 24:2-3 establishes that male and female fornicators are to be flogged one-hundred times. According to Hadith, married male and female fornicators are to be stoned to death.&lt;ref name="Suad 2007 531"&gt;{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures |year=2007 |publisher=Brill, Leiden |location=Boston |page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, one practice outside marriage that does exist within Islamic law is legal sexual relations between a man and an unmarried female slave whom he owns. [[Malik ibn Anas]] cites a report in which "Umar b. al-Khattab says that when a female slave gives birth to a child by her master, then the slave becomes an ''umm walad'' (mother of a child, concubine)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia |year=2007 |publisher=Brill, Leiden |location=Boston |page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illegal sex (fornication) ===

Similar to laws that prohibit extramarital sexual relations, the Qur'an also stipulates categories of women with whom men are prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse. Verse 4:22-4 lists mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, [[wet nurse]]s, wet nurses' daughters, wives' mothers, daughters of wives from different fathers, wives of sons, and women already married.

Additionally, Verse 2:222 prohibits sexual relations with women during menstruation. Muhammad specifically restricts the injunction "to segregate the women" and "not go near them" in 2:222 to a prohibition against sexual relations with menstruating women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Pornography==
Pornography is considered haram and a clear sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsalam.net/10-reasons-muslim-quit-watching-pornography/|title=10 Reasons The Muslim Should Quit Watching Pornography|date=28 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102104315/http://www.gsalam.net/10-reasons-muslim-quit-watching-pornography/|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/166123|title=Her husband watches porn with the excuse of stress at work|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830004408/https://islamqa.info/en/166123|archivedate=2017-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran states: 
{{quote|“Tell the faithful men to cast down their looks and to guard their private parts ...Tell the faithful women to cast down their looks and to guard their private parts, and not to display their charms except what is apparent thereof and put their scarves over their bosoms...|(Quran, 24:30-31)}}

==Prostitution==
[[Prostitution]] is banned in Islam.&lt;ref name=pro&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/5707|title=The difference between slaves and prostitutes|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510161236/https://islamqa.info/en/5707|archivedate=2017-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quran states,

{{quote|And compel not your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste, in order to seek the frail goods of this world's life. And whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful..|{{cite quran|24|33|s=ns}}}}

Prostitution (trading sex for money) is haraam. If any does this then he shall be stoned to death. It was practiced by some Arabs during the 6th century. In the 7th century, [[Muhammad]] declared that prostitution is forbidden on all grounds.

{{quote|Jabir reported that 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul used to say to his slave-girl:
Go and fetch something for us by committing prostitution . It was in this connection that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:" And compel not your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste in order to seek the frail goods of this world's life, and whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful" (xxiv. 33).|{{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|43|7180}},{{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|43|7181}},{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|12|2304}}}}

Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
{{quote|The Prophet said: There is no prostitution in Islam. If anyone practised prostitution in pre-Islamic times, the child will be attributed to the master (of the slave-woman). He who claims his child without a valid marriage or ownership will neither inherit nor be inherited.|{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|12|2257}}}}

In [[Islam]], prostitution is considered a sin, and Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari is attributed with the saying: {{quote|"Allah's Apostle forbade taking the price of a dog, money earned by prostitution and the earnings of a soothsayer".|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|439}}}}

Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair:
{{quote|'Aishah, the wife of the Prophet told him that there were four types of marriage during Pre-Islamic period of Ignorance. One type was similar to that of the present day i.e. a man used to ask somebody else for the hand of a girl under his guardianship or for his daughter's hand, and give her Mahr and then marry her. The second type was that a man would say to his wife after she had become clean from her period. "Send for so-and-so and have sexual intercourse with him." Her husband would then keep awy from her and would never sleep with her till she got pregnant from the other man with whom she was sleeping. When her pregnancy became evident, he husband would sleep with her if he wished. Her husband did so (i.e. let his wife sleep with some other man) so that he might have a child of noble breed. Such marriage was called as Al-Istibda'. Another type of marriage was that a group of less than ten men would assemble and enter upon a woman, and all of them would have sexual relation with her. If she became pregnant and delivered a child and some days had passed after delivery, she would sent for all of them and none of them would refuse to come, and when they all gathered before her, she would say to them, "You (all) know what you have done, and now I have given birth to a child. So, it is your child so-and-so!" naming whoever she liked, and her child would follow him and he could not refuse to take him. The fourth type of marriage was that many people would enter upon a lady and she would never refuse anyone who came to her. Those were the prostitutes who used to fix flags at their doors as sign, and he who would wished, could have sexual intercourse with them. If anyone of them got pregnant and delivered a child, then all those men would be gathered for her and they would call the Qa'if (persons skilled in recognizing the likeness of a child to his father) to them and would let the child follow the man (whom they recognized as his father) and she would let him adhere to him and be called his son. The man would not refuse all that. But when Muhammad was sent with the Truth, he abolished all the types of marriages observed in pre-Islamic period of Ignorance except the type of marriage the people recognize today.|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|1|62|58}}}}

However, [[sexual slavery]] as concubinage was not considered prostitution and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] throughout the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]], when women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Slavery in Islam|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521234122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|archivedate=21 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]] tells us several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}. San Francisco Unified School District.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Shia]] Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah|fixed-term marriage]] – muta'a in [[Iraq]] and [[sigheh]] in [[Iran]] — which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in the Sahih al-Bukhari, Mut'ah marriage is classed as forbidden because [[Ali bin Abu Talib]] said that he heard Muhammad say that it is forbidden. 
As narrated by 'Ali bin Abu Talib: 
{{quote|"On the day of khaibar, Allah's Apostle forbade the Mut'a (i.e. temporary marriage) and the eating of donkey-meat."|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|527}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|9|86|91}}}}

Zaidi Shia texts also state that Ali said Mut'ah marriage was forbidden and for this reason the Zaidi Shia do not practise Mut'ah marriage.

==Gender non-conforming people==
{{main|LGBT in Islam|Mukhannathun}}
[[Mukhannathun]] (مخنثون "effeminate ones", "men who resemble women", singular mukhannath) were men who acted in ways interpreted as feminine. As time went on, the ''mukhannathun'' were forced to be castrated. There has been significant mention of "mukhannathun" in ahadith and by scholars of Islam. The word refers to a person who behaves like a woman in gentleness, speech, appearance, movements and so on. The mukhannath or effeminate man is one who is obviously male, unlike the khuntha (intersex). Effeminate people are of two types.
(i)Those who are created that way (intersex); there is no sin on them.
(ii)Those who were not created that way; rather they choose to imitate women in their movements and speech. This is the type which is cursed in the [[hadith]]s.&lt;ref name=intersexmarriage/&gt;
The following tradition speaks to the their behavior:
{{quotation|Narrated by Abdullah ibn Abbas: The Prophet cursed effeminate men; those men who are in the similitude (assume the manners of women) and those women who assume the manners of men, and he said, "Turn them out of your houses." The Prophet turned out such-and-such man, and 'Umar turned out such-and-such woman.|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|774}}}}
[[Sex change operation]] means that healthy males or females suffering from no deformity, who are able to marry and [[reproduce]], choose to undergo elective surgery to transform themselves into the appearance of the opposite sex. This kind of surgery is prohibited by [[Islamic Law]] because it is altering Allah’s creation needlessly and in vanity. Allah relates that [[Satan]] says:{{quotation| “And I shall order them and they will alter Allah’s creation.” |[Sûrah al-Nisâ’:119]}} 
It is also the most extreme form of imitating the opposite sex. Islamic prophet Muhammad said:&lt;ref name=islamtoday/&gt;
{{quote|“Allah curses men who imitate women and women who imitate men.”|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|773}}}}

==Intersex==
{{see|Intersex people and religion#Islam}}
An [[intersex]] person may have [[sex characteristics]] or [[sex organ|organs]] that are not typically male or female. This person is called a ''Khunthaa'' in the books of Fiqh.&lt;ref name=Khuntha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/81691|title=View on Transgender - IslamQA|date=9 May 2015|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507020847/http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/81691|archivedate=7 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of Khunthaa:

1. A person has aspects of both organs, and urinates from the male organ. This person will be included among the males and the laws regarding males will fall on him.

2. The person urinates from the female organ so will be included among the females. The laws related to females will fall on this person. This applies before the person reaches maturity. After maturity, the person will be rechecked. If he experiences wet dreams like a male then he will be counted as a male. On the other hand, if the person develops breasts and other signs of being feminine the she will be included among the females.

3. When both masculine and feminine signs are equal and it cannot be determined whether the person is more male or more female then such a person is termed Khunthaa Mushkil. There are different laws regarding such a person, a few examples: It is not permissible for a Khunthaa Mushkil to wear silk and jewellery. Both these are permissible for females. But because this person’s condition cannot be ascertained, so precaution demands that such a person not wear silk and jewellery, because of the possibility that the person may be more male. Such a person cannot travel without a Mahram because of the possibility of being more female. When this person dies, Ghusl will not be given because the question arises that who will render the Ghusl, male or female. The law is that this person will be given Tayammum. If a Ghayr Mahram is rendering the Tayammum then the person has to wear a cloth over the hands. A Mahram does not have to wear a cloth over the hands.&lt;ref name=Khuntha/&gt;

With regard to marriage of one who is intersex, if it is an unambiguous case, then according to how he or she is classified, he or she may marry someone of the opposite gender. If it is an ambiguous case, then the marriage of such a person cannot be valid, the reason being that he may be male, in which case how can he marry another male, or may be female, in which case she can't marry another female like her. If this individual is sexually attracted to females and claims to be a man, this is a sign that he is most likely male, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=intersexmarriage&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/114670|title=Ruling on marrying a man who is intersex or impotent, and the difference between them|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829203522/https://islamqa.info/en/114670|archivedate=2017-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intersex medical interventions]] are considered permissible to achieve agreement between a person’s exterior, [[chromosomal]] make-up or sex organs. They are regarded as treatment and not the altering of Allah’s creation or imitation of the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=islamtoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.islamtoday.net/node/1334|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107021853/http://en.islamtoday.net/node/1334|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-01-07|title=Sex change operation - IslamToday - English|website=en.islamtoday.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concubinage ==
{{main|Ma malakat aymanukum}}
{{See also|Islamic views on slavery#Sexual intercourse}}

Concubinage was a relationship between a man and an unmarried female slave whom he owns; the term refers to the status of the female. If she gives birth to a child by her master, the slave becomes ''umm walad'' ("mother of child", "concubine"). The [[Hanbali]] jurist [[Ibn Qudama]] explains that the father is not allowed to sell or transfer ownership of his concubine, though he is entitled to have sexual relations with her, to employ her service, to hire her out and to marry her. [[Ibn al-Humam]] adds that the slave-owner must acknowledge the kinship of the child.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

"Concubine" (''surriyya'') refers to the female slave (''jāriya''), whether Muslim or non-Muslim, with whom her master engages in sexual intercourse. The word "''surriyya''" is not mentioned in the Qur'an. However, the expression "[[Ma malakat aymanukum]]" (that which your right hands own), which occurs fifteen times in the sacred book, refers to slaves and therefore, though not necessarily, to concubines.{{additional citation needed|date=November 2016}} Concubinage was a pre-Islamic custom that was allowed to be practiced under Islam with Jews and non-Muslim people  to marry concubine after teaching her and instructing her well and then giving them  freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quranx.com/Hadith/adab/In-Book/Book-9/Hadith-48/ | title=Al-Adab Al-Mufrad / Book-9 / Hadith-48 | publisher=quranx.com | accessdate=7 June 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217062833/http://quranx.com/Hadith/adab/In-Book/Book-9/Hadith-48/ | archivedate=17 February 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Islamic jurisprudence sets limits on the master's right to sexual intercourse with his female slave. A man's ownership of his unmarried slave-girl gave him an exclusive right to have sex with her that he could not sell to others (in order to prevent prostitution of slaves). A man could own a limitless number of concubines, but could not have access to the slave-girls owned by his wife. Marriage between the master and his concubine was only possible if she was granted free status first. To avoid pregnancies, the master had the right to practice [[coitus interruptus]]. The birth of progeny would change the legal status of the concubine to that of ''umm al-walad'' ("mother of the child"); as such, the concubine could not then be sold. On the (lawful) death of her master, she would automatically acquire free status and her children would be considered free and legitimate.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

Surah [[Al-Muminun]] (23:6) and Surah [[Al-Maarij]] (70:30) both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and "those whom one's right hands possess" (female slaves), saying " أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ" (literally, "their spouses or what their right hands possess"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible. The purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, and this was the most common motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history.&lt;ref name="Brunschvig"&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, Brill, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

One rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that "it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]."&lt;ref name="Sikainga 1996 p22"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sikainga, Ahmad A. | title=Slaves Into Workers: Emancipation and Labor in Colonial Sudan | publisher=University of Texas Press | year=1996 | isbn=0-292-77694-2}} p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Most schools restrict concubinage to a relationship where the female slave is required to be monogamous to her master&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bloom, Jonathan |author2=Blair, Sheila | title=Islam: A Thousand Years of Faith and Power | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2002| isbn=0-300-09422-1}} p.48&lt;/ref&gt;  (though the master's monogamy to her is not required), but according to Sikainga, "in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for [male] members of their owners' household, their [owner's male] neighbors, and their [owner's male] guests."&lt;ref name="Sikainga 1996 p22"/&gt;

The history of slavery in Islamic states and of sexual relations with slaves, was the "responsibility of Muslims, and not of the Quran", according to Parwez,{{who|date=January 2017}} as quoted by Clarence-Smith.&lt;ref name=csp198&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=William|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195221516|pages=198–200|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=slavery+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=translation&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611073330/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=slavery+quran&amp;ots=CmLKAHzroo&amp;sig=qkVj_OulU-TNieKvSJk6ybw8NUc#v=onepage&amp;q=translation&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-06-11|df=|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Ali blamed the history of Islamic slavery in racist terms, states Clarence-Smith, stating that slave servitude and sexual abuse of captive slaves may have been because of degeneration of the Arabs from their admixing over time with "lower races such as Ethiopians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=William|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195221516|pages=199–201|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nQbylEdqJKkC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429200313/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;f=false|archivedate=2016-04-29|df=|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rape ==
{{main|Zina#Rape and zina|Rape in Islamic law}}
Rape is considered a serious sexual crime in Islam, and can be defined in Islamic law as: "Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent".&lt;ref name="Noor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noor|first1=Azman Mohd|title=Rape: A Problem of Crime Classification in Islamic Law|journal=Arab Law Quarterly|date=1 January 2010|volume=24|issue=4|pages=417–438|doi=10.1163/157302510X526724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Islamic law, it is classified as ''[[hirabah]]'', i.e. a violent crime causing disorder in the land in the manner described in the Qur'an as ''[[fasad]]'' (destructive mischief). A similar crime, for example, would be [[highway robbery]], as it puts fear in people going out or losing their property through violence. Some other branches of Islamic law consider it to be part of ''[[zina]]'', as a crime called "forced fornication" (''zina-bil-jabr''). In Sharia, rape is punishable by [[stoning]] to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]], [http://sunnah.com/ tirmidhi/17 17:37] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020025409/http://www.sunnah.com/ |date=2015-10-20 }}, {{Hadith-usc|abudawud|

Under Islam, sexual intercourse is regarded as a loving act within marriage and should only be by mutual consent.{{additional citation| date=January 2017}} There is, however, no explicit concept of rape within marriage in Sharia; a wife is deemed to have accepted conjugal relations as part of the marriage contract. She can only refuse on grounds which are specified as prohibited for sexual intercourse such as when she is fasting, menstruating, undergoing [[Postpartum period|post-natal puerperal discharge]], or whilst on [[Hajj]] or [[Umrah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Classical Islamic law defined what today is commonly called "rape" as a coercive form of fornication or adultery (''zināʾ'').&lt;ref name="Kassam"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0075 |title= The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Law |last=Kassam |first=Zayn |date= |website= |publisher= Oxford Islamic Studies Online |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113724/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0075 |archive-date= 2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |accessdate= 3 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic definition of rape as "coercive ''zināʾ''" meant that all the normal legal principles that pertained to ''zināʾ''{{spaced ndash}}its definition, punishment and establishment through evidence{{spaced ndash}}were also applicable to rape; the prototypical act of ''zināʾ'' was defined as sexual intercourse between a man and a woman over whom the man has neither a conjugal nor an ownership right.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt; Sane adult male and female convicted of ''zināʾ'' were to receive a fixed corporal punishment (''ḥadd''):

* One hundred lashes and exile for one year for unmarried free persons;
* Stoning to death for married or previously married free persons;

''Zināʾ'' was established, according to classical law, through confession by one or both parties as well as proof. A second type of evidence{{spaced ndash}}pregnancy in an unmarried/unowned woman{{spaced ndash}} was contested between the schools. The stringent evidentiary and procedural standards for implementing the zināʾ punishment may have functioned to offset the severity of the punishment itself, an effect that seems to have been intended by legal authorities, who in the early period developed legal maxims encouraging averting the ḥadd punishments as much as possible, whether through claiming ambiguity (shubhah) or a lack of legal capacity (ahliyya).&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt;

What distinguished a prototypical act of zināʾ from an act of rape, for the jurists, was that in the prototypical case, both parties act out of their own volition, while in an act of rape, only one of the parties does so. Jurists admitted a wide array of situations as being "coercive" in nature, including the application of physical force, the presence of duress, or the threat of future harm either to oneself or those close to oneself; they also included in their definition of "coercion" the inability to give valid consent, as in the case of minors, or mentally ill or unconscious persons. Muslim jurists from the earliest period of Islamic law agreed that perpetrators of coercive ''zināʾ'' should receive the ''ḥadd'' punishment normally applicable to their personal status and sexual status, but that the ḥadd punishment should not be applied to victims of coercive or nonconsensual ''zināʾ'' due to their reduced capacity.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt;

According to the Mālikī, Ḥanbalī, and Shāfiʾī schools of law, the rape of a free woman consisted of not one but two violations: a violation against a "right of God" (''ḥaqq Allāh''), provoking the ''ḥadd'' punishment; and a violation against a "human" (interpersonal) right (''ḥaqq ādamī''), requiring a monetary compensation. {{additional citation|date=January 2017}} These jurists saw the free woman, in her proprietorship over her own sexuality (''buḍʾ''), as not unlike the slave-owner who owns the sexuality of his female slave. For them, in the same way that the slave owner was entitled to compensation for sexual misappropriation, the free woman was also entitled to compensation. The amount of this compensation, they reasoned, should be the amount that any man would normally pay for sexual access to the woman in question {{spaced ndash}}that is, the amount of her dower (''ṣadāq'' or ''mahr''){{additional citation needed|date=January 2018}}.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt; As far as abortion in the context of rape, most jurist do not consider rape to be a valid reason: the sanctity of the new life takes precedence over the autonomy of the pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Moosa"/&gt;

However, some women{{which|date=February 2018}}in the middle east were arrested after they went to the police to report rapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38013351 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921194207/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38013351 |archivedate=2017-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the act is forbidden in the [[Islamic marriage contract]], a wife must abstain from it should her husband demand it and may seek divorce if her husband persists or tries to force it on her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 |title=When Husband Insists on Anal Sex with His Wife - ارشيف اسلام اونلاين |publisher= |accessdate=11 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054059/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 |archivedate=15 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act in itself, however, does not [[:wikt:nullify|nullify]] the marriage and the wife must seek divorce if she is to leave her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 |title=Anal Sex with the Wife: Does It Nullify Marriage? - ارشيف اسلام اونلاين |publisher= |accessdate=11 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054251/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 |archivedate=15 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim scholars justify the prohibition on the basis of the Qur'anic verse 2:223, saying that it commands intercourse only in the vagina (i.e. potentially procreational intercourse). The vaginal intercourse may be in any manner the couple wishes, that is, from behind or from the front, sitting or with the wife lying on her back or on her side.

There are also several ''hadith'' which prohibit sodomy.

Islamic law establishes two categories of legal, sexual relationships: between husband and wife, and between a man and his concubine. All other sexual relationships are considered ''zināʾ'' (fornication), including adultery and homosexuality, according to Islamic law and exegesis of the Qur'an. From the story of [[Lot in Islam|Lot]] it is clear that the Qur'an regards sodomy as an egregious sin. The death by stoning for people of Sodom and Gomorrah is similar to the stoning punishment stipulated for illegal heterosexual sex. There is no punishment for a man who sodomizes a woman because it is not tied to procreation. However, other jurists insist that any act of lust in which the result is the injecting of semen into another person constitutes sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

Sodomy often falls under that same category as sex between and unmarried man and women engaging in sexual acts. Male-male intercourse is referred to as ''liwat'' (literally, "joining") while female-female intercourse is referred to as ''sihaq'' (literally, "rubbing"). Both are considered reprehensible acts but there is no consensus on punishment for either. Some jurists define ''zināʾ'' exclusively as the act of unlawful vaginal penetration, hence categorizing and punishing anal penetration in different ways. Other jurists included both vaginal and anal penetration within the definition of ''zināʾ'' and hence extended the punishment of the one to the other.&lt;ref name="Omar"/&gt;
Religious discourse has mostly focused on sexual acts, which are unambiguously condemned. The Qur'an refers explicitly to male-male sexual relations only in the context of the story of Lot, but labels the Sodomites's actions (universally understood in the later tradition as anal intercourse) an "abomination" (female-female relations are not addressed). Reported pronouncements by Muhammad (''hadith'') reinforce the interdiction on male-male sodomy, although there are no reports of his ever adjudicating an actual case of such an offense; he is also quoted as condemning cross-gender behavior for both sexes, but it is unclear to what extent this is to be understood as involving sexual relations. Several early caliphs, confronted with cases of sodomy between males, are said to have had both partners executed, by a variety of means. While taking such precedents into account, medieval jurists were unable to achieve a consensus on this issue; some legal schools prescribed capital punishment for sodomy, but others opted only for a relatively mild discretionary punishment. There was general agreement, however, that other homosexual acts (including any between females) were lesser offenses, subject only to discretionary punishment.&lt;ref name="Rowson"/&gt;

Currently, sodomy is punishable by death in a number of Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia and Yemen, as well as in Nigeria's Sharia courts.&lt;ref name="Omar"/&gt;

==Oral sex==
{{main|Islamic views on oral sex}}
In Islam, [[oral sex]] between a husband and wife is considered "Makruh Tahrimi"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask The Scholar: What is meant by makruh?|url=http://askthescholar.com/question-details.aspx?qstID=1750|work=Shaik Ahmad Kutty|publisher=Ahmad Kutty|accessdate=7 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120709204156/http://askthescholar.com/question-details.aspx?qstID=1750|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or highly undesirable by some Islamic jurists when the act is defined as mouth and tongue coming in contact with the genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral Sex in Islam|url=http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/OralSexInIslam.htm|work=The Majlis|publisher=JamiatKZN, Central-Mosque.com|accessdate=7 July 2012|location=Vol. 6 No. 8|date=14 June 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614230937/http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/OralSexInIslam.htm|archivedate=14 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moulana Ismail Desai"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are partners allowed to lick each other's private parts?|url=http://www.askimam.org/public/question_detail/21483#_ftnref1|work=Mawlana Saeed Ahmed Golaub|publisher=Moulana Ismail  Desai|accessdate=9 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004191016/http://askimam.org/public/question_detail/21483#_ftnref1|archivedate=4 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind considering this act as not recommended is manifold, the foremost being the issue of modesty, purification ([[Ritual purity in Islam|Taharat]]) and cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions On Sexuality, Oral sex|url=http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e92.html#2|work=Living Islam|publisher=GF Haddad|accessdate=7 July 2012|author=Hajj Gibril|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620140054/http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e92.html#2|archivedate=20 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common argument states&lt;ref name="Moulana Ismail Desai"/&gt; that the mouth and tongue are used for recitation of the Qur'an and for the remembrance of Allah ([[Dhikr]]).&lt;ref name="rem allah 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembrance of Allaah|url=http://www.islaam.net/main/display.php?id=391&amp;category=134|work=Islamic Network.|publisher=Islamic Network.|accessdate=7 July 2012|author='Alî Abd-ur-Rahmân al-Hudhaifî|date=4 May 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415032643/http://www.islaam.net/main/display.php?id=391&amp;category=134|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of genital secretions is debated among the four Sunni schools, some scholars viewing it as impure and others not.

== Purification and hygiene ==
{{main|Islamic sexual hygienical jurisprudence}}

After partaking in sexual activity where penetration or ejaculation occurs, both men and women are required to complete a full-body ritual [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]] known as ''[[ghusl]]'' in order to re-establish ritual purity before prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali |first=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: feminist reflections on Qur'an, hadith, and jurisprudence |year=2006 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ghusl'' requires clean, odorless water that has not been used for a previous ritual and begins with the declaration of the intention of purity and worship.&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;{{cite web |last=Esposito |first=John |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e4 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=3 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114153249/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e4 |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Muslim performing complete ablution then washes every part of his or her body.&lt;ref name="Esposito"/&gt;

== Fasting and Ramadan ==

{{quote|It is made lawful to you to go into your wives on the night of the fast; they are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them; Allah knew that you acted unfaithfully to yourselves, so He has turned to you (mercifully) and removed from you (this burden); so now be in contact with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn, then complete the fast till night, and have not contact with them while you keep to the mosques; these are the limits of Allah, so do not go near them. Thus does Allah make clear His communications for men that they may guard (against evil).|{{cite quran|2|187|t=s|s=ns}}}}

According to Qura'nic verse 2:187, one may have sex during the month of Ramadan but not during the time of fasting. As such, sex during Ramadan is only permitted at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ahmad |first=Anis |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236MIW/e0667 |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113623/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236MIW/e0667 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this passage is explicitly addressed to men, the regulations on sex in regard to fasting are universally taken to apply equally to both male and female Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali |first=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: feminist reflections on Qur'an, hadith, and jurisprudence |year=2006 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Menstruation ==

{{quote|And they ask you about menstruation. Say: It is an illness; therefore keep aloof from the women during the menstrual discharge and do not go near them until they have become clean; then when they have cleansed themselves, go in to them as Allah has commanded you; surely Allah loves those who turn much (to Him), and He loves those who purify themselves.|{{cite quran|2|222|t=s|s=ns}}}}

Verse 2:222 in the Qur'an implies that sexual relations during menstruation are prohibited. However, unlike Jewish tradition, Islam does not forbid men from interacting with menstruating women entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joseph |first=Suad |title=Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures |year=2007 |publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Kathīr, a [[muhaddith]], narrated a hadith that describes Muhammad's habits with his menstruating wives. This hadith demonstrates that Muhammad gave license to all forms of spousal intimacy during the period of menstruation with the exception of vaginal intercourse. Women are required to perform ritual cleansing (''ghusl'') before resuming religious duties or sexual relations upon completion of her menstruation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baugh |first=Carolyn |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0965 |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908190008/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0965 |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nocturnal emission==
{{main|Nocturnal emission#Islamic view}}
Nocturnal emission is not a sin in Islam. Moreover, whereas a person fasting (in [[Ramadan]] or otherwise) would normally be considered to have broken their fast by ejaculating on purpose (during either masturbation or intercourse), nocturnal emission is not such a cause. They are still required to bathe prior to undergoing some rituals in the religion. Muslim scholars consider ejaculation something that makes one temporarily ritually impure, a condition known as [[junub]]; meaning that a [[Muslim]] who has had an orgasm or ejaculated must have a ''[[ghusl]]'', before they can read the [[Qur'an]] or perform the formal prayer known as [[salat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/9208|title=Coping with wet dreams|publisher=www.islampqa.info|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102104301/https://islamqa.info/en/9208|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Masturbation ==
{{main|Islam and masturbation}}
According to most jurists, masturbation is generally considered Haram or prohibited in Islam.&lt;ref name="Shia"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.al-islam.org/marriage-and-morals-islam-sayyid-muhammad-rizvi/chapter-three-islamic-sexual-morality-2-its#b-masturbation |chapter=3.

The Qur'an has been cited as being ambiguous on the issue of masturbation. The hadith regarding masturbation are, too, not considered to take a definitive stance on the subject. As such, positions on masturbation vary widely.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Omar |first=Sara |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114153420/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0011 |archivedate=2016-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to alDin Tarbiyyah, it is permissible if done out of necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Gender, and Social Change - Page 28, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad, John L. Esposito - 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He also permitted masturbation as a means whereby soldiers, far away from their wives on a tour of duty may remain chaste. The four [[Sunni]] schools of [[jurisprudence]] (known as Madhaahib - the ''Hanafi'', ''Shafi'i'', ''Maliki'' and ''Hanbali'' schools of ''Fiqh'') have differing stances on the issue. Some see it forbidden in certain cases (i.e. if it leads a man/woman to ignore their spouse sexually) but recommended it when they see it as a lesser evil to illicit sex. It is generally prohibited according to the [[Hanafi]] and [[Hanbali]] Mazhabs, unless one fears adultery or fornication, or is under the desire pressure, in which case, it is permissible to seek a relief through masturbation. According to Ahmed ibn Hanbal, it is permissible for prisoners, travellers and for men and women who have difficulty in finding a lawful spouse.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is prohibited all the time according to the [[Maliki]] and [[Shafi`i]] Mazhabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nikah.com/marriage/islam_part1.asp Marriage in Islam - Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127060711/http://nikah.com/marriage/islam_part1.asp |date=2010-11-27 }} by Hussein Khalid Al-Hussein, Ph.D. Refer to: Section Al-`Alaqat Al-Mubahah (Allowed Relationships)&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[haram]] in [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] jurisprudence.&lt;ref name= "Shia"/&gt; There has always been a view to permit masturbation as the lesser of two evils (so as to ward of falling into fornication).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Inhorn |first=Marcia |title=Masturbation, Semen Collection and Men's IVF Experiences: Anxieties in |journal=Body &amp; Society |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is categorically incorrect to state that all Islamic scholars of the early Islamic age have unanimously agreed upon its complete prohibition. Jurists distinguish between those who masturbate out of necessity and those who have these means yet still masturbate to gratify their lust.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

== Contraception ==

The Qur'an does not contain explicit text regarding contraception. Muslims refer to the hadith on the question of contraception. According to Muslim scolars, birth control is permitted, when it is temporary and for a valid reason.&lt;ref name="amjaonline"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Hatem al-Haj |title=Fatwa-76792 -  Getting my tubes tied: female sterilization |url=http://www.amjaonline.org/fatwa-76792/info |website=www.amjaonline.org |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companions of Muhammad are cited when addressing this issue. For example, Jabir, one of Muhammad's companions, relates a hadith in which a man came to Muhammad and said {{Quote|"I have a slave girl, and we need her as a servant and around the palm groves. I have had sex with her, but I am afraid of her becoming pregnant." The Prophet responded, ″Practice [[coitus interruptus]] with her if you so wish, for she will receive what has been predestined for her.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sachedina |first=Zulie |title=Islam, Procreation and the Law |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |year=1990 |volume=16 |issue=3 |jstor=2133308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} As such, the withdrawal method of contraception is allowed according to the hadith. Muslim jurists concur with its permissibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali |first=Kecia |title=Sexual ethics and Islam: feminist reflections on Qur'an, hadith, and jurisprudence |year=2006 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use analogical deduction to approve other forms of contraception (e.g. [[condom]] usage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Esposito |first=John |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e358 |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201230901/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e358 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting [[Sunnah]] include:

{{Quote|A man said: "Apostle of Allah, I have a slave-girl and I withdraw from her (while having intercourse), and I dislike that she becomes pregnant. I intend (by intercourse) what the men intend by it. The Jews say that withdrawal method (Al-azl) is like burying the living girls on a small scale." He (the Prophet) said: "The Jews told a lie. If Allah intends to create it, you cannot turn it away."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|11|2166}}&lt;/ref&gt;|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|11|2166}}}}

{{Quote|"O Allah's Apostle! We get female captives as our share of booty, and we are interested in their prices, what is your opinion about coitus interruptus?" The Prophet said, "Do you really do that? It is better for you not to do it. No soul that which Allah has destined to exist, but will surely come into existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|432}}&lt;/ref&gt;|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|432}}}}
===Sterilization===
It is not permitted to carry out operations on men or women that will lead to complete sterility, such as cutting the vas deferens ([[vasectomy]]) in men, or removing the ovaries or womb ([[hysterectomy]] or [[Tubal ligation|ligation]]) in women. Irreversible methods of contraception and birth control called [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] are not allowed for both male and female, except in the case of the wife who becomes terminally ill and perpetually incapable of having babies.&lt;ref name="Iqainfo-sterility"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=Ruling on surgery that causes sterility |url=https://islamqa.info/en/2160 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=13 September 2018 |date=1998-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if the sterilization is irreversible and cannot be undone, it will not be permissible unless the woman is terminally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Yusuf Laher |title=Are Muslim women allowed to have sterilization? |url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/44911 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=IQS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under normal circumstances, sterilization is considered to be absolutely and decidedly prohibited in Shari’ah. The irreversible nature associated with both the male and female sterilizations clearly contradicts one of the primary purposes of marriage which is to have children, as mentioned by [[Abu Hamid al-Ghazali]] in his [[Ihya’ Ulum al-Din]]. 
Furthermore, sterilization is a form of mutilation of one’s body (muthla), which has been clearly forbidden in the Shari’ah. Allah Most High mentions in [[An-Nisa]] the words of [[Satan]], when he said:

{{Quote|“I will mislead them, and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle and to deface the (fair) nature created by Allah.”|[[An-Nisa]]:119}}

However, in cases of absolute necessity, sterilization does become permitted. The well-known principle of Islamic jurisprudence based on the guidelines of the Qur’an and Hadith states: {{Quote|“Necessities make prohibitions lawful.”| (Ibn Nujaym, Al-Ashbah wa al-Naza’ir 85)}}&lt;ref name="DI"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Muhammad ibn Adam |title=Permanent Contraception (Female Sterlisation) - Does Intention affect Permissibility? |url=http://www.daruliftaa.com/node/5114?txt_QuestionID |website=[[Darul Ifta]] |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=02-08-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being sterilized permanently may mean one of two things: 
# – It may be done out of necessity, such as if it is determined by trustworthy medicinal evidence that pregnancy will pose a danger to the mother’s life, and there is no hope of a cure, so permanent sterilization will ward off that danger. In this case it is permissible to be sterilized. 
# – When there is no need for it. Undoubtedly in this case it is a criminal act and a major sin, because it is a transgression against the creation of Allaah for no reason, and preventing the production of offspring which was encouraged by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and being ungrateful for the blessing of children which Allaah bestows upon His creation. And it is not permissible to do anything that will put a stop to pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;It says in al-Insaaf: It says in al-Faa’iq (1/383).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Islamic Fiqh Council]] stated the following: 

{{Quote|It is haraam to sterilize both men and women, if there is no necessary reason for doing so unless there is a necessity which is to be determined according to the guidelines set out by sharee’ah. It is permissible to take temporary measures to space pregnancies or prevent them for a limited period of time, if there is a legitimate shar’i need to do so, so long as this decision is made on the basis of mutual consultation and approval between the spouses. That is subject to the condition that no harm should result from that, and that the means should be acceptable according to sharee’ah, and that there should be no harm caused to an existing pregnancy.|Islamic Fiqh Council, report no. 39 (1/5)}}

Based on this, if preventing pregnancy is for a legitimate reason as outlined above, then there is nothing to do anything. But if it was not for a necessary reason, then sterilizing is prohibited.&lt;ref name="IQA3"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=She had injections to make her infertile – what is the ruling on that? |url=https://islamqa.info/en/47196 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=2004-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iqs"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid]] |title=Ruling on having one’s tubes tied or having a hysterectomy because pregnancy exhausts her and temporary methods of contraception do not work for h |url=https://islamqa.info/en/258382 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castration==
[[Castration]] is removal of the testicles. The Arabic word translated here as castration may also refer to removal of the testicles and penis. Some scholars differentiated between the two and said: If his testicles only are cut off, then he is a eunuch; if his penis is cut off, then he is emasculated. 
It is prohibited for a person to do that deliberately to himself or to someone else. Castration of the human is prohibited in Islam, whether he is a child or an adult, because of the prohibition on hadith on that.&lt;ref name="IQA.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Is Castration Permissible? |url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/mahmoodiyah/53845 |website=Islamqa.org |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=20 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Hajar]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} said:
{{quote|it is prohibited, therefore it is haraam, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that in the case of the sons of Adam (i.e., humans).}} 
Among the reports that confirm this prohibition is the following prophet Muhammad's era, when some followers wanted to be castrated in abstance of their wives, but the prophet forbade it and permitted three days [[Nikah mut'ah|temporary marriage]] for them for a certain period, but after the period he declered it permanently forbidden: 

{{quote|Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) reported: We were on an expedition with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we had no women with us. We said: Should we not have ourselves castrated? He (the Holy Prophet) forbade us to do so He then granted us permission that we should contract temporary marriage for a stipulated period giving her a garment, and 'Abdullah then recited this verse: 'Those who believe do not make unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Allah does not like trangressers" (al-Qur'an, v. 87).|[[Sahih Bukhari]], Chapter: 62, Hadith no: 11, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1404}}}}

{{quote|Sabra al-Juhanni reported on the authority of his father that while he was with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon hm) he said: 0 people, I had permitted you to contract temporary marriage with women, but Allah has forbidden it (now) until the Day of Resurrection. So he who has any (woman with this type of marriage contract) he should let her off, and do not take back anything you have given to then (as dower).|[[Sahih Muslim]]: Book 008, Number 3255}}

[[Ibn Hajar]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} said, commenting on these hadiths: 

The reason behind the prohibition on castration is that it is contrary to what the Lawgiver wants of increasing reproduction to ensure continuation of struggle against the [[Kafir|disbelievers]]. Otherwise, if permission had been given for that, then many people would have done that, and reproduction would have ceased, and the numbers of Muslims would have become less as a result, and the numbers of non-muslims would have increased, and that is contrary to the religious purpose.&lt;ref name="IQAC"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid]] |title=126987: The ruling on castration |url=https://islamqa.info/en/126987 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |date=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In vitro fertilization==
Regarding the response to [[In Vitro Fertilization]] (IVF) of [[Islam]], the conclusions of Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak's ART fatwa include that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://vlex.com/vid/fatwas-ivf-gamete-sunni-shia-islam-418643 | last = Inhorn | first = MC | title = Making Muslim babies: IVF and gamete donation in Sunni versus Shi'a Islam | journal = Cult Med Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 427–50 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17051430 | pmc = 1705533 | doi = 10.1007/s11013-006-9027-x | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090624121701/http://vlex.com/vid/fatwas-ivf-gamete-sunni-shia-islam-418643 | archivedate = 2009-06-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*IVF of an egg from the wife with the sperm of her husband and the transfer of the fertilised egg back to the uterus of the wife is allowed, provided that the procedure is indicated for a medical reason and is carried out by an expert physician.
*Since marriage is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, whether he or she is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to ''zina'', or [[adultery]].

== Abortion ==
{{main|Islam and abortion}}

Islamic schools of law have differing opinions on abortion, though it is prohibited or discouraged by most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sachedina |first=Zulie |title=Islam, Procreation and the Law |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |year=1990 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, abortion is allowed under certain circumstances, such as if the mother's health is [seriously] threatened. If the abortion is necessary to save the woman's life, Muslims universally agree that her life takes precedence over the life of the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donna Lee |last=Bowen |chapter=Contemporary Muslim Ethics of Abortion |editor-first=Jonathan E. |editor-last=Brockopp |title=Islamic ethics of life: abortion, war, and euthanasia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=agqtUUoOgQoC |year=2003 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001185028/https://books.google.com/books?id=agqtUUoOgQoC&amp;PA=88 |archivedate=2015-10-01 |df= |isbn=9781570034718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim jurists allow abortion in this context based on the principle that what is considered the greater evil{{spaced ndash}}the woman's death{{spaced ndash}}should be warded off by accepting the lesser evil of abortion. In these cases, the physician is considered a better judge than the scholar. Abortions of pregnancies that are merely unplanned or unwanted are generally ''haram'' (forbidden). The Qur'an forbids the abortion of a fetus for fear of poverty:

{{quote|...kill not your children on a plea of want; We provide sustenance for you and for them|{{cite quran|6|151|s=ns}}}}
{{quote|Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you: verily the killing of them is a great sin.|{{cite quran|17|31|s=ns}}}}

Muslim views on abortion are also shaped by the [[Hadith]] as well as by the opinions of legal and religious scholars and commentators. In Islam, the fetus is believed to become a living soul after four months of gestation,&lt;ref&gt;"''(The matter of the Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is ordered to write four things...then the soul is breathed into him''"&lt;br&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|54|430}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abortion after that point is generally viewed as impermissible. Many Islamic thinkers recognize exceptions to this rule for certain circumstances; indeed, [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]] notes that "the majority of Muslim scholars permit abortion, although they differ on the stage of fetal development beyond which it becomes prohibited."&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-13-forum-abortion_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |title=Where does God stand on abortion? |first=Tom |last=Ehrich |date=August 13, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627035106/http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-13-forum-abortion_x.htm |archivedate=June 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sherman Jackson]], "while abortion, even during the first trimester, is forbidden according to a minority of jurists, it is not held to be an offense for which there are criminal or even civil sanctions," so Muslims should not support legal restrictions on abortion rights unsupported by Islamic law, as opposed to solely moral activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Sherman A. |last=Jackson |chapter=Blackamerica, Immigrant Islam, and the Dominant Culture |title=Islam and the Blackamerican&lt;!-- Sic --&gt;: Looking Toward the Third Resurrection |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nprKYM8sleYC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |page=151 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426033404/https://books.google.com/books?id=nprKYM8sleYC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2016-04-26 |df= |isbn=9780195343571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Muslim scholars hold that the child of rape is a legitimate human being and therefore subject to the same laws of abortion (i.e. its abortion is permitted only if the fetus is less than four months old, or if it endangers the life of its mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/131275 | title=Her foetus died after 66 days gestation and was miscarried after 100 days. Is her bleeding nifaas? | publisher=Islamqa.info | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724210816/http://islamqa.info/en/131275 | archivedate=24 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some scholars disagree with this position. Some Muslim scholars{{who|date=October 2016}} also argue that abortion is permitted if the newborn might be sick in some way that would make its care exceptionally difficult for the parents (e.g. deformities, mental retardation, etc.).&lt;ref name="VRC"&gt;{{cite book |first=Vardit |last=Rispler-Chaim |chapter=The Right Not To Be Born: Abortion of the Disadvantaged Fetus in Contemporary Fatwas |editor-first=Jonathan E. |editor-last=Brockopp |title=Islamic ethics of life: abortion, war, and euthanasia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=agqtUUoOgQoC |year=2003 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |pages=87–88 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001185028/https://books.google.com/books?id=agqtUUoOgQoC&amp;PA=88 |archivedate=2015-10-01 |df= |isbn=9781570034718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2016}}{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

A '''Kee Klamp''' is a [[structural pipe fitting]] commonly used in the construction of handrails and barriers. Fabricated installations comprise the fittings and separate [[structural tubing|tubing]] components, which can be sized on site.

The system was devised in 1934 and is made by a subsidiary of [[KIG Holdings]]. The fittings are mostly supplied to third parties for sale to fabricators, with a small proportion of sales being made internally to specialist divisions of the company.

== History ==

Some cutting or [[tube bending|bending]] of the tubes may be required while installing the system, according to site-specific circumstances. Skilled labourers such as welders are not required, but the material costs are higher for the Kee Klamp system.&lt;ref name="oft 2003"&gt;{{cite web|title=Completed acquisition by KIG Ltd of FastMat Ltd and Access Technologies Ltd |url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/mergers/mergers_fta/mergers_fta_advice/kig |work=ME/1056/03 |publisher=[[Office of Fair Trading]] |accessdate=12 July 2012 |date=21 May 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529070102/http://oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/mergers/mergers_fta/mergers_fta_advice/kig |archivedate=29 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A contractor at the [[Long Island Rail Road]] described the system in 2007 as being "very simple to install".&lt;ref name="ehstoday 2007" /&gt;

In 2003, the company and a former competitor stated that such fittings were not being used in some countries in Europe, in favour of welding. This was due to lower labour costs. For uncomplicated installations, welding may be a cheaper solution than Kee Klamp, depending upon usage.&lt;ref name="oft 2003" /&gt;

== Market dominance ==

In 2003, the system dominated the UK and EU markets, with a share of {{nowrap|70{{ndash}}80 per cent}}. (The fittings market was worth {{nowrap|£5{{ndash}}8 million}} in the UK in 2003.) The premium branding the product is said to hold is due to KIG offering [[incremental services]].&lt;ref name="oft 2003" /&gt; Some customers inherently prefer using such fittings, while others prefer welding.&lt;ref name="oft 2003" /&gt; The choice of system is often made during initial design of an installation.&lt;ref name="oft 2003" /&gt;

The system is marketed for specific uses under various names, including a low-cost brand called Tubeclamp. Specialist divisions of the company exist which fabricate finished structures, although such internal sales of the fittings constitute only a fraction of total fittings sales.&lt;ref name="oft 2003" /&gt;

Between 1998 and 2003, volumes of Kee Klamp sales increased. The value of total annual sales remained static throughout this period, associated with an overall price reduction of {{nowrap|20{{ndash}}30 per cent}}. During this period, the price reduction of a complete system including the tube components was {{nowrap|5{{ndash}}10 per cent}}.&lt;ref name="oft 2003" /&gt;

A business acquisition by KIG of {{nowrap|[[no frills]]}} competitor FastMat (a subsidiary of [[Access Technologies]]) in 2003 led to a report being filed with the UK's [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]] under the [[Fair Trading Act 1973]]. The report concluded that the merger should not be referred to the [[Competition Commission]] due to the relatively inexpensive cost of entry to the market by others. Most suppliers of competing products to the UK import their fittings from low-cost [[Far East]] contract manufacturers.&lt;ref name="oft 2003" /&gt;

The '''Mahamuni Buddha Temple''' ({{lang-my|မဟာမုနိဘုရားကြီး}}, {{IPA-my|məhà mṵnḭ pʰəjádʑí}}; also called the '''Mahamuni Pagoda''') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple and major pilgrimage site, located southwest of [[Mandalay]], [[Myanmar (Burma)]] (Myanmar).&lt;ref name= Reid&gt;{{Cite book|last=Reid|first=Robert|author2=Michael Grosberg|title=Mahamuni Pagoda, Mandalay|page=234|accessdate=2010-03-22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MZwU0SNKchoC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=Mahamuni+Buddha&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AdumS7HKLJC3rAeUyOjyCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Mahamuni%20Buddha&amp;f=false|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2005|isbn=978-1-74059-695-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahamuni Buddha image (literal meaning: The Great Sage) is deified in this temple, and originally came from [[Rakhine State|Arakan]].&lt;ref name= Keown&gt;{{Cite book|last=Keown|first=Damien|title=A dictionary of Buddhism|work=Mahamuni Paya and Mahamuni temple|pages=164–165|accessdate=2010-03-24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=985a1M7L1NcC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=Mahamuni+Buddha+Temple&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uAinS5WQKIGzrAen-9HKCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=Mahamuni%20Buddha%20Temple&amp;f=false|publisher= Oxford University Press US|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-860560-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly venerated in Burma and central to many people's lives, as it is seen as an expression of representing the Buddha's life.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, p.1351&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
According to legend, the [[Gautama Buddha]]  visited [[Dhanyawadi]], the capital city of Arakan during his travels on a [[Proselytization]] mission to spread Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Daw"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Buddhist art of ancient Arakan: an eastern border state beyond ancient India, east of Vanga and Samatata|publisher=Volume 43, Issue 4 of Burmese cultural microfilm collection, Daw Saw Saw|year=1979|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 26th anniversary of the King at the time, a devout Buddhist, the Buddha accompanied by Shin Ananda and 500 disciples&lt;ref name="Daw"/&gt; landed at Salagiri mountain peak near Khaukrah town.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt; The King of Arakan, along with his Chief Queen Sandra Mala (with her retinue of 1,600 ladies in waiting), and an entourage of ministers, generals and officials, paid homage to the Buddha.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; They were deeply moved by his teachings and upon his departure to Thawuthi ([[Sravasti]]), the King insisted that he leave his image for people to worship.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; For this purpose, the Buddha then sat under a [[Bodhi tree]] for a week of meditation.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; During this time [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]] (in [[Pāli]], the ruler of the [[Trāyastriṃśa]] Heaven in [[Buddhist cosmology]], supported by his assistant Vissakamma, moulded a lifelike image of the Buddha using ornaments donated by the king and his people.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; It is also said that Sakka and Vissakamma (or Vishvakarman) created a separate pavilion for the Buddha to live and enjoy during these seven days.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; After looking at his own lifelike image, believed at the time to have been his only true-likeness,&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha was pleased and "imbued the image with his spiritual essence", or "enlivened and consecrated" the image, naming it "Candasara".&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt; He also stated that the image would last for five thousand years as his representative.&lt;ref name=legend/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aung&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aung |first=Myo|author2=H.Kraft|title= Upper Myanmar Mandalay Pyin Oo Lwin Sagaing Monywa Mingun Mogok Shwebo|work=Mahamuni Buddha|pages=4–5|accessdate=2010-03-24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zt2T_QO6OtAC&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=Mahamuni+Buddha+Pagoda,+Mandalay&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Sr-pS7C2INKfrAf25dGmAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true|publisher= Books on Asia|isbn=9789749290859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.268"&gt;Schober, p.268&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Juliane Schober has very succinctly explained this legend and the cult worship that has evolved around the "living" double image of Mahamuni Buddha:
{{clear}}
{{quotation|The rich and complex mythology associated with this image includes episodes that parallel other stories about the Buddha...The rituals and myths of Mahamuni thus accomplish two aims simultaneously: they place local contexts and actors within a universal Buddhist cosmology, and they locate a continuing biography of the Buddha in the Buddhist politics of Arakan and Upper Burma. [[Theravada]] politics characteristically extended the biographical mode of recreating the Buddha's presence and associated with it the power of kings and other patrons of this image. The veneration of this Buddha image is thus informed by local conceptions of religious patronage in sociopolitical domains.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.260"&gt;Schober, p.260&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Buddha in Sarnath Museum (Dhammajak Mutra).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Gautama Buddha]]]]
Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle relates to the nine phenomena that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; the water from the tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt in the direction of the Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.269"&gt;Schober, p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|The large bronze statues.jpg|160|The large Bronze Figures.jpg|175|Left: Large bronze statues believed to have healing powers when rubbed. Right: [[Airavata]]–Three headed Elephant and other statues of [[Shiva]].}}
Another legend narrated is linked to the six [[Cambodia|Khmer]] bronze statues (three lions–with heads substituted later in Burmese style, a three-headed elephant known as [[Airavata]], and two warriors in the form of [[Shiva]]), which are installed in the temple in the northern end of the courtyard. These statues were originally at the [[Angkor Wat]] temple complex in [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref name= "Abbott, p.33"&gt;Abbott, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Devotees believe that the statues have healing qualities to rub a particular part of the body against the statues to cure themselves of various ailments and diseases.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;&lt;ref name=legend/&gt;

===Image history===

[[File:Prince Thado Minsaw.JPG|thumb|left|[[Thado Minsaw]], Crown Prince and son of [[Bodawpaya]] carried off the Mahamuni to Mandalay.]]

In the ancient history of Arakan, King [[Anawratha]] of [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan]] (r. 1044–1077) attempted to move the image to [[Bagan|Pagan]], without success.&lt;ref name= "Schober p.260"&gt;Schober p.260&lt;/ref&gt; In 1784, the [[Bamar|Burmese]] under the military leadership of Crown Prince [[Thado Minsaw]] of [[Konbaung dynasty]] conquered the Kingdom of [[Mrauk U]].&lt;ref name=rlf-109&gt;{{cite book | title=The River of Lost Footsteps--Histories of Burma | author=Thant Myint-U | pages=109–110 | year=2006 | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | isbn=978-0-374-16342-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious relics of the kingdom, including the Mahamuni Buddha image, were confiscated and installed in the Mahamuni temple or Pagoda at [[Amarapura]], on the outskirts of the old capital of Mandalay. As the Mahamuni image was too large to transport as a whole, it was cut into sections and later reassembled and housed in the new temple.&lt;ref name= "Schober p.266"&gt;Schober p.266&lt;/ref&gt;  Mandalay became the capital under King [[Mindon Min|Min]]don (r. 1853–1878).&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, p.685&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the capital under his son [[Thibaw Min|Thibaw]] (r. 1878–1885) of the [[Konbaung Dynasty]] (1752–1885). When the British annexed Upper Burma in 1885 to prevent the French from dominating it, monarchic rule ended.&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; However, veneration of the Mahamuni image has continued, and is visited and idolised by many pilgrims, mainly [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]], [[Mon people|Mon]] and [[Bamar|Burmans]] peoples.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.260-261"&gt;Schober, p.260-261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fink&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fink|first=Christina|title= Living silence: Burma under military rule

Several old bronze statues that line the courtyard of the temple have a long history as war loot. They were originally [[Khmer architecture|Khmer statues]], found at [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]], and were taken to [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] in 1431 by the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siamese]].&lt;ref name= "Abbott, p.33"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vella, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Greenwood, p.128"&gt;Greenwood, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; In 1564, the Burmese king [[Bayinnaung]] conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to [[Bago, Burma|Bago]] (Pegu).&lt;ref name= "Greenwood, p.128"/&gt;&lt;ref name=geh&gt;{{cite book | last=Harvey | first=G.E. | title=History of Burma | page=168 | chapter=Toungoo Dynasty: IIIrd Siege of Ayuthia | year=1925 | publisher=Frank Cass &amp; Co.

They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;

===Damage===
[[File:Mahamuni.JPG|right|thumb|A statue of Maha Muni Buddha or Maha Myat Muni Paya or Rakhine Paya or Payagyi enshrined in a temple/pagoda at [[Mandalay]].]]
The Mahamnuni image and its precincts suffered damage from fires in 1879 and 1884.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"&gt;Schober, p.263&lt;/ref&gt; In the fire that broke out during the reign of King Thibaw, the seven-tiered spire on the brick temple, devotional halls, causeways and others were burnt down, although the Great Image itself was saved. Gold recovered after the fire was made into a robe that currently adorns the image. In 1887, Minister [[Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung]] took charge of the site and in 1896 constructed the present temple around the original shrine built by King Bodawpaya.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;

In 1996, the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council|military rulers]] in Burma undertook renovation work on the Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared in the belly of the Great Image.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"&gt;Fink, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt;

==Architecture==

===Main Temple/Pagoda===
{{double image|right|Mahamuni Pagoda.jpg|205|Freshly painted - Maha Muni.jpg|230|Mahamuni pagoda}}
The Mahamuni Temple or Pagoda is a complex of structures located along a road from Mandalay leading to the southwest. It was originally located on A brick paved road which was constructed from the Royal Palace of King [[Bodawpaya]] to the eastern gate of the temple, although only remnants of this road can still be seen.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt; A major teaching monastery of some 400 monks of the [[Thudhamma Nikaya]] (order), is one among the many monasteries which are adjacent to the Pagoda. The temple has a central shrine and is framed by an extensive grass lawn. The arcades leading to the main shrine have many kiosks, selling religious paraphernalia such as incense, candles, rosaries, flowers, robes, sandals etc., and various restaurants and tea shops. The [[sanctum sanctorum]], where the large Mahamuni image is deified, is a small chamber and has a roof covering made up of seven ''[[pyatthat]]'' meaning tiered roofs (derivative of the [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]] word ''prasada'').&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt;&lt;ref name=palace&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=619905|title=The Reconstruction of  Mandalay Palace: An Itermi Report on Aspects of Design|publisher=|quote=...epitomized by tiered roofs, the ''pya-that'' found in both royal and religious architecture. It comes from the Sanskrit ''prasada'', a palatial building often with multiple roofs.|volume=56|pages=335–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceiling has an ornate mosaic covering. The arcades are supported by 252 gilded and carved columns adorned with fine frescoes.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt;

}}
The Mahamuni Buddha image is housed in a  small chamber, seated on a throne in a divine posture known as the ''Bhumisparsa [[Mudra]]''. This posture or mudra symbolises Buddha's vanquishing of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]). The legs are crossed with feet turned inwards, and the right hand touches the ground ritualistically, as a witness of his past deeds.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt; The image is cast in [[bronze]] and weighs 6.5 tonnes and is erected on a {{convert|1.84|m|ft}} high pedestal and reaches a height  of {{convert|3.82|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; Its shoulders measure {{convert|1.84|m|ft}} and its waist measures {{convert|2.9|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; It is draped in royal costumes with "Brahmanic cords (''[[salwe]]'') and regalia crossing his chest".&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; The image is crowned, bejewelled with [[diamond]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]] and [[sapphire]]s. The left hand appears imprecise, unusually large, and is seen resting in the lap with an upturned palm.

[[Gold leaf|Gold leaves]] are regularly applied to the face of the Mahamuni Buddha by male devotees. Consequent to the frequent application of gold leaves, the coating of gold (thickness {{convert|15|cm|in}}) has given a shapeless contour to the Mahamuni image. However, it is also noted that the right hand, crown and other iconographic characteristics of royalty are free of gold leaf covering, which gives an impression that these were later additions to the original image of the Mahamuni.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mara/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pagoda&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myokyawhtun.com/photo-gallery/mahamuni-buddha.html|title=Mahamuni Pagoda|accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, when the pagoda was burnt down, {{convert|91|kg|lbs}} of gold was recovered from the site, which represents the continued historical veneration and perpetuation of the cult of Mahamuni.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other features===
[[File:Sacred fish pond @ Maha Muni.jpg|thumb|left| Sacred fish and tortoise pond near the Mahamuni Pagoda.]]
A large number of 'inscription stones' collected by King Bodawpaya are seen in a long gallery in the southeastern corner of the temple courtyard. These inscriptions, some of which are made from gilded marble and sandstone, have been collected from many regions of the country.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pagoda/&gt; There is also a large water tank in the southeast direction of the temple where fish and turtles are fed with [[rice cake]]s by the large number of pilgrims who visit the temple every day.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt; Adjacent to the Buddha temple is the Mahamuni Museum, which contains displays of Buddhism throughout [[Asia]].

==Daily rituals==
{{double image|right|Mahamuni Buddha (1).jpg|200|Mahamuni Buddha (2).jpg|200|Left: Early morning ritual of face wash to Mahamuni Buddha. Right: Early morning brushing the teeth of Mahamuni Buddha.}}
On February 17, 1988, the present Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of [[Htilin Monastery]] and Pitaka Kyaung initiated the ritual of daily face washing of the deity at dawn. This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4:30 am when [[monks]] wash the face and brush the teeth of the Buddha image.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt; It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire, assisted by several lay helpers, dressed in white and wearing formal headdress. As soon as the drums are struck, the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels, offered by devotees. He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; After this, [[sandalwood]] paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water. After the ceremony is completed, the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;

On special occasions, such as [[Uposatha]] day, an orange stole is placed around its shoulders by the presiding monk and is fanned.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.264"&gt;Schober, p.264&lt;/ref&gt; A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals; some men sit in the front enclosure while others including women and children sit in the middle and rear end of the foyer. Devotees offer food and other items brought by them on a tray to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt; During the winter season, the image is covered by a cloak of the monastic order.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.264"/&gt;

During the reign of Burmese monarchs, offerings were made daily to the Great Image in a formal way. Food and other offerings, sheltered by a Royal white umbrella, were taken in a procession from the palace, escorted by a Minister, as an honour due to a sovereign head of the state.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;

==Festival==
A major annual [[pagoda festival]] known as the 'Mahamuni Paya Pwe' ('pwe' meaning "festival") is held in early February, at the end of the [[Vassa|Buddhist Lent]] to celebrate the history of the pagoda. During this festival, aside from the daily rituals,  the ''[[Patthana]]'' from a "Book of Conditional Relations" is recited.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.272"&gt;Schober, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; This book is a philosophical text which Buddha recounted to his mother in a sermon in ''[[Tavatimsa]]'' heaven and is a sacred scripture in the [[Pali language]].&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.272"&gt;Schober, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; The Pattana recitation is a special feature, which continues for several days. Monks recite from the scriptures, in groups of two or three. The festivities also include various forms of entertainment programmes such as dance, music, theatre etc., and there is also a social event, allowing families and friends gather to greet each other.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.272"&gt;Schober, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; Given that large crowds of pilgrims are attracted during the festive season, guards are posted near the Great Image and video cameras are placed in many parts of the temple precincts to protect it.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;

In the field of [[control engineering]], a '''map-based controller''' is a controller whose outputs are based on values derived from a pre-defined [[lookup table]]. The inputs to the controller are usually values taken from one or more sensors and are used to index the output values in the lookup table. By effectively placing the [[transfer function]] as discrete entries within a lookup table, engineers free to modify smaller sections or update the whole list of entries as required.

Map-based controllers are frequently used to manage fuel delivery systems in modern [[internal combustion engine]]s.

'''Marine Transfer Operations''' are conducted at many ports around the world between '''tanker ships, barges, and marine terminals'''. Specifically, once the marine vessel is secure at the dock a [[loading arm]] or transfer hose is connected between a valve header on the dock and the manifold header on the vessel. A marine transfer of petroleum products cannot be conducted unless it is supervised by a '''person-in-charge (PIC)''' on the vessel who is seafarer in the [[Merchant Marine]] and another person-in-charge on the dock.
[[Image:Tanker unloading crude oil.jpg|thumb|300px|Tanker ship arriving at a Marine Terminal.]]

== Person-in-charge ==
The person-in-charge on the dock is called a [[Loading master]]-PIC and the person-in charge on the barge will be the '''Tankerman-PIC.''' The person-in-charge on a tanker ship will be the '''[[deck officer]]''' who monitors the transfer of product in the '''cargo control room'''. All persons-in-charge must have special training in order to obtain the proper credentials such as licensing and endorsement on their merchant mariner documents.
[[Image:TugBargesCCC17Ap06.jpg|thumb|300px|Inland Tug and Barge]]

== Marine surveyor ==

Loading Masters work closely with the marine surveyor in agreeing to the sequence of the transfer. Such as whether any product sampling will take place prior to commencement, determining if a line displacement will occur, agreeing on whether the final stop at completion will either be a shore stop or a draft stop on the vessel. The marine surveyor gauges the vessel's tanks and shore tanks to ensure the correct amount of product is transferred. Additionally, the surveyor or inspector will obtain product samples on the marine vessel and shore tank for laboratory analysis to ensure that the product meets all specifications of purity.

== Regulations ==
Transfer operations and commencement of a transfer is highly regulated throughout the world with consideration of the environment with potential of [[water pollution]] occurring if petroleum product is released into the water during the transfer. Federal, state, and local laws must be observed during marine transfer operations. 

[[Maritime Security (USCG)]], [[occupational safety and health]] regulations must be adhered to in addition to environmental regulations during marine transfer operations. These regulation's are enforced by local state port control organizations such as the United States Coast Guard in the United States.

==Marine transfer operators==

A marine transfer operation occurs between three main stakeholders which includes the Loading Master-PIC, Vessel Person-In -Charge PIC, and marine surveyor or inspector. These individuals communicate prior to the transfer agreeing on the sequence of events that will occur before, during, and after the transfer. During the course of the transfer the Loading Master is in continuous two way radio contact with the vessel Person-In-Charge and standing by to stop the transfer immediately if any problems develop such as leaks at the transfer hose or loading arm.

A '''medina quarter''' ({{lang-ar|المدينة القديمة}} {{transl|ar|''al-madīnah al-qadīmah''}} "the old city") is a distinct city section found in a number of [[North Africa]]n and [[Fortifications of Malta|Maltese]] cities. A medina is typically walled, with many narrow and [[maze|maze-like]] streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|work=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/medina?q=medina|entry=Medina definition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "[[wikt:medina|medina]]" ({{lang-ar|[[wikt:مدينة|مدينة]]}} {{transl|ar|''madīnah''}}) itself simply means "[[city]]" or "[[town]]" in modern-day Arabic although it was borrowed from an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word (also "medina") referring to a city or populated area.

==Description==
Medina quarters often contain historical [[fountain]]s, [[palace]]s, [[mosque]]s, and sometimes churches.

Because of the very narrow streets, medinas are generally free from [[car]] traffic, and in some cases even [[motorcycle]] and [[bicycle]] traffic. The streets can be less than a metre wide. This makes them unique among highly populated urban centres. The Medina of [[Fes]], or [[Fes el Bali]], is considered one of the largest car-free urban areas in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Mother Nature Network|url=http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/photos/7-car-free-cities/the-medina-of-fes-al-bali-morocco-pop-156000|title=7 car-free cities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10530">[[File:Plankton_collage.jpg|right|thumb|An assemblage of [[planktonic]] organisms]]

'''Meroplankton''' is a wide variety of [[planktonic]] organisms, which spend a portion of their lives in the benthic region of the ocean. These organisms do not remain as [[plankton]] permanently, rather, they are planktonic components in transition, which eventually become larger organisms. After a period of time in the plankton, meroplankton either graduate to the [[nekton]] or adopt a [[benthos|benthic]] (often [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]]) lifestyle on the [[seafloor]]. Meroplankton consists of larval stages of organisms such as [[sea urchins]], [[starfish]], and [[crustaceans]]. Success of meroplankton populations depends on many factors, such as adult fecundity, fertilization success, growth and larval stage duration, behaviour, dispersal, and settlement. Mortality depends on many factors, such as predation, competition, disease, parasites, and physiological stresses. Survival and mortality of meroplankton has a direct effect on adult population numbers of many species. Many of the common, well-known animals found on the [[Great Barrier Reef]] spend time as free-swimming meroplankton, bearing little or no resemblance to the adult they will become. The differences between the appearance of larval and adult stages led to much confusion in the past when larval forms were often believed to be completely different species from the adults. Larvae spend varying amounts of time in the plankton, from minutes to over a year. However, just how long these tiny animals can be considered truly planktonic is under some debate.

==Spatial distribution==
Meroplankton species composition depends on spatial distribution and reproductive habits of adults in a given area. Biotic and abiotic factors such as tidal and lunar cycles and availability of food determine adult spawning schedules, in turn,  determining subsequent meroplankton populations. Behavioural factors, such as predator avoidance are also important. Freshwater inputs play a key role in meroplankton species composition in estuarine environments. Effects of tides contribute greatly to meroplankton species distribution. One study conducted in a Patagonian [[Fjord]] found that species composition of the meroplankton community depended on the seasonally varying input levels from the [[Baker River (Chile)|Baker river]] as well as vertical and horizontal stratification of the water column.&lt;ref name="Castrob"&gt;7. Castrob L., R., Meerhoffa E., Tapiab F. J. 2014. Spatial structure of the meroplankton community along a Patagonian Fjord – The Role of Changing Freshwater Inputs. Vo. 129A, pp.125-135&lt;/ref&gt; Events such as wind driven upwelling and downwelling also affect meroplankton species distribution. Most species are swept in the direction of the flow of water, either off shore during an [[upwelling]] or near shore during a [[downwelling]]. Some species, such as [[Bivalvia|bivalve]] larvae, have the ability to maintain their nearshore position during these events.&lt;ref name="Brubaker"&gt;10. Brubaker J., Largier J., Shanks A.L., 2003. Observations on the Distribution of Meroplankton During an Upwelling Event. Journal of Plankton Research. Vo. 25, No 6, pp: 645-667&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Icefishuk.jpg|right|thumb|212x212px|Icefish larva]][[File:Haeckel_Amphoridea-10.jpg|thumb|189x189px|An early state of a [[Sea Urchin]] larva|left]]

==Dispersal==
Survival rate of Meroplankton is critical to successful development of adult organisms. Low survival rates of meroplankton will result in reduction in adult population numbers. One factor which often determines meroplankton survival is larval dispersal. Most species within the meroplankton community rely on ocean currents for dispersal. Currents play a key role in delivering larval organisms to specific settlement locations, where they are able to transition and mature into adult forms. Organisms which do not make it to the right settlement site are unlikely to complete their lifecycle.&lt;ref name="Brink"&gt;5. Brink L., Brubaker J., Hooff R., Largier J., Shanks A.L, 2002. Observations on the distribution of meroplankton during a downwelling event and associated intrusion of the Chesapeake Bay estuarine plume. Journal of Plankton Research. Vo. 24, No. 4, pp. 391-416&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists in recent years have also discovered that many of these tiny animals in the plankton (in particular larval fish and crustaceans) quickly become very good swimmers capable of incredible feats of speed and endurance.   [[File:FMIB_46393_First_Larval_Stage_of_the_Common_Lobster.jpeg|thumb|185x185px|First Larval Stage of the [[Common Lobster]]]]

==Food availability==
A major factor affecting meroplankton survival is food availability. While living in the plankton, meroplankton either feed on other members of the plankton, or they live off the [[Egg yolk|yolk]] they have retained from the egg they hatched from. Many members of the meroplankton community rely on the surrounding planktonic community for nutrition. In order to ensure that larvae have sufficient amounts of nutrition, many species coordinate larval release with times of algal blooms.  This synchronicity between release of larvae and algal blooms often leads to Meroplankton making up the largest percentage of the planktonic community during such reproductive periods.&lt;ref name="Attrill"&gt;3. Attrill M.J., Conway D.V.P., Eloire D., Highfeild J.M., Lindeque P.K., SomerfeildP.J., 2010. Seasonal dynamics of meroplankton assemblages at station L4. Journal of Plankton Research. Vol. 00, No. 0, pp.1-11&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that certain species are able to commence spawning as they come into contact with [[phytoplankton]] cells. These species store embryos in the mantle cavity until they detect algal blooms. This adaptation allows for better larval survival.&lt;ref name="Arntz"&gt;2. Arntz W.E., Schnack-Schiel S., Thatje S., 2003. Developmental trade-offs in Subantarctic meroplankton communities and the enigma of low decapod diversity in high southern latitudes. Marine Ecology Progress Series. Vo. 260, pp. 195-207&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Phytoplankton_-_the_foundation_of_the_oceanic_food_chain.jpg|thumb|185x185px|A [[phytoplankton]] cell|left]]

==Diversity and abundance==
Meroplankton diversity and abundance are affected by many factors. Seasonal and spatial variations are among some of the main causes of such variability. A study which was conducted in Dunkellin Estuary, determined that spawning times of many species are timed to maximize food availability at a particular time of year, while minimizing presence of other species which exploit the same food source &lt;ref name="Byrne"&gt;8. Byrne, P., 1995. Seasonal Composition of Meroplankton in the Dunkellin Estuary, Galway Bay. Biology and Environment: Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Vo. 95B, No. 1, pp. 35–48&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity and abundance are depth dependent qualities. Generally, shallow coastal waters contain far greater numbers of meroplankton than deep, open ocean waters. Most abundant regions occur at depths between 0 and 200 meters of the water column, where light penetration is highest. Availability of sunlight allows for proliferation of [[phytoplankton]], which serves as one of the major food sources for meroplankton. Deep oceanic waters show significantly lower abundance than shelf regions, due to poor light penetration.&lt;ref name="Gallego"&gt;9. Gallego R., Lavery S.,  Sewell M.A.,  2014. Meroplankton Community of the Oceanic Ross Sea During Late Summer. Antarctic Science Antarctic Science, Vo. 26, No. 4, pp. 345–360&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of pollution ==
Water and benthos pollution from industrial sources has been demonstrated to have varying  effects on biological diversity and survival potential of meroplankton. One study conducted in the [[Vostok Bay]] region in [[Russia]], demonstrated that even in the presence of industrial pollutants, most species of meroplankton were able to proliferate almost unaffected. The authors of this study attribute these findings to the fact that meroplankton are transported by ocean currents generally from cleaner open waters inshore. Furthermore, the same study also concluded that even in heavily polluted areas, meroplankton populations were able to reestablish if pollution was brought under control and sufficient time was allowed to pass. However, the rate of recolonization was demonstrated to be notably slow, on average talking about 10 years before the abundance and diversity of meroplankton returned to its original levels. This is in part due to the slow nature of detoxification of benthic [[sediment]]s, which retain much of the heavy metal [[pollution]] &lt;ref name="Kulikova"&gt;6. Kulikova V. A., Omelyanenko V. A., Tarasov V. G. 2004. Effect of Pollution on the Meroplankton of Gaidamak Bight (Vostok Bay, Sea of Japan), Russian Journal of Ecology, Vo. 35, No. 2, pp. 91-97&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meroplankton and climate change ==
A study conducted in the  [[North Sea]] between 1958-2005, collected samples of meroplankton using a CPR survey. These samples consisted of larval [[echinoderms]], [[decapods]], [[bivalves]], cirripedes, and ectoprocts. Meroplankton abundance as well as PCI levels (amount of chlorophyll in each sample in relation to sea surface temperature) were examined. Researchers concluded that echinoderm larvae increased in abundance throughout the study, with the largest increase occurring in the Northern and Central regions. [[Decapoda|Decapod]] larvae were found to increase in abundance as well, and were found to appear earlier in the year. Bivalve larvae showed an overall decline in abundance. It was also concluded that PCI levels increased throughout the study, particularly during the summer months. It was determined that climate, particularly sea surface temperature, drives meroplankton abundance. Warmer sea surface temperature shortens developmental time of the larvae, increasing their survival rate.&lt;ref name="Beaugrand"&gt;4. Beaugrand G., Kirby R. R., Lindley J. A., 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19529">The '''missing years''' in the [[Hebrew calendar]] refer to a chronological discrepancy between Talmudic chronologists for the destruction of the [[First Temple]] in 423 BCE (3338 [[Hebrew calendar|AM]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Rashi]] on [[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Avodah Zara'' 9a; [[Josephus]], ''[[Seder hadoroth]]'' year 3338 [[Anno Mundi]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the modern secular dating for it in 587 BCE.

== Destruction of the First Temple ==
{{Main|Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)}}
Both the [[Babylonian Chronicles]] and the biblical Chronicles indicate that [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] captured Jerusalem, but secular scholars have attempted to set a year when the event took place. The Babylonian Chronicles, which were published by [[Donald Wiseman]] in 1956, establish that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem the first time on 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Wiseman, ''Chronicles of Chaldean Kings in the British Museum'' (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1956) 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicles, with the names of Jewish kings, is derived from [https://web.archive.org/web/20141030154541/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/cuneiform_nebuchadnezzar_ii.aspx British Museum – Cuneiform tablet with part of the Babylonian Chronicle (605–594 BC)], (See also [http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc5/jerusalem.html Chronicle Concerning the Early Years of Nebuchadnezzar II] Reverse, lines 11'–13')

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the seventh year (of Nebuchadnezzar, 599 BCE) in the month Chislev (Nov/Dec) the king of Babylon assembled his army, and after he had invaded the land of Hatti ([[Syro-Hittite states|northern Syria and southern Anatolia]]) he laid siege to the city of Judah. On the second day of the month of Adar (16 March) he conquered the city and took the king ([[Jeconiah]]) prisoner. He installed in his place a king ([[Zedekiah]]) of his own choice, and after he had received rich tribute, he set forth to Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;No 24 WA21946, The Babylonian Chronicles, The British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|36:6–10|HE}} says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;6 Against him ([[Jehoiakim]]) came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
8 ... and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem...
10 And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before Wiseman's publication, [[E. R. Thiele]] had determined from the biblical texts that Nebuchadnezzar's initial capture of Jerusalem occurred in the spring of 597 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars, including [[William F. Albright]], more frequently dated the event to 598 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Strand, "Thiele's Biblical Chronology As a Corrective for Extrabiblical Dates," ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 34 (1996) 310, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the date of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|first siege of Jerusalem]] in about 597 BCE to the date of the destruction of the First Temple requires resort to biblical sources.

2 Chronicles 36:11 says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;11 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There has been some debate as to when the second siege of Jerusalem took place. Although there is no dispute that Jerusalem fell the second time in the summer month of Tammuz ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:6|HE}}), Albright dates the end of Zedekiah's reign (and the fall of Jerusalem) to 587 BCE, whereas Thiele offers 586 BCE.&lt;ref name=Thiele&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiele's reckoning is based on the presentation of Zedekiah's reign on an accession basis, which was used for most but not all of the kings of Judah. In that case, the year that Zedekiah came to the throne would be his ''first'' partial year; his first full year would be 597/596 BCE, and his eleventh year, the year Jerusalem fell, would be 587/586 BCE. Since Judah's regnal years were counted from [[Tishrei]] in autumn, this would place the end of his reign and the capture of Jerusalem in the summer of 586 BCE.&lt;ref name=Thiele /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie McFall, “A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,” ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) 45.[https://lmf12.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/transguide.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating in Seder Olam Rabbah==

=== Two-year difference within the Hebrew calendar ===
The 2nd century CE rabbinic work [[Seder Olam Rabbah]], which formed the basis of the era counting of the Hebrew calendar, interpreted the  [[prophecy of seventy weeks]] in {{bibleverse||Daniel|9:24–27|HE}} as referring to a period of 490 years, with a "week" being interpreted as a period of seven years, which would pass between the destruction of the [[First Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple]]. This is used to date the destruction of the First Temple to 423 BCE (3338 AM) – about 165 years after the current scholarly dating of the event. The discrepancy between these two dates is referred to as "missing years".

Today, Hebrew dating places the creation of the world near the end of "Year One" AM and afterwards the first year of Adam's life as "Year Two" AM. However, Seder Olam Rabba shows that the Hebrew dating originally counted the first year of Adam's life as "Year Zero" AM. This may mean that the Hebrew dating has shifted in the course of history such that traditional dating of ancient events appears two years earlier than the modern Hebrew dating would be.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Frank, ''Talmudic and Rabbinic Chronology'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbinic tradition&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gans]], Tzemach David (צמח דוד).&lt;/ref&gt; says that the First Temple was destroyed in "year 3338" AM and the Second Temple in "year 3828" AM. If there was no calendar shift, the Common Era equivalents would be 423 BCE and 68 CE, respectively. If there was a calendar shift, the destructions would have taken place in our years 3339 and 3829 AM, or in 3340 and 3830 AM, and the Common Era equivalents would be 422 BCE and 69 CE, respectively, or 421 BCE and 70 CE.

If there was no calendar shift, the length of the missing-years period would be 163 years (586 minus 423). If there was a calendar shift, the length of the missing-years period would be 164 or 165 years.

=== The missing years and Daniel ===
A popular explanation for the missing years suggests that the Jewish sages interpreted the prophecy in {{bibleverse||Daniel|9:24–27|HE}} as meaning that there would be 490 years from the destruction of the First Temple to the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] and, working backwards from the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] (in 3828 AM), wrongly dated the destruction of the First Temple (in 3338 AM).

A variation on this argument states that the Jews deliberately altered the dating so that the true date of the "anointed one" ([[Mashiah]]) mentioned in {{bibleverse||Daniel|9:25|HE}} would be hidden. Other apologists&lt;ref&gt;This position was proposed by Rabbi Shimon Schwab in "Comparative Jewish Chronology," in the Ateret Tzvi Jubilee Volume in honor of Rabbi Joseph Breuer (Feldheim 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; have countered with claims that the dating was indeed altered for one or another reason and should be understood as fable, not history.

These explanations come from the ambiguous meaning of the word 'week' in Hebrew, which means 'a heptad', or a group of seven. The Hebrew word for 'week' is used to refer to periods of seven days as well as seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{StrongHebrew|7620}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding of this number as referring to 490 years can also be found in Seder Olam. Christians also interpreted these verses as years and connect them to Jesus, although [[Rashi]]'s interpretation is such that it upholds the tradition that the anointed one in question is the Persian king Cyrus.

== Highlighting discrepancies ==

===Mistakes in the Hebrew or secular dating===
If traditional dates are assumed to be based on the standard Hebrew calendar, then the differing traditional and modern secular dating of events cannot both be correct. Attempts to reconcile the two systems must show one or both to have errors.

====Missing reign lengths in the Hebrew dating====
Secular scholars see the discrepancy between the traditional and secular date of the destruction of the First Temple arising as a result of Jewish sages missing out the reign lengths of several Persian kings during the Persian Empire's rule over [[Land of Israel|Israel]]. Modern secular scholars tally ten Persian kings whose combined reigns total 208 years. By contrast, ancient Jewish sages only mention four Persian kings totaling 52 years. The reigns of several Persian kings appear to be missing from the traditional calculations.

==== Missing years in Jewish tradition ====
R' [[Azariah dei Rossi]], in ''Me'or Einayim'' (c. 1573), was likely the first Jewish authority to claim that the traditional Hebrew dating is not historically precise regarding the years before the Second Temple.

R' [[Nachman Krochmal]] in ''Guide to the perplexed of our times'' (Hebrew, 1851) points to the Greek name Antigonos mentioned in the beginning of Avot as proof that there must have been a longer period to account for this sign of Hellenic influence. He posits that certain books of the Bible such as [[Ecclesiastes|Kohelet]] and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] were written or redacted during this period.

R' [[David Zvi Hoffman]] (1843–1921) points out that the Mishna in Avot (1:4) in describing the chain of tradition uses the plural "accepted from them" even though the previous Mishna only mentions one person. He posits that there must have been another Mishna mentioning two sages that was later removed.

It has been noted that the traditional account of Jewish history shows a discontinuity in the beginning of the 35th century: The account of [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] is complete only until this time. It has been postulated that this work was written to complement another historical work, about subsequent centuries until the time of [[Hadrian]], which is no longer extant.

It appears that Jewish dating systems only arose in the 35th century, so that precise historical records would naturally have existed only from that time onwards. The Minyan Shtarot system, used to date official Jewish documents, started in the year 3449. According to Lerman's thesis, the year-count "from Creation" was established around the same time (see [[Birkat Hachama]]).

It has also been posited that certain calculations in the Talmud compute better according to the secular dating. Two possible harmonizations are proposed by modern rabbis:

* R' [[Shimon Schwab]] points to the words "seal the words and close the book" in the book of Daniel as a positive commandment to obscure the calculations for the Messiah mentioned within.  However, R' Schwab later withdrew this suggestion once it became clear that the whole basis for the dating of the [[sabbatical]] and [[jubilee (biblical)|jubilee]] years would be undermined, labeling it a mere thought experiment.
* An alternative solution suggests that the sages were concerned with the acceptance of the [[Mishna]]. There existed a Rabbinical tradition that the year 4000 marked the close of the "era of Torah". The authors of the [[Ḥakirah (journal)|Ḥakirah]] article propose that the Sages therefore arranged the chronology so that the redaction of the Mishna should coincide with that date and thus have a better chance of acceptance.

====Critiques of secular dating====
Attempts have been made to reinterpret the historical evidence to agree with the Rabbinic tradition (see ''Excursus: Rabbinic Tradition'', below), however this approach to the discrepancy is problematic. The reinterpretation of the Greek, Babylonian and Persian sources that is required to support the traditional dating has been achieved only in parts and has not yet been achieved in its entirety. Similar problems face other attempts to revise secular dating (such as those of [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]] and [[David Rohl]]) and mainstream scholarship rejects such approaches. Where and how the Gregorian or Julian calendric differential gets factored in, remains another argument entirely.

{{hidden begin|border=1px #aaa solid|title={{center|''Excursus'': '''Rabbinic Tradition'''}}}}

According to the Aramaic '''[[Scroll of Antiochus]]''', from the Second Temple's rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes who invaded Judaea, there had transpired '''213 years''' in total. Quoting verbatim from that ancient Aramaic record:
 
בִּשׁנַת עַסרִין וּתלָת שְׁנִין לְמִמלְכֵיהּ, בִּשׁנַת מָאתַן וּתלָת עֲסַר שְׁנִין לְבִניַין בֵּית אֱלָהָא דֵיך, שַׁוִּי אַנפּוֹהִי לְמִיסַּק לִירוּשְׁלֵם

Literal translation: ''In the twenty third year of his kingdom, in the two-hundred and thirteenth year of the rebuilding of this, God's house, he (Antiochus Eupator) put his face to go up to Jerusalem.''

This timeframe is taken in conjunction with another date in the [[Seleucid Era]] counting mentioned by [[Josephus]], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (book 12, chapter 9, section 2). Based on Josephus' record,  Antiochus Eupator began his reign after his father's death (Antiochus Epiphanes) in ''anno'' 149 of the [[Seleucid Era]] (= 162 BCE). Twenty-three years into Antiochus Eupator's reign would have then been ''anno'' 172 of the [[Seleucid Era]], or what was then 139 BCE. Since, according to the [[Megillat Antiochus|Scroll of Antiochus]], the [[Second Temple]] had already been standing 213 years, this means that the [[Second Temple]] was completed in ''anno'' '''352 BCE''', being what was then the 6th year of the reign of [[Darius I|Darius]] the king (i.e. Darius, the son of Hystaspes), the year in which the king finished its building according to Ezra 6:15. Although this date of the Temple's rebuilding largely disagrees with modern scholarship who base their chronologies upon the [[Babylonian Chronicles]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Parker &amp; Waldo H. Dubberstein, ''Babylonian Chronology 626 BC - AD 75'', Providence 1956&lt;/ref&gt; and its rebuilding in 516 BCE, it is, nonetheless, held by religious Jewish circles as being accurate and reliable, since it is founded upon a tradition passed down generation after generation. The [[Babylonian Chronicles]], however, are known to be lacking in certain regnal years ascribed to some kings, besides disagreeing in other places with the ancient Egyptian records outlining the regnal years of eight successive Persian kings, preserved in the [[Manetho|Third Book of Manetho]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Fragments'', ed. I. P. Cory, Esq., p. 65, London 1828. Manetho was the high priest and scribe of Egypt who wrote down his history for Ptolemy Philadelphus.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jewish tradition, the Second Temple stood '''420 years''',&lt;ref&gt;Tosefta (''Zevahim'' 13:6); Palestinian Talmud (''Megillah'' 18a), ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, it was destroyed by Titus in the 2nd year of the reign of [[Vespasian]], in 68 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Questions &amp; Responsa'', ''responsum'' # 389; in other editions, ''responsum'' # 234 (Hebrew). Maimonides states explicitly this tradition, putting the destruction of the Second Temple in the lunar month Av, in the year which preceded ''anno'' 380 of the Seleucid era (i.e. 68 CE). See also ''She'harim la'luah ha'ivry'' (Gates to the Hebrew Calendar) by Rahamim Sar-Shalom, 1984 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of subject, see [[Seder Olam Rabbah]].

The 2nd century Jewish chronicler wrote in ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' (chapter 30): "Rabbi Yose says: The kingdom of Persia during the time of the Temple lasted [only] '''34 years'''." Many have misconstrued these words to mean that the author of ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' has contracted the entire Persian period of over 200 years into a supposed period of 34 years. According to [[Rashi|RASHI]],&lt;ref&gt;RASHI’s commentary on the Bablylonian Talmud (''Avodah Zarah'' 9a, s.v. מלכות פרס בפני הבית)&lt;/ref&gt; the 34-year Persian period must be understood in the context of their hegemony over Israel while the Second Temple stood. Meaning, 34 years is the precise timeframe between the building of the Second Temple under [[Darius I|Darius]] (I) in 352 BCE (according to Jewish calculations) and [[Alexander the Great]]'s rise to power in 318 BCE – collected altogether as 34 years of Persian hegemony over Israel while the Temple stood. This timeframe, therefore, does not signify the end of the dynasties in Persia, but rather of their rule and hegemony over Israel before [[Alexander the Great]] rose to power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12193">'''Partial stroke testing''' (or PST) is a technique used in a control system to allow the user to test a percentage of the possible failure modes of a [[shut down valve]] without the need to physically close the valve.  PST is used to assist in determining that the safety function will operate on demand.  PST is most often used on high integrity emergency shutdown valves (ESDVs) in applications where closing the valve will have a high cost burden yet proving the integrity of the valve is essential to maintaining a safe facility.  In addition to ESDVs PST is also used on high integrity pressure protection systems or HIPPS.  Partial stroke testing is not a replacement for the need to fully stroke valves as proof testing is still a mandatory requirement.

==Standards==
Partial stroke testing is an accepted [[petroleum industry]] standard technique and is also quantified in detail by regulatory bodies such as the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and the [[Instrument Society of Automation]] (ISA). The following are the standards appropriate to these bodies.

:*'''[[IEC61508]]''' – Functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety-related systems
:*'''[[IEC61511]]''' – Functional safety – Safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector
:*'''ANSI/ISA-84.00.01''' – Functional safety: Safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector (an [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard)

These standards define the requirements for safety related systems and describe how to quantify the performance of PST systems

==Measuring safety performance==
IEC61508 adapts a [[safety life cycle]] approach to the management of plant safety. During the design phase of this life cycle of a safety system the required safety performance level is determined using techniques such as [[Markov analysis]], [[Failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]], [[fault tree analysis]] and [[Hazard and operability study|Hazop]]. These techniques allow the user to determine the potential frequency and consequence of hazardous activities and to quantify the level of risk. A common method for this quantification is the [[safety integrity level]]. This is quantified from one to four with level four being the most hazardous.

Once the SIL level is determined this specifies the required performance level of the safety systems during the operational phase of the plant. The metric for measuring the performance of a safety function is called the average probability of failure on demand (or PFD&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;) and this correlates to the SIL level as follows

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! SIL !! PFD&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| 4 || ≥10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 3 || ≥10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 2 || ≥10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1 || ≥10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

One method of calculating the PFD&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; for a basic safety function with no [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] is using the formula

:'''PFD&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; = [(1-PTC)×λ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;×(TI&lt;sub&gt;FC&lt;/sub&gt;/2)] + [PTC×λ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;×(TI&lt;sub&gt;PST&lt;/sub&gt;/2)]'''

Where:

:PTC = Proof test coverage of the partial stroke test.

:λ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = The dangerous failure rate of the safety function.

:TI&lt;sub&gt;FC&lt;/sub&gt; = The full closure interval, i.e. how often the valve must be full closed for testing.

:TI&lt;sub&gt;PST&lt;/sub&gt; = The partial stroke test interval.

The proof test coverage is a measure of how effective the partial stroke test is and the higher the PTC the greater the effect of the test.

==Benefits==
The benefits of using PST are not limited to simply the safety performance but gains can also be made in the production performance of a plant and the capital cost of a plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=Article_Index1&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=73686 Web Exclusive: Valve failure not an option] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718092829/http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=Article_Index1&amp;template=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=73686 |date=2011-07-18 }}.

Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt; These are summarised as follows

===Safety benefits===
Gains can be made in the following areas by the use of PST.
:* Reducing the probability of failure on demand.

===Production benefits===
There are a number of areas where production efficiency can be improved by the successful implementation of a PST system.
:* Extension of the time between compulsory plant shutdowns.
:* Predicting potential valve failures facilitating the pre-ordering of spare parts.
:* Prioritisation of maintenance tasks.

==Drawbacks==
The main drawback of all PST systems is the increased probability of causing an accidental activation of the safety system thus causing a plant shutdown, this is the primary concern of PST systems by operators and for this reason many PST system remain dormant after installation.  Different techniques mitigate for this issue in different manners but all systems have an inherent risk

In addition in some cases, a PST cannot be performed due to the limitations inherent in the process or the valve being used. Further, as the PST introduces a disturbance into the process or system, it may not be appropriate for some processes or systems that are sensitive to disturbances.

Finally, a PST cannot always differentiate between different faults or failures within the valve and actuator assembly thus limiting the diagnostic capability.

==Techniques==
There are a number of different techniques available for partial stroke testing and the selection of the most appropriate technique depends on the main benefits the operator is trying to gain.

===Mechanical Jammers===
Mechanical jammers are devices where a device is inserted into the valve and actuator assembly that physically prevents the valve from moving past a certain point. These are used in cases where accidentally shutting the valve would have severe consequences, or any application where the end user prefers a mechanical device.

Typical benefits of this type of device are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B5PSPJfG9S5kYTRhMDVhYjAtNTViMy00ZGQ5LWE2ZmItYzY3MjU4NDM3Nzk1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;authkey=CM77sJIP D-Stop Partial Stroke Test Device. Manual/Local and Remote Operated Mechanical Partial Stroke Valve Testing]. Cameron. Docs.google.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The devices assure metal-to-metal prevention of stroke past the specified set point.
*Unlike some electronic systems, there is no need to commission and calibrate controls or continually train personnel, resulting in additional significant cost savings.
*The devices are vibration resistant, making them highly reliable.
*The risk associated with having an ESD event occur at time of manual mechanical PST may be considered statistically insignificant and allows a rational consideration of the advantages mechanical devices offer.
*Modular design allows for addition of limit switches, potentiometers, remote control operation, etc.
*The test is a comprehensive test of the logic solver and all final elements, only the sensing elements of the safety function are not tested.
*The valve is tested at the designed operating speed as it simulates an ESD event
*Jammers have a very low probability of causing a spurious trip.

However, opinions differ whether these devices are suitable for functional safety systems as the safety function is offline for the duration of the test.

Modern mechanical PST devices may be [http://www.netherlocks.com/partial-stroke-testing/netherlocks-develops-remote-operation-for-faith-pst-system/ automated].

Examples of this kind of device include direct interface products that mount between the valve and the actuator and may use cams fitted to the valve stem. 
An example of such a mechanical PST system:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netherlocks.com/products/partial-stroke-testing/faith-overview/ Netherlocks mechanical PST system FAITH - known as the industry standard.] Retrieved on 2013-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods include adjustable actuator end stops.

===Pneumatic valve positioners===
The basic principle behind partial stroke testing is that the valve is moved to a predetermined position in order to determine the performance of the shut down valve. This led to the adaptation of pneumatic positioners used on [[flow control valve]] for use in partial stroke testing. These systems are often suitable for use on shutdown valves up to and including SIL3.
The main benefits are : 
* Elimination of the cost of manual testing
* Tracking and records of the PST tests for an optimum Safety monitoring. When the positioner is connected to the Safety System, the date and result of the test are registered in the Sequence of Events, for Insurance purposes. 
* Remote access to valve diagnostics from the control room, with action oriented reports for predictive maintenance.

The main benefit of these systems is that positioners are common equipment on plants and thus operators are familiar with the operation of these systems, however the primary drawback is the increased risk of spurious trip caused by the introduction of additional control components that are not normally used on on/off valves.  These systems are however limited to use on pneumatically actuated valves.

===Electrical relay systems===
These systems use an electrical switch to de-energise the solenoid valve and use an electrical relay attached to the actuator to re-energise the solenoid coil when the desired PST point is reached.

===Electronic control systems===
Electronic control systems use a configurable electronic module that connects between the supply from the ESD system and the [[solenoid valve]]. In order to perform a test the timer de-energises the solenoid valve to simulate a shutdown and re-energises the soleniod when the required degree of partial stroke is reached. These systems are fundamentally a miniature [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]] dedicated to the testing of the valve.

Due to their nature these devices do not actually form part of the safety function and are therefore 100% fail safe. With the addition of a pressure sensor and/or a position sensor for feedback timer systems are also capable of providing intelligent diagnostics in order to diagnose the performance of all components including the valve, actuator and solenoid valves.

In addition timers are capable of operating with any type of fluid power actuator and can also be used with subsea valves where the solenoid valve is located top-side.

===Integrated solenoid valve systems===
Another technique is to embed the control electronics into a solenoid valve enclosure removing the need for additional control boxes.  In addition there is no need to change the control schematic as no dedicated components are required.

The '''Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology''' (PCMA; {{lang-pl|Centrum Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej im. [[Kazimierz Michałowski|Kazimierza Michałowskiego]] UW}}) operates as an independent research institute of the [[University of Warsaw]] under the present name since 1990. It is dedicated to organizing, implementing and coordinating archaeological research, both excavations and study projects, as well as conservation, reconstruction and restoration projects, in [[North Africa|northeastern Africa]], the [[Near East]] and [[Cyprus]]. Projects include sites covering a broad chronological spectrum from the dawn of civilization (prehistoric times) through all the historic periods of the ancient Mediterranean civilizations to Late Antiquity and early Islam. Tasks beside fieldwork include comprehensive documentation of finds, archives management and publication of the results in keeping with international research standards. The PCMA manages the [[Research Centre in Cairo, Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw|Research Centre in Cairo]].

'''Pollen''' is a fine to coarse powdery substance comprising pollen grains which are male [[Gametophyte|microgametophytes]] of [[spermatophyta|seed plants]], which produce male [[gamete]]s (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of [[sporopollenin]] that protects the gametophytes during the process of their movement from the [[stamen]]s to the [[gynoecium|pistil]] of flowering plants, or from the male [[Conifer cone|cone]] to the female cone of [[Pinophyta|coniferous plants]]. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it [[germinate]]s, producing a [[pollen tube]] that transfers the [[sperm]] to the [[ovule]] containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called [[palynology]] and is highly useful in [[paleoecology]], [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], and [[Forensic science|forensics]].

Pollen in plants is used for transferring haploid male genetic material from the [[Stamen|anther]] of a single flower to the stigma of another in cross-pollination.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Pollination |volume=22 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a case of self-pollination, this process takes place from the anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Pollen itself is not the male gamete.&lt;ref name="facts_and_practice_for_a_level"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Johnstone | first1 = Adam | title = Biology: facts &amp; practice for A level| year =2001 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | isbn = 978-0-19-914766-3 | page = 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each pollen grain contains vegetative (non-reproductive) cells (only a single cell in most flowering plants but several in other seed plants) and a generative (reproductive) cell. In flowering plants the vegetative tube cell produces the [[pollen tube]], and the generative cell divides to form the two sperm cells.

=== Formation ===
Pollen is produced in the [[microsporangia]] in the male cone of a conifer or other [[gymnosperm]] or in the anthers of an [[Flowering plant|angiosperm]] [[flower]]. Pollen grains come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and surface markings characteristic of the species (see [[electron micrograph]], right). Pollen grains of [[pine]]s, [[fir]]s, and [[spruce]]s are winged. The smallest pollen grain, that of the [[forget-me-not]] (''Myosotis'' spp.),{{which|date=February 2017}} is around 6&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] (0.006&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter.{{citation  needed|date=February 2017}} Wind-borne pollen grains can be as large as about 90–100&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmc = 59743 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.211287498 | year = 2001 | title = Corn pollen deposition on milkweeds in and near cornfields | volume = 98 | issue = 21 | pages = 11919–24 | pmid = 11559840 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | last1 = Pleasants| first1 = J.

In angiosperms, during flower development the anther is composed of a mass of cells that appear undifferentiated, except for a partially differentiated dermis. As the flower develops, four groups of sporogenous cells form within the anther. The fertile sporogenous cells are surrounded by layers of sterile cells that grow into the wall of the pollen sac. Some of the cells grow into nutritive cells that supply nutrition for the microspores that form by meiotic division from the sporogenous cells.

In a process called '''microsporogenesis''', four haploid [[microspore]]s are produced from each diploid sporogenous cell (microsporocyte, pollen mother cell or [[meiocyte]]), after [[meiotic division]]. After the formation of the four microspores, which are contained by callose walls, the development of the pollen grain walls begins. The callose wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine. The exine is what is preserved in the fossil record. Two basic types of microsporogenesis are recognised, simultaneous and successive. In simultaneous microsporogenesis meiotic steps I and II are completed prior to [[cytokinesis]], whereas in successive microsporogenesis cytokinesis follows. While there may be a continuum with intermediate forms, the type of microsporogenesis has systematic significance. The predominant form amongst the [[monocots]] is successive, but there are important exceptions.&lt;ref name=Furness2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furness|first1=Carol A.|last2=Rudall|first2=Paula J.|authorlink2=Paula Rudall|title=Pollen and anther characters in monocot systematics|journal=Grana|date=January 2001|volume=40|issue=1–2|pages=17–25|doi=10.1080/00173130152591840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During microgametogenesis, the unicellular microspores undergo mitosis and develop into mature [[microgametophyte]]s containing the gametes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology/people/twell/lab/pollenis/development Pollen Development — University of Leicester&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In some flowering plants,{{which|date=February 2017}} [[germination]] of the pollen grain may begin even before it leaves the microsporangium, with the generative cell forming the two sperm cells.

=== Structure ===
Except in the case of some submerged aquatic plants, the mature pollen grain has a double wall. The vegetative and generative cells are surrounded by a thin delicate wall of unaltered [[cellulose]] called the '''endospore''' or '''intine''', and a tough resistant outer cuticularized wall composed largely of [[sporopollenin]] called the '''exospore''' or '''exine'''. The exine often bears spines or warts, or is variously sculptured, and the character of the markings is often of value for identifying genus, species, or even cultivar or individual. The spines may be less than a micron in length (spinulus, plural spinuli) referred to as '''spinulose''' (scabrate), or longer than a micron (echina, echinae) referred to as '''echinate'''. Various terms also describe the sculpturing such as '''reticulate''', a net like appearance consisting of elements (murus, muri) separated from each other by a lumen (plural lumina).

The pollen wall protects the sperm while the pollen grain is moving from the anther to the stigma; it protects the vital genetic material from drying out and solar radiation. The pollen grain surface is covered with waxes and proteins, which are held in place by structures called sculpture elements on the surface of the grain. The outer pollen wall, which prevents the pollen grain from shrinking and crushing the genetic material during desiccation, is composed of two layers. These two layers are the tectum and the foot layer, which is just above the intine. The tectum and foot layer are separated by a region called the columella, which is composed of strengthening rods. The outer wall is constructed with a resistant biopolymer called sporopollenin.

Pollen apertures are regions of the pollen wall that may involve exine thinning or a significant reduction in exine thickness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furness|first=Carol A.|last2=Rudall|first2=Paula J.|date=2004-03-01|title=Pollen aperture evolution--a crucial factor for eudicot success?|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=9|issue=3|pages=154–158|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2004.01.001|pmid=15003239|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.5084}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow shrinking and swelling of the grain caused by changes in moisture content. Elongated apertures or furrows in the pollen grain are called colpi (singular: colpus) or sulci (singular: [[Sulcus (morphology)|sulcus]]). Apertures that are more circular are called pores. Colpi, sulci and pores are major features in the identification of classes of pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/ppapertr.html|author=Davis, Owen |title=Aperture|work=geo.arizona.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollen may be referred to as '''inaperturate''' (apertures absent) or '''aperturate''' (apertures present).

The transfer of pollen grains to the female reproductive structure ('''''[[Carpel|pistil]]''''' in angiosperms) is called '''[[pollination]]'''. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, in which case the plant is described as '''[[Anemophily|anemophilous]]''' (literally wind-loving). Anemophilous plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering seed plants (e.g., pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous. Anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. '''[[Entomophily|Entomophilous]]''' (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and [[protein]]-rich, for dispersal by [[insect]] [[pollinator]]s attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some [[mite]]s are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called [[palynivore]]s.

In non-flowering seed plants, pollen germinates in the pollen chamber, located beneath the [[Ovule|micropyle]], underneath the integuments of the ovule. A [[pollen tube]] is produced, which grows into the [[nucellus]] to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells. Sperm cells of [[Pinophyta]] and [[Gnetophyta]] are without [[flagella]], and are carried by the pollen tube, while those of [[Cycad]]ophyta and [[Ginkgophyta]] have many flagella.

When placed on the [[Carpel|stigma]] of a flowering plant, under favorable circumstances, a pollen grain puts forth a [[pollen tube]], which grows down the tissue of the style to the [[ovary (plants)|ovary]], and makes its way along the [[placenta]], guided by projections or hairs, to the micropyle of an [[ovule]]. The nucleus of the tube cell has meanwhile passed into the tube, as does also the generative nucleus, which divides (if it hasn't already) to form two sperm cells. The sperm cells are carried to their destination in the tip of the [[pollen tube]]. Double-strand breaks in DNA that arise during [[pollen tube]] growth appear to be efficiently [[DNA repair|repaired]] in the generative cell that carries the male [[genome|genomic information]] to be passed on to the next plant generation.&lt;ref name="pmid23550213"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirano T, Takagi K, Hoshino Y, Abe T |title=DNA damage response in male gametes of Cyrtanthus mackenii during pollen tube growth |journal=AoB Plants |volume=5 |issue= |pages=plt004 |year=2013 |pmid=23550213 |pmc=3583183 |doi=10.1093/aobpla/plt004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the vegetative cell that is responsible for tube elongation appears to lack this [[DNA repair]] capability.&lt;ref name="pmid23550213" /&gt;

==Pollen in the fossil record==
{{Main article|Palynology}}
Pollen's sporopollenin outer sheath affords it some resistance to the rigours of the fossilisation process that destroy weaker objects; it is also produced in huge quantities. There is an extensive fossil record of pollen grains, often disassociated from their parent plant. The discipline of palynology is devoted to the study of pollen, which can be used both for biostratigraphy and to gain information about the abundance and variety of plants alive — which can itself yield important information about paleoclimates. Also, pollen analysis has been widely used for reconstructing past changes in vegetation and their associated drivers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franco-Gaviria |first=Felipe et al. |title=The human impact imprint on modern pollen spectra of the Mayan lands |year=2018 |publisher=[[Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana 70, 1]] |pages=61–78 |url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%284%29Franco.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Allergy to pollen==

}}
[[Allergic rhinitis|Nasal allergy]] to pollen is called [[pollinosis]], and allergy specifically to grass pollen is called [[hay fever]]. Generally, pollens that cause allergies are those of anemophilous plants (pollen is dispersed by air currents.) Such plants produce large quantities of lightweight pollen (because wind dispersal is random and the likelihood of one pollen grain landing on another flower is small), which can be carried for great distances and are easily inhaled, bringing it into contact with the sensitive nasal passages.

Pollen allergies are common in polar and temperate climate zones, where production of pollen is seasonal. In the tropics pollen production varies less by the season, and allergic reactions less.
In northern Europe, common pollens for allergies are those of [[birch]] and [[alder]], and in late summer [[Artemisia vulgaris|wormwood]] and different forms of [[hay]]. Grass pollen is also associated with [[Asthma|asthma exacerbations]] in some people, a phenomenon termed [[Thunderstorm asthma|thunderstorm asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erbas|first=B.|last2=Jazayeri|first2=M.|last3=Lambert|first3=K.

In the US, people often mistakenly blame the conspicuous [[goldenrod]] flower for allergies. Since this plant is entomophilous (its pollen is dispersed by animals), its heavy, sticky pollen does not become independently airborne. Most late summer and fall pollen allergies are probably caused by [[ragweed]], a widespread anemophilous plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oder|first1=Tom|title=Dear allergy sufferers: Don't blame goldenrod|url=http://www.mnn.com/health/allergies/stories/dear-allergy-sufferers-dont-blame-goldenrod|website=mnn.com|publisher=Mother Nature Network|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arizona]] was once regarded as a haven for people with pollen allergies, although several ragweed species grow in the desert. However, as suburbs grew and people began establishing [[irrigation|irrigated lawns and gardens]], more irritating species of ragweed gained a foothold and Arizona lost its claim of freedom from hay fever.

Anemophilous spring blooming plants such as [[oak]], [[birch]], [[hickory]], [[pecan]], and early summer [[grass]]es may also induce pollen allergies. Most cultivated plants with showy flowers are entomophilous and do not cause pollen allergies.

The number of people in the United States affected by hay fever is between 20 and 40 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skoner|first1=DP|title=Allergic rhinitis: definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, detection, and diagnosis.|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=July 2001|volume=108|issue=1 Suppl|pages=S2–8|pmid=11449200|doi=10.1067/mai.2001.115569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such allergy has proven to be the most frequent [[allergic response]] in the nation. There are certain evidential suggestions pointing out hay fever and similar allergies to be of [[Hereditary disease|hereditary origin]]. Individuals who suffer from [[eczema]] or are [[asthma]]tic tend to be more susceptible to developing long-term hay fever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/allergies/living-with-allergies-10/rhinitis Allergies and Hay Fever] WebMD. Retrieved on 2010-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], decades of rising temperatures cause pollen to appear earlier and in greater numbers, as well as introduction of new species such as ragweed.&lt;ref&gt;Siewertsen, Bjarne. "[http://www.dmi.dk/nyheder/arkiv/nyheder-2015/04/haard-nyser-for-allergikere-i-varm-fremtid/ Hård nyser for allergikere i varm fremtid]"  (English: Hard sneeze for allergic people in warm future) ''[[Danish Meteorological Institute]]'', 18 April 2015. Retrieved: 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most efficient way to handle a pollen allergy is by preventing contact with the material. Individuals carrying the ailment may at first believe that they have a simple summer cold, but hay fever becomes more evident when the apparent cold does not disappear. The confirmation of hay fever can be obtained after examination by a [[General practitioner|general physician]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allergiesandtreatments.com/pollen-allergy/ Bee, grass pollen allergy symptoms]. allergiesandtreatments.com. Retrieved on 2010-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
{{main article|Allergic rhinitis#treatment}}
[[Antihistamines]] are effective at treating mild cases of pollinosis, this type of non-prescribed drugs includes [[loratadine]], [[cetirizine]] and [[chlorpheniramine]]. They do not prevent the discharge of [[histamine]], but it has been proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this [[biogenic amine]], which considerably lowers hay fever symptoms.

[[Decongestants]] can be administered in different ways such as tablets and [[nasal spray]]s.

[[Allergen immunotherapy|Allergy immunotherapy]] (AIT) treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to pollen, thereby inducing specific long-term tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;Van Overtvelt L. et al. Immune mechanisms of allergen-specific sublingual immunotherapy. Revue française d'allergologie et d'immunologie clinique. 2006; 46: 713–720.&lt;/ref&gt; Allergy immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops), or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous). Discovered by Leonard Noon and John Freeman in 1911, allergy immunotherapy represents the only causative treatment for respiratory allergies.

==Nutrition==
Most major classes of [[predatory]] and [[parasitic]] [[arthropod]]s contain species that eat pollen, despite the common perception that [[bee]]s are the primary pollen-consuming arthropod group. Many other [[Hymenoptera]] other than bees consume pollen as adults, though only a small number feed on pollen as [[larva]]e (including some [[ant]] larvae). [[Spider]]s are normally considered [[carnivore]]s but pollen is an important source of food for several species, particularly for [[spider]]lings, which catch pollen on their [[spider web|webs]]. It is not clear how spiderlings manage to eat pollen however, since their mouths are not large enough to consume pollen grains.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some [[Acari|predatory mites]] also feed on pollen, with some species being able to subsist solely on pollen, such as ''[[Euseius tularensis]]'', which feeds on the pollen of dozens of plant species. Members of some beetle families such as [[Mordellidae]] and [[Melyridae]] feed almost exclusively on pollen as adults, while various lineages within larger families such as [[Curculionidae]], [[Chrysomelidae]], [[Cerambycidae]], and [[Scarabaeidae]] are pollen specialists even though most members of their families are not (e.g., only 36 of 40000 species of [[Carabidae|ground beetle]]s, which are typically predatory, have been shown to eat pollen—but this is thought to be a severe underestimate as the feeding habits are only known for 1000 species). Similarly, [[Ladybird]] beetles mainly eat insects, but many species also eat pollen, as either part or all of their diet. [[Hemiptera]] are mostly [[herbivore]]s or [[omnivore]]s but pollen feeding is known (and has only been well studied in the [[Anthocoridae]]). Many adult flies, especially [[Syrphidae]], feed on pollen, and three UK syrphid species feed strictly on pollen (syrphids, like all [[Fly|flies]], cannot eat pollen directly due to the structure of their mouthparts, but can consume pollen contents that are dissolved in a fluid).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| chapter = The Pollen Feeders| title = Relationships of Natural Enemies and Non-Prey Foods| volume = 7| pages = 87–11| year = 2009| isbn = 978-1-4020-9234-3| doi = 10.1007/978-1-4020-9235-0_6| last1 = Lundgren| first1 = Jonathan G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of fungus, including ''[[Fomes fomentarius]]'', are able to break down grains of pollen as a secondary nutrition source that is particularly high in nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fungal Strategies of Wood Decay in Trees|author= Schwarze, Francis W.

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has not found any harmful effects of bee pollen consumption, except from the usual allergies. However, FDA does not allow bee pollen marketers in the United States to make health claims about their produce, as no scientific basis for these has ever been proven. Furthermore, there are possible dangers not only from allergic reactions but also from contaminants such as pesticides and from fungi and bacteria growth related to poor storage procedures. A manufacturers's claim that pollen collecting helps the bee colonies is also controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AA158| archiveurl = http://ufdc.ufl.edu/IR00004421/00001| title = Producing Pollen | author = Sanford, Malcolm T. | publisher = University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences | accessdate=2007-08-30}}.

In [[forensic biology]], pollen can tell a lot about where a person or object has been, because regions of the world, or even more particular locations such a certain set of bushes, will have a distinctive collection of pollen species.&lt;ref name="bryant"&gt;{{cite web| title = Forensic Palynology: A New Way to Catch Crooks | author = Bryant, Vaughn M.  | url = http://www.crimeandclues.com/pollen.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203104441/http://www.crimeandclues.com/pollen.htm | archivedate = 2007-02-03 |work=crimeandclues.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollen evidence can also reveal the season in which a particular object picked up the pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Forensics studies look to pollen | author = Stackhouse, Robert | newspaper = The Battalion | date = 17 April 2003 | url = https://web.archive.org/liveweb/http://www.thebatt.com/2.8526/forensics-studies-look-to-pollen-1.1224833#.UXXYzlfHn-E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollen has been used to trace activity at mass graves in [[Bosnia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3640788.stm | title = Pollen helps war crime forensics | author =  Wood, Peter| date = 9 September 2004 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; catch a burglar who brushed against a ''[[Hypericum]]'' bush during a crime,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2005.11.028 | title = Hypericum pollen determines the presence of burglars at the scene of a crime: An example of forensic palynology | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 163 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–235 | author = D.

== Spiritual purposes ==
In some [[Native American religion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, pollen is used in [[prayer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and rituals to symbolize life and renewal by [[sanctifying]] objects, dancing grounds, trails, and [[sandpainting]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. It may also be sprinkled over heads or in mouths. Many [[Navajo]] people believe the body becomes [[holy]] when it travels over a trail sprinkled with pollen. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Native American Religions|last=Hirshfelder|first=Arlene|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|year=2000|isbn=0816039496|location=|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Research Centre is to develop and expand Polish research in the region, particularly in [[Nile|the Nile Valley]]. It is operated by the [[Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology]], an independent research institute of the [[University of Warsaw]]. The PCMA Cairo Research Centre is located in two buildings situated in close proximity to one another in the Cairo [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] district — in antiquity the centre of a religious cult and the location of the Egypt's reputedly largest temple.

== History ==
Polish archaeologists first started to work in [[Egypt]] during the times of the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918-1939). [[Kazimierz Michałowski]], the founder of the Polish school of Mediterranean archaeology, initiated Polish research in Egypt, and joined as a field director a project of the [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale|French Institute for Oriental Archaeology]] in Cairo (IFAO) at [[Edfu]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Od Edfu do Faras|last=Michałowski|first=Kazimierz|publisher=Wydawnictwa Artystyczne i Filmowe|year=1983|isbn=|location=Warsaw|pages=10, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation was suspended after three seasons because of the outbreak of [[World War II|WWII]]. Twenty years later, despite the tense political situation in the Middle East, Polish archaeologists were back in Egypt. In 1956, they were granted a concession to explore [[Athribis|Tell Atrib]] in the suburbs of [[Banha|Benha]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/pl/wydarzenia/niepodpiete/stulecie-urodzin-k-michalowskiego/|title=Profesor Kazimierz Michałowski i polska szkoła archeologii śródziemnomorskiej|last=Pawlicki|first=Franciszek|date=|website=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but work did not begin until a year later due to the [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 lat polskich wykopalisk w Egipcie i na Bliskim Wschodzie|last=Daszewski|first=Wiktor Andrzej|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=25 lat istnienia Stacji Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 Professor Michałowski established the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw in Cairo, which is still operated today under the name Research Center in Cairo.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Polish archaeologists facing new archaeological tasks, such as coordination of new research, preparing for publication the results of the excavations, contributing to the international [[UNESCO]] campaign to save [[Nubia]]n archaeological heritage, greatly benefitted from having a permanent location in Egypt&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1960 Polish archaeologists began excavations in [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Kiss|first=Zolt|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=117|chapter=Alexandria. Past research}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961–1964, led by Michałowski, they became an important part of the UNESCO campaign to save the archaeological heritage of [[Nubia]], which was to be inundated by the waters of the newly created artificial [[Lake Nasser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture.pl/pl/artykul/skarby-faras-ukryte-w-piaskach-pustyni|title=Skarby Faras ukryte w piaskach pustyni|last=Sural|first=Agnieszka|date=|website=culture.pl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Poles hit the Nubian lottery jackpot",'' reported the international press about the Polish discoveries at [[Faras]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Even as the first season of excavation at Faras was in full swing, Michałowski was approached by the Egyptian authorities to take on the task of completing the restoration of the Upper Terrace of the [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|Temple of Hatshepsut]] in [[Luxor]]. The work in [[Deir el-Bahari]] began in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Szafrański|first=Zbigniew|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=93|chapter=Deir el-Bahari. Temple of Hatshepsut}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Michałowski headed the international committee of experts created by the Egyptian government to rescue the [[Abu Simbel temples|rock temples of Abu Simbel]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Polish Centre in Cairo was named after its founder by the Senate of the [[University of Warsaw]] on 21 December 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 lat polskich wykopalisk w Egipcie i na Bliskim Wschodzie|last=Białkowski|first=Grzegorz|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Wstęp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment and development into a reputed international archaeological institution is considered among his greatest achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadurska|first=Anna|date=1981|title=Nekrologi|url=|journal=Archaeologia|volume=32|pages=244|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After all, "''the current level of culture in any country is measured by whether it runs its own excavations in Egypt,"'' Michałowski used to say.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1980s saw a rapid development of archaeological research with the opening of new sites in Egypt as well as in other countries of the Middle East. This resulted in an administrative reorganization in 1986. The head office was moved to Warsaw, establishing the [[Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology]] of the University of Warsaw in Warsaw in charge of supervising the Research Centre in Cairo as its main branch, as well as all the Polish archaeological missions in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Near East and Northeastern Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2017, there was a dozen or so Polish archaeological missions working in Egypt. Every year several hundred Polish researchers of different specialties, not only archaeologists, from different Polish and foreign scientific institutions participate in research in Egypt.

== Objectives ==
The objectives of the Research Centre in Cairo are as follows:
* to ensure the efficient progress of archaeological and restoration work carried out by Polish missions in Egypt;
* to represent Polish researchers, archaeologists and conservators, to the Egyptian authorities responsible for antiquities, most of all the Ministry of Antiquities, as well as to other archaeological units in Egypt;
* to develop and popularize knowledge, by organizing public lectures and seminars presenting archaeological research in Egypt and Polish achievements in this field, as well as running a reference library allowing the Centre's residents and visitors to access to publications on archaeology and history of the Middle East;
* to provide support for a scholarship program of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Poland, granted to students, graduates and PhD candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/pl/stacja-badawcza-w-kairze/|title=Stacja Badawcze w Kairze|last=|first=|date=|website=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the establishment of the Polish Centre in Warsaw, the Polish Centre in Cairo was headed by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egiptologia.pl/polskie-centrum-archeologii-srodziemnomorskiej-uw/|title=Polska Stacja Badawcza w Kairze|last=Juszczyk-Futkowska|first=K.|date=|website=egiptologia.pl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kazimierz Michałowski (1959–1981)
* Zofia Sztetyłło (Acting Director, 1981)
* Waldemar Chmielewski (1982)
* Wiktor Andrzej Daszewski (1982–1991)
* Michał Gawlikowski (1991–2005)
Since 2005 the Research Center in Cairo has its own Director, subordinated to the Director of the Polish Centre in Warsaw. This office has been held by:
* [[Zbigniew Szafrański|Zbigniew E. Szafrański]] (2005–2015)
* Artur Obłuski (2015 –).

== Polish archaeological missions in Egypt ==
* Polish-Egyptian Archaeological and Conservation Mission at Kom el-Dikka in [[Alexandria]], since 1960. One of the main quarters of the ancient city located in the center of the modern town is among the greatest discoveries of Polish archaeologists in Egypt. Preserving non-stop occupation from the city's founding in the 3rd century BC through the medieval 13th- – 14th-century Islamic burial ground, the site that is visited today as an archaeological park open to tourists encompasses buildings from the 4th through 6th centuries AD, including the oldest known ruins of an institution of higher learning (Alexandria's ancient academy) composed of lecture halls, an assembly hall vel theater or rather odeon, a late Roman imperial bathhouse and a habitation quarter of houses and workshops. Kom el-Dikka is the largest and the most important archaeological site in Alexandria.

* Polish Archaeological Mission at Tell el-Farkha, working since 1998. The site is a settlement on three mounds, located on a major trade route passing through the Nile Delta to the Mediterranean coast and Syria. Its peak development can be dated to the [[Amratian culture|Nagada period]]. Of highest significance among the discoveries are two golden statues of presumed rulers from the pre-Dynastic period, indicating that the site was a power center of some substance in this part of Egypt, before its decline about the time of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, resulting from changing trade routes and the increased importance of water transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.farkha.org/english/stanowisko.html|title=Tell el-Farkha archaeological site|last=|first=|date=|website=Polish Archaeological Expedition to the Eastern Nile Delta - Tell el-Farkha|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish-Egyptian Archaeological Mission at [[Saqqara]], opened in 1987, working regularly since 1997, in a sector of the necropolis located to the west of the oldest [[pyramid]] in the world, the [[Pyramid of Djoser|step-pyramid of Djoser]], built around 2650 BC. Polish archaeologists proved that the site was not an ancient dump, although the tombs discovered there were located in and ancient stone quarry from the Third Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dwadzieścia lat polskich badań w Sakkarze,|last=Myśliwiec|first=Karol|publisher=Wydawnictwo Instytutu Kultur Śródziemnomorskich i Orientalnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lavishly decorated tombs (preserving the ancient polychromed reliefs in excellent condition) belonged to high-ranking nobles from the Sixth Dynasty, such as the vizier [[Merefnebef]] (discovered in 1997) and the admiral Nyankhnefertem, priest and trusted secretary of the pharaoh (discovered in 2003).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Polish Archaeological Mission at Naqlun (Deir el-Malak) in [[Faiyum Oasis|Fayum Oasis]], research since 1986 in a monastic complex established in the 5th century and still functional today. The site comprises scattered hermitages, a central compound of extended monastic buildings, church, refuse dump and two cemeteries, one from the 6th and the other a large medieval Christian cemetery of the 12th–13th century. Finds include pottery, burial textiles, basketry and many others. The written documents: letters, codices, literary texts, psalms and fragments of Gospels, in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], Greek, Arabic and Latin, are evidence of monastic continuity and the level of the monks’ education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Godlewski|first=Włodzimierz|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=176|chapter=Naqlun}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish–Egyptian Archaeological and Conservation Mission at the Temple of [[Hatshepsut]] at [[Deir el-Bahari]], operating since 1961. The main task of the mission is the restoration of the Upper Terrace of this magnificent temple of the New Kingdom Pharaoh-Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.templeofhatshepsut.uw.edu.pl/en|title=About us|last=Szafrański|first=Zbigniew|date=|website=Polish-Egyptian Archaeological Mission at the Temple of Hatshepsut|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Polish Archaeological Mission at Sheikh Abd al-Gurna (“Hermitage Mission”), established in 2003 to study the 6th–8th century AD Coptic hermitage installed in two Middle Kingdom nobles' tombs in Western [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Górecki|first=Tomasz|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=185–186|chapter=Sheikh Abd el-Gurna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the mission has started to investigate the underground parts of the tombs. One of the most interesting finds are fragments of linen with ink-painted hieroglyphs, a gift of [[Ptolemy XII Auletes|Ptolemy XII]], the father of [[Cleopatra]], for the nearby temple at [[Deir el-Medina]].
* Polish–American Mission in [[Baris, Egypt|Berenike]] and the Eastern Desert, excavations since 2008 in the Hellenistic and Roman ruins of the Red Sea port. The port was built in the 3rd century BC, a prime purpose being the import of elephants from eastern Africa for the needs of the Ptolemaic armies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wyborcza.pl/7,75400,21114289,niezwykle-cmentarzysko-zwierzat-domowych-sprzed-2000-lat.html|title=Niezwykłe cmentarzysko zwierząt domowych sprzed 2000 lat|last=Grabowska|first=Joanna|date=13 December 2016|work=Wyborcza|access-date=2017-11-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harbor was an important stop on the major Greek and Roman trade routes to India, from where spices and precious stones were brought, and probably China, from where silk was imported. Incense and myrrh were brought from Arabia. The goods were transported by land from the port to Coptos on the Nile (modern Qift), and then by water to the Nile Delta and further to [[Rome]]. A cemetery of animals (cats, dogs, monkeys) is being excavated on the outskirts of the harbor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5716">'''Risk inclination (RI)''' is defined as a mental disposition (i.e., confidence) toward an eventuality (i.e., a predicted state) that has consequences (i.e., either loss or gain). The '''risk inclination model (RIM)''' is composed of three constructs: confidence weighting, restricted context, and the risk inclination formula. Each of these constructs connects an outside observer with a respondent’s inner state of risk taking toward knowledge certainty.

[[File:Risk Inclination Model (RIM).jpg|thumb|'''RIM''']]

==Confidence weighting==
{{Main|Confidence weighting}}
The [[Confidence weighting|confidence weighting ('''CW''')]] construct is concerned with indices that connect an outside observer to the respondent’s inner state of knowledge certainty toward specific content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ebel |first=R.L. |title=Confidence Weighting and Test Reliability |journal=[[Journal of Educational Measurement]]|volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1965.tb00390.x |pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Kenneth D. |author2=A. Ralph Hakstian |author3=B.R. Hopkins|title=Validity and Reliability Consequences of Confidence Weighting|journal=[[Educational and Psychological Measurement]]|year=1973|volume=33|pages=135–141|doi=10.1177/001316447303300114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beasley|first=Robert E.|title=The Effects of Confidence Weighting on Test Scores and Confidence Weighting Perceptions in the Computing Curriculum|journal=[[Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges]]|year=2012|volume=28|issue=1|pages=91–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jack|first=B.M|author2=Liu, C.J. |author3=Chiu, H.L. |author4=Tsai, C.W. |title=Measuring the Confidence of 8th Grade Taiwanese Students' Knowledge of Acids and Bases|journal=[[International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education]]|year=2012|volume=10|issue=4|pages=889–905|doi=10.1007/s10763-011-9300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underpinning the CW construct of the risk inclination model is the individual's experience of coherence or rightness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mangan |first=B |title=Sensation's Ghost: The Non-Sensory "Fringe" of Consciousness |journal=Psyche |volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to calibrate the relationship between a respondent’s objective and observable measures of risk taking (i.e., weighted indices toward answer selections) with his or her subjective inner feelings of knowledge certainty (i.e., feelings of rightness).

==Restricted context==

The restricted context ('''RC''') construct is based on [[Jean Piaget]]’s theory of equilibration&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book 
|title=Handbook of Child Psychology 
|last=Piaget 
|first=J. 
|year=1983 
|publisher=Wiley 
|location=New York
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and allows the outside observer to measure the way a respondent manages competing inner states of knowledge certainty during the application of confidence weights among items within the restricted total point value (TPV) context of the test. RC sets the parameters where risk taking toward knowledge certainty occurs. These parameters are important because they allow an observer to scale and thereby measure the respondent’s inner state of equilibration among related levels of knowledge certainty. Equilibration is defined as a self-regulatory process that reflects the biological drive to produce an optimal state of balance between a person’s cognitive structures (i.e., inner state) and their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=R. M.|title=Piaget and Vygotsky revisited: Dialogue or assimilation?|journal=Developmental Review|year=1995|volume=15|pages=458–472|doi=10.1006/drev.1995.1019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk inclination formula==

The [[risk inclination formula]] ('''RIF''') construct is based upon [[Varignon's theorem]] and quantifies feelings of rightness toward knowledge certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp?searchtype=basic&amp;pageSize=10&amp;ERICExtSearch_Facet_0=facet_au&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=Brady+Michael+Jack&amp;ERICExtSearch_FacetValue_0=%22Jack%2C+Brady%22&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=au&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;objectId=0900019b8046c889&amp;accno=ED519174&amp;_nfls=false |title=Utilitarian Model of Confidence Testing for Knowledge-based Societies |last1=Jack |first1=B.M. |last2=Hung |first2=K.M.|last3=Liu |first3=C.J.|last4=Chiu |first4=H.L.|publisher=ERIC |id= ED519174}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Coxeter|Coxeter, H. S. M.]] and Greitzer, S. L. "Quadrangle; Varignon's theorem" §3.1 in Geometry Revisited. Washington, DC: Math. Assoc. Amer., pp. 52&amp;ndash;54, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; RIF uses the Principle of Moments or Varignon’s Theorem to calculate the first factorial moment of probability in order to define this center point of balance among all confidence weights (i.e., the point of Risk Equilibration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coxeter|first=H. S. M.|title=Quadrangles: Varignon's Theorem. Geometry Revisited|year=1967|publisher=The Mathematical Association of America|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=D. P.|title=Engineering Mechanics|year=2010|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=New Delhi, India|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal derivation of the RIF is divided into three separate calculations: (1) calculation of the first factorial moment, (2) calculation of inclination, and (3) calculation of the risk inclination score.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">A '''short-term exposure limit''' ('''STEL''') is the acceptable average exposure over a short period of time, usually 15 minutes as long as the time-weighted average is not exceeded.  

STEL is a term used in [[occupational health]], [[industrial hygiene]] and [[toxicology]].  The STEL may be a [[law|legal]] limit in the [[United States]] for exposure of an employee to a [[chemical substance]].  The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (U.S. OSHA) has set OSHA-STELs for [[1,3-Butadiene]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10087 29CFR1910.1051]&lt;/ref&gt; [[benzene]]   &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10042 29CFR1910.1028]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ethylene oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10070 29CFR1910.1047]&lt;/ref&gt;  For chemicals, STEL assessments are usually done for 15 minutes and expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm), or sometimes in [[milligram]]s per cubic meter (mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

The [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] publishes a more extensive list of  STELs as [[threshold limit value]]s (TLV-STEL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acgih.org/home.htm American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''synthetic radioisotope''' is a [[radionuclide]] that is not found in nature: no natural process or mechanism exists which produces it, or it is so unstable that it decays away in a very short period of time. Examples include [[technetium]]-95 and [[promethium]]-146. Many of these are found in, and harvested from, [[spent nuclear fuel]] assemblies. Some must be manufactured in [[particle accelerator]]s.

==Production==
Some synthetic radioisotopes are extracted from spent [[nuclear reactor]] fuel rods, which contain various [[fission products]]. For example, it is estimated that up to 1994, about 49,000 [[Becquerel|terabecquerels ]] (78 [[tonne|metric ton]]) of [[technetium]] was produced in nuclear reactors, which is by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoshihara|first1=K|editor1-last=Yoshihara|editor1-first=K|editor2-last=Omori|editor2-first=T|title=Technetium and Rhenium Their Chemistry and Its Applications|date=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-59469-7|chapter=Technetium in the environment|series=Topics in Current Chemistry|volume=176|doi=10.1007/3-540-59469-8_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some synthetic isotopes are produced in significant quantities by fission but are not yet being reclaimed.  Other isotopes are manufactured by [[neutron]] irradiation of parent isotopes in a nuclear reactor (for example, Tc-97 can be made by neutron irradiation of Ru-96) or by bombarding parent isotopes with high energy particles from a particle accelerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radioisotope Production|url=http://www.bnl.gov/medical/Isotope_Distribution/Isodistoff.htm|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106040156/http://www.bnl.gov/medical/Isotope_Distribution/Isodistoff.htm|archivedate=6 January 2010|date=2009|deadurl=bot: unknown|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual for reactor produced radioisotopes.|date=2003|publisher=IAEA|location=Vienna|isbn=92-0-101103-2|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/IAEABooks/6407/Manual-for-Reactor-Produced-Radioisotopes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many isotopes are produced in [[cyclotron]]s, for example [[fluorine-18]] and [[oxygen-15]] which are widely used for [[positron emission tomography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cyclotron Produced Radionuclides: Physical Characteristics and Production Methods|date=2009|publisher=IAEA|location=Vienna|isbn=978-92-0-106908-5|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/iaeabooks/7892/Cyclotron-Produced-Radionuclides-Physical-Characteristics-and-Production-Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Most synthetic radioisotopes have a short [[half-life]]. Though a health hazard, radioactive materials have many medical and industrial uses.

===Nuclear medicine===
The field of [[nuclear medicine]] covers use of radioisotopes for diagnosis or treatment.

====Diagnosis====
Radioactive tracer compounds, [[radiopharmaceutical]]s, are used to observe the function of various organs and body systems. These compounds use a chemical tracer which is attracted to or concentrated by the activity which is being studied. That chemical tracer incorporates a short lived radioactive isotope, usually one which emits a [[gamma ray]] which is energetic enough to travel through the body and be captured outside by a [[gamma camera]] to map the concentrations. [[Gamma camera]]s and other similar detectors are highly efficient, and the tracer compounds are generally very effective at concentrating at the areas of interest, so the total amounts of radioactive material needed are very small.

The metastable [[nuclear isomer]] Tc-99m is a [[gamma-ray]] emitter widely used for medical diagnostics because it has a short half-life of 6 hours, but can be easily made in the hospital using a [[technetium-99m generator]]. Weekly global demand for the parent isotope [[molybdenum-99]] was {{convert|12000|Ci|TBq|lk=out|order=flip|abbr=on}} in 2010, overwhelmingly provided by fission of [[uranium-235]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production and Supply of Molybdenum-99|url=https://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC54/GC54InfDocuments/English/gc54inf-3-att7_en.pdf|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Several radioisotopes and compounds are used for [[Unsealed source radiotherapy|medical treatment]], usually by bringing the radioactive isotope to a high concentration in the body near a particular organ. For example, [[iodine]]-131 is used for treating some disorders and tumors of the [[thyroid]] gland.

===Industrial radiation sources===
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}
[[Alpha particle]], [[beta particle]], and [[gamma ray]] radioactive emissions are industrially useful. Most sources of these are synthetic radioisotopes. Areas of use include the [[Uses of radioactivity in oil and gas wells|petroleum industry]], [[industrial radiography]], [[homeland security]], [[process control]] and [[food irradiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenblatt|first1=Jack A.|title=Stable and Radioactive Isotopes: Industry &amp; Trade Summary|url=https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/ITS-1.pdf|website=Office of Industries|publisher=United States International Trade Commission|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rivard|first1=Mark J.|last2=Bobek|first2=Leo M.|last3=Butler|first3=Ralph A.|last4=Garland|first4=Marc A.|last5=Hill|first5=David J.|last6=Krieger|first6=Jeanne K.|last7=Muckerheide|first7=James B.|last8=Patton|first8=Brad D.|last9=Silberstein|first9=Edward B.|title=The US national isotope program: Current status and strategy for future success|journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes|date=August 2005|volume=63|issue=2|pages=157–178|doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2005.03.004|url=https://www.isotopes.gov/outreach/reports/Rivard.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branch|first1=Doug|title=Radioactive Isotopes in Process Measurement|url=https://www.controlglobal.com/assets/12WPpdf/121105-vega-isotopes-measurement.pdf|publisher=VEGA Controls|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinavia''''' is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] study of [[Norse paganism]] in Late Iron Age Scandinavia. It was written by the English archaeologist [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]], then a professor at the [[University of Aberdeen]], and first published by the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at [[Uppsala University]] in 2002. A revised second edition is due to be published in 2017 by Oxbow Books.

Price had worked on the subject of Norse paganism for his doctoral thesis, undertaken between 1988 and 2002, first at the [[University of York]], England and then at the University of Uppsala, Sweden. Although primarily archaeological, Price took an interdisciplinary approach to the subject, drawing evidence from other disciplines such as [[history]] and [[anthropology]].

Divided into seven chapters, Price opened the book with a discussion of his [[archaeological theory|theoretical approach]], before providing an overview of what is known of pre-Christian Norse religion and magic from both literary and archaeological studies. He then moves into providing a deeper study of ''[[Seiðr]]'', or Norse magical practices, identifying [[shamanism|shamanic]] elements within it.

The book would be widely acclaimed by archaeologists working in European archaeology, and praised as a model for both future interdisciplinary research and for understanding past religious beliefs from an archaeological perspective.

==Background==
The origins of ''The Viking Way'' came from Price's doctoral research, which he undertook at the [[University of York]]'s Department of Archaeology from October 1988 through to May 1992. Under the supervision of the archaeologists Steve Roskams and Richard Hall, Price had initially focused his research on the Anglo-Scandinavian tenements at 16&amp;ndash;22 [[Coppergate Shopping Centre|Coppergate]] in York, although eventually moved away from this to focus on archaeology within Scandinavia itself.&lt;ref name="Price 2002 13"&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal circumstances meant that Price was unable to finish his doctoral thesis at York, and in 1992 he emigrated to [[Sweden]], where he spent the following five years working as a field archaeologist. Despite his full-time employment, he continued to be engaged in archaeological research in a private capacity, publishing a series of academic papers and presenting others at conferences. In 1996 joined the Department of Archaeology at the [[University of Uppsala]] as a research scholar, beginning full-time work there the following year. At Uppsala, he went on to complete his doctoral thesis and gain his [[PhD]] under the supervision of Anne-Sofie Gräslund.&lt;ref name="Price 2002 14"&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In undertaking research for his doctoral thesis, Price took great interest in circumpolar shamanism, attending academic conferences on this subject and reading much published material that had been produced by anthropologists. He found that much of the data which he collected in this area was ultimately of little use for his thesis, and so he included it in an edited anthology which he put together entitled ''[[The Archaeology of Shamanism]]'' (2001).&lt;ref name="Price 2002 17"&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 1: Different Vikings? Towards a cognitive archaeology of the later Iron Age===
Price opens ''The Viking Way'' with a discussion of why he chose to write the book, noting how he wanted to understand the mindset of the Scandinavians living in the Viking Age; in his own words, the book is his attempt to "write an explicitly 'cognitive' archaeology of the Vikings".&lt;ref name="Price 2002 25-27"&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 25&amp;ndash;27.&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeds to explain his interdisciplinary approach to the subject of Norse paganism, drawing from textual sources as well as archaeology. Noting that this is a view that has been championed by [[post-processualism|post-processualists]] like [[Ian Hodder]], he proceeds to discuss the manner in which the Scandinavian Late Iron Age is simultaneously viewed as the final period of [[prehistory]] and the first of the [[medieval]].&lt;ref name="Price 2002 27-37"&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 27&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Price goes on to discuss the role of [[cognitive archaeology]] and its multiple problems, but nonetheless defends his position in taking a cognitive archaeological approach within his study. He then highlights the rise of [[Fourth World]] archaeology, a sub-section of world archaeology that focuses on the histories of contemporary [[indigenous people]]s, and notes the impact which this has on his study, in particular regarding his work with the [[Sami people]] of Northern Europe. He highlights the need to recognise that modern archaeologists have many problems facing the cognitive understandings of past people like the Norse, arguing for the need to take an approach which he terms "odd archaeology", recognising the "oddness" of societies other than our own. He contrasts this "odd archaeology" with [[queer theory|queer archaeology]], which focuses on the study of deviants within any given society. He then rounds off the chapter by summarising the rest of ''The Viking Way'''s contents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 38&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 2: Problems and paradigms in the study of Old Norse sorcery===
After offering an overview of what is known about [[Norse mythology]] from surviving Scandinavian literary sources, Price continues to discuss the various research perspectives that have been adopted by past scholars investigating Norse paganism, including those of  [[philology|philologists]] and specialists in [[religious studies]]. Focusing on the pre-Christian religions themselves, he then discusses Iron Age Scandinavian beliefs regarding deities such as [[Odin|Óðinn]] and [[Thor|Þórr]]. Price moves on to look at the wide variety of other supernatural entities that existed within the Norse world-view: the servants of the gods (i.e. the ''[[valkyrie|valkyrja]]'' and [[Huginn and Muninn]]), the beings with cosmological purpose (i.e. the ''[[Norns|Nornir]]''), the ''[[Jötunn|Jötnar]]'', the supernatural beings of nature (i.e. ''[[dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dvergr]]'' and elves), 'spirits' and projections of the human soul. He then discusses the evidence for temples and sacred spaces in Iron Age Scandinavia, and the various priestly figures who would have carried out cultic functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 39&amp;ndash;62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second part of the chapter, Price looks more specifically at the Norse magical practices, known as ''[[Seiðr]]''. Noting that there were specific terms applying to different forms of magical practice in the Norse context, such as ''[[Galdr]]'' and ''Gandr'', he also highlights the fact that sorcery was intricately connected to cultic practice. He then proceeds to look at the various literary sources which refer to ''Seiðr'', such as the [[Skald|Skaldic poetry]], [[Poetic Edda|Eddic poetry]], the sagas of the kings, [[Sagas of Icelanders|sagas of the Icelanders]], the ''[[Legendary saga|fornaldarsǫgur]]'', the ''Biskupasǫgur'', law codes and also several non-Scandinavian sources. Finally, he offers an overview of earlier scholarly research into ''Seiðr'', discussing a variety of studies published from the 19th century through to the beginning of the 21st.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 63&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 3: Seiðr===
[[Image:Ardre Odin Sleipnir.jpg|thumb|Óðinn riding on his eight-legged horse Sleipnir, depicted on the [[Tjängvide image stone]]. Price describes the god's association with sorcery and shamanism.]]
The third chapter is devoted to an examination of the literary and archaeological evidence for ''Seiðr'' practices in Norse society. Price starts with an examination of the god Óðinn, noting his literary associations with sorcery and shamanism, as well as identifying the shamanic and magical associations of those supernatural beings that served him, such as his horse [[Sleipnir]] and ravens [[Huginn and Muninn]]. Furthermore, he lists a total of 240 names which have been applied to Óðinn in the Norse literature, illustrating his multi-faceted role in Norse religion. Moving on to look at another deity, Freyja, Price discusses her association with magic and sorcery, before then discussing shamanistic and magical elements in pagan Norse cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 97&amp;ndash;111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Price goes on to look at the "performers" of ''Seiðr'', the majority of whom were apparently female. He discusses various references to female magicians in Old Norse literature, and looks into the multitude of different words used for them, arguing that some of them may have referred to different categories of magician. He then proceeds to discuss male magicians, who were a minority in the surviving literature, being viewed as deviants who had committed ''[[ergi]]''. He moves on to deal with accounts of the ''Seiðr''-workers' assistants in the literature, before turning his attention to the burial evidence for Norse magical practitioners. Here, he notes that both inhumation and crematory burial can be interpreted as perhaps being the resting place of sorcerers if they are buried with items which likely had magical uses, such as staffs and narcotics. As evidence, Price highlights a number of Viking Age graves that have been excavated in Scandinavia and found to contain potentially magical items; this includes three inhumation burials at [[Birka]] in the town of [[Björkö, Ekerö|Björkö]] in [[Uppland]], and two cremation burials at Klinta in Köpings parish, [[Öland]], all of which were in Sweden, as well as a Danish grave from the cemetery at [[Fyrkat]] in [[Jylland]] and another from the Swedish cemetery at [[Aska Hundred|Aska]] in Hagebyhöga parish, [[Östergötland]]. Looking at the [[Oseberg ship|Oseburg ship burial]] in Norway, he then looks at the burial of what appears to be an Anglo-Scandinavian individual from the [[Danelaw]] whom was discovered at [[Peel Castle]] on the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 111&amp;ndash;161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Price carries on by looking at the "performance" of ''Seiðr'' itself, discussing the potential use of ritual architecture and space, dealing with literary and archaeological evidence for ''seiðhjaller'' platforms, chair pendants, door frames and empty ritual space (''útiseta''). He follows this with a study of the clothes that magical practitioners may have worn, discussing ideas regarding masks, veils and head coverings. Debating whether they made use of drums in their performance of ''Seiðr'', he then undertakes a study of the use of staffs and wands in Nordic magic, highlighting the existence of a number of metal and wooden staffs found in the archaeological record. Moving on, he looks at the evidence for the [[entheogen]]ic use of narcotics and intoxicants such as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[henbane]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. He then rounds off this section of the chapter with a discussion of charms, songs and chants, as well as debating whether we can understand the role of [[trance]] and [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] in ''seiðr''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 162&amp;ndash;209.&lt;/ref&gt; Price proceeds to deal with the [[gender]] concepts surrounding ''seiðr'', and the fact that male practitioners of sorcery were viewed as social and sexual deviants who had committed ''ergi''. Looking at the role of Óðinn as sorcerer under the lens of [[queer theory]], Price then discusses the evidence that ''Seiðr'' practices offered involved sexual acts such as [[masturbation]]. Moving on, he looks at the Norse concept of the soul, and the idea that ''seiðr'' practitioners could command spirits known as ''[[gandir]]''. Finally, the chapter is brought to an end with a discussion of the domestic uses of ''seiðr'', including divination, healing, hunting and weather magic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 210&amp;ndash;232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 4: ''Noaidevuohta''===
{{Empty section|date=January 2012}}

===Part 5: Circumpolar religion and the question of Old Norse shamanism===

Proceeding to discuss evidence for shamanism in Scandinavia, Price casts a critical eye on previous scholarship that has argued for the existence of shamanistic beliefs and practices from the Paleolithic through to the Viking Age, being particularly critical of Jimmy Strassburg's work. He then looks at the arguments that have previously been put forward describing ''seiðr'' as shamanic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 312&amp;ndash;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic reviews===
''The Viking Way'' was reviewed in the journal ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' by Matthew Townend of the [[University of York]]'s Centre for Medieval Studies. Townend was of the opinion that Price's "exceptional" work represented "one of the most important contributions to Viking studies in recent years, quite possibly in recent decades", dealing as it did with the neglected area of magic in the Viking world. Praising Price's work as being "logical, persuasive and theoretically astute", he found much to commend it, opining that it had much to teach archaeologists, while at the same time being "very easy" to read, written in a prose style which was "lucid, and often stylish and witty". Furthermore, praising the use of illustrations and bibliography, he did however comment that the book would have been improved by the inclusion of an index.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tow03|Townend 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Fornvännen]]'', the archaeologist [[Martin Carver]] of the [[University of York]] praised ''The Viking Way'' as a work of "impeccable and comprehensive scholarship", but noted that a better title might have been ''The Viking Mind''. He commended the interdisciplinary approach that Carver utilized, noting that very few contemporary archaeologists had successfully taken such an approach, and expressed his opinion that Price had written a "spellbinding" work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car04|Carver 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider academic reception===
In his book ''Shamanism in Norse Myth and Magic'' (2009), the English scholar Clive Tolley noted that his work overlapped with Price's ''The Viking Way'' in several respects, but that Price's work focused on an archaeological rather than a literary approach to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tol09|Tolley 2009]]. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing Tolley's work in the ''[[Time and Mind]]'' journal, historian [[Ronald Hutton]] commented that Price's study had gained "much admiration" for its multidisciplinary approach. Comparing Price and Tolley's research, Hutton opined that the former played up the importance of Sami shamanic elements entering southern Scandinavia, while Tolley played it down, approaches that can be balanced with one another.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut11|Hutton 2011]]. pp. 225&amp;ndash;226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in his opening paper, "Agency, Intellect and the Archaeological Agenda", published in the academic anthology ''[[Signals of Belief in Early England|Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited]]'' (2010), Martin Carver quoted from Price's book, before remarking that this "remarkable" work has "done much to make the study of non-Christian religion once more respectable among archaeologists."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22892">'''Theoretical psychology''' is concerned with theoretical and philosophical aspects of [[psychology]]. It is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]] with a wide scope of study. It focuses on combining and incorporating existing and developing theories of psychology non-experimentally.  Theoretical psychology originated from the [[philosophy of science]], with [[logic]] and [[rationality]] at the base of each new idea. It existed before [[Empirical psychology|empirical]] or [[experimental psychology]]. Theoretical psychology is an interdisciplinary field involving psychologists specializing in a wide variety of psychological branches. There have been a few prominent pioneers of theoretical psychology such as [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[William James]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[John B. Watson]]. There has also been a number of notable contributors which include [[Jerome Kagan]], [[Alan E. Kazdin]], [[Robert Sternberg]], [[Kenneth J. Gergen]], and [[Ulric Neisser]]. These contributors often publish in a variety of journals including the most prominent for theoretical psychology, the ''[[Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology]]''. Many other organizations are beginning to recognize theoretical psychology as a formal subdivision of psychology.

==Origin==

Theoretical psychology emerged from [[philosophy]], more specifically, from the [[philosophy of science]]. Philosophy strives to understand nature and structure of concepts, the laws in which these concepts occur, and the theories that combine the laws together. One of these specific branches of philosophy of science is theoretical psychology. Philosophy of science does not use the [[scientific method]] to empirically derive ideas about the physical world through conducting experiments and interpreting results. However, it is still about science with an emphasis on the logic and rationality behind science itself, bringing to light what cannot be explained by empirical measures. It is also [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] and epistemologically focused on all humans while incorporating the nature and essence of [[human knowledge]]. Just as the philosophy of science is to science, theoretical psychology is to psychology in that it is the logic and rationality applied to [[concepts]], [[laws]], and [[theories]]. Theoretical psychology is not in place to discern which theories are more truthful or more correctly. Many consider theoretical psychology as the support or rationalization of an "idea" within psychological theory that is more "truthful". However, this is not the case. Theoretical psychology is scientifically grounded in ideas of what is known through epistemology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bergmann, Gustav. "THEORETICAL PSYCHOLOGY." ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY. Vol. 4. Palo Alto: ANNUAL REVIEWS, 1953. 435-458.{{doi|10.1146/annurev.ps.04.020153.002251}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Theoretical psychology existed long before any branches of traditional empirical and [[experimental psychology]]. Because of this, there is much more depth and breadth of knowledge from which to draw. This also makes it less common for new developments to come about in the present day because many "new" approaches are drawing from and revitalizing past theories. This brings new knowledge, frames of reference, and mindsets to these foundational theories.  This may be due to Ideas taking longer to develop and gain momentum than related fields in empirical based psychology.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Relationship to philosophy and scope==

Theoretical psychology is a rational, non-experimental approach to [[psychology]]. In psychology, as with any field of study, there are three [[Philosophy|philosophical]] perspectives and methodologies of ways to derive knowledge about the reality of the world. [[Rationalism]] (use of intellect and reason of the mind), [[Empiricism]] (use of our individually experienced sensorium), and [[Skepticism]] (knowledge beyond mere appearance that is not able to be studied) characterize the three perspectives in understanding theoretical concepts relating to laws which help to understand larger theoretical theories.&lt;ref&gt;https://drummondphilosophy.wikispaces.com/Scepticism,+Rationalism+and+Empiricism&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the philosophical perspectives, rationalism is the most pertinent to this discipline of psychology. Theoretical psychology is not experimental or clinically based and focuses on non-experimental ways to acquire knowledge about psychological topics.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It explores the theoretical knowledge behind its encompassed ideologies.  Oftentimes this includes, but is not limited to, non-experimental critiques to different schools of thought, and the usefulness of psychological concepts. Theoretical psychology is a discipline that bases its information through inference, as opposed to empirically acquired information. Hypotheses are then exchanged and further built upon from different perspectives. Theoretical Psychology also deals with manipulating non-scientific, common words ([[Construct (philosophy)|hypothetical constructs]]) into scientifically objective terms ([[intervening variable]]s). Theoretical psychology requires full agreement on the different viewpoints to be able to see the point as a theory. As a result, many of its topics remain in continuous debate.

Theoretical psychology is the [[Psychology of reasoning|logic of psychology]] and all of its components. This means when theories within psychology oppose or compete, theoretical psychology does not select which is correct. It describes the nature and composition of psychology's many ideas. To explain the logic of psychology, there has been a conclusion of the principles belonging to the three classified areas. Psychology is built on the principle of being able to reference [[Behaviorism|observable behavior]], [[physical environment]], and/or [[Mood (psychology)|physiological states]]. Theoretical psychology is an important aspect that continues to play a role in modern psychology. While there are some downfalls to theoretical psychology, there are also strengths and benefits it brings to the field.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucey, K. (2015). Pesky essays on the logic of philosophy. Reno, Nevada: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope that theoretical psychology covers is vast.  Professionals have the opportunity to use this method of seeking out theoretical knowledge to begin research in a variety of subjects. This allows for a great deal of knowledge to be explored by means of inference rather than seeking out tangible data to draw ideas. Theoretical psychology is an interdisciplinary field involving psychologists specializing in [[cognitive psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[clinical psychology]], [[perceptual psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[biological psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[Cultural-historical psychology|historical psychology]], [[economic psychology]], [[political psychology]], and [[critical psychology]].  It is important to acknowledge these fields do not discount empiricism, but rather explore new ideas with a theoretical approach first.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Pioneers==
A brief history into the field of theoretical psychology includes some prominent pioneers. To begin, [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1874) originally worked as a professor of philosophy. His focus was on the subjective study of an individual's [[consciousness]], he believed that this was a key factor to the field of psychology. This aspect of psychology was unable to be shown with a large amount of empirical evidence, but remained a theory throughout the history of Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=W|title=Retracing the Footsteps of Wilhelm Wundt: Explorations in the Disciplinary Frontiers of psychology and in vokerpsychologie|journal=History of Psychology|date=2009|volume=4|issue=12|pages=229–265|doi=10.1037/a0017711}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, [[William James]] (1890) worked as a psychologist and a philosopher. His career focused around the idea of [[free will]], which is theoretical in nature. He also assisted in forming the [[James-Lange theory]] of [[emotion]], which is based upon many theoretical factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leary|first1=D.E.|title=Overcoming Blindness: Some historical reflections on qualitative psychology|journal=Qualitative Psychology|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Doherty|first1=K|title=Relational Being|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|date=2011|volume=1|issue=31|pages=61–64|doi=10.1037/a0022548}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Sigmund Freud]] (1905) was also an important pioneer for theoretical psychology. Freud founded the [[psychoanalytic theory]] of psychology. He did not rely on empirical data when making his theories, but instead looked for philosophical explanations. Freud often shared his view that he did not need empirical evidence for his theory, because he simply knew it is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Solomon|first1=M.|title=Psychopathology of everyday life: a critical review of Dr. Sigmund Freud's theories|journal=The Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1916|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–33|doi=10.1037/qup0000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=D.E.|title=Freud's Psychology|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2014|volume=4|issue=7|pages=109–128|doi=10.1037/qup0000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another pioneer was [[John B. Watson]] (1913). Watson founded the theory of [[behaviorism]] in psychology through the article "Psychology as a Behaviorist Views It".  Although Behaviorism has a strong emphasis on empirical psychology, forming the methods cannot be empirically tested, and is therefore considered theoretical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=John. B.|title=Psychology as a Behaviorist Views it|journal=Psychological Review|date=March 1913|volume=2|issue=20|pages=158–177|doi=10.1037/h0074428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slife|first1=B.D|title=Toward a Theoretical Psychology:Should a subdiscipline be formally recognized?|journal=American Psychologist|date=1997|volume=2|issue=52|pages=117–129|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.52.2.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable contributors==

There are some notable individuals that have, and continue to make a large impact on theoretical psychology.  [[Jerome Kagan]]'s (1971) work on [[personality traits]] and [[aging]], [[emotion]], and [[temperament]] could be considered theoretical psychology due to Kagen dedicating much of his work to psychology constructs, specifically to the developmental psychology.  As a science gains new empirical procedures it also generates new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jerome Kagen|journal=American Psychologist|volume=4|issue=43|pages=223–225|doi=10.1037/h0091993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of cognitive–behavioral therapies|Donald Meichenbaum]] (1977) had work that focused on [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]. Meichenbaum did the majority of his work in the field of cognitive psychology.  He compared his theory to [[Pandora's box]]. Its main focus is connecting [[cognitive processes]] and relations to things such as clients' feelings, behavior, and consequences of these. It also factors in physiologic and social cultural processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donald|first1=Meichenbaum|title=Changing Conceptions of Cognitive Behavior Modification: Retrospect and Prospect.|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=1993|volume=2|issue=61|pages=202–204|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.61.2.202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan E. Kazdin]] (1980) had theories that focuses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as a style in children and adolescence. He focuses on child and adolescent [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]] such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and conduct problems. His writings on research strategies and methods have set a high standard for rigor in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alan E. Kazdin|journal=American Psychologist|date=2011|volume=8|issue=66|pages=682–698|doi=10.1037/a0024502}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Sternberg]]'s (1990) main focus revolves around some theoretical idea that include; [[creativity]], [[wisdom]], [[Collaborative method|thinking styles]], [[love]], and [[hate]]. Sternberg often includes politically charged articles that focus on admissions testing and general intelligence. He performed both empirically driven and theoretical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sternberg|first1=R.J|title=Teaching for creativity: The Sounds of Silence|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics|date=2015|volume=2|issue=9|pages=115–117|doi=10.1037/aca0000007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kenneth J. Gergen]]'s (1991) work on social psychology as history was used towards generative theories, realities and relationships, the saturated self, positive aging, and relational being. He included many theoretical ideas such as culture and science, assumptions, views on [[mental illness]], and relations.  Many of his idea's were theoretical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gergen|first1=K.J.|title=Process Without Foundations|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|volume=3|issue=34|pages=195–199|doi=10.1037/a0035424}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulric Neisser]](1995) has work that's related to [[cognitive psychology]], specifically the idea of [[flashbulb memories]].  Although he used empirical data to test this idea, he originally took the concept from theoretical work.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cutting|first1=J.E|title=Ulric Neisser|journal=American Psychologist|volume=6|issue=67|page=492|doi=10.1037/a0029351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These individual's and many others continue to impact psychology with theoretical ideas that may or may not be yet supported by empirical data.

==Modern organizational support==

The [[American Psychological Association]] has the division of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology as Division 24. Theoretical Ideas are also associated to the division of [[humanistic psychology]] (32). According to the American Psychological Association, "Division 24: Society for Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology encourages and facilitates informed exploration and discussion of psychological theories and issues in both their scientific and philosophical dimensions and interrelationships." The International Society for Theoretical Psychology, the Section of History and Philosophy of Psychology (25) of the Canadian Psychological Society, the Section of History and Philosophy of psychology of the [[British Psychological Society]], the International Human Science Conference, and the [[Society for Philosophy and Psychology]] also offer organizational support. Universities that currently have Theoretical Psychology/Human Science programs include [[Duquesne University]], the [[University of Dallas]], [[Seattle University]], [[West Georgia College]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Alberta]], [[York University]], [[Brigham Young University]], [[University of Notre Dame]], And [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

==Research methods==

Theoretical psychology works together with empirical psychology to form a symbiotic relationship. Theoretical psychology is not constrained by empirical research or laboratory studies. It allows for scientists to freely search for knowledge that we have yet to be able to study empirically or are not yet capable of studying empirically. For theoretical psychology, its strength lies in the realm of rationality, focused on big picture ideas. However, on its own it is not a complete way to gain particular knowledge of reality. This is where the empirical based branches of psychology has strength. Theoretical psychology can more heavily rely on an idea about human nature that is universal, even when it is not known why or how this particular trend happens in the world, either individualistically or collectively. [[Empirical psychology]] is what allows for humans to make insights on these big picture ideas at a more palatable, applicable and individualistic and way that gives practical information about reality. Theoretical psychology is not a universal psychological theory able to explain all topics without the use of empirical research.  Theoretical psychology is not fundamental or comprehensive theory of psychology, rather, for theoretical psychology to operate correctly it is  important to supplement empirical psychology and give reason to topics and produce theories until they can be empirically verified by the other branches of psychology.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Issues in methodology and practice==

[[Humans]] have innate wonder, exploring many topics through experience and perception. From this wonder, individuals rationally reflects on their own experiences about a specific topic. Then the individual practices [[dialectics]], examining what others have said about the topic being explored with the hopes of finding a particular knowledge about the topic. Theoretical psychology serves as the bridge between the philosophical roots of psychology and the present day empirical psychology. This bridge has an emphasis and focus on forming concepts from moments of explicit behavior that are observable, excluding introspective mental events within [[Consciousness|individual consciousness]]. Psychological laws are created from these observable behaviors that are derived from one concept that also contain concepts from the individual’s environment of internal physiological states. These laws are categorized into [[causal]] ([[statistical]]) or [[deterministic]]/[[mechanistic]] (nonstatistical) categories which relate simultaneous parallel traits or predict future from present or past respectively.  Then these laws are organized into theories based on connections logically deduced together and open to new laws yet to be discovered or empirically verified. The ultimate and logically possible goal of theoretical psychology is to create an exact and comprehensive psychological theory. However, the concepts that are immediately observable are still abstract and difficult to define even in a basic law in an important solid theory as they relate to no physical object we can make sense of or interact with using our sensorium and empirical approaches. They are not instantiated in the world and in virtue of this they are called [[Theoretical definition|theoretical concepts]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Significance==

Theoretical psychology has many aspects that can be viewed as positive or negative, which depends on the interpreter. Theoretical psychology can play an important and also unique role in the field such that almost any claim can be reasonably thought of as true if it is theoretically appealing and empirically supported by research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Edelman, S. (2012). Six
Challenges to Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology. ''Frontiers in Psychology'', ''3'', 219. http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00219&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists must be strategic and knowledgeable when shifting through experimental psychology as the field grows. This can be beneficial in the sense that individuals know theorists have made a deliberated effort when analyzing the research surrounding a theory. However, for those who are not familiar with the theoretical psychology surrounding a theory, the abundant amount of information contributing to a theory can be overwhelming.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, theories can be extremely resistant to change. As theories compete, and different evidence emerges, prior theories can be extremely difficult to change. This can make it difficult for new theories to gain traction within the field of psychology. This [[Psychological resilience|resiliency]] may in part be due to theories stated in ways that are worded too abstractly, ineffectively, and contradictory at times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One challenge of theoretical psychology is the difficulty to explain [[consciousness]]: there are many competing theories revolving around consciousness, and theoretical psychology struggles to fully explain or justify consciousness. Researchers have an extremely difficult time studying it, despite there being an entire field of psychology completely dedicated to consciousness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Theoretical psychology can be extremely beneficial because it brings together scientific ideas and philosophical ideas of psychology. Integrating these ideas contributes to the knowledge of psychology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Journals==

The fields of [[humanistic]] and  [[existential]], as well as the [[Social constructionism|Social Constructionist perspective]] of psychology, all have been fundamental to some of the first theoretical ideas as it pertains to modern theoretical psychology. Today, there are many journals that include theoretical articles. These journals include the following:&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;
