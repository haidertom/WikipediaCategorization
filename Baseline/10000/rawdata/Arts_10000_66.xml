The '''1-euro coin''' ('''€1''') is a [[euro coin]] with a value of one [[euro]] (€1). It is made of two [[alloy]]s: the inner part of [[cupronickel]], the outer part of nickel [[brass]]. All coins have a common reverse side and country-specific national sides. The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.

As of July 2015, there were approximately 6.7 billion one-euro coins in circulation, constituting 26.4% of all circulated euro coins by value and 5.9% by quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/euro/circulation/html/index.en.html|title=Banknotes and coins circulation|accessdate=2015-09-11}} See "Circulation of euro coins, quantities report and data" and "Circulation of euro coins, values report and data" in the "Alternative data formats" section.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The coin dates from 2002, when euro coins and [[euro banknotes|banknotes]] were introduced in the twelve-member [[Eurozone]] and its [[Eurozone#Use outside the Union|related territories]]. The common side was designed by [[Luc Luycx]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] artist who won a Europe-wide competition to design the new coins. The design of the one and two euro coins was intended to show the [[European Union]] (EU) as a whole with the then 15 countries more closely joined together than on the 10- to 50-cent coins (the 1- to 5-cent coins showed the EU as one, though intending to show its place in the world).

There were then 15 versions of the national sides (eurozone + [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] who could mint their own) and in each case there was a national competition to decide the design, which had to comply with uniform specifications, such as the requirement to include twelve stars (see [[euro coins]]). National designs were not allowed to change until the end of 2008, unless a [[monarch]] (whose portrait usually appears on the coins) died or abdicated. This happened in Monaco and the Vatican City, resulting in three new designs in circulation (the Vatican had an interim ''[[sede vacante]]'' design until the new [[Pope]] was elected). National designs have seen some changes, as they are now required to include the name of the issuing country: previously neither Finland nor Belgium showed this. {{as of|2010}}, Austria, Germany and Greece are obliged to change their designs due this requirement in the future.

As the [[Member state of the European Union|EU's membership]] has since [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanded]] in 2004 and 2007, with further expansions envisaged, the common face of all euro coins of values of 10 cents and above were redesigned in 2007 to show a new map. This map showed Europe, not just the EU, as one continuous landmass; however [[Cyprus]] was moved west as the map cut off after the [[Bosphorus]] (which was seen as excluding [[Turkey]] for political reasons). The 2007 redesign coincided with the first enlargement of the [[eurozone]] in that year, with the entry of [[Slovenia]]. Hence, the Slovenian design was added to the designs in circulation. Since then designs for [[Cyprus]], [[Malta]], [[Slovakia]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] have been added as each of these states joined the eurozone. [[Andorra]] began minting its own designs in 2014 after winning the right to do so.

==Design==
[[File:EUR 1 edge (2007 issue).png|thumb|Edge of all €1 coins]]
The coins are composed of two alloys. The inner circle is composed of three layers ([[Cupronickel|copper-nickel]], [[nickel]], copper-nickel) and the outer ring of nickel [[brass]], giving the coin a two-colour appearance. The coin has a diameter of 23.25&amp;nbsp;mm, thickness 2.33&amp;nbsp;mm and a mass of 7.5&amp;nbsp;grams. The coins' edges consist of alternating segments: three smooth, three finely ribbed. The coins have been used from 2002, though some are dated 1999, which is the year the [[euro]] was created as a currency, but not put into general circulation.

===Reverse (common) side===
The reverse (used from 2007 onwards) was designed by Luc Luycx and displays a map of Europe, not including [[Iceland]] and cutting off, in a [[semicircle]], at the Bosphorus, north through the middle of [[Ukraine]], then [[Russia]] and through northern [[Scandinavia]]. Cyprus is located further west than it should be and Malta is shown disproportionately large so that it appears on the map. The map has numerous indentations giving an appearance of geography{{clarify|date=September 2013}} rather than a flat design. Six fine lines cut across the map except where there is landmass and have a star at each end—reflecting the twelve stars on the [[flag of Europe]]. Across the map is the word EURO, and a large number 1 appears to the left hand side of the coin. The designer's initials, LL, appear next to Cyprus.

Luc Luycx designed the original coin, which was much the same except that the design was only of the then 15 members in their entirety{{clarify|date=September 2013}} and showing borders and no geographic features.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} The map was less detailed and the lines the stars were upon{{clarify|date=September 2013}} cut through where there would be landmass in [[eastern Europe]] if it were shown.

===Obverse (national) side===
The obverse side of the coin depends on the issuing country. All have to include twelve stars (in most cases a circle around the edge), the engraver's initials and the year of issue. New designs also have to include the name or initials of the issuing country. The side cannot repeat the denomination of the coin unless the issuing country uses an alphabet other than [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] (currently, [[Greece]] is the only such country, hence "1 ΕΥΡΩ" is engraved upon its coin. [[Austria]] is currently in breach of the revised rules, but has so far not announced plans to remove "1 EURO" from its coin).

====Planned designs====
{{See also|Enlargement of the eurozone}}

Austria, Germany and Greece will at some point need to update their designs to comply with guidelines stating they must include the issuing state's name or initial, and not repeat the denomination of the coin.

In addition, there are several EU states that have not yet adopted the euro, some of them have already agreed upon their coin designs; however, it is not know exactly when they will adopt the currency, and hence these are not yet minted. See [[enlargement of the Eurozone]] for expected entry dates of these countries.

====Minting====
One-euro coins have been produced every year in Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands and Spain. In Austria, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Luxemburg, Portugal, San Marino and the Vatican City no €1 coins were minted dated 1999, 2000 and 2001. In [[Monaco]], no €1 coins were minted in 1999, 2000, 2005, 2008 and 2010. Malta did not issue €1 coins in 2009. Slovenia and Slovakia have produced coins every year since their respective entries to the eurozone.

[[Proof coinage|Proof]] €1 coins are minted by the majority, but not all, of the eurozone states.

One of the most valuable planned issues of a €1 coin was by Vatican City in 2002, which may sell for several hundred euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coinweek.com/world-coins/the-coin-analyst-collecting-vatican-coins-can-be-rewarding-in-many-ways/ | title=Collecting Vatican Coins Can Be Rewarding in Many Ways | date = 12 November 2014 | website = coinweek.com | accessdate = 24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the French mint marks were mistakenly not placed on some 2007 Monaco coins which are hence worth more than €200 to collectors.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

PP means the proof-condition coins.
Numbers means if more than one coin was minted in that year in that condition by the country. In Germany, there are five [[Identifying marks on euro coins|mint marks]], so they mint ten types of coins in every year. In Greece, there were coins in 2002 which were minted in Finland with S mint mark. In the Vatican, there were coins minted with [[John Paul II]]'s effigy, and with "Sede Vacante" image in 2005.

==Error coins==
There are several error 1-euro coins: Italian types from 2002 without mintmarks; Portuguese coins, also from 2002 with another type of edging (29 stripes instead of 28) and from 2008 with the first type of the common side, officially used until 2007; and the famous Monegasque coin from 2007 without mint marks.

'''''4 days in May''''' (''Vier Tage im Mai'') is a war drama film directed by [[Achim von Borries]] and starring Paul Wenzel and Alexei Guskov. It is a German-Russian-Ukrainian co-production. The film was released on August 9, 2011, at the [[Locarno Film Festival]].

== Plot ==
It is one of the last days before the capitulation of [[Nazi Germany]] in May 1945. The setting is the Baltic coast in [[Pomerania]]. A unit of the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]], comprising seven men and led by a captain nicknamed "Gorynych" ("dragon") (Alexei Guskov) by his companions, has left for reconnaissance and observation of the movements of the retreating Germans. The group is housed in a large building, a shelter for orphaned girls. A [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] detachment is situated close by, awaiting transport for evacuation by sea to [[Denmark]], where they plan to surrender to the British. Both parties understand that the war is almost over; they do not want to engage each other and choose to wait things out. But resistance is not over for a teenage orphan Peter (Paul Wenzel), who was indoctrinated in the "no surrender" tradition of [[National Socialism]]. Soviet intelligence officers disarm him and patiently try to neutralize his youthful aggression.

On May 8, 1945, [[Victory in Europe Day]], a Soviet major who is commander of the division that includes the reconnaissance unit, arrives with Red Army troops. He was drunk on the occasion of Germany's capitulation. The major tries to rape one of the German girls, but the captain disarms him and stops the attempt.  Wishing to eliminate witnesses of his indecent behavior, the major said that the enemy, in disguise, infiltrated the building, and began an assault by his unit. The German detachment did not surrender but came to rescue the children. Then they made provisions for the safe withdrawal of the orphans on a fishing launch to Denmark.

== Reliability ==

[[Alexei Guskov]], the producer and the lead actor, based the screenplay on a work by Dmitry Faust. The author, telling the story of Marshal of the Soviet Union, [[Kirill Moskalenko|K. Moskalenko]], described the reported case of German troops coming to the aid of the small Soviet reconnaissance unit. Scouts prevented the drunken major - a tank officer - from raping a German girl. The plausibility of the story was supported by its publication in the prestigious Russian historical illustrated magazine ''[[Rodina (magazine)|Rodina]]''. However, the same journal contained an article by [[Boris Vadimovich Sokolov|Boris Sokolov]], in which he called into question the authenticity of the political report quoted by Dmitry Faust. Later, other historians argued that the story was totally fictional, unsupported by archival documents. In particular, the Russian historian Alexei Isaev said Faust had actually written about the "brotherhood of the weapon" on the island of [[Rügen]].

== Cast ==
* Paul Wenzel as Peter
* Alexei Guskov as Captain, commander of the reconnaissance
* [[Ivan Shvedoff]] as Trubitsin, scout
* [[Andrei Merzlikin|Andrew Merzlikin]] as Gray, the scout
* Sergei Legostaev as Ivanov, a scout
* [[Merab Ninidze]] as Major
* Gerald Alexander Held as Colonel Wald
* Martin Brambach as Lt. Wendt
* Angelina Henchy as Anna
* Petra Kelling as patroness of the shelter

== Awards ==
* Special Jury Award: For courage and humanism, and the prize "Golden Boat" in the "Vyborg Account" film festival "Window to Europe"(Vyborg, 2011).

''A Colour Symphony'' was written to be performed at the [[Three Choirs Festival]], held in 1922 in [[Gloucester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The concise Oxford dictionary of music|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-860884-4|author=Bourne, Joyce|author2=Michael Kennedy|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the invitation of Sir [[Edward Elgar]], who also invited [[Herbert Howells]] and [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]] to write a piece each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=9.80004&amp;catNum=9.80004&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English Bliss: Colour Symphony]&lt;/ref&gt; Howells wrote ''Sine Nomine'' for wordless chorus,&lt;ref name=mwi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classRev/2003/Apr03/british_choral_music.htm|last=Culot|first=Hubert|title=Review: British Choral Music|publisher=MusicWeb International|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was not given its second performance until his centenary year 70 years later, in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simonlindley.org.uk/howells.html Romanticism in Retrospect]&lt;/ref&gt; Goossens wrote a piece called ''Silence'' for chorus and orchestra.&lt;ref name=mwi/&gt; Elgar's own contribution was his orchestration of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''Fantasia and Fugue in C minor''.

Bliss decided to write a symphony, but was at first undecided what the theme or character of the work would be. He could not get started for some weeks. One day, by chance, he came across a book on [[heraldry]] in which he read of the symbolic meanings attached to certain colours; this gave him the notion of writing a work about colours. He attempted to give each movement a character corresponding to these meanings, but without attempting to depict the colours themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emusic.com/lists/showlist.html?lid=16782048 The eMusic Dozen: British Composers]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bliss dedicated the symphony to the conductor [[Adrian Boult]].&lt;ref name=class/&gt;

The first performance, with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], in [[Gloucester Cathedral]] on 7 September 1922, was conducted by the composer.  It was not well received at first, due to poor preparation.  The work uses a large orchestra, but the platform was so taken up with the chorus required for other works also being performed, that several instruments had to be omitted.&lt;ref name=greene&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m3S7PIxe0mwC&amp;pg=PA1199&amp;lpg=PA1199&amp;dq=bliss+colour+symphony+gloucester&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KT7QuTP2Va&amp;sig=7HENnXAqSA-G0UcegzQHMFAQ0Oc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VZ3RSb_iL6Xg6gPx_6yaBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers]&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar attended, but found it "disconcertingly modern".&lt;ref name=class&gt;[http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/92969.html#about Classical Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;  It nevertheless entered the repertoire and has been recorded various times, although it is now an infrequent visitor to concert platforms.

==Analysis==

The four movements are:

A theme from towards the end of the ''Red'' movement was used as the signature tune of the televised "[[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Serotsky|first=Paul|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/Programme_Notes/bliss_colour.htm|title=Programme Notes: Bliss - A Colour Symphony|publisher=MusicWeb International|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revision==

In 1932, Bliss revised the [[coda (music)|coda]]s of the first two movements.&lt;ref name=Harvard/&gt;  He conducted the revised work himself in a recording with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Rec/rec.music.classical.recordings/2005-09/msg05493.html derkeiler.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bliss made a stereo recording with the [[BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra]].

The last movement, "Green", was separately published as ''Pyonepsion''.

==Other uses==
In 1977, a [[ballet]] called ''Royal Offering'' was created, with music based on ''A Colour Symphony''.

A short extract from the 'Red' movement was used as the opening music to [[BBC]] TV coverage of [[The Proms]] until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2010/about/questions.shtml BBC Proms 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402173527/http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2010/about/questions.shtml |date=April 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British artist Kevin Laycock created a visual piece called ''Four Movements in Colour'', in which he attempted to portray, in colour, the sounds created by Arthur Bliss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drumcroon.org.uk/Arch1/klaycock/LaycockTeacherNotes.doc Four Movements in Colour: Recent Paintings by Kevin Laycock] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930050504/http://www.drumcroon.org.uk/Arch1/klaycock/LaycockTeacherNotes.doc |date=September 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, Laycock created a series of paintings called ''Tectonics'' as a direct response to Bliss's ''A Colour Symphony'' using parallel compositional structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colour-journal.org/2007/1/10/07110gallery.pdf Uncertain Harmonies]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''All That Jazz''''' is a 1979 American [[musical film|musical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Bob Fosse]]. The screenplay, by [[Robert Alan Aurthur]] and Fosse, is a [[autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical]] [[fantasy]] based on aspects of Fosse's life and career as a dancer, choreographer and director. The film was inspired by Fosse's manic effort to edit his film ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'' while simultaneously staging the 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. It borrows its title from the [[Kander and Ebb]] tune "[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]" in that production. The film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]].

In 2001, ''All That Jazz'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1833/year/1980.html|title=ALL THAT JAZZ|publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Joe Gideon is a theater director and choreographer trying to balance staging his latest Broadway musical with editing a Hollywood film he has directed. He is a workaholic who chain-smokes cigarettes; without a daily dose of [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Visine]], [[Alka-Seltzer]], [[Dextroamphetamine|Dexedrine]], and [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], he wouldn't have the energy to keep up the biggest "show" of all—his life. His girlfriend Katie Jagger, his ex-wife Audrey Paris, and daughter Michelle try to pull him back from the brink, but it is too late for his exhausted body and stress-ravaged heart. In his imagination, he flirts with an [[Death (personification)|angel of death]] named Angelique.

Gideon's condition gets progressively worse. He is rushed to a hospital after experiencing chest pains during a particularly stressful [[Read-through|table-read]] (with the production's penny-pinching backers in attendance) and is admitted with severe [[Angina pectoris|angina]]. Joe brushes off his symptoms, and attempts to leave to go back to rehearsal. He collapses in the doctor's office, and is ordered to stay in the hospital for several weeks to rest his heart and recover from his exhaustion. The show is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, in brazen denial of his mortality. Champagne flows, endless strings of women frolic around his hospital room, and cigarettes are constantly being smoked. As cardiogram readings show no improvement, Gideon dances with death. A negative review for his film—which has been released without him—comes in, and Gideon has a massive coronary event. He undergoes [[coronary artery bypass surgery]].

The show's backers must decide whether it's time to pack up, or replace Gideon as the director. Their matter-of-fact, money-oriented negotiations with the insurers are juxtaposed with graphic scenes of Joe's [[Cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]]. The producers realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to bet on Gideon dying: the insurance proceeds would result in a profit of over half a million dollars. Meanwhile, elements from Gideon's past life are staged in dazzling dream sequences of musical numbers he directs from his hospital bed while on life support. Realizing death is imminent and his mortality unconquerable, Gideon has another heart attack. In the film's glittery finale, he goes through the [[five stages of grief]]—anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance—featured in the stand-up routine he had been editing. As death closes in on Gideon, his fantasy episodes become more hallucinatory and extravagant. In an epilogue set up as a monumental [[variety show]] featuring everyone from his past, Gideon takes center stage.

The final shot shows his corpse being zipped up in a [[body bag]].

==Production==
With increasing production costs and a loss of enthusiasm for the film, [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] brought in [[20th Century-Fox|Fox]] to finance completion, who acquired domestic distribution rights in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Daily Variety]]|title='Kramer' Wins Five-Oscar Judgment|date=April 15, 1980|page=1|last=Harwood|first=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's structure is often compared to [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]'', another thinly veiled autobiographical film with fantastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9803E2DF1538E732A25753C2A9649D946890D6CF Vincent Canby in ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/7299 DVD review in ''The Onion: A.V. Club''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223116/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/7299 |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonard Maltin page 26"&gt;"Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide" page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of Audrey Paris—Joe's ex-wife and continuing muse, played by [[Leland Palmer (actress)|Leland Palmer]]—closely reflects that of Fosse's wife, the dancer and actress [[Gwen Verdon]], who continued to work with him on projects including ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''All That Jazz'' itself.

Gideon's rough handling of chorus girl Victoria Porter closely resembles [[Bob Fosse]]'s own treatment of Jennifer Nairn-Smith during rehearsals for ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''All His Jazz: The Life &amp; Death of Bob Fosse'' by Martin Gottfried, Da Capo Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Nairn-Smith herself appears in the film as Jennifer, one of the ''NY/LA'' dancers.

[[Ann Reinking]] was one of Fosse's sexual partners at the time and was more or less playing herself in the film, but nonetheless she was required to audition for the role as Gideon's girlfriend, Kate Jagger.

[[Cliff Gorman]] was cast in the titular role of ''The Stand-Up''—the film-within-a-film version of ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]''—after having played the role of Lenny Bruce in the original theatrical production of the show (for which he won a [[Tony Award]]), but was passed over for Fosse's film version of the production in favor of [[Dustin Hoffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink1=Robert Simonson |last1=Simonson |first1=Robert |title=Cliff Gorman, Broadway's Lenny, Is Dead at 65 |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/cliff-gorman-broadways-lenny-is-dead-at-65-com-108241 |website=Playbill.com |publisher=Playbill, Inc. |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=13 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Reviews were largely positive. ''All That Jazz'' scores an 86% "Fresh" (or "good") rating on [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 36 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|all_that_jazz|All That Jazz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] called the film "an uproarious display of brilliance, nerve, dance, maudlin confessions, inside jokes and, especially, ego" and "an essentially funny movie that seeks to operate on too many levels at the same time... some of it makes you wince, but a lot of it is great fun... A key to the success of the production is the performance of Roy Scheider as Joe Gideon... With an actor of less weight and intensity, ''All That Jazz'' might have evaporated as we watched it. Mr. Scheider's is a presence to reckon with."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9803E2DF1538E732A25753C2A9649D946890D6CF ''The New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described it as "a self-important, [[egomania]]cal, wonderfully choreographed, often compelling film" and added, "Roy Scheider gives a superb performance as Gideon, creating a character filled with nervous energy… The film's major flaw lies in its lack of real explanation of what, beyond ego, really motivates [him]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117796599.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[TV Guide]]'' said, "The dancing is frenzied, the dialogue piercing, the photography superb, and the acting first-rate, with non-showman Scheider an illustrious example of casting against type . . . ''All That Jazz'' is great-looking but not easy to watch. Fosse's indulgent vision at times approaches sour self-loathing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/movies/jazz/review/111363 ''TV Guide'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two-and-a-half stars (out of four) in his 2009 movie guide; he said that the film was "self-indulgent and largely negative," and that "great show biz moments and wonderful dancing are eventually buried in pretensions"; he also called the ending "an interminable finale which leaves a bad taste for the whole film."&lt;ref name="Leonard Maltin page 26" /&gt;

''[[Time Out London]]'' states, "As translated onto screen, [Fosse's] story is wretched: the jokes are relentlessly crass and objectionable; the song 'n' dance routines have been created in the cutting-room and have lost any sense of fun; [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]]-esque moments add little but pretension; and scenes of a real open-heart operation, alternating with footage of a symbolic Angel of Death in veil and white gloves, fail even in terms of the surreal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/77740/All_That_Jazz.html ''Time Out London'' review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507033352/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/77740/All_That_Jazz.html |date=2008-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon release in 1979, director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who is mentioned in the movie, reportedly called it "[the] best film I think I have ever seen".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=12}}
In 2001, ''All That Jazz'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. It was also preserved by the [[Academy Film Archive]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=All+That+Jazz&amp;filmmaker=&amp;category=All&amp;collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the film was ranked #14 by the [[American Film Institute]] on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years of Musicals|Greatest Movie Musicals]].

The film would be the last musical nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] until Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in 1991, and was the last live-action musical to compete in the category until [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' was nominated over twenty years later.

An '''association copy''' is a term used to describe a copy of a [[book]] which once belonged to the author or someone connected with the author. It can also apply to a copy that once belonged to someone particularly associated with its contents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An association copy is often also a [[presentation copy]], in which the author gives the book to a friend, [[colleague]], notable person, or someone upon whom a [[Fictional character|character]] in the book is thought or known to have been based.

Association copies are highly [[collectable]]. 

An example of an association copy is Herman Melville's copy of ''The Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whaleship Essex of Nantucket'' that contains 18 pages of Melville's notes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book

== Business ==

Building a strong backlist has traditionally been considered the best method to produce a profitable publishing house, as the most expensive aspects of the publishing process have already been paid for and the only remaining expenses are reproduction costs and author royalty. 

"The backlist is the financial backbone of the book industry, accounting for 25 to 30 percent of the average publisher's sales," printed ''[[The New York Times]]''. "Current titles, known as the front list, are often a gamble: they can become best sellers, but they are much more likely to disappear in a flood of returns from bookstores.

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|upright|Representation of the Buddha in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], 1st century CE]]
{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist art''' is the [[art|artistic practices]] that are influenced by [[Buddhism]]. It includes art media which depict [[Buddha]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; [[mandala]]s and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as [[vajra]]s, bells, [[stupa]]s and [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist temple architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Buddhist Art? |url=http://buddhistartnews.wordpress.com/what-is-buddhist-art/ |publisher=Buddhist Art News |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BCE, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and co-developed with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] art, with cave temple complexes built together, each likely influencing the other.&lt;ref name=blurton113&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 113-116, 160-162, 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-iconic phase (5th century – 1st century BCE)==
{{See also|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Footprint of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. 1st century BCE, [[Gandhara]].]]
During the 2nd to 1st century BCE, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha’s life and teachings. These took the form of votive tablets or [[frieze]]s, usually in relation to the decoration of stupas.
Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form, but only through [[Buddhist symbolism]]. This period may have been [[aniconism in Buddhism|aniconic]].

Artists were reluctant to depict the Buddha anthropomorphically, and developed sophisticated aniconic symbols to avoid doing so (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear). This tendency remained as late as the 2nd century CE in the southern parts of India, in the art of the [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district#Amaravati School|Amaravati School]] (see: [[Mara (demon)|Mara's assault on the Buddha]]).
It has been argued that earlier anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha may have been made of wood and may have perished since then. However, no related archaeological evidence has been found.

The earliest works of Buddhist art in India date back to the 1st century BCE The
[[Mahabodhi Temple]] at Bodh Gaya became a model for similar structures in Burma
and Indonesia. The frescoes at [[Sigiriya]] are said to be even older than the
[[Ajanta Caves]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art ]  Frontline Magazine 13–26 May 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconic phase (1st century CE – present)==
{{see also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Padmapani, cave 1, Ajanta, India.jpg|thumb|left|Over life-size figure of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Padmapani]], cave 1, [[Ajanta Caves]], 5th century]]
Anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha started to emerge from the 1st century CE in [[Northern India]]. The two main centers of creation have been identified as [[Gandhara]] in today’s [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]], in [[Pakistan]], and the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern India.

Hellenistic culture was introduced in Gandhara during the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign: 321–298 BCE), founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]], conquered the Macedonian satraps during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]] of 305–303 BCE. Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]] (reign: 268-232 BCE), who formed the largest Empire in the Indian subcontinent, converted to Buddhism following the [[Kalinga War]]. Abandoning an expansionist ideology, Ashoka worked to spread the religion and philosophy throughout his empire as described in the [[edicts of Ashoka]]. Ashoka claims to have converted the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

After the overthrow of the Mauryan Empire by the [[Shunga Empire]], the  [[Greco-Bactrian]] and subsequently the [[Indo-Greek]] Kingdoms invaded north-western India. They facilitated the spread of Greco-Buddhist art style to other parts of the subcontinent. The Indo-Greek King [[Menander I]] was renown as a great patron of Buddhism, attaining the title of an [[arhat]].&lt;ref&gt;"(In the Milindapanha) Menander is declared an arhat", McEvilley, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] persecuted Buddhism, presumably to further erase the legacy of the Mauryan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Caleb; Sarao, K. T. S. (2010). "Pushyamitra Sunga, a Hindu ruler in the second century BCE, was a great persecutor of Buddhists". In Danver, Steven L. Popular Controversies in World History. ABC-CLIO. p. 89. {{ISBN|9781598840780}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the decline of Buddhist art east of Mathura.

Gandharan Buddhist sculpture displays [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Hellenistic artistic influence]] in the forms of human figures and ornament. Figures were much larger than any known from India previously, and also more naturalistic, and new details included wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, and [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf ornament.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Inscribed Seated Buddha Image in Abhaya Mudra - Kushan Period - Katra Keshav Dev - ACCN A-1 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5972.JPG|thumb|Mathura school Buddha, [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]]]]

The art of Mathura tends to be based on an Indian tradition, exemplified by the anthropomorphic representation of divinities such as the [[Yaksha|Yaksas]], although in a style rather archaic compared to the later representations of the Buddha. The Mathuran school contributed clothes covering the left shoulder of thin [[muslin]], the wheel on the palm, the lotus seat.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Mathura and Gandhara also influenced each other. During their artistic florescence, the two regions were even united politically under the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], both being capitals of the empire. It is still a matter of debate whether the anthropomorphic representations of Buddha was essentially a result of a local evolution of Buddhist art at Mathura, or a consequence of Greek cultural influence in Gandhara through the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] [[syncretism]].

This iconic art was characterized from the start by a realistic idealism, combining realistic human features, proportions, attitudes and attributes, together with a sense of perfection and serenity reaching to the divine. This expression of the Buddha as both man and God became the iconographic canon for subsequent Buddhist art.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Remains of early Buddhist painting in India are vanishingly rare, with the later phases of the [[Ajanta Caves]] giving the great majority of surviving work, created over a relatively short up to about 480 CE.  These are highly sophisticated works, evidently produced in a well-developed tradition, probably painting secular work in palaces as much as religious subjects.

Buddhist art continued to develop in India for a few more centuries. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of Mathura evolved during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (4th to 6th century CE) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. The art of the Gupta school was extremely influential almost everywhere in the rest of Asia. At the end of the 12th century CE, Buddhism in its full glory came to be preserved only in the Himalayan regions in India. These areas, helped by their location, were in greater contact with Tibet and China - for example the art and traditions of [[Ladakh]] bear the stamp of Tibetan and Chinese influence.
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|240px|Buddhist expansion throughout Asia.]]
As Buddhism expanded outside of India from the 1st century CE, its original artistic package blended with other artistic influences, leading to a progressive differentiation among the countries adopting the faith.
* A '''Northern route''' was established from the 1st century CE through [[Central Asia]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], in which [[Mahayana]] Buddhism prevailed.
* A '''Southern route''', where [[Theravada]] Buddhism dominated, went through [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]].

==Northern Buddhist art==
[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|left|thumb|A Chinese wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE)]]

The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] to Central Asia, China and ultimately Korea and Japan started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Ming]] (58-75&amp;nbsp;AD). However, extensive contacts started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]], with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]], were either [[Parthia]]n, [[Kushan]], [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] or [[Kuchean]].

Central Asian missionary efforts along the [[Silk Road]] were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of [[Serindian art]] from the 2nd through the 11th century in the Tarim Basin, modern [[Xinjiang]]. Serindian art often derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Pakistan]], combining Indian, Greek and [[Roman art|Roman]] influences. Silk Road Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs, Buddhist imagery, and a select few representations of [[Kami|Japanese gods]].

The art of the northern route was also highly influenced by the development of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, an inclusive branch of Buddhism characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]], and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. Mahāyāna goes beyond the traditional [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist]] ideal of the release from suffering ([[dukkha|duḥkha]]) of [[arhat]]s, and emphasizes the [[bodhisattva]] path. The Mahāyāna sutras elevate the Buddha to a transcendent and infinite being, and feature a pantheon of bodhisattvas devoting themselves to the [[Paramita|Six Perfections]], ultimate knowledge ([[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]]), enlightenment, and the liberation of all sentient beings. Northern Buddhist art thus tends to be characterized by a very rich and syncretic Buddhist pantheon, with a multitude of images of the various [[Buddhahood|buddhas]], bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings ([[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]).

===Afghanistan===
[[File:GBA1(trimmed).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue from a Buddhist monastery, 700&amp;nbsp;AD, Afghanistan]]
Buddhist art in [[Afghanistan]] (old [[Bactria]]) persisted for several centuries until the spread of Islam in the 7th century. It is exemplified by the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Other sculptures, in [[stucco]], [[schist]] or [[clay]], display very strong blending of Indian post-[[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] mannerism and Classical influence, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]].

Although Islamic rule was somewhat tolerant of other religions "[[People of the Book|of the Book]]", it showed little tolerance for Buddhism, which was perceived as a religion depending on "[[idolatry]]". Human figurative art forms also being prohibited under Islam, Buddhist art suffered numerous attacks, which culminated with the systematic destructions by the [[Taliban]] regime. The Buddhas of Bamyan, the sculptures of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], and many of the remaining artifacts at the Afghanistan museum have been destroyed.

The multiple conflicts since the 1980s also have led to a systematic pillage of archaeological sites apparently in the hope of reselling in the international market what artifacts could be found.

===Central Asia===
{{See also|Dunhuang|Mogao Caves|Kingdom of Khotan|Silk Road|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
[[File:SerindianGroup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Serindian art]], 6th-7th century [[Terra cotta|terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang).]]
[[Central Asia]] long played the role of a meeting place between China, India and [[Iran|Persia]]. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] to the West led to increased contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

Thereafter, the expansion of Buddhism to the North led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oasis of Central Asia. Some [[Silk Road]] cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between East and West.

The eastern part of Central Asia  ([[Chinese Turkestan]] ([[Tarim Basin]], [[Xinjiang]]) in particular has revealed an extremely rich [[Serindian art]] ([[cave painting|wall paintings]] and [[relief]]s in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. Works of art reminiscent of the Gandharan style, as well as scriptures in the Gandhari script [[Kharoshti]] have been found. These influences were rapidly absorbed however by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.

===China===
{{see also|Chinese Buddhist sculpture}}
Buddhism arrived in [[China]] around the 1st century CE, and introduced new types of art into China, particularly in the area of [[statue|statuary]]. Receiving this distant religion, strong Chinese traits were incorporated into Buddhist art.

====Northern Dynasties====
In the 5th to 6th centuries, the [[Northern Dynasties]] developed rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible and realistic manner, progressively led to a change towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

*[[Longmen Grottoes]], [[Henan]]

====Tang Dynasty====
[[File:Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets by Chang Huai-hsing.jpg|thumb|right|''{{ill|Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets|yue|熾盛光佛並五星圖}}'', 897 A.D.]]
Following a transition under the [[Sui Dynasty]], Buddhist sculpture of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. Because of the dynasty's openness to foreign influences, and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India, Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Indian art of the Gupta period. During that time, the Tang capital of [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) became an important center for Buddhism. From there Buddhism spread to [[Korea]], and [[Japanese missions to Tang China]] helped it gain a foothold in Japan.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang China|Wuzong]] outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) in order to support the indigenous religion, [[Taoism]]. He confiscated Buddhist possessions, and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the development of the religion and its arts in China.

[[Chán]] Buddhism however, as the origin of Japanese [[Zen]], continued to prosper for some centuries, especially under the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), when Chan monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.

[[File:Chinesischer Maler von 1238 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of the Chinese [[Zen]] Buddhist [[Wuzhun Shifan]], painted in 1238&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Song Dynasty]].]]

Early paintings by Chán monks tended to eschew the meticulous realism of [[Gongbi]] painting in favour of vigorous, monochrome paintings, attempting to express the impact of enlightenment through their brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, A; ''The imperial capitals of China: an inside view of the celestial empire'', Random House 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84595-010-1}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Neo-Confucianism]] under [[Zhu Xi]] in the twelfth century resulted in considerable criticism of the monk-painters. Connected as they were with the then-unpopular school of Chan Buddhism, their paintings were discarded and ignored. Some paintings survived after being transported to Japan by visiting Zen monks, but the school of Chan painting gradually diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Valérie Malenfer; ''Dreaming the southern song landscape: the power of illusion in Chinese painting'', BRILL 1999, {{ISBN|978-90-04-11011-3}} p161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qing Dynasty====
During the Qing Dynasty, Manchu emperors supported Buddhist practices for a range of political and personal reasons. The [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was a devotee of Chan Buddhism, while his successor, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] promoted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], claiming to be the human embodiment of the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref&gt;Weidner, Marsha Smith, and Patricia Ann Berger. Latter Days of the Law : Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850-1850. Lawrence, KS: Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was under the rule of the third Qing ruler, the [[Qianlong Emperor]], that imperial patronage of the Buddhist arts reached its height in this period. He commissioned a vast number of religious works in the Tibetan style, many of which depicted him in various sacred guises.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.113&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art produced during this period are characterized by a unique fusion of Tibetan and Chinese artistic approaches. They combine a characteristically Tibetan attention to iconographic detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements. Inscriptions are often written in Chinese, Manchu, Tibetan, Mongolian and Sanskrit, while paintings are frequently rendered in vibrant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p.webm|thumb|Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p]]
Additionally, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] initiated a number of large-scale construction projects; in 1744 he rededicated the [[Yonghe Temple]] as Beijing's main Tibetan Buddhist monastery, donating a number of valuable religious paintings, sculptures, textiles and inscriptions to the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xumi Fushou Temple]], and the works housed within, is another project commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] that embodies the unique blend of Tibetan and Manchu artistic styles that characterized Buddhist art produced in China under Qianlong's reign.

After the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s abdication in 1795, the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism at the Qing court declined. The motives behind the Qing emperors' promotion of Tibetan Buddhism have been interpreted as a calculated act of political manipulation, and a means of forging ties between Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan communities, though this has been challenged by recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Patricia Ann. Empire of Emptiness : Buddhist Art and Political Authority In Qing China. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularization of Buddhism in China has made the country home to one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts in the world. The [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] and the [[Bingling Temple]] caves near [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] province, the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province, and the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] near [[Chongqing]] municipality are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.

===Korea===
{{see also|Buddhism in Korea|Korean Buddhist sculpture|Korean art}}
[[Korea]]n Buddhist art generally reflects an interaction between other Buddhist influences and a strongly original Korean culture. Additionally, the art of the steppes, particularly Siberian and [[Scythia]]n influences, are evident in early Korean Buddhist art based on the excavation of artifacts and burial goods such as [[Silla]] [[Crown of Silla|royal crowns]], belt buckles, daggers, and comma-shaped [[gogok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/crown.htm |title=Crown |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Arts of Korea |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this indigenous art was geometric, abstract and richly adorned with a {{clarify span|characteristic "barbarian" luxury|date=November 2012}}. Although many other influences were strong, Korean Buddhist art, "bespeaks a sobriety, taste for the right tone, a sense of abstraction but also of colours that curiously enough are in line with contemporary taste" (Pierre Cambon, ''Arts asiatiques- Guimet''').

====Three Kingdoms of Korea====
[[File:Pensive Bodhisattva 02.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], semi-seated contemplative Maitreya probably from Silla circa early 7th century.]]
The first of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] to officially receive Buddhism was [[Goguryeo]] in 372.&lt;ref name=graysonp25&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chinese records and the use of Buddhist motifs in Goguryeo murals indicate the introduction of Buddhism earlier than the official date.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baekje]] Kingdom officially recognized Buddhism in 384.&lt;ref name=graysonp25/&gt; The [[Silla]] Kingdom, isolated and with no easy sea or land access to China, officially adopted Buddhism in 535 although the foreign religion was known in the kingdom due to the work of Goguryeo monks since the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Encyclopedia of World History: ancient, medieval, and modern, chronologically arranged |author1=Peter N.

Particularly important in the transmission of sophisticated art styles to the Korean kingdoms was the art of the "barbarian" Tuoba, a clan of non-Han Chinese Xianbei people who established the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty in China in 386. The Northern Wei style was particularly influential in the art of the Goguryeo and Baekje. Baekje artisans later transmitted this style along with Southern Dynasty elements and distinct Korean elements to Japan. Korean artisans were highly selective of the styles they incorporated and combined different regional styles together to create a specific Korean Buddhist art style.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), pp. 27 &amp; 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture, 5th&amp;ndash;9th Century |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Timeline of Arts History |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seokguram Buddha.JPG|upright|thumb|left|[[Seokguram Grotto]] is a [[World Heritage Site]] and dates to the [[Unified Silla]] era.]]
While Goguryeo Buddhist art exhibited vitality and mobility akin with Northern Wei prototypes, the Baekje Kingdom was also in close contact with the [[Southern Dynasties]] of China and this close diplomatic contact is exemplified in the gentle and proportional sculpture of the Baekje, epitomized by Baekje sculpture exhibiting the fathomless smile known to art historians as the [[Baekje smile]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture (5th–9th century) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=metmuseum.org |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silla Kingdom also developed a distinctive Buddhist art tradition epitomized by the [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], a half-seated contemplative maitreya whose Korean-made twin, the Miroku Bosatsu, was sent to Japan as a proselytizing gift and now resides in the Koryu-ji Temple in Japan.&lt;ref name="kenyon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln275/Jap-Kor-art.htm |title=Japanese Art and Its Korean Secret |publisher=www2.kenyon.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms period stimulated massive temple-building projects, such as the [[Mireuksa]] Temple in the Baekje Kingdom and the [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple in Silla. Baekje architects were famed for their skill and were instrumental in building the massive nine-story pagoda at Hwangnyongsa and early Buddhist temples in Yamato Japan such as [[Asuka-dera|Hōkō-ji]] (Asuka-dera) and [[Hōryū-ji]].&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sir Banister Fletcher's a History of Architecture |author1=Fletcher, B. |author2=Cruickshank, D. |date=1996 |publisher=Architectural Press |isbn=9780750622677 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gt1jTpXAThwC |page=716 |accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6th century Korean Buddhist art exhibited the cultural influences of China and India but began to show distinctive indigenous characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/06/eak/ht06eak.htm metmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; These indigenous characteristics can be seen in early Buddhist art in Japan and some early Japanese Buddhist sculpture is now believed to have originated in Korea, particularly from Baekje, or Korean artisans who immigrated to Yamato Japan. Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Korean style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the Koryu-ji Miroku Bosatsu and the Chugu-ji Siddhartha statues. Although many historians portray Korea as a mere transmitter of Buddhism, the Three Kingdoms, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Korea: A Religious History |author=Grayson, J.H. |date=2002 |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |isbn=9780700716050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1BzL2lwPqEC |page=33 |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unified Silla====
[[File:Goryeo Pagoda.jpg|thumb|160px|The Goryeo era [[Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda]] sits on the first floor of the [[National Museum of Korea]].]]
During the [[Unified Silla]] period, [[East Asia]] was particularly stable with China and Korea both enjoying unified governments. Early Unified Silla art combined Silla styles and Baekje styles. Korean Buddhist art was also influenced by new [[Tang Dynasty]] styles as evidenced by a new popular Buddhist motif with full-faced Buddha sculptures. Tang China was the cross roads of East, Central, and South Asia and so the Buddhist art of this time period exhibit the so-called international style. State-sponsored Buddhist art flourished during this period, the epitome of which is the [[Seokguram]] Grotto.

====Goryeo Dynasty====
The fall of the Unified Silla Dynasty and the establishment of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty in 918 indicates a new period of Korean Buddhist art. The Goryeo kings also lavishly sponsored Buddhism and Buddhist art flourished, especially Buddhist paintings and illuminated sutras written in gold and silver ink. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/eak/ht07eak.htm]. The crowning achievement of this period is the carving of approximately 80,000 woodblocks of the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] which was done twice.

====Joseon Dynasty====
The [[Joseon Dynasty]] actively suppressed Buddhism beginning in 1406 and Buddhist temples and art production subsequently decline in quality in quantity although beginning in 1549, Buddhist art does continue to be produced.

===Japan===

[[File:ASURA detail Kohfukuji.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The ASURA in [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (734)]]
Before the introduction of Buddhism, [[Japan]] had already been the seat of various cultural (and artistic) influences, from the abstract linear decorative art of the indigenous Neolithic [[Jōmon]] from around 10500&amp;nbsp;BC to 300&amp;nbsp;BC, to the art during the [[Yayoi]] and [[Kofun]] periods, with developments such as [[Haniwa]] art.

The cultural exchange between India and Japan was not direct, as Japan received Buddhism through Korea, China, Central Asia and eventually India. The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled to the islands together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The cultural contact between Indian Dharmic civilization and Japan through the adoption of Buddhist ideas and aesthetic has contributed to the development of a national cultural order in the subsequent century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Indian Influence on the Art of Japan | author = Sampa Biswas | publisher = Northern Book Centre | year = 2010 | isbn = 9788172112691 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=fLjcMfMGP10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Japan&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisg5jQrPrVAhWKMo8KHXxoBpEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Japan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century. Being geographically at the end of the [[Silk Road]], Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.

[[File:Bodhidarma.jpg|thumb|upright|Scroll calligraphy of [[Bodhidharma]] "Zen points directly to the human heart, see into your nature and become Buddha", by [[Hakuin Ekaku]] (1686 to 1769)]]

From 711, numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], including a five-story [[pagoda]], the Golden Hall of the Horyuji, and the [[Kōfuku-ji]] temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. Indian, Hellenistic, Chinese and Korean artistic influences blended into an original style characterized by realism and gracefulness. The creation of Japanese Buddhist art was especially rich between the 8th and 13th centuries during the periods of [[Nara period|Nara]], [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]].
Japan developed an extremely rich figurative art for the pantheon of Buddhist deities, sometimes combined with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Shinto]] influences. This art can be very varied, creative and bold.

From the 12th and 13th, a further development was [[Zen]] art, and it faces golden days in [[Muromachi Period]], following the introduction of the faith by [[Dogen]] and [[Eisai]] upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as [[sumi-e]]) and poetry (especially [[haiku]]s), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned "non-dualistic" representations. The search for enlightenment "in the moment" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the [[Chanoyu]] tea ceremony or the [[Ikebana]] art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques ([[martial art]]s).

Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Still around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved. Many of them are in wood and are regularly restored.

===Tibet and Bhutan===
{{See also|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}
[[File:Yama tibet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]] 18th century, Tibet]]
[[Tantric Buddhism]] started as a movement in eastern India around the 5th or the 6th century. Many of the practices of Tantric Buddhism are derived from [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] (the usage of [[mantra]]s, [[yoga]], or the burning of sacrificial offerings). Tantrism became the dominant form of Buddhism in [[Tibet]] from the 8th century. Due to its geographical centrality in Asia, Tibetan Buddhist art received influence from Indian, [[Nepal]]i, Greco-Buddhist and Chinese art.

One of the most characteristic creations of Tibetan Buddhist art are the [[mandala]]s, diagrams of a "divine temple" made of a circle enclosing a square, the purpose of which is to help Buddhist devotees focus their attention through meditation and follow the path to the central image of the Buddha.
Artistically, Buddhist [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art and Hindu art tend to be the two strongest inspirations of Tibetan art.

In 10th to 11th centuries, [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], Northern India (at that time part of Western Tibet Kingdom) serves an important role as an intermediary between India and Tibet cultural exchange, especially Buddhist art and philosophy. Notable example of Tibetan Buddhist art in Tabo is its exquisite frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tabo: a lamp for the kingdom : early Indo Tibetan Buddhist art in the western Himalaya, Archeologia, arte primitiva e orientale | author1 =Deborah E.

===Vietnam===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The boy Buddha rising up from lotus. Crimson and gilded wood, Trần-Hồ dynasty, Vietnam, 14th-15th century]]
Chinese influence was predominant in the north of [[Vietnam]] (Tonkin) between the 1st and 9th centuries, and [[Confucianism]] and Mahayana Buddhism were prevalent. Overall, the art of Vietnam has been strongly influenced by Chinese Buddhist art.

In the south thrived the former kingdom of [[Champa]] (before it was later overtaken by the Vietnamese from the north). [[Champa]] had a strongly Indianized art, just as neighboring [[Cambodia]]. Many of its statues were characterized by rich body adornments. The capital of the kingdom of Champa was annexed by Vietnam in 1471, and it totally collapsed in the 1720s, while [[Cham (Asia)|Cham people]] remain an abundant minority across [[Southeast Asia]].

==Southern Buddhist art==
The orthodox forms of Buddhism, also known as Southern Buddhism are still practised in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. During the 1st century CE, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise of the [[Parthia]]n empire in the [[Middle East]], an unvanquished enemy of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connections, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Trade routes linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Thailand|Siam]], lower [[Cambodia]] and southern [[Vietnam]], and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.

[[File:CambodianBuddha.JPG|thumb|upright|A Cambodian Buddha, 14th century]]
For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[Pāli|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and the Indian script, together with [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhism, [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. This expansion provided the artistic context for the development of Buddhist art in these countries, which then developed characteristics of their own.

Between the 1st and 8th centuries, several kingdoms competed for influence in the region (particularly the Cambodian [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] then the Burmese [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdoms) contributing various artistic characteristics, mainly derived from the Indian [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] style. Combined with a pervading Hindu influence, Buddhist images, votive tablets and Sanskrit inscriptions are found throughout the area. Between 8th- and 12th-century, under the patronage of [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]], arts and ideas of Buddhism and Hinduism co-developed and became increasingly intermeshed.&lt;ref name=richardblurton202/&gt; However, with Muslim invasion and sacking of monasteries in India, states Richard Blurton,  "Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India".&lt;ref name=richardblurton202&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 202-204, Quote: "Buddhism flourished in this part of India throughout the first millennium AD, especially under the patronage of Pala kings of the eighth and twelfth centuries. Towards the end of this period, popular Buddhism and Hinduism became increasingly intermeshed. However, when Muslim invaders from further west sacked the monasteries in the twelfth century, Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple.]]

By the 8th to 9th century, [[Sailendra]]n Buddhist art were developed and flourished in [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] kingdom of [[Central Java]], Indonesia. This period marked the renaissance of Buddhist art in Java, as numerous exquisite monuments were built, including [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Mendut]] and [[Borobudur]] stone mandala. The traditions would continue to the 13th century [[Singhasari]] Buddhist art of East Java.

From the 9th to the 13th centuries, Southeast Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The [[Sri Vijaya]] Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence, but both were adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, and their art expressed the rich Mahayana pantheon of the [[Bodhisattva]]s.
The [[Theravada]] Buddhism of the Pali canon was introduced to the region around the 13th century from [[Sri Lanka]], and was adopted by the newly founded [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]]. Since in Theravada Buddhism of the period, Monasteries typically were the central places for the laity of the towns to receive instruction and have disputes arbitrated by the monks, the construction of temple complexes plays a particularly important role in the artistic expression of Southeast Asia from that time.

From the 14th century, the main factor was the spread of [[Islam]] to the maritime areas of Southeast Asia, overrunning [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and most of the islands as far as the [[Southern Philippines]]. In the continental areas, Theravada Buddhism continued to expand into Burma, [[Laos]] and Cambodia.

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddha statue in Sri Lanka.]]
According to tradition, Buddhism was introduced in Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE by Indian missionaries under the guidance of Thera [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], the son of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]]. Prior to the expansion of Buddhism, the indigenous population of Sri Lanka lived in an animistic world full of superstition. The assimilation and conversion of the various pre-Buddhist beliefs was a slow process. In order to gain a foothold among the rural population, Buddhism needed to assimilate the various categories of spirits and other supernatural beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The earliest monastic complex was the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahāvihāra]] at [[Anuradhapura|Anurādhapura]] founded by [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Devānampiyatissa]] and presented to Mahinda Thera. The Mahāvihāra became the centre of the orthodox Theravāda doctrine and its supreme position remained unchallenged until the foundation of the [[Abhayagiri Vihāra]] around BC 89 by [[Valagamba of Anuradhapura|Vaţţagāmaņĩ]].

The Abhayagiri Vihāra became the seat of the reformed Mahāyāna doctrines. The rivalry between the monks of the Mahāvihāra and the Abhayagiri led to a further split and the foundation of the [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavanarama]] near the Mahāvihāra. The main feature of Sinhala Buddhism was its division into three major groups, or ''nikāyas'', named after the three main monastic complexes at Anurādhapura; the Mahāvihāra, the Abhayagiri, and the Jetavanārāma. This was the result in the deviations in the disciplinary rules ''(vinaya)'' and doctrinal disputes. All the other monasteries of Sri Lanka owed ecclesiastical allegiance to one of the three. Sri Lanka is famous for its creations of Buddhist sculptures made of stone and cast in bronze alloy.&lt;ref&gt;von Schroeder, Ulrich. 1990. ''Buddhist Sculptures of Sri Lanka''.

===Myanmar===
[[File:Buddha 00004.JPG|thumb|upright|A Mandalay-style statue of Buddha]]
A neighbor of India, [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was naturally strongly influenced by the eastern part of Indian territory. The [[Mon people|Mon]] of southern Burma are said to have been converted to Buddhism around 200&amp;nbsp;BC under the proselytizing of the Indian king [[Ashoka]], before the schism between [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

Early Buddhist temples are found, such as Beikthano in central Myanmar, with dates between the 1st and the 5th centuries. The Buddhist art of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in Southeast Asia following the expansion of the Mon Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries.

Later, thousands of Buddhist temples were built at [[Bagan]], the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries, and around 2,000 of them are still standing. Beautiful jeweled statues of the Buddha are remaining from that period. Creation managed to continue despite the seizure of the city by the [[Mongols]] in 1287.
[[File:Bodleian MS. Burm. a. 12 Life of the Buddha 15-18.jpg|thumbnail|left|Scenes from the life of the Buddha in an 18th-century Burmese watercolour]]
During the [[Ava Kingdom|Ava period]], from the 14th to 16th centuries, the Ava (Innwa) style of the Buddha image was popular. In this style, the Buddha has large protruding ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, thin lips and a hair bun that is pointed at the top, usually depicted in the bhumisparsa [[mudra]].&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part1/post_pagan_period__part_1.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 1 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Konbaung dynasty]], at the end of the 18th century, the Mandalay style of the Buddha image emerged, a style that remains popular to this day.&lt;ref name="niu2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part3/post_pagan_period__part_3.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 3 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a marked departure from the Innwa style, and the Buddha's face is much more natural, fleshy, with naturally-slanted eyebrows, slightly slanted eyes, thicker lips, and a round hair bun at the top. Buddha images in this style can be found reclining, standing or sitting.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/mandalay_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalay-style Buddhas wear flowing, draped robes.

Another common style of Buddha images is the Shan style, from the [[Shan people]], who inhabit the highlands of Myanmar. In this style, the Buddha is depicted with angular features, a large and prominently pointed nose, a hair bun tied similar to Thai styles, and a small, thin mouth.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/shan_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===
{{See|Khmer art|Khmer sculpture}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Lokesvara statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Bodhisattva [[Avalokitesvara|Lokesvara]], [[Cambodia]] 12th century.]]
[[Cambodia]] was the center of the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] kingdom, which expanded into Burma and as far south as Malaysia between the 3rd and 6th centuries. Its influence seems to have been essentially political, most of the cultural influence coming directly from India.

Later, from the 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu [[Khmer Empire]] dominated vast parts of the Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was foremost in the development of Buddhist art in the region. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of [[Jayavarman VII]], a Buddhist king that built [[Angkor Thom]] walled city, adorned with the smiling face of [[Lokeshvara]] in Angkor Thom ''dvaras'' (gates) and ''prasat'' towers [[Bayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Monuments and Temples of Cambodia and Laos | author = W.

A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.

Often, Khmer art manages to express intense spirituality through divinely beaming expressions, in spite of spare features and slender lines.

The Thai Buddhist art encompasses period for more than a millennia, from pre Thai culture of Dvaravati and Srivijaya, to the first Thai capital of Thai 13th century Sukhothai, all the way to  succeeding Thai kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"&gt;{{cite book | title = Thai Buddhist Art: Discover Thai Art | author = Dawn F.

From the 1st to the 7th centuries, Buddhist art in [[Thailand]] was first influenced by direct contact with Indian traders and the expansion of the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdom, leading to the creation of Hindu and Buddhist art inspired from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] tradition, with numerous monumental statues of great virtuosity.

From the 9th century, the various schools of Thai art then became strongly influenced by Cambodian [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] art in the north and [[Sri Vijaya]] art in the south, both of Mahayana faith. Up to the end of that period, Buddhist art is characterized by a clear fluidness in the expression, and the subject matter is characteristic of the [[Mahayana]] pantheon with multiple creations of [[Bodhisattva]]s.

From the 13th century, [[Theravada]] Buddhism was introduced from Sri Lanka around the same time as the [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] was established.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; The new faith inspired highly stylized images in Thai Buddhism, with sometimes very geometrical and almost abstract figures.

During the [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period (14th-18th centuries), the Buddha came to be represented in a more stylistic manner with sumptuous garments and jeweled ornamentations. Many Thai sculptures or temples tended to be [[gilding|gilded]], and on occasion enriched with inlays.

The ensuing period of [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] saw the further development of Thai Buddhist art.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; By the 18th century, [[Bangkok]] was established as the royal center of the kingdom of [[Siam]]. Subsequently, the Thai rulers filled the city with imposing Buddhist monuments to demonstrate their Buddhist piety as well as to showcase their authority. Among others are the celebrated [[Wat Phra Kaew]] which hosts the [[Emerald Buddha]]. Other Buddhist temples in Bangkok includes [[Wat Arun]] with ''prang'' style towers, and [[Wat Pho]] with its famous image of [[Reclining Buddha]].

Like the rest of Southeast Asia, [[Indonesia]] seems to have been most strongly influenced by India from the 1st century CE. The islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java (island)|Java]] in western Indonesia were the seat of the empire of [[Sri Vijaya]] (8th-13th century), which came to dominate most of the area around the Southeast Asian peninsula through maritime power. The Sri Vijayan Empire had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, under a line of rulers named the [[Sailendra]]. The Sailendras was the ardent temple builder and the devoted patron of Buddhism in Java.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java | author1 = Jean Philippe Vogel | author2 = Adriaan Jacob Barnouw | publisher = Asian Educational Services | year = 1936 | isbn = 9788120612259 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=wQ2x0cbZkn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Java&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLm_6o6PfVAhXKo48KHUc_DuEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Java&amp;f=false| pages = 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sri Vijaya spread Mahayana Buddhist art during its expansion into the Southeast Asian peninsula. Numerous statues of Mahayana [[Bodhisattva]]s from this period are characterized by a very strong refinement and technical sophistication, and are found throughout the region. One of the earliest Buddhist inscription in Java, the [[Kalasan inscription]] dated 778, mentioned about the construction of a [[Kalasan|temple]] for the goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt;

[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Side Detail.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of [[Prajnaparamita of Java|Prajñāpāramitā from Singhasari]], East Java.]]
Extremely rich and refined architectural remains are found in Java and Sumatra. The most magnificent is the temple of [[Borobudur]] (the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built  around 780-850&amp;nbsp;AD), built by Sailendras.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt; This temple is modelled after the Buddhist concept of universe, the [[Mandala]] which counts 505 images of the seated Buddha and unique bell-shaped stupa that contains the statue of Buddha. Borobudur is adorned with long series of bas-reliefs narrated the holy Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas | author = John Miksic | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781462909100 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=borobudur+golden+tales+of+the+buddhas&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP45O7r_rVAhWJtY8KHcpuAfYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20art&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Buddhist structure in Indonesia probably is the [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] stupas at Karawang, West Java, dated from around the 4th century. This temple is some plastered brick stupas. However, Buddhist art in Indonesia reach the golden era during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty rule in Java. The bas-reliefs and statues of [[Boddhisatva]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], and [[Kinnara]] found in [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sewu|Sewu]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], and [[Candi Plaosan|Plaosan]] temple is very graceful with serene expression, While [[Mendut]] temple near Borobudur, houses the giant statue of [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]].

In [[Sumatra]] Sri Vijaya probably built the temple of Muara Takus, and [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]]. The most beautiful example of classical Javanese Buddhist art is the serene and delicate statue of [[Prajnaparamita]] (the collection of National Museum Jakarta) the goddess of transcendental wisdom from [[Singhasari]] kingdom.&lt;ref name ="VCM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prajnaparamita | publisher =Virtual Collections of Asian Masterpieces| url  =http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=12147| accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian Buddhist Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the [[Chola]] rulers of India, then followed by [[Majapahit]] empire.

==Contemporary Buddhist art==
[[File:Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism (1916) (14779469804).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration from the book "Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism" (1916).]]
Many contemporary artists have made use of Buddhist themes. Notable examples are [[Bill Viola]], in his video installations,&lt;ref&gt;Buddha Mind in Contemporary Art, University of California Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Connell]], in sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;ARTlines, April 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allan Graham]] in his multi-media "Time is Memory".&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Rail, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK [[The Network of Buddhist Organisations]] has interested itself in identifying Buddhist practitioners across all the arts. In 2005 it co-ordinated the UK-wide Buddhist arts festival, "A Lotus in Flower";&lt;ref&gt;a poster advertising one of the events is archived here - http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824213345/http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf# |date=24 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 it helped organise the two-day arts conference, "Buddha Mind, Creative Mind".&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwbo-news.blogspot.com/2009/07/report-from-buddha-mind-creative-mind.html |title=Triratna Buddhist Community News: Report from ‘Buddha Mind - Creative Mind?’ conference |author=Lokabandhu |publisher=fwbo-news.blogspot.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the latter an association of Buddhist artists was formed.&lt;ref name="ning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dharmaarts.ning.com/ |title=Dharma Arts Network - Launched at Buddha Mind - Creative Mind ? |publisher=dharmaarts.ning.com |accessdate=2014-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010000408/http://dharmaarts.ning.com/# |archive-date=10 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Church of Ecce Homo''' was a [[catholic Church]] in [[Alcamo]], in the [[province of Trapani]].

== Historical hints ==
The present Church was built in 1753 on the same spot where there was a [[chapel]], called the ''Crocifissello'' (that is the small [[Crucifix]]) close to the western town walls; in fact, as it was very little, the members of the Congregation asked the [[municipality]] of that time, the [[authorization]] to have the chapel’s [[courtyard]] in order to build a wider Church there.&lt;ref name="jaco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacoponedatodi.xoom.it/ecce%20homo.htm|website=jacoponedatodi.xoom.it|title=ECCE HOMO|accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction started in 1753 and was completed the following year; the building was closed to service because of the [[1968 Belice earthquake]]. After a lot of years, in 1986, the Monuments and Fine Arts Department of Trapani decided a first restoration work including the consolidation of the Church, the [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] and the roof.

Later, in 1992 the Department disposed the completing  of the works, and they repaired the [[stucco]]es, replaced the frames, adapted the systems, made the gildings and painted the Church.&lt;ref name="jaco"/&gt;

Today the Church of the Most Holy Ecce Homo is no longer a temple left to itself, on the contrary, it is a monument rescued from decay, and it has recently been used as an [[auditorium]] and as a meeting place for cultural events.&lt;ref name="trapaniplus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trapaniplus.it/schedacosedavedere.php?cosadavedere=158|website=trapaniplus.it|title=www.trapaniplus.it/schedacosedavedere.php?cosadavedere=158|accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description and works ==
The church has a simple portal, surmounted by a niche where you can see a marble [[alto-rilievo]] panel representing  [[Ecce homo|Ecce Homo]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p.62, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one circular nave, similar to that one in the [[Saints Cosma and Damiano's Church (Alcamo)|Saints Cosma and Damiano's Church]], with beautiful [[Settecento]] stucco decorations on the vault;  it has an emispheric shape, with four webs surmounting the windows ending on [[masonry]] pillars.

Inside the webs there are represented the profecy of the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]], the [[Flagellation]], the [[Calvary]] and the Risen’s [[Cross]]; in the middle of the vault there are the [[Holy Ghost]], as a dove, and the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name="jaco"/&gt;

There are three altars and these works:
*Ecce Homo, a [[wooden]] statue on the high altar
*A wooden Crucifix, on the left  altar
*[[Saint Francis of Paola]]: a recent statue on the right altar
*Organ with its [[choir]], settled above the entrance opposite the high altar.

== The Congregation ==
The Congregation of  the Most Holy Ecce Homo, founded at about 1750 by canonico Don Vincenzo Fiderico, [[Chapelain]] of the Hospital Santo Spirito e San Vito and its first [[Rector (religion)|Rector]], was formed by butchers and other merchants, who, owing to their working hours, were used to meet on Friday night in this Church for their spiritual meetings.

After having been hosted in other churches, in 1753 the [[bishop of Mazara del Vallo]], after some pressing requests made by Congregation, gave them the Church of the Crocifissello, in the district of Chiesa Madre and adjoining a courtyard limited by the old town walls and some houses.

The main scopes were these:
* To promote the greater glory of God the Father and of the Holy Church, the sinners’ conversion and the end of blasfemies.
* To devote oneself to spiriritual works and to the Most Holy Ecce Homo
* To take action for the reform of one’s habits, by giving other people the good example of [[Christian]] life and maintaining the spirit of charity towards everybody, because this is the bond which connects us to God.&lt;ref name="cat"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.89-90, Alcamo, Campo, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

These people were excluded:
*All women
*Noblemen or teachers or dignitaries of any kind
*Immoral, irreligious and  ed heretical people
*The people condemned for public or private crimes or guity of illegal purchase of Church property
*Dissolute or scandalous people, such as concubinaries, [[adulterers]], blasfemers, violators of festivities.

The feast was celebrated on the first Friday of March and it was preceded by a week of spiritual exercises and followed by the ''Forty Hours Devotion''. During the rites and processions, the members of the congregation  wore a cloth [[scapular]] with  two violet [[ribbons]] at their ends: one side, with the image of Ecce Homo, was hanging on their chest, and the other, behind their shoulders, had the [[embroidery]] of a crown made by thorns and three nails inside it.

The Congregation existed  until 1968, when the [[Belice Earthquake|Belice earthquake]] damaged its  structure remarkably and the Church was unfit for use..

The '''cut-up technique''' (or ''découpé'' in French) is an [[aleatory]] [[literary technique]] in which a written text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. The concept can be traced to at least the [[Dada]]ists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer [[William S. Burroughs]], and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.

==Technique==
The cut-up and the closely associated fold-in are the two main techniques:

*''Cut-up'' is performed by taking a finished and fully linear text and cutting it in pieces with a few or single words on each piece. The resulting pieces are then rearranged into a new text, such as in poems by [[Tristan Tzara]] as described in his short text, ''TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1920"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.391.org/manifestos/19201212tristantzara_dmonflabl.htm |title=manifestos: dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love by tristan tzara, 12th december 1920 |publisher=391 |date=12 December 1920 |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Fold-in'' is the technique of taking two sheets of linear text (with the same linespacing), folding each sheet in half vertically and combining with the other, then reading across the resulting page, such as in ''[[The Third Mind]]''. It is [[William S. Burroughs|Burroughs]] and [[Brion Gysin|Gysin]]'s joint development.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Caruso. William Burroughs, the infinite groundbreaker. Buenos Aires Herald. buenosairesherald.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

William Burroughs cited [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) and [[John Dos Passos]]' [[U.S.A. trilogy|''U.S.A.'' trilogy]], which incorporated newspaper clippings, as early examples of the cut ups he popularized.

[[Gil J. Wolman]] developed cut-up techniques as part of his [[lettrism|lettrist]] practice in the early 1950s.

Also in the 1950s, painter and writer [[Brion Gysin]] more fully developed the cut-up method after accidentally re-discovering it. He had placed layers of newspapers as a mat to protect a tabletop from being scratched while he cut papers with a [[razor blade]]. Upon cutting through the newspapers, Gysin noticed that the sliced layers offered interesting juxtapositions of text and image. He began deliberately cutting newspaper articles into sections, which he randomly rearranged. The book ''Minutes to Go'' resulted from his initial cut-up experiment: unedited and unchanged cut-ups which emerged as coherent and meaningful prose. South African poet [[Sinclair Beiles]] also used this technique and co-authored ''Minutes To Go''.

Gysin introduced Burroughs to the technique at the [[Beat Hotel]]. The pair later applied the technique to printed media and [[audio recording]]s in an effort to decode the material's implicit content, [[Hypothesis|hypothesizing]] that such a technique could be used to discover the true meaning of a given text.  Burroughs also suggested cut-ups may be effective as a form of [[divination]] saying, "When you cut into the present the future leaks out."&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r541727|pure_url=yes}} Break Through in Grey Room]&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs also further developed the "fold-in" technique. In 1977, Burroughs and Gysin published ''[[The Third Mind]]'', a collection of cut-up writings and essays on the form. Jeff Nuttall's publication ''[[My Own Mag]]'' was another important outlet for the then-radical technique.

In an interview, [[Alan Burns (author)|Alan Burns]] noted that for ''Europe After The Rain'' (1965) and subsequent novels he used a version of cut-ups: "I did not actually use scissors, but I folded pages, read across columns, and so on, discovering for myself many of the techniques Burroughs and Gysin describe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/book/?fa=customcontent&amp;GCOI=15647100621780&amp;extrasfile=A09F77F7-B0D0-B086-B615C61B62D698F2.html |author=David W. Madden |title=A Conversation with Alan Burns |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentine writer [[Julio Cortázar]] often used cut ups in his 1963 novel ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortázar novel)|Hopscotch]]''.

==History in literature==

In 1969, poets [[Howard W. Bergerson]] and [[J. A. Lindon]] developed a cut-up technique known as [[vocabularyclept poetry]], in which a poem is formed by taking all the words of an existing poem and rearranging them, often preserving the metre and stanza lengths.&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=Ben |authorlink=Howard Bergerson |date=February 1969 |title=Some Neglected Ways of Words |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/vol2/iss1/4/ |journal=[[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics]] |publisher=[[Greenwood Periodicals]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=14–19 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "Ben Rogers" is an anagrammatic pseudonym of "Bergerson" --&gt;&lt;ref name="lindon1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lindon |first=J. A. |authorlink=J. A. Lindon |date=May 1969 |title=The Vocabularyclept Poem, № 1 |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/vol2/iss2/8/ |journal=[[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics]] |publisher=[[Greenwood Periodicals]] |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=85–89 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bishop"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Yvonne M.|author1-link= Yvonne Bishop |last2=Fienberg |first2=Stephen E. |last3=Holland |first3=Paul W. |date=2007 |title=Discrete Multivariate Analysis: Theory and Applications |url= |location= |publisher=Springer |pages=340–342 |isbn=978-0-387-72805-6 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A precedent of the technique occurred during a Dadaist rally in the 1920s in which [[Tristan Tzara]] offered to create a poem on the spot by pulling words at [[random]] from a hat. [[Collage]], which was popularized roughly contemporaneously with the Surrealist movement, sometimes incorporated texts such as newspapers or brochures. Prior to this event, the technique had been published in an issue of 391 in the poem by Tzara, ''dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love'' under the sub-title, ''TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in-vacua.com/tzara.shtml|title=Tzara Combinations|author=|date=|website=www.in-vacua.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1920"/&gt;

A drama scripted for five voices by performance poet [[Hedwig Gorski]] in 1977 originated the idea of creating poetry only for performance instead of for print publication. The "neo-verse drama" titled ''Booby, Mama!'' written for "guerilla theater" performances in public places used a combination of newspaper cut-ups that were edited and choreographed for a troupe of non-professional street actors.&lt;ref&gt;Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street, Slough Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0615271033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booby Mama! Cut-Up Spoken Word, 1977 https://www.amazon.com/Booby-Mama-Surreal-Cut-Up-Spoken/dp/1507829159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kathy Acker]], a literary and intermedia artist, sampled external sources and reconfigured them into the creation of shifting versions of her own constructed identity. In her late 1970s novel ''[[Blood and Guts in High School]]'', Acker explored literary cut-up and appropriation as an integral part of her method.

==History in film==
[[Antony Balch]] and Burroughs created a collaboration film, ''The Cut-Ups''&lt;ref name="dangerousminds1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/william_burroughs_antony_balch_cut_ups|title=A Complete Disorientation of the Senses: William Burroughs’ and Antony Balch’s ‘Cut Ups’|author=|date=16 December 2010|website=dangerousminds.net|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that opened in London in 1967. This was part of an abandoned project called ''Guerrilla Conditions'' meant as a documentary on Burroughs and filmed throughout 1961–1965. Inspired by Burroughs' and Gysin's technique of cutting up text and rearranging it in random order, Balch had an editor cut his footage for the documentary into little pieces and impose no control over its reassembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/appraisal-films-william-burroughs-brion-gysin-anthony-balch-terms-recent-avant-garde-theory/|title=An Appraisal of the Films of William Burroughs, Brion Gysin, and Anthony Balch in terms of Recent Avant Garde Theory – Bright Lights Film Journal|author=|date=1 February 2003|website=brightlightsfilm.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opened at [[Oxford Street]]'s Cinephone cinema and had a disturbing reaction. Many audience members claimed the film made them ill, others demanded their money back, while some just stumbled out of the cinema ranting "it's disgusting".&lt;ref name="dangerousminds1"/&gt; Other cut-up films include ''Ghost at n°9 (Paris)'' (1963–72), a posthumously released short film compiled from reels found at Balch's office after his death, and ''William Buys a Parrott'' (1982), ''Bill and Tony'' (1972), ''Towers Open Fire'' (1963) and ''The Junky's Christmas'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/film/burroughs.html|title=UbuWeb Film &amp; Video –  William S. Burroughs|author=|date=|website=www.ubu.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical influence==
From the early 1970s, [[David Bowie]] used cut-ups to create some of his lyrics. [[Thom Yorke]] applied a similar method in [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) album, writing single lines, putting them into a hat, and drawing them out at random while the band rehearsed the songs. Perhaps indicative of Thom Yorke's influences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Radiohead – Everything in Its Right Place|url = http://radiohead1.tripod.com/songs/album/everything.htm|website = radiohead1.tripod.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; instructions for "How to make a Dada poem" appeared on Radiohead's website at this time.

[[Stephen Mallinder]] of [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] reported to ''[[Inpress]]'' magazine's [[Andrez Bergen]] that "I do think the manipulation of sound in our early days – the physical act of cutting up tapes, creating [[tape loop]]s and all that – has a strong reference to Burroughs and Gysin."&lt;ref&gt;"Vintage Cab Sav," Andrez Bergen. ''[[Inpress]]'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul McCartney was a Burroughs acquaintance in London when the White Album was recorded -- See "Revolution No. 9."

"'''Disabled'''" is a [[war poem]] by [[Wilfred Owen]] written in 1917. It expresses the tormented thoughts and recollections of a teenaged soldier in [[World War I]] who has lost his limbs in battle and is now confined to a wheelchair. The subject contrasts the predicament he is now in with the youthful pleasures he had enjoyed "before he threw away his knees". He recalls the impetuous circumstances in which he enlisted, notes how the crowds that greeted his return were smaller and less enthusiastic than those who cheered his departure, and laments how women no longer look at him but at "the strong men who were whole".

'''East Street Arts''' is  a contemporary arts organisation and [[registered charity]] based in Leeds, [[England]]. It was established in 1993 by Karen Watson and Jon Wakeman to provide space, services, facilities, opportunities and support for artists.&lt;ref name="esaweb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esaweb.org.uk/page.asp?sectionIdentifier=2005119_59563845&amp;pageIdentifier=200645_63637942 |title=ESA - Facilitating Visual Artists |publisher=Esaweb.org.uk |date=2004-10-29 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The arts organisations is dedicated to making art accessible to all. It operates on an international scale, supporting artists at all levels and stages of their careers. East Street Arts aims to sustain the alternative and challenge the norm through creating the space, time and resource for artists to be innovative, pioneering and successful. At the heart of its philosophy is developing unique, provocative and experimental environments for artists, residents, businesses and tourists to convene.

East Street Arts occupies places, bringing creativity, vibrancy and life to urban environments: from artistic commissions which reimagine public space to its portfolio of temporary and permanent arts properties.

Led by a dynamic trio of directors, its property portfolio spans the length and breadth of the country providing artistic workspaces and studios, exhibition venues, community arts hubs and, most recently, the UK’s first independent Art Hostel, creating a home-from-home for an international community of artists and curious tourists alike.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6578">'''Ecofeminist art''' emerged in the 1970s in response to [[ecofeminism|ecofeminist]] philosophy, that was particularly articulated by writers such as [[Carolyn Merchant]], [[Val Plumwood]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Starhawk]], [[Greta Gaard]], [[Karen J. Warren]] and [[Rebecca Solnit]]. Those writers emphasized the significance of relationships of cultural dominance and ethics (Merchant, Plumwood, [[Donna Haraway]]) expressed as [[sexism]] (Haraway), spirituality ([[Starhawk]]), [[speciesism]] (Warren, Gaard), capitalist values that privilege objectification and the importance of [[vegetarianism]] in these contexts (Gaard). The main issues Ecofeminism aims to address revolve around the effects of a "Eurocentric capitalist patriarchal culture built on the domination of nature, and the domination of woman 'as nature.'&lt;ref name="Salleh 1997 12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecofeminism as Politics: nature, Marx, and the postmodern|last=Salleh|first=Ariel|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer Luke Martell in the ''Ecology and Society'' journal writes that 'women' and 'nature' are both victims of patriarchal abuse and "ideological products of the Enlightenment culture of control." &lt;ref name="Salleh 1997 12"/&gt; Ecofeminism argues that we must become a part of nature, living with and among it. We must recognize that nature is alive and breathing and work against the passivity surrounding it that is synonymous with the passive roles enforced upon women by patriarchal culture, politics, and capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767502886|title=Ecofeminist Approaches to Early Modernity.|last=Jennifer.|first=Munroe,|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Laroche, Rebecca.|isbn=9781137001900|location=Basingstoke|oclc=767502886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevance of Ecofeminism was discussed in feminist art programs at the college and university level, including at the [[Institute for Social Ecology]] at [[Goddard College]], Vermont. In the USA, as far back as 1962, an overwhelming series of lawsuits against the corporate world came from the kitchens of mothers and grandmothers.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In 1964, Brazilian women set up the ''Acào Democràtica Feminina Gaucha'' which soon evolved into an advocacy group for sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women around the world were coming together in an effort to break the "continuum of Eurocentric patriarchal capitalist exploitation of natural resources, women, and of indigenous peoples." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Overview==
The work of ecofeminist writers helped inspire many early male and female practitioners in the ecological art movement to imitate their concerns about a more horizontal relationship to environmental functions in their own practices. The feminist art writer [[Lucy Lippard]], writing for the ''Weather Report Show'' she curated, which included many ecological artists and some ecofeminist artists from the list below (2007 Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art), commented on how many of those artists were women.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy, Lippard Weather Report 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors who have written about ecofeminist artists most prominently include [[Gloria Feman Orenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, Gloria; Diamond, Irene "Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Ecofeminism"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orenstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orenstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orenstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orenstein|first=Gloria Feman|title=The Greening of Gaia: Ecofeminist Artists Revisit the Garden|journal=Ethics &amp; the Environment|date=Spring 2003|volume=8|issue=1|pages=103–111|doi=10.1353/een.2003.0009|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/ethics_and_the_environment/v008/8.1orenstein.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Progressions in Ecofeminist Art: The Changing Focus of Women in Environmental Art |first=Jade |last=Wildy |url=http://magazin.cultura21.de/piazza/english/between-art-and-science.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Women's Environmental Art Directory'' (''WEAD'') is a compendium of women who self-identify as environmental artists, initiated by [[Jo Hanson]] and [[Susan Leibovitz Steinman]] in the 1990s, to credit women artists who might not otherwise be recognized by the mainstream art world. In addition to artists, some curators were influenced by ecofeminist thinking, such as [[Amy Lipton]], co-curator of ecoartspace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liptonarts.com/ecoart|title=ecoartspace  -  LiptonArts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Tricia Watts.

'''Ecstasy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἔκστασις ''ekstasis'', "to be or stand outside oneself, a removal to elsewhere" from ''ek-'' "out," and ''stasis'' "a stand, or a standoff of forces") is a term used in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]], [[Christian philosophy|Christian]] and [[Existential philosophy|Existential]] philosophy. The different traditions using the concept have radically different perspectives.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
According to [[Plotinus]], ecstasy is the culmination of human possibility. He contrasted emanation (πρόοδος, ''prohodos'') from the [[Henology|One]]—on the one hand—with ecstasy or reversion (ἐπιστροφή, ''epistrophe'') back to the One—on the other.

This is a form of ecstasy described as the vision of, or union with, some otherworldly entity (see [[religious ecstasy]])—a form of ecstasy that pertains to an individual trancelike experience of the sacred or of God.

==Christian mysticism==
[[File:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''Ecstasy of Saint Teresa'', 1652, by [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]]]]
Among the [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystics]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Teresa of Ávila]] had mystical experiences of ecstasy, or talked about ecstatic visions of God.

==Existential philosophy==

The term is currently used in philosophy usually to mean "outside-itself". One's consciousness, for example, is not self-enclosed, as  one can be conscious of an [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] person, who falls well outside one's own self. In a sense consciousness is usually, "outside itself," in that its object (what it thinks about, or perceives) is not itself. This is in contrast to the term '''[[wiktionary:enstasis|enstasis]]''' which means from "standing-within-oneself" which relates to [[theoria|contemplation]] from the perspective of a speculator.&lt;ref&gt;J. Glenn Friesen, [http://www.members.shaw.ca/aevum/Enstasy.pdf "Enstasy, Ecstasy and Religious Self-reflection"], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of enstasis gives way to the example of the use of the "ecstasy" as that one can be "outside of oneself" with time. In temporalizing, each of the following: the past (the 'having-been'), the future (the 'not-yet') and the present (the 'making-present') are the "outside of itself" of each other. The term ecstasy ({{lang-de|Ekstase}}) has been used in this sense by [[Martin Heidegger]] who, in his ''[[Being and Time]]'' of 1927, argued that our [[being-in-the-world]] is usually focused toward some person, task, or the past (see also [[existence]] and ''[[Dasein]]''). Telling someone to "remain in the present" could then be self-contradictory, if the present only emerged as the "outside itself" of future possibilities (our projection; ''{{lang|de|Entwurf}}'') and past facts (our [[Facticity#Heidegger|thrownness]]; ''{{lang|de|Geworfenheit}}'').&lt;ref&gt;As [[existentialist]] scholar [[Alphonso Lingis]] writes: "Existential philosophy defined the new concepts of ecstasy or of transcendence to fix a distinct kind of being that is by casting itself out of its own given place and time, without dissipating, because at each moment it projects itself — or, more exactly, a variant of itself — into another place and time. Such a being is not ideality, defined as intuitable or reconstitutable anywhere and at any moment. ''Ex-istence,'' understood etymologically, is not so much a state or a stance as a movement, which is by conceiving a divergence from itself or a potentiality of itself and casting itself into that divergence with all that it is." —Lingis, Alphonso. "The Imperative," Indiana University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmanuel Levinas]] disagreed with Heidegger's position regarding ecstasy and existential temporality from the perspective of the experience of insomnia.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin, Dachun Yang, Linyu Gu (eds), [https://books.google.com/books?id=p3y64bw5kr8C&amp;dq= ''Levinas: Chinese and Western Perspectives''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Levinas talked of the Other in terms of 'insomnia' and 'wakefulness'.&lt;ref&gt;A-T. Tymieniecka (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iGONF4dUwOwC&amp;dq= ''Phenomenology World Wide''], Springer, 2003, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized the absolute otherness of the Other and established a social relationship between the Other and one's self.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin ''et al'' (eds), 2009, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he asserted that ecstasy, or exteriority toward the Other, forever remains beyond any attempt at full capture; this otherness is interminable or infinite.&lt;ref&gt;Sociality is a "relation ... to the infinite" (E. Levinas, ''Le temps et l'autre'', Presses universitaires de France, 1991, p. 8). The "relation with the Other" [''rapport à autrui''] is one among the "inevitable articulations of the transcendence of time" [''articulations ... inévitables de la transcendance du temps''] which are "neither ecstasy where the Same is absorbed in(to) the Other nor knowledge where the Other belongs to the Same" [''ni extase où le Même s'absorbe dans l'Autre ni savoir où l'Autre appartient au Même''] (''ibid''., p. 13).&lt;/ref&gt; This "infiniteness" of the Other would allow Levinas to derive other aspects of philosophy as secondary to this ethic. Levinas writes:
{{quote|text=The others that obsess me in the other do not affect me as examples of the same genus united with my neighbor by resemblance or common nature, [[individuation]]s of the human race, or chips off the old block... The others concern me from the first. Here fraternity precedes the commonness of a [[genus]]. My relationship with the Other as neighbor gives meaning to my relations with all the others.&lt;ref&gt;E. Levinas, ''Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence'', 1981, Springer, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other uses of the term==
The term 'ecstasy' is also used concomitantly by philosophers to refer to a heightened state of pleasure or area of consciousness that may have been ignored by other theorists; to sexual experiences with another person, or as a general state of intense emotional [[ecstasy (emotion)|rapture]]. These may include [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], intense consciousness toward another, or extraordinary physical connections to others.

==Synopsis==
[[Howard Rollins]] stars as assassinated NAACP [[civil rights]] activist [[Medgar Evers]], while [[Irene Cara]] co-stars as his wife (and future [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] chairperson) [[Myrlie Evers|Myrlie]]. The film concentrates on Medgar Evers, an ex-insurance agent turned activist, in the final years of his life as the first NAACP field secretary in Mississippi. In 1954, he is involved in a boycott against white merchants and was instrumental in eventually [[desegregation|desegragating]] the [[University of Mississippi]] in 1962. His home in [[Jackson, Mississippi]] is besieged by [[Bigotry|bigots]], and he and his family are threatened with dire consequences. Myrtle Evers with her children were often at home alone when fire bombs and bricks were thrown against their home and through their windows.  However, The Everses continued to work towards the goal of [[Racial integration|integrating]] the racially polarized. Medgar Evers truly believed The Constitution to include the rights within were for each American citizen, no matter color, age, class or education. On June 12, 1963, however, the 37-year-old Medgar Evers is shot to death in front of his home by [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Byron De La Beckwith]].

[[Image:Pan-American Exposition - Horse Tamer.jpg|thumb|Roth's ''Horse Tamer'', from the Pan-American Exposition]]

'''Frederick George Richard Roth''' (1872 – 1944) was an [[United States|American]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] and [[animalier]], well known for portraying living [[animal]]s. The [[statue]] of the [[sled dog]] [[Balto]] in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]] is perhaps his most famous piece.

==Biography==
Roth was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and briefly worked in his father's business. He traveled to [[Europe]], where he took [[art]] classes in several countries, including the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna]], and the [[Royal Academy]] in [[Berlin]]. He also studied animals in their natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. When he returned to the United States, he continued his schooling at the [[New York Academy]].  By 1900, he was working professionally as a sculptor.&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Roth, Frederick George Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth won awards at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] (1901) in Buffalo, the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (1904) in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], and the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915)]] in [[San Francisco]], and at another [[World's Fair]] in [[Buenos Aires]]. He became the president of the [[National Sculpture Society]]. From 1934 to 1936, he worked under the [[Works Progress Administration|Works Projects Administration]] as the head sculptor for the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].  He was elected to the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

===Balto===
His statue of Balto was unveiled on December 17, 1925, and was the first statue in the city to honor a [[dog]]. The black [[Siberian Husky]] became famous during the [[1925 serum run to Nome]], which saved the children of the city from a [[diphtheria]] [[epidemic]].

The statue is [[bronze]], and is set on a large granite rock near the entrance of Central Park at East 67th Street, by the [[Tisch Children's Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smithsonian Museum of American Art Inventories of Painting and Sculpture Control Number IAS 87870159|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=record_ID:siris_ari_302803|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A plaque on the front is engraved with seven sled dogs running through a [[blizzard]], and the following words:

:Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed [[antitoxin]]s 660 miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through [[Arctic]] blizzards from [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]] to the relief of stricken Nome in the Winter of 1925.
:ENDURANCE FIDELITY INTELLIGENCE

The statue is popular among tourists, especially children.

The '''ice nativity scene''' ([[German language|German]] ''Eiskrippe'') is an ice sculpture exhibited annually in the Landhaus courtyard in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], during [[Advent]] time. The project of a [[nativity scene]] made of [[glaze ice]] has been a highlight in the town’s Advent scene since 1996 and receives international media attention.

== History ==
[[File:Eiskrippe 2011 Graz 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Ice nativity scene 2011 (detail)]]
The first ice nativity scene was modelled in 1996 on behalf of the Graz tourist association. The renowned [[Villach]] ice artist Gert J. Hödl (1943–2017) who had already succeeded in [[Canada]], [[Russia]], [[Norway]] and [[Japan]] came on board for the artistic direction. After two years of planning Hödl alongside four employees carved an ice nativity scene out of 156 blocks with a total weight of 23 tons, a global first. The Landhaus in the city centre was chosen as exhibition site for artwork with life-sized characters. The complete installation was eight meters wide by four meters high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Christian Weniger|title=Eine Eiskrippe aus 23 Tonnen Eis für Graz|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=1996-10-29|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tourist association kept the project alive for the following years and was first able to provide online live pictures in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eiskrippe auch im Internet|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=1998-11-29|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since its first installation the nativity scene is sculpted in late November or early December and revealed in a solemn ceremony. In the evening hours the ice nativity scene and the [[Arcade (architecture)|Arcade halls]] of the Landhaus are colorfully illuminated.

To ensure increased durability, bigger blocks were first used in 2003, the year Graz was the [[European Capital of Culture]], and the ice weight rose to 45 tons. The ice also showed a greenish hue for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eiskrippe schimmert heuer grün|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=2003-11-23|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a tribute to a famous son of Graz, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who had been elected [[Governor of California]] shortly before, Hödl put a bear – the Californian [[heraldic animal]] – in the background of the [[Holy family]], an action that greatly enhanced international media interest.&lt;ref name="hecke03"&gt;{{cite news|author=Bernd Hecke|title=Bei Krippe ist der Bär los|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=2003-11-29|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other actions aimed at slowing down the melting process include a more "[[monument]]al construction" first implemented in 2004 which is supposed to generate an [[Ice house (building)|ice house]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Krippe mit Kühlhauseffekt|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=2004-12-04|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several sets of characters are stored in an ice house near Graz in case they are required as replacements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Das Geheimnis hinter der Eiskrippe|periodical=|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/steiermark/graz/grazumgebung/4613162/GRAZER-ADVENT_Das-Geheimnis-hinter-der-Eiskrippe|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-12-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Michael Saria|date=2014-12-08|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, [[Finland|Finnish]] ice artist Kimmo Frosti is responsible for the artistic design of the ice nativity scene. With support from a five-man team and [[liquid nitrogen]], it takes him about a week to complete the work. The components are then arranged with the help of a [[forklift]].&lt;ref name="saria16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Herr Frosti schnitzt die Grazer Eiskrippe|periodical=|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/steiermark/graz/5124800/Video_Herr-Frosti-schnitzt-die-Grazer-Eiskrippe|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-12-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Michael Saria|date=2016-11-26|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grazer Eiskrippe aus rund 50 Tonnen Eis aufgebaut|periodical=|publisher=[[Tiroler Tageszeitung]]|url=http://www.tt.com/panorama/gesellschaft/9322730-91/grazer-eiskrippe-aus-rund-50-tonnen-eis-aufgebaut.csp|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-12-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=2014-11-28|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ice nativity scene has generated international attention since its first installment. As of 2016, coverage was provided on more than 200 international TV channels and newspapers. [[press agency|Press agencies]] like ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' and ''[[Reuters]]'' reported on the project.&lt;ref name="saria16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice Sculpture of Nativity Scene Created in Graz, Austria By Gert J.

== Controversy ==
[[File:Eiskrippe 2009 Graz 01.jpg|thumb|Collapsed artwork 2009]]
Despite its value as a tourist attraction there has been debate over the meaningfulness of the ice nativity scene. At warmer temperatures the construction does not always survive throughout the entirety of [[Advent]]. In 2002, the sculpture collapsed before being even opened to the public, and had to be saved by the artist with night work.&lt;ref name="hecke03" /&gt;
In 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eiskrippe im Landhaushof eingestürzt|periodical=|publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]|url=http://stmv1.orf.at/stories/409301|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-12-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=2009-12-12|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009, the nativity scene did not edndure the warm weather and crumpled before [[Christmas]]. A local politician of the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Green Party]] cynically noted: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Due to global warming, Advent will become ever milder. This raises the question of whether the city of Graz should continue to invest more than 40,000 € in a pool of water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eine Eiskrippe mit Ablaufdatum|publisher=[[Kronen Zeitung]]|language=de|date=2006-12-23|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Suggestions to cancel the project have been turned down by the tourist association who argued that the ice nativity scene rendered the economically important Graz Advent an "unmistakable" event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grazer Eiskrippe „gerettet“|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=2005-12-02|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Tiroler Tageszeitung]]'' made tongue-in-cheek claims about yearly bets of Graz citizens on the ice nativity scene’s endurance.&lt;ref name="tt" /&gt;
A planned wood roof to protect the artwork from rain was vetoed in 1999 through intervention of the [[Federal Monuments Office]] because it would disturb the ambience of the [[Renaissance architecture]]. In the same year there was a conflict of interest with a movie event that wished to keep equipment in place, which nearly prevented the popular artwork’s construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bernd Hecke|title=Der Eisschnitzer droht, Graz den Rücken zu kehren|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=1999-11-25|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Intellectual property]]''' (IP) consists of four kinds: [[patent]], [[trademark]], [[copyright]], and [[trade secret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bramson|first=R.S.|date=1981|title=Intellectual property as collateral — patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights.|url=|journal=The Business Lawyer|volume=36|pages=1567-1604|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to understand these areas and use them correctly, a person needs to be trained and educated. That training may be delivered through various types of resources, including webinars, college courses, webpages, and books. Intellectual property education should teach the individual what these areas are, what aspects of the law apply to them, and how to understand normal situations which might arise regarding those specific area.  Because of its importance, intellectual property education should be available to people of all age groups and education levels. Because intellectual property laws are specific to each country, training on the topic is also specific to each country.

Copyright protects original expression of ideas in different forms, but not the ideas themselves. The goal of copyright law is to encourage individual and business entities to produce original work by rewarding them with exclusive rights for their benefits, which is subject to time and statutory exceptions.

== Governing Laws of Copyright ==

=== Constitution ===
United States copyrights law is based in U.S. Constitution, which authorizes Congress to provide authors with certain exclusive rights in their writings for a limited period of time.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/10617&lt;/nowiki&gt; U.S.C.A. § 106&lt;/ref&gt; The "writings" is a broad term, which means any work of original expression in any form or medium, including literary, artistic, musical and etc.. "Authors" is also a broad term, which includes all creators of works.

=== Copyright Act of 1976 ===
Copyright law is primarily governed by federal statute and the current controlling statute is Copyright Act of 1976, as amended.[https://www.copyright.gov/title17/title17.pdf] Under the [[Supremacy Clause|Supremacy Clause of Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. art. 6, cl. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;, with few exceptions, the Copyright Act of 1976 preempts state law.

=== Regulations ===
The US Copyright Office administers copyrights authorized by the Copyright Act, whose functions include rulemaking, regulate copyright registration, administering statutory and compulsory licenses. It also provides legal and regulatory background information as well as procedural guidance on its [https://copyright.gov/ website].

=== TEACH Act ===
The federal [[TEACH Act]] (Technology, Education, and Copyright Harmonization Act of 2002) was signed in November 2002, and governs the use of copyrighted materials in online learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://copyright.cornell.edu/teach-act|title=New Copyright Legislation (TEACH Act) {{!}} Copyright Information Center|website=copyright.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TEACH Act eases some of the rules put in place by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://er.educause.edu/articles/2006/1/managing-intellectual-property-for-distance-learning|title=Managing Intellectual Property for Distance Learning|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities, including the University of Washington,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/uwcopy/Copyright_Law/TEACH_Act/|title=UW Copyright Connection : TEACH Act : TEACH Act|website=depts.washington.edu|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide information about compliance with the TEACH Act, often related to the use of [[Learning management system|learning management systems]]

=== State Law ===
Though the Copyright Act preempts state law, state law covers the issues which is outside the scope of Copyright Act, such as works of authorship that have not been expressed in a tangible medium(outside of scope of "[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102 fixed in any tangible medium of expression]"&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 102(a)&lt;/ref&gt;), right not equivalent to any of the "[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106 exclusive rights]"&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 106&lt;/ref&gt;, etc..

=== International Copyright Treaties ===
International copyright treaties between U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions is enforceable in U.S. territory under the Supremacy Clause, including: [[Berne Convention|The Berne Convention]], [[Universal Copyright Convention|The Universal Copyright Convention]], [[WIPO Copyright Treaty|The WIPO Copyright Treaty]], [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty|The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]], [[Geneva Phonograms Convention|The Geneva Phonograms Convention]] and [[TRIPS Agreement|TRIPS]]. While their specific terms are different, two fundamental rules govern each member under each treaty: member countries must meet certain minimum standards for copyright protection in their local law and provide reciprocal treatment to copyright owners in other member jurisdictions. The copyright law provided by each jurisdiction is based on its own national laws.

== Popular Topics ==

=== Fair Use ===
[[Fair use]] is one important topic in Copyright and Intellectual Property Education. Fair use law allows for limited use of copyrighted materials without seeking and/or acquiring copyright clearance from the copyright owner. There are four factors of fair use: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount or portion used of the work, and (4) the effect of the use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/461034081|title=Copyright and cultural institutions: Guidelines for digitization for U.S. libraries, archives, and museums|last=Hirtle|first=Peter, B.|date=|publisher=Cornell University Library|others=Hudson, Emily., &amp; Kenyon, Andrew T.|year=2009|isbn=9780935995107|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=461034081}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Faculty, staff, and students may find a [https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use/fair-use-checklist.html#Fair%20Use%20Checklist Fair Use Checklist] helpful when determining whether or not their use of a material would fall under fair use. Columbia University Libraries' [https://copyright.columbia.edu/index.html Copyright Advisory Services] provides their own [https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use/fair-use-checklist.html#Fair%20Use%20Checklist Fair Use Checklist] and information about fair use law, as well as other information regarding copyright&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://copyright.columbia.edu/index.html|title=Copyright Advisory Services|last=|first=|date=|website=Columbia University Libraries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

For further clarification on Fair Use and how to determine if a person's use falls under that exception, Stanford University has a [https://fairuse.stanford.edu/charts-and-tools/ Charts and Tools] section on their website. This website includes links to codes of best practices - including the Center for Media &amp; Social Impact's [http://cmsimpact.org/code/code-best-practices-fair-use-media-literacy-education/ Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy Education], a [http://dirc.vraweb.org/ Digital Image Rights Computator] to help a user discover if an image they wish to use is copyrighted, and a [http://navigator.carolon.net/ Copyright Navigator] that provides basic information on how copyright law works. Each of the links on the website equips a user with enough resources to determine if their use of a copyrighted material falls under the protection of Fair Use.

The legislative intent for fair use in Section 107 in Copyright Act is stated as following: "the bill endorses the purpose and general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use, but there is no disposition to freeze the doctrine in the statute, especially during a period of rapid technological change. Beyond a very broad statutory explanation of what fair use is and some of the criteria applicable to it, the courts must be free to adapt the doctrine to particular situations on a case-by-case basis. Section 107 is intended to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://law.resource.org/pub/us/works/aba/ibr/H.Rep.94-1476.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; H.R. REP. 94-1476, 66, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5680&lt;/ref&gt;  It means courts have broad discretion to decide fair use application. U.S. Copyright Office creates a [https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html Fair Use Index] which summarizes the newest case law development in fair use. 

=== Public Domain ===
[[Public Domain]] is another important concept in Copyright and Intellectual Property Education. If a work is in public domain - i.e., if its copyright has expired, been lost, or was never given - that work may be used by anyone. In order to help determine if a work is in Public Domain, Cornell University provides a [https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain Public Domain Flow Chart] to help users identify if a work is protected by copyright law. In order to further understand copyright and public domain, the [https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809 Copy This Podcast] provides listeners with a brief history of Copyright Law and Public Domain. Each podcast is approximately twelve minutes long and covers topics such as "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/pop-culture-and-the-public-domain Pop Culture and the Public Domain]," "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/you-use-it-more-than-you-realize Fair Use: You Use It More Than You Realize]," and "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/notice-and-takedown-leave-it-be Notice and Takedown: Leave it Be]." Each of these podcasts features experts and scholars of copyright law and can provide users with information about how to navigate the world of copyright. 

=== Orphan Works ===
[[Orphan work|Orphan works]], or works where the creator or rightsholder is unable to be determined, are an important current topic in copyright law. There is currently no legislation in the United States place to fully address this issue, though progress has been made specifically for music with the [[Music Modernization Act]] in 2018. 

After the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], copyright holders were no longer required to register copyrighted works, which benefited copyright holders by simplifying the process to obtain and maintain copyright protection, but in turn complicated the process for potential users of copyrighted material to determine ownership over certain works as the central register for copyrighted materials was no longer deemed necessary. This made any usage of copyrighted materials outside of fair use a violation of copyright, but did not take into account the drastic changes of access and dissemination that would soon occur due to digitization and the internet. 

In 2006 the U.S. Copyright Office held a study and released a report on orphan works&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/orphan/orphan-report.pdf|title=Report on Orphan Works|last=A Report of the Register of Copyrights|first=|date=January 2006|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main conclusion was that new legislation was needed to address this issue, and that clearly delineated steps need to be identified for potential users of such works, as well as protocols set in place for when an author comes forward. 

Another report, ‘Orphan Works and Mass Digitization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/orphan/reports/orphan-works2015.pdf|title=Orphan Works and Mass Digitization|last=A Report of the Register of Copyrights|first=|date=June 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;’ was completed in 2012 with particular focus on how how efforts to preserve copyrighted material needed to be balanced with reasonable access to the work. This report laid out the prospective changes needed to alter the outdated legislation and better serve current informational needs. 

It is also important to note that in 2013, the UK passed a copyright act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/copyright-orphan-works|title=Guidance: Copyright: orphan works|last=Intellectual Property Office|first=|date=May 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that permitted usage of orphan works as long as a diligent effort was made and certain conditions were met, such as filing a ‘notice of use’ for the work.

'''Melvin Miller Rader''' (8 November 1903 – 14 June 1981) was an author and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Washington]] for 51 years, and an outspoken advocate of civil rights. He taught [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]] and [[political philosophy]]. In 1948, he was accused of being a [[Communism|communist]] by the [[Canwell Committee]] (the Joint Legislative Fact Finding Committee on [[House Un-American Activities Committee|Un-American Activities]]), and was later exonerated in 1951 by [[List of Attorneys General of Washington|Attorney General, Smith Troy]]. [[Ed Guthman]], a [[The Seattle Times|Seattle Times]] investigative reporter, received a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his reporting of the events. In 2009, an endowment fund was created in Rader's name at the [[University of washington|University of Washington]] to fund philosophy students engaged in social justice work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phil.washington.edu/enews/fall2010/enewsfall2010rader.htm University of Washington, Philosophy Department, webpage.]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

[[File:Beatles ad 1965 just the beatles crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[John Lennon]] (far left) with [[the Beatles]], 1965]]

"'''More popular than Jesus'''"{{efn|Although "Bigger than Jesus" has been used in analysis of the controversy,{{sfn|Womack|Davis|2012|p=103}} the specific words used were "more popular than Jesus".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}}}} was part of a longer remark made by [[the Beatles]]' [[John Lennon]] during a 1966 interview, in which he argued that [[Christianity]] would end, possibly before [[rock music]]. His opinions drew no controversy when originally published in the United Kingdom, but angry reactions flared up in Christian communities when the comment was republished in the United States five months later. The full quotation was: {{quote|Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I'll be proved right. '''We're more popular than Jesus now'''; I don't know which will go first – rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.}}

The statement originates from an interview conducted by journalist [[Maureen Cleave]], who included it in a March 1966 article for the London newspaper the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'', which drew no public reaction at the time. When ''Datebook'', a US teen magazine, quoted Lennon's comments five months later in August, extensive protests broke out in the United States, particularly throughout the [[Bible Belt]]. Some radio stations stopped playing Beatles songs, their records were publicly burned, press conferences were cancelled, and threats were made. The controversy coincided with the group's [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|US tour in August 1966]], and Lennon and [[Brian Epstein]] attempted to quell the dispute at a series of press conferences. Some tour events experienced disruption and intimidation, including a picketing by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

Shortly after the controversy broke, Lennon reluctantly apologised for the comment, saying "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it". He stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people [[Cultural impact of the Beatles|viewed and popularised the band]]. The events contributed to the Beatles' lack of interest in public live performances, and the US tour was the last they undertook, after which they became a studio-only band.

==Background {{anchor|BiggerThanJesus}}==
{{The Beatles history}}

In March 1966, London's ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' ran a weekly series of articles titled "How Does a Beatle Live?"{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}} that featured, in chronological order, [[John Lennon]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. The articles were written by journalist [[Maureen Cleave]],{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}} who knew the group well and had interviewed them regularly since the start of [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]] in the UK. Three years previously she had described them as "the darlings of Merseyside",{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}} and had accompanied them on the plane on the group's first US tour in February 1964.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}}{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|p=175}} For her lifestyle series in March 1966, she chose to interview the group individually, rather than all together, as was the norm.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}}

[[File:John Lennon press conference at Schiphol.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Lennon at a press conference, June 1964]]
Cleave interviewed Lennon on 4 March 1966. At his home, [[Kenwood, St. George's Hill|Kenwood]], in [[Weybridge]], she found a full-size [[crucifix]], a [[gorilla]] [[costume]], a medieval suit of [[armour]]{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=449}} and a well-organised library, with works by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[George Orwell]], [[Aldous Huxley]],{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}} and ''[[The Passover Plot]]'' by [[Hugh J. Schonfield]], which had influenced Lennon's ideas about Christianity.{{sfn|Cadogan|2008|p=4}} Cleave's article mentioned that Lennon was "reading extensively about religion",{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}} and quoted a comment he made:

{{blockquote|Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I'll be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first – [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}}&lt;ref name="LennonIKnew"&gt;{{cite news |first=Maureen |last=Cleave |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3646983/The-John-Lennon-I-knew.html |title=The John Lennon I knew |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=5 August 2014 | date=5 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cleave's interview with Lennon was published in the ''Evening Standard'' in March 1966 and provoked no public reaction in the UK.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} [[Church attendance]] there was in decline and the Christian churches were making no secret of the need to transform their image into something more relevant to modern times.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} Music historian Jonathan Gould wrote, "The satire comedians had had a field day with the increasingly desperate attempts of the Church to make itself seem more relevant ('Don't call me vicar, call me ''Dick''&amp;nbsp;...')."{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} In 1963, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Bishop of Woolwich]], [[John A.T. Robinson]], published a [[controversy|controversial]] but popular book, ''[[Honest to God]]'', urging the nation to reject traditional church teachings on [[morality]] and the concept of God as an "old man in the sky", and instead embrace a universal ethic of love.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} [[Bryan R. Wilson]]'s 1966 text ''Religion in Secular Society'' explained that increasing [[secularisation]] led to British churches being abandoned. However, in the US, churches remained popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secularisation in the Christian World: Essays in Honour of Hugh McLeod|editor1-first=Callum G.|editor1-last=Brown|editor2-first=Michael Francis|editor2-last=Snape|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2010|p=205|isbn=978-0-7546-6131-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both McCartney and Harrison had been baptised in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], but neither of them followed Christianity.&lt;ref name="vatican"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/7579019/Vatican-forgives-The-Beatles-for-bigger-than-Jesus-comment.html|title=Vatican forgives The Beatles for 'bigger than Jesus' comment|first=Nick|last=Pisa|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 April 2010|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of Beatlemania, the group came into contact with the Revd Ronald Gibbons, who told reporters that a Beatles version of "[[O Come, All Ye Faithful]]" might provide the [[Church of England]] with "the very shot in the arm it needs".{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}}

==Response in the US==
The day after Cleave's article appeared in the ''Evening Standard'', Beatles press officer [[Tony Barrow]] offered ''Datebook'', a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple [[pop music]] and producing more intellectually challenging work. As ''Datebook'' was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalisation of marijuana, it seemed like a suitable vehicle to carry this information.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=82}}

Lennon's quote was featured in a 3 July article in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and provoked no reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cleave |first=Maureen |date=3 July 1966 |title=Old Beatles—A Study in Paradox |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/07/03/93851831.html?pageNumber=118 |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, New York |access-date=16 December 2016 |pages=10–11, 30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late July, when ''Datebook'' republished the interviews, editor Art Unger put Lennon's quote "I don't know which will go first – rock 'n' roll or Christianity!" on the cover.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}}&lt;ref name="JohnLennonforgiven"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article133727.ece |title=John Lennon forgiven for Jesus claim |first=Maurice |last=Chittenden |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |accessdate=2 June 2011 | date=23 November 2008 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the cover was a quote from Paul McCartney regarding America: "It's a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Luft |first=Eric |date=2009 |title=Die at the Right Time: A Subjective Cultural History of the American Sixties |url= |location=North Syracuse, New York |publisher=Gegensatz Press |page=181 |isbn=978-0-9655179-2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Birmingham, Alabama]], [[WAYE|WAQY]] DJ Tommy Charles heard about Lennon's remarks from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, "That does it for me. I am not going to play the Beatles any more".{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment and the response was overwhelmingly negative.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} Charles later stated, "We just felt it was so absurd and [[sacrilege|sacrilegious]] that something ought to be done to show them that they can't get away with this sort of thing".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}} Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for [[United Press International]] News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 5 August.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the [[Deep South]] went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=176}}

Epstein was so concerned by the reaction that he considered cancelling [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|the group's upcoming US tour]], believing they would be seriously harmed in some way.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} He then flew to the US and held a press conference in [[New York City]], where he publicly criticised ''Datebook'', saying the magazine had taken Lennon's words out of context, and expressed regret on behalf of the group that "people with certain religious beliefs should have been offended in any way".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} Epstein's efforts had little effect, as the controversy quickly spread beyond the borders of the US. In [[Mexico City]] there were demonstrations against the group, and a number of countries, including [[South Africa]] and [[Spain]],&lt;ref name="SquashesBeatles"&gt;{{cite news |title=South Africa Squashes Beatles |newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |page=6|date=9 August 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the decision to ban the Beatles' music on national radio stations.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} The [[Holy See|Vatican]] issued a public denouncement of Lennon's comments.&lt;ref name="vatican"/&gt;

The Beatles left for their US tour on 11 August 1966. According to Lennon's wife, [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]], he was nervous and upset that he had made people angry simply by expressing his opinion.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} The Beatles attended a press conference in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]; Lennon did not want to apologise but was advised by Epstein and Barrow that he should.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=84}} Lennon said that "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it"{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=293}} but stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. He described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, "not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us."{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} Adamant that he was not comparing himself with Christ, he tried to explain the decline of Christianity in the UK. Pressed for an apology by a reporter, he said: "if you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry."{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=295}} Journalists gave a sympathetic response, and told Lennon that the [[Bible Belt]] were "quite notorious for their Christian attitude".{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=85}}

When the tour began, it was marred by protests and disturbances.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} Telephone threats were received, and concerts were picketed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} ''[[Daily Express]]'' writer Robert Pitman, responding to the US outcry, wrote, "It seems a nerve for Americans to hold up shocked hands, when week in, week out, America is exporting to us a subculture that makes the Beatles seem like four stern old churchwardens."{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}} The reaction was also criticised in the US; a [[Kentucky]] radio station announced that it would give the Beatles' music airplay to show its "contempt for hypocrisy personified", and the [[Jesuit]] magazine ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'' wrote: "Lennon was simply stating what many a Christian educator would readily admit".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}}

[[File:Mid-South Coliseum.jpg|left|thumb|During the Beatles' performance at [[Mid-South Coliseum]], [[Memphis, Tennessee]], on 19 August 1966, a firecracker was set off onstage.]]

The [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] city council, aware that a Beatles concert was scheduled at the [[Mid-South Coliseum]] during the tour, voted to cancel it rather than have "municipal facilities be used as a forum to ridicule anyone's religion", and also saying, "the Beatles are not welcome in Memphis".{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=12}} The Ku Klux Klan nailed a Beatles album to a wooden cross, vowing "vengeance", with conservative groups staging further public burnings of Beatles records.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}} The Reverend Jimmy Stroad stated that a Christian rally in Memphis "would give the youth of the mid-South an opportunity to show Jesus Christ is more popular than the Beatles".{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=11}} The Memphis shows did take place, on 19 August;{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=622}} the afternoon show went as planned, but there was a minor panic when a firecracker was set off on stage during the evening performance,&lt;ref name="BeatlesInterviewsorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1966.0819.beatles.html |title=Beatles Interview: Memphis, Tennessee |first=Jay |last=Spangler |publisher=Beatles Interviews |date=19 August 1966 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led the group to believe they were the target of gunfire.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}}

The Beatles hated the tour, partly due to the controversy and adverse reaction from Lennon's comments, and were unhappy about Epstein continuing to organise live performances that were increasingly at odds with their studio work.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=212–213}} The controversy had also overshadowed the US release of their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'',&lt;ref name="GilmoreAcidTest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beatles-revolver-how-lsd-opened-the-door-to-a-masterpiece-w436062 |first=Mikal|last=Gilmore |title=Beatles' Acid Test: How LSD Opened the Door to 'Revolver'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=25 August 2016|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the band considered to be their best and most mature musical statement up to that point.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|pp=xii, 174–75}} Following the tour, Harrison seriously contemplated leaving the group, but was persuaded to stay on the condition that the Beatles would from now on focus solely on their work as recording artists.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=213}} After a break, they reconvened in November 1966 to begin recording ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which was a major critical and commercial success when released in June 1967.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=350–351}} {{clear left}}

==Aftermath==
Lennon was asked about the controversy during a trip to [[Canada]] in 1969. He repeated his opinion that the Beatles were more influential on young people than Christ, adding that some ministers had agreed with him. He called the protestors in the US "fascist Christians", saying he was "very big on Christ. I've always fancied him. He was right."{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=412}} In 1978, he thanked Jesus for an end to the Beatles' touring, saying "if I hadn't said [that] and upset the very Christian Ku Klux Klan, well, Lord, I might still be up there with all the other performing fleas! God bless America. Thank you, Jesus."&lt;ref name="LennonIKnew"/&gt;

In 1993, [[Michael Medved]] wrote in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that "today, comments like Lennon's could never cause controversy; a contemptuous attitude to religion is all but expected from all mainstream pop performers."{{sfn|Huq|2007|p=143}} In 1997, [[Noel Gallagher]] claimed that his band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] was "bigger than God", but reaction was minimal.{{sfn|Huq|2007|p=143}}

In a 2008 article marking the 40th anniversary of the Beatles' double album ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as the "White Album"), the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', issued the statement:

{{blockquote|The remark by John Lennon, which triggered deep indignation, mainly in the United States, after many years sounds only like a "boast" by a young working-class Englishman faced with unexpected success, after growing up in the legend of [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and rock and roll. The fact remains that 38 years after breaking up, the songs of the Lennon-McCartney brand have shown an extraordinary resistance to the passage of time, becoming a source of inspiration for more than one generation of pop musicians.&lt;ref name=nyt-100413&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/arts/music/13arts-VATICANGETSA_BRF.html |title=Vatican Gets Around to Praising the Beatles |first=Dave|last=Itzkoff |work=The New York Times |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to the statement, Starr said "Didn't the Vatican say we were possibly Satanic, and they've still forgiven us?

The 1966 ''L'Osservatore Romano'' article noted that Lennon had apologised for his comments and that fellow Beatle Paul McCartney had criticized them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=6019  "Vatican newspaper responds to Ringo Starr's dismissal of Beatles coverage"].

In 2012, the ''[[Houston Press]]'' music blog compared several aspects of popular media and concluded that Jesus is more popular than the Beatles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/music/seriously-are-the-beatles-more-popular-than-jesus-6513260|title=Seriously: Are the Beatles More Popular Than Jesus?|last=Smith

==Other mentions==
On 18 May 1968, Lennon summoned the other Beatles to a meeting at [[Apple Corps]] to announce that he was the living reincarnation of Jesus: "I have something very important to tell you all. I am Jesus Christ. I'm back again."{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=233}} The meeting was adjourned for lunch and Lennon never mentioned the subject again.{{sfn|Ingham|2003|p=262}} In May 1969, Lennon and McCartney recorded "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]", with Lennon singing the lines, "Christ, you know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be, The way things are going, They're gonna crucify me."{{sfn|Ingham|2003|p=262}} In a [[BBC]] interview a few months later, Lennon called himself "One of Christ's biggest fans", talked about the Church of England, his vision of heaven, and unhappiness over being unable to marry [[Yoko Ono]] in church.&lt;ref name="BiggestFans"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2403617/Bigger-than-Jesus-The-Beatles-were-a-Christian-band.html |title=Bigger than Jesus?

On 3 December 1969,{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=296}} [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] asked Lennon to play the part of Jesus in the stage production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', which he declined,{{sfn|Ingham|2003|p=262}} although he said he would have been interested if Ono could play the part of [[Mary Magdalene]].&lt;ref name="LennonPlayJesus"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Lennon Won't Play Jesus |newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |page=2|date=5 December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon mentioned Jesus again in his 1970 song "[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]", singing, "I don't believe in Jesus", but also sang that he did not believe in the [[Bible]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]]'', and the Beatles.{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=6}} Critics of Lennon's lyrics have also focused on the line "Imagine there's no heaven" from his 1971 song "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]".{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=161}}

Lennon was [[murder of John Lennon|murdered]] on 8 December 1980 by [[Mark David Chapman]], who had become a [[born-again Christian]] in 1970{{sfn|Jones|1992|p=115}} and was incensed by Lennon's "more popular than Jesus" remark, calling it [[blasphemy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9971">'''Mozarabic art''' refers to art of [[Mozarabs]] (from ''musta'rab'' meaning “Arabized”), Iberian [[Christian]]s living in [[Al-Andalus]], the [[Muslim]] conquered territories in the period that comprises from the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Arab invasion of the Iberian Peninsula]] (711) to the end of the 11th century, adopted some Arab customs without converting to Islam, preserving their religion and some ecclesiastical and judicial autonomy.

Formerly used for the whole of the [[Iberian peninsula]], the term is now usually restricted, at least in architecture, to the south, with [[Repoblación art and architecture]] used for the north.

==Art==
The Mozarabic communities maintained some of the [[Visigothic]] churches that were older than the Arab occupation for the practice of their religious rites and were rarely able to build new ones, because, even though a certain religious tolerance existed, the authorizations for building new churches were very limited.  When permitted, new churches were always in rural areas or in the cities' suburbs, and of modest size.

When Christian kingdoms of the north of the peninsula initiated an expansion (which sometimes including the expulsion of native Muslim population in the conquered lands), some Mozarabs opted to emigrate towards these territories where they were offered land. Their Hispano-Visigothic culture had been mixing with the Muslim and it is to be supposed that this contributed to the emerging cultures of the new Christian kingdoms in all fields.  However it is unlikely that they were responsible for all of the artistic innovations brought to maturity  in the kingdoms of the north during the 10th century.

Concluding the first phase of the artistic process that is generally comprised in the ample concept of "[[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]]" and corresponding with Hispano-Visigothic art; another stylistic current was initiated in Iberia, inheriting many aspects of the earlier style and known as "[[Asturian architecture|Asturian art]]". This has been identified with the artistic creations that were being produced during the 9th century in the so-called "nucleus of resistance", specifically in the territories that comprised the [[kingdom of Asturias]]. However the artistic activity, in general (and architecture especially) was not limited to this area or this century, it encompassed all the northern peninsula and had continuity during the next century.

The displacement of the Christian-Muslim border to the [[Douro]] basin allowed the construction of new temples (works on which all the artistic capacity available was concentrated) in demand of the necessities of re-settling. The now prosperous Northern kingdoms were in a condition to undertake that task (as they had already been doing), without depending on hypothetical contributions of the incorporated Mozarabs, so it cannot be assumed that all the religious buildings and all the artistic creations are owed to these mainly rural immigrants who arrived with limitation of means and resources.

After the publication in 1897 of the well-informed work in four volumes ''History of the Mozarabs of Spain'' (''Historia de los mozárabes de España'') by [[Francisco Javier Simonet]], the professor and investigator [[Manuel Gómez Moreno]] published 20 years later (1917) a monograph about ''The Mozarabic Churches''. It is here where the Mozarabic character is applied to the churches constructed in Christian territory from the end of the 9th century until the beginning of the 11th, and where the term "Mozarabic" is instituted to designate this architectural form and all of the related art. The denomination had success in becoming one that has been commonly used, although other scholars claimed the interpretation lacked rigour.

The Mozarabic character of the temples that Gómez Moreno referred to in his book has been questioned by modern historiography, including by the not so modern. Already [[José Camón Aznar]] in his ''Spanish Architecture of the 10th Century'' (''Arquitectura española del siglo X'') considered himself against such an interpretation, after him [[Isidro Bango Torviso]] and many others, to the point that the present tendency shows a trend towards the abandoning of "'''Mozarabic Art'''" denomination altogether and its substitution by "[[Repoblación art and architecture]] to refer to the period, especially in the north of Spain.

==Literature==
[[Image:B Facundus 233vdét.jpg|right|thumb|Beatus of Facundus: Judgement of Babylon]]
The principal exponent is religious literature: Mozarabic missals, antiphoneries and prayerbooks, created in the [[history of the book|scriptorium]] of the monasteries. Examples of quality and originality of the miniatures and [[illuminated manuscripts]] are the ''Commentarium in Apocalypsin'' (''[[Commentary on the Apocalypse]]'') from [[Beatus of Liébana]], Beatus of Facundus or Beatus of Tábara. Or antiphonaries like the ''Mozarabic Antiphonary of the Cathedral of León'' (''Antifonario mozárabe de la Catedral de León'').

Toledo and Córdoba were the most important Mozarabic centers. From Córdoba was the abbot [[Speraindeo]], who wrote an ''[[Apologetics|Apologetic]] against Muhammad''. And very important for the history of philosophy studies is the ''Apologetic of the abbot Sansón'' (864).

==Architecture==
The principal characteristics that define the Mozarabic architecture are the following:

* A great command of the technique in construction, employing principally ashlar by ''[[bond (masonry)|length and width]]''.
* Absence or sobriety of exterior decoration.
* Diversity in the floor plans, certainly the majority stand out by the small proportions and discontinuous spaces covered by [[cupolas]] (groined, segmented, ribbed of horseshoe transept, etc.).
* Use of the [[horseshoe arch]], a very tight arch with the slope being two-thirds of the radius.
* Use of the [[alfiz]].
* Use of the [[column]] as support, crowned by a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capital]] decorated with very stylized vegetable elements.
* The eaves extend outwards and rest on top of [[corbels]] of lobes.

The Mozarabic architecture interpreted strictly in its definition, that is to say, that the Mozarabs in Muslim Iberia brought to completion, would be reduced to two examples:

* [[Bobastro|The Church of Bobastro]]: rock temple located in the place known as ''Mesas de Villaverde'', in [[Ardales]] ([[Málaga]]), of which only some ruins remain.
* [[Santa María de Melque|The Church of Santa María de Melque]]: located in proximity to [[La Puebla de Montalbán]] ([[Toledo (province)|Toledo]]). With respect to this temple, its stylistic parentage is in doubt, because it shares Visigothic features with other more proper Mozarabic features, nor its date being clear.

Nevertheless, at a popular level, including in encyclopedias and books, the denomination that has kept prevailing is '''Mozarabic Art''' and among the most important that can be cited in Spain and Portugal, the following can be counted as '''Mozarabic''':

* In [[Castile and León]]:

::- [[Santa Maria de Matadars]] (Barcelona), in the municipality of El Pont de Vilomara i Rocafort

* In [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]:
::- [[San Miguel de Celanova]] (Orense)

'''''Mythos''''' is a three-part documentary that consists of a series of lectures given by [[Joseph Campbell]]. Campbell conceived of the original lectures, filmed over the last six years of his life, as a summation of what he had learned about the human mythic impulse, in terms of [[psychology]], [[ethnology]] and [[comparative mythology]]—what he called "the one great story of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&amp;p9999_action=details&amp;p9999_wid=258 ''Mythos''] page on [http://www.jcf.org JCF.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformations: A False Step==
After Campbell's death and the posthumous celebrity brought by the airing in 1988 of ''[[The Power of Myth]]'', the filmmakers who had recorded the lectures quickly cobbled together a much-abridged, hastily edited series for [[PBS]] entitled ''Transformations of Myth Through Time''. An even-more-highly redacted version was briefly released under the title ''The World of Joseph Campbell''.&lt;ref name="The Transformations of Myth Through Time"&gt;[https://www.jcf.org/works/help/faq/from-transformations-of-myth-through-time-to-mythos/ The Transformations of Myth Through Time] and Mythos: from [http://www.jcf.org JCF.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mythos'' Emerges==
Campbell's estate, represented by his widow [[Jean Erdman]] and, eventually, by the [[Joseph Campbell Foundation]] (JCF), asked that these versions, which were unlicensed and did not accurately represent Campbell's thoughts, be pulled from the market, and proposed the production of a twenty-hour television series in four parts that followed Campbell's original vision more closely: ''Mythos''.

Volume One of ''Mythos'' was released in 1999. Volume Two was released in 2000. Both parts are narrated by [[Susan Sarandon]].

After these initial releases, the original distributor, Unipix, promptly went bankrupt, and production on the series halted.&lt;ref name="The Transformations of Myth Through Time" /&gt;

The JCF re-released the first two volumes in 2007 and 2008 in conjunction with [[Acorn Media]] as part of the ''[[Collected Works of Joseph Campbell]]'' series and the third volume was released in 2011. The decision was eventually made that the planned fourth volume, dealing with James Joyce's novels, was to be released in 2013 as a separate product.&lt;ref name="The Transformations of Myth Through Time" /&gt; This was motivated by the difficulties to make its contents fit with the overall format of ''Mythos''.

The three volumes of ''Mythos'' were released together as ''Mythos - The Complete Series'' in September 2012.

[[File:Giotto di Bondone - Navicella - WGA09363.jpg|thumb|300px|The 1628 full-size copy in oil in the Vatican]]
[[File:Parri spinelli, copia della navicella di giotto, metropolitan museum.jpg|thumb|300px|Drawing of the lost mosaic by [[Parri Spinelli]], about 1420, once owned by [[Vasari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/90005191 Parri Spinelli, "Free Copy of Giotto's Navicella"], Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''''Navicella''''' (literally "little ship") of [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, was a large and famous [[mosaic]] by [[Giotto di Bondone]] that occupied a large part of the wall above the entrance arcade, facing the main facade of the basilica across the courtyard. It depicted the version from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (Matthew 14:24–32) of [[Jesus' walk on water|Christ walking on the water]], the only one of the three gospel accounts where [[Saint Peter]] is summoned to join him.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts of the miracle appear in three Gospels: [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:22|Matthew 14:22–33]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:45|Mark 6:45–52]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#6:16|John 6:16–21]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was almost entirely destroyed during the construction of the new [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in the 17th century, but fragments were preserved from the sides of the composition, and what is effectively a new work, incorporating some original fragments, was restored to a position at the centre of the portico of the new building in 1675.&lt;ref&gt;"St Peter's"; Lubbock, 158; Tomei, 31; Nicholls, 162; [http://www.bridgemanart.com/asset/279736/Giotto-di-Bondone-c.1266-1337-after/The-Navicella-of-St.-Peter-mosaic-bw-photo?search_context={%22url%22%3A%22\%2Fsearch\%2Flocation\%2FSt.-Peter%27s-Vatican-City\%2F3734%22%2C%22num_results%22%3A17%2C%22search_type%22%3A%22location_assets%22%2C%22sort_order%22%3A%22asset_id%22%2C%22location_id%22%3A%223734%22%2C%22item_index%22%3A16} Present image], from Bridgeman Art Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosaic, designed to be seen from a distance, was extremely large. A full-scale copy in oil, commissioned by the Vatican from [[Francesco Berretta]] in 1628, after much of the work had already been lost round the edges, measures {{convert|7.4|x|9.9|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/html/g/giotto/zz_misc/y_mosaic/11navice.html WGA]&lt;/ref&gt; The full mosaic was probably about {{convert|9.4|x|13|m|ft}}, with an inscription in Latin verse running below the image.&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 34; Tomei, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The mosaic was commissioned in 1298 by [[Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi]], canon of St. Peter's, whose [[donor portrait]] was to the right of Christ's feet.&lt;ref&gt;Hösl, Ignaz, "Kardinal Jacobus Gaietani Stefaneschi: Ein Beitrag zur Literatur- und Kirchengeschichte des beginnenden vierzehnten Jahrhunderts," Berlin, 1908. &lt;/ref&gt; Giotto's mosaic therefore belonged to the preparations of St. Peters for the [[holy year]] in 1300. The date of the commission is attested by a document copied in the 17th century. There are no indications of a later dating, nor are there indications that Giotto's mosaic replaced an older one. &lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Leben: mit einer Sammlung der Urkunden und Texte bis Vasari (Giottus Pictor I) Wien: Böhlau, 2004. Pg. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Stefaneschi's obituary of 1347, the work cost 2,200 [[florin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tomei, 30&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to an official document from 1298,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Leben: mit einer Sammlung der Urkunden und Texte bis Vasari (Giottus Pictor I) Wien: Böhlau, 2004. Pg. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt; references to the work as by Giotto are found in a Vatican [[necrology]] entry for Cardinal Stefaneschi recording his death in 1343, and then the Latin chronicle of Giotto's home city [[Florence]] written in the late 14th century by [[Filippo Villani]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

It was rectangular, and positioned so that those leaving the basilica saw it across the courtyard outside the church, and passed under it if they left by the main route.&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 34; [http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lookandlearn-preview/M/M098/M098735.jpg Later print of the original location]&lt;/ref&gt;  A figure of a man fishing on the shore to the left was thought to be a self-portrait of Giotto, as [[Vasari]]'s ''Life'' records.  The composition was dominated by the fishing boat with its large sail, which represented a metaphor of the "Ship of the Church", whose "captain" on earth was Saint Peter and his successors as [[Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;St Peter's&lt;/ref&gt;  It was commissioned at a very difficult time for the Papacy, who were unable even to control the gangsterish nobility of Rome, and had therefore left the city, but the image promised that both church and Papacy were, with the help of Christ, "unsinkable".&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 36; Paoletti &amp; Radke, 65&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the eleven figures still in the boat, it has been suggested that the one holding the [[tiller]] is (anachronistically in terms of the Gospels) [[Saint Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, 164, reporting Köhren-Jansen, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In the sky, two almost naked classical style "wind god" figures blow through horns or funnels, one from each side, below pairs of haloed male figures.&lt;!-- who? anyone? The 4 Evangelists? --&gt;  Giotto would have produced drawings for specialist mosaic workers to recreate on the wall; whether he had any further involvement as the work was created is unknown.

The subject is depicted elsewhere in [[medieval art]] of the period, and later works like [[fresco]]s in the "Spanish Chapel" of [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella#Spanish Chapel|Santa Maria Novella]] in Florence, and in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] by [[Masaccio]] (or perhaps his colleague [[Masolino]]), and one of the [[bronze]] relief panels on [[Ghiberti]]'s north doors of the [[Florence Baptistery]].&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, 158–160&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used on Papal coins and medals, though usually with Peter in the boat, often as the only figure.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, 163; [http://www.coinarchives.com/w/results.php?search=Navicella&amp;s=0&amp;results=100 Examples from www.coinarchives.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the only modern (post-classical) work described in [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s ''[[De Pictura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, 199; Lubbock, 158&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a large depiction of a maritime scene was unprecedented in [[marine art]], at least since classical times.

The arcade across the courtyard and its mosaic was at first unaffected by the protracted and complicated rebuilding of the main basilica, but in the 17th century the mosaic underwent a complicated series of four moves and restorations or remodellings in 1610, 1618, 1629 and 1674/75 which finally took it to its present size, condition and location above the main door inside the portico of the new church.&lt;ref&gt;See Kleinhenz 749, Capresi 36, Tomei, 31, though none give a coherent account of the process.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragments==
Only two bust-length figures of angels in [[roundel]]s survive from the original;&lt;ref&gt;Tomei, 31;  Moioli et al., 244&lt;/ref&gt; one remains in the Vatican, while the other was given to the church of San Pietro Ispano in [[Boville Ernica]] in 1610, when the mosaic was first removed from its original place. The former is considerably restored (in 1924, 1950 and 1975–80), and was discovered underneath later work in 1911 (or 1924). The Boville Ernica fragment consisted of little original substance and was completely restored between 1888 and 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Werke (Giottus Pictor II) Wien: Böhlau, 2008, Pg. 262-263.
[[File:Bilder-50617-15704-original.tif|thumb|Fragment in Boville Ernica, before restoration.]]
&lt;/ref&gt; Despite none of the copies of the original including these figures it is thought they were part of the original, probably in a border.&lt;ref&gt;Papacy, 6–7; Tomei, 31; Moioli et al., who give the date of discovery of the Vatican fragment as 1924, and the dates of subsequent work&lt;/ref&gt;  There are thought to be some patches of original work remaining in the mosaic still in St Peter's, which is now semi-circular with a straight bottom edge to fit into a [[lunette]]. Areas where original work seems to survive are in "the gilded edge of the ship, the sail blown by the wind, various sections of some apostles".&lt;ref&gt;Vatican&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The style of the work can now only be judged from the two angel fragments, restored as they are. Vasari's description emphasized the varied reactions of the figures in the boat as they saw Peter sinking below the waves, and the patient expression on the face of the fisherman on the shore, who, like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s ploughman in ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'' seems to ignore the dramatic scene on the water in concentrating on his own task.  But, as [[Svetlana Alpers]] has shown, these were the terms in which Vasari tended to describe large [[history painting]]s he admired, though [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s description in ''[[De pictura]]'' also "treats ...[the work] as a psychological narrative".&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, 190–192, 199 (quoted); Lubbock, 158 quotes from Alberti&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars, working from the fragments, emphasize the influence of the major Roman artist of the day, [[Pietro Cavallini]], who was also patronized by Cardinal Stefanesci, and of the Late Antique and Early Medieval works to be seen in Rome.  According to [[John White (art historian)|John White]]: "The relatively schematic, linear quality of much late-thirteenth- and early-fourteenth-century work is wholly absent.  The impressionistic technique and range of colour both derive from the fifth century. It is impossible to say how much this technique reflects the ideas of Giotto himself and how much those of the skilled mosaicists working under him. The two heads are, however, closely related both to the work of Cavallini, whose art still dominated the Roman scene, and to the basic type of physiognomy developed on the walls of the [[Arena Chapel]]."&lt;ref&gt;White, 332 (quoted); see also Calvesi, 40, and Paoletti &amp; Radke, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies==
There are a number of records of the original design in drawings and prints—at least 17 are recorded.  The earliest are a number of drawings attributed to the Florentine artist [[Parri Spinelli]] (c. 1387–1453), of which the most detailed is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and others are in [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and [[Bayonne]]. However, the variations between these, and other drawings by Spinelli of surviving works, show that he was in the habit of making rather loose interpretations of works that he recorded in drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Bean, no. 2 (New York); Dunbar, 104–110 (Cleveland)&lt;/ref&gt; Most later copies date from after parts of the mosaic were already lost, and none form a complete record of the full design. Some prints, like an [[engraving]] by [[Nicolas Beatrizet]] of about 1559, are reversed (mirror-image) copies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/24364447@N05/6559941119/ image on flickr] of the Beatrizet; [http://www2.printsanddrawings.hu/search/prints/8875/ Unreversed print of 1567] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130702063243/http://www2.printsanddrawings.hu/search/prints/8875/ |date=2013-07-02 }}, by Mario Labacco, from Budapest.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gospel account==
Only in the account in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:22|Matthew 14:24–33]] does Peter also leave the boat to walk on the waves:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea.
And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.
But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters.
And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.
And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.
And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vision of St Catherine of Siena==
On the evening of January 29, 1380, at the time of [[Vespers]], Saint [[Catherine of Siena]], who had been contemplating the mosaic for some hours, suddenly felt as if "the ship had fallen off and landed on her shoulders" with "unbearable weight".  She apparently never walked again, and died three months later.&lt;ref&gt;Papetros, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Notes Left Behind''''' is a 2009 [[non-fiction]] book by Keith and Brooke Desserich, the parents of a six-year-old girl named Elena who died of cancer. The book is a publication of some of the hundreds of notes Elena left for her parents to find after her death. It follows Elena's battle against brain cancer.

==Background==
Elena Desserich, from the [[Cincinnati]] suburb of [[Wyoming, Ohio]], United States, was diagnosed with an inoperable rare form of brain cancer in 2006 and her parents were told she had just 275 days to live. Her parents vowed to make what remained of Elena's life as special as possible. She lived for 10 months after her diagnosis, eventually being paralysed and left unable to speak by the cancer. She died in August 2007. Shortly after, her parents and younger sister began finding notes all over the house.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/721390--dying-6-year-old-girl-leaves-love-notes-behind?bn=1|title=Dying 6-year-old girl leaves love notes behind|last=Gordon|first=Andrea|date=5 November 2009|work=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=[[Star Media Group]]|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents didn't tell Elena her prognosis, but retrospectively believe that she knew it.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt;

==Narrative==
After her diagnosis at the age of five, Elena Desserich wrote hundreds of "love messages" to her parents, Keith and Brooke Desserich, who published the notes in ''Notes Left Behind'' in 2009.&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6506509/Notes-left-by-cancer-victim-six-for-family-turned-into-book.html|title=Notes left by cancer victim, six, for family turned into book|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 July 2010 | location=London | date=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She hid the messages at various places in their house so that her parents would find them after her death.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33505113/ns/today-today_books/|title=Parents share diary of child’s cancer battle|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elena, who turned 6 in the nine months between her diagnosis and her death, died in August 2007 and her parents published the book in November 2009. The book also contains entries from Elena's parents' diary as well as several of Elena's drawings.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;

Her parents said that they found the first of the notes several days after Elena's death, but "then they kept on showing up everywhere and now we have three large boxes full of them".&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;

==Impact==
Originally self-published in 2009, it soon received national attention and was later re-published in 2009 by [[HarperCollins]] Publishers.  It was listed as a [[New York Times Bestseller|''New York Times'' Best Seller]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best Sellers, Hardcover Nonfiction|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=November 6, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/bestseller/besthardnonfiction.html?_r=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Elena's paintings, which she titled ''I love You'', was displayed at the [[Cincinnati Art Museum]] next to a work by [[Pablo Picasso]], one of Elena's lifelong ambitions which she had recorded on her wish list during her illness.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/JobClub/story?id=6494966&amp;page=1|title='Notes Left Behind' Inspired by 5-Year-Old|date=19 December 2008|work=[[ABC News]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]]|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors, Brooke and Keith Desserich, live in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], and founded the Cure Starts Now Foundation, an organization dedicated to researching a cure for all cancers, starting first with pediatric brain cancer. A percentage of the funds raised from the sale of ''Notes Left Behind'' goes towards the Cure Starts Now Foundation.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt;

'''Persian pottery''' or '''Iranian pottery''' refers to the pottery works made by the artists of [[Persia|Persia (Iran)]] and its history goes back to early [[Neolithic Age]] (7th millennium BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/anthropology/persia/history.htm  |title=The History of Persian Ceramics |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the centuries, Persian potters have responded to the demands and changes brought by political turmoil by adopting and refining newly introduced forms and blending them into their own culture. This innovative attitude has survived through time and influenced many other cultures around the world.

The Islamic prohibition on using vessels made of precious metal at the table, which had been usual for pre-Islamic elites of the earlier [[Persian empire]]s, meant that a market for luxury ceramics opened up, which Persian potters were able to fill with fancy glazes such as in [[lustreware]] and high-quality painted decoration.
 
==Early pottery from Susa==
{{main|Susa}}
Evidence of a painted-pottery civilization around [[Susa]] has been dated to c&amp;nbsp;5000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=Langer&gt;{{cite book|title=An Encyclopedia of World History| editor-last = Langer | editor-first = William L. |edition = 5th | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company| location = Boston, MA| year = 1972 | isbn = 0-395-13592-3|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Susa was firmly within the [[Sumer]]ian [[Uruk]] cultural sphere during the [[Uruk period]]. An imitation of the entire state apparatus of Uruk, [[proto-writing]], [[cylinder seal]]s with Sumerian motifs, and monumental architecture, is found at Susa. Susa may have been a colony of Uruk. As such, the [[periodization]] of Susa corresponds to Uruk; Early, Middle and Late Susa II periods (3800–3100&amp;nbsp;BCE) correspond to Early, Middle, and Late Uruk periods.

Shortly after Susa was first settled 6000&amp;nbsp;years ago, its inhabitants erected a temple on a monumental platform that rose over the flat surrounding landscape. The exceptional nature of the site is still recognizable today in the artistry of the ceramic vessels that were placed as offerings in a thousand or more graves near the base of the temple platform. Nearly two thousand pots were recovered from the cemetery and now, most of them now are located in the [[Louvre]]; one such vessel is the [[Bushel with ibex motifs]]. The vessels found are eloquent testimony to the artistic and technical achievements of their makers, and they hold clues about the organization of the society that commissioned them.&lt;ref name="Aruz 1992 26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painted ceramic vessels from Susa in the earliest first style are a late, regional version of the Mesopotamian [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] ceramic tradition that spread across the Near East during the fifth millennium B.C.&lt;ref name="Aruz 1992 26"/&gt;

Susa I style was very much a product of the past and of influences from contemporary ceramic industries in the mountains of western Iran. The recurrence in close association of vessels of three types—a drinking goblet or beaker, a serving dish, and a small jar—implies the consumption of three types of food, apparently thought to be as necessary for life in the afterworld as it is in this one. Ceramics of these shapes, which were painted, constitute a large proportion of the vessels from the cemetery. Others are course cooking-type jars and bowls with simple bands painted on them and were probably the grave goods of the sites of humbler citizens as well as adolescents and, perhaps, children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery is carefully made by hand. Although a slow wheel may have been employed, the asymmetry of the vessels and the irregularity of the drawing of encircling lines and bands indicate that most of the work was done freehand.

==Early Islamic period==
The [[Samanid Empire|Samanid period]] saw the creation of epigraphic pottery. These pieces were typically [[earthenware]] vessels with black [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] lettering in [[Kufic|Kufi]] script painted on a base of white slip. These vessels would typically be inscribed with benedictions or adages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McWilliams|first1=Mary|title=Bowl Inscribed with a Saying of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib|url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/art/165532|website=Harvard Art Museums|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samarqand]] and [[Nishapur]] were both centers of production for this kind of pottery.&lt;ref name="Volov 1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volov|first1=Lis|title=Plaited Kufic on Samanid Epigraphic Pottery|journal=Ars Orientalis|date=1966|volume=6|issue=1966|page=107-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovations in ceramics from this period include the production of minai ware, enamelled with figures on a white background, and use [[fritware]], a [[silicon]]-based paste, rather than clay.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 64–73&lt;/ref&gt;  Metalworkers highlighted their intricate hammered designs with precious metal inlays.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 78–93&lt;/ref&gt;

One potter, [[Abū Zayd ibn Muḥammad ibn Abī Zayd]] (active c. 1186 – 1219, [[Kashan]]) has signed 15 surviving pieces, more than any other medieval Iranian potter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T000296  "Abu Zayd."] In Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online, (accessed February 5, 2012; subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safavid period==
[[Image:Plate pomegranates Louvre MAO868.jpg|thumb|right|''Plate decorated with two pomegranates'', v.&amp;nbsp;1500, [[the Louvre]]]]
[[Image:Tile young man flowers - Iran - Louvre museum - AD 27812.jpg|thumb|Tile with young man. Earthenware, painted on slip and under transparent glaze. Northwestern Iran, [[Kubachi ware]], 17th century.]]
The study and dating of ceramics under [[Shah Ismail]] and [[Shah Tahmasp]] is difficult because there are few pieces which are dated or which mention the place of production.  [[Chinese porcelain]] was collected by the elite, and was more highly valued than the local productions; Shah Abbas I donated much of the royal collection to the shrines at [[Ardabil]] and [[Mashhad]], renovating a room at Ardabil to display pieces in niches.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 101-104, 121-123, 137-159&lt;/ref&gt;  Many locations of workshops have been identified, although not with certainty, in particular: [[Nishapur]], [[Kubachi ware]], [[Kerman]] (moulded monochromatic pieces) and Mashhad. [[Lusterware]] was revived, using a different technique from the earlier production, and typically making small pieces with a design in a dark copper colour over a dark blue background. Unlike other wares, these use traditional Middle Eastern shapes and decoration rather than Chinese-inspired ones.&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 171&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the designs tend to imitate those of Chinese porcelain, with the production of blue and white pieces with Chinese form and motifs, with motifs such as  chi clouds, and dragons.&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 171&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Persian blue]] is distinguished from the [[Chinese blue]] by its more numerous and subtle nuances.  Often, quatrains by Persian poets, sometimes related to the destination of the piece (allusion to wine for a goblet, for example) occur in the scroll patterns. A completely different type of design, much more rare, carries iconography very specific to Islam (Islamic zodiac, bud scales, [[arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]]) and seems influenced by the Ottoman world, as is evidenced by feather-edged anthemions (honeysuckle ornaments) widely used in Turkey.  New styles of figures appeared, influenced by the art of the book:  young, elegant cupbearers, young women with curved silhouettes, or yet cypress trees entangling their branches, reminiscent of the paintings of [[Reza Abbasi]]. 

Numerous types of pieces were produced: goblets, plates, long-necked bottles, [[spittoon]]s, etc.  A common shape is flasks with very small necks and bodies flattened on one side and very rounded on the other. Shapes borrowed from Islamic metalwork with decoration largely inspired by Chinese porcelain are characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 162-163, 218-219&lt;/ref&gt; With the closing of the Chinese market in 1659, Persian ceramic soared to new heights, to fulfill European needs.  The appearance of false marks of Chinese workshops on the backs of some ceramics marked the taste that developed in Europe for far-eastern porcelain, satisfied in large part by Safavid production.  This new destination led to wider use of Chinese and exotic iconography (elephants) and the introduction of new forms, sometimes astonishing ([[hookah]]s, octagonal plates, animal-shaped objects).

== Contemporary ==
One of the main areas in Iran that has a very special way of producing pottery is Kalpuregan. Kalpuregan village is located in south east of Iran. The only characteristic that distinguishes Kalpuregan from other areas is its indigenous pottery, creation of civilization by Baluchi women artists. According to one of the village elders, manufacturing practices dating back to about 4 to 6 thousand years ago still remains intact. The only workshop that is still active and persistent to continue working with primitive method is Kalpuregan pottery workshop.

Throughout the history the art of pottery in Kalpuregan has belonged to women since men had the burden of hunting or farming. According to historical evidence, indigenous women are creators of pottery art. In this land, delicate tasks are done by women and men only have the responsibility of preparing and firimg the clay.

Another thing that distinguishes pottery of the region from other parts of the country is that women in Kalpuregan do not use pottery wheel to make pottery. It is amazing that such a magnificent work is possible only with traditional and innovative methods and the help of rural women's loving cracked hands. Potteries in this area learn this art from their mothers or clan women.

Paintings on pottery are abstract symbols that remained from generation to generation and indicate the artist’s beliefs and spiritual desires of her surroundings. Often symbolic paintings are similar to early prehistoric pottery. Indigenous artist women in this area believe they should use simple and abstract geometric patterns to paint pottery pieces exactly like their Ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.farwayart.com/blog/indigenous-pottery-in-kalpuregan-iran|title=Indigenous pottery in Kalpuregan (Iran)|last=Art|first=Far Way|website=Far Way Art|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
There are large collections of Persian pottery at the [[British Museum]], the [[Hermitage Museum]], the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], and elsewhere. In 2013, the Royal Ontario Museum, in partnership with [[Brill Publishers]] in the [[Netherlands]], published a special book about this art entitled "Persian Pottery in the First Global Age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/products/book/persian-pottery-first-global-age |title=Persian Pottery in the First Global Age |publisher=Brill/ROM |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Postmodernism}}
'''Postmodern picture books''' are a specific [[genre]] of [[picture books]].  Characteristics of this unique type of book include [[Nonlinear (arts)|non-linear]] narrative forms in storybooks, books that are "aware" of themselves as books and include self-referential elements, and what is known as [[metafiction]].

A classic example of this genre is [[David Macaulay]]'s award winning ''[[Black_and_White_(book)|Black and White]]'' (1990). This book consists of four "separate" sub-plots which are related, but the reader must decide in what way the story becomes meaningful.  The inside front cover of this book, awarded the Caldecott Medal in 1990, states: "WARNING: This book appears to contain a number of stories that do not necessarily occur at the same time. But it may contain only one story. Then again, there may be four stories. Or four parts of a story. Careful inspection of both words and pictures is recommended."

Examples of postmodern picture books include David Wiesner's ''The Three Pigs'', Anthony Browne's ''Voices in the Park'', and Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith's ''The Stinky Cheese Man''. Some books have unusual pictures that don't always mesh with the traditional, linear text (that often matches the pictures). An example would be ''Bamboozled'' by David Legge.

Frank Serafini (2004) has created lesson plans that lead students to discuss how text interacts with illustrations. Three sets of texts could be discussed: books that have corresponding text and pictures, books where the illustrations enhance the texts, and books where the illustrations contradict the text (''Bamboozled'' is an example of contradictory text). Another lesson that Serafini describes that incorporates PM picture books could be having students read books that are ambiguous and allow for multiple interpretations. Student are encouraged to record their thinking in a journal called a "walking notebook". Books that are especially open to interpretation include: Browne's ''Voices in the Park'', Wiesner's ''The Three Pigs'', and David Macauley's ''Black and White''.

These books could be thought of as multi-modal texts that defy the usual, linear organization of storybooks. In postmodern, meta-fictive books, the reader is intentionally made aware of the way that the book calls attention to itself. For example, in Wiesner's ''The Three Pigs'', the main characters decide to climb outside the text; pictures depicting the pigs climbing outside the story are prominent.  In ''The Stinky Cheese Man'', Scieszka and Lane purposely use [[intertextual]] references, or references to many other well-known fables, to create tongue-in-cheek, satirical stories and spin-offs of classic fairy tales. Widely varying size fonts and pictures combine to create a post-modern picture book.

According to Anstey (2002), characteristics of postmodern picture books include:

# Non-traditional plot structure
# Using the pictures or text to position the reader to read the text in a particular way, for example, through a character's eyes or point of view.
# The reader's involvement with constructing the meaning of the text.
# [[Intertextual]] references, which requires the reader to make connections to other books or knowledge, in order to better understand the text.
# Varied design layout and a variety of styles of illustration.

Ryan &amp; Anstey (2003) suggest that post-modern picture books may allow students to increase their "self-knowledge about reading" and that students might be able to use this knowledge in strategic ways as they read. In their study, Ryan and Anstey looked at how sixth graders responded to a PM picture book, which was selected because it was open to many interpretations, titled ''The Rabbits'' by [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]] and [[Shaun Tan]]. They discovered that the reading of such texts allow students to draw upon their resources as readers. The reading of such books supports a [[multiliteracies]] perspective. Accordingly, such books may be useful in allowing teachers to use texts that encourage students to draw upon their own identity and use this knowledge to read strategically.

'''Radovan''' ({{lang-la|Raduan}}) was [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102–1526)|Croatian]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] and [[architect]] who lived in [[Trogir]] in the 13th century. In Croatian he is commonly referred to as ''{{lang|hr|Majstor Radovan}}'' or "Master Radovan". Virtually no information exists about the personality and career of this artist, save for his monumental [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[portal (architecture)|portal]] of the [[Trogir cathedral]].

Radovan inscribed his name and the year of making of the main portal, 1240, on the [[lunette]] above the entrance:
{{quote|FUNDATUR VALVE POST PARTUM VIRGINIS ALME PER RADUANUM CUNCTIS...}}

The text informs us that master Radovan was the best in the art of sculpture and that the project was completed in the time when a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]], [[Treguan]] from [[Florence]], had been the [[bishop of Trogir]].

That Radovan was a native son of [[Trogir]] ''(Trau)'' is attested, among other things, by his name, which figures frequently in Trogir's municipal archives in the 13th century.

Finally, in tympanum is the Birth of Christ. The figures are very realistic, recalling French Gothic sculpture, including the sculpture at [[Chartres Cathedral]].

In art and archaeology, in sculpture as well as in painting, a '''register''' is a horizontal level in a work that consists of several levels arranged one above the other, especially where the levels are clearly separated by lines.  Modern [[comic books]] typically use similar conventions. It is thus comparable to a row, or a line in modern texts. In the study of ancient writing, such as [[cuneiform]] and Egyptian [[hieroglyph]]s, "register" may be used of vertical compartments like columns containing writing that are arranged side by side and separated by lines, especially in [[cylinder seal]]s, which often mix text and images.  Normally, when dealing with images it only refers to row compartments stacked vertically.  

Among many other cultures, the use of registers is common in [[Ancient Egyptian art]], from the [[Narmer Palette]] onwards, and in [[medieval art]] in large [[fresco]]s and [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  [[Narrative art]], especially covering the lives of sacred figures, is often presented as a sequence of small scenes arranged in registers.  

Sculpted [[Luwian language hieroglyphs]] were also usually arranged in registers one above the other. The direction of reading ran from one of the top corners, and reversed direction in each lower register, so that the reader did not have to start at the other end of each new row.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Peter T., ''The World's Writing Systems'', pp. 120-121, 1996, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0195079930}}, 9780195079937, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ospMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples, in the [[art of Mesopotamia]], are [[Kudurru]], or boundary stones, which often had registers of [[god]]s on the upper registers of the scenes.

There are many '''religious views on euthanasia''', although many moral theologians are critical of the procedure.

== Buddhism ==
{{Main|Buddhism and euthanasia}}
There are many views among Buddhists on the issue of euthanasia, but many are critical of the procedure.

An important value of Buddhism teaching is compassion.  Compassion is used by some Buddhists as a justification for euthanasia because the person suffering is relieved of pain.&lt;ref name="Keown, Damien 2005"&gt;Keown, Damien. “End of life: the Buddhist View,” Lancet 366 (2005): 953. SocINDEX with full text, EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is still immoral "to embark on any course of action whose aim is to destroy human life, irrespective of the quality of the individual's motive." &lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien. “End of life: the Buddhist View,” Lancet 366 (2005): 954. SocINDEX with full text, EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Theravada Buddhism]] a [[upasaka|lay person]] daily recites the simple formula: "I undertake the precept to abstain from destroying living beings."&lt;ref&gt;This is the first of the [[Five Precepts]].  It has various interpretations.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Buddhist monastics (''[[bhikkhu]]'') however the rules are more explicitly spelled out. For example, in the monastic code (''[[Patimokkha]]''), it states:
:"Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (thus): 'My good man, what use is this wretched, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life,' or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in communion."&lt;ref name="Keown, Damien 2005"/&gt;
&lt;ref name=ThanissaroParajika&gt;[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] (1994).

Retrieved 2007-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==

=== Catholicism ===
The [[Declaration on Euthanasia]] is the Church's official document on the topic of euthanasia, a statement that was issued by the [[Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="vatican-euth"&gt;
{{cite web
|url = http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19800505_euthanasia_en.html
|publisher = Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
|title = Declaration on Euthanasia
|date = 5 May 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic teaching condemns euthanasia as a "crime against life" and a "crime against God".&lt;ref name="vatican-euth" /&gt; The teaching of the Catholic Church on euthanasia rests on several core principles of Catholic ethics, including the [[sanctity of life|sanctity of human life]], the [[dignity]] of the human person, concomitant [[human rights]], due [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]] in [[Casuistry|casuistic]] remedies, the inevitability of death, and the importance of [[charity (virtue)|charity]].&lt;ref name="vatican-euth" /&gt; It has been argued that these are relatively recent positions,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/aug/27/religion-catholicism McDougall H, ''It's popularly believed that Catholics are anti-euthanasia. Do Catholics believe we don't have the freedom to do as we like?'' The Guardian 27 August 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt; but whatever the position of individual Catholics, the Roman Catholic Church's viewpoint is unequivocal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/catechism/catechism-of-the-catholic-church/ Catechism of the Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestantism ===
[[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s vary widely on their approach to euthanasia and physician assisted death. Since the 1970s, [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches have worked with Roman Catholics on a sanctity of life approach, though some Evangelicals may be adopting a more exceptionless opposition. While [[liberal Protestant]] denominations have largely eschewed euthanasia, many individual advocates (such as [[Joseph Fletcher]]) and euthanasia society activists have been Protestant clergy and laity. As physician assisted dying has obtained greater legal support, some liberal Protestant denominations have offered religious arguments and support for limited forms of euthanasia. However, they are more lenient than the Roman Catholic Church

=== Christians in support of euthanasia ===
Groups claiming to speak for Christians rather than the official viewpoints of the Christian clergy have sprung up in a number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;In Australia: http://www.christiansforve.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{see also|Prayopavesa}}
There are two Hindu points of view on euthanasia. By helping to end a painful life a person is performing a good deed and so fulfilling their moral obligations.Euthanasia may also be acceptable if it is used for selfless motives. On the other hand, by helping to end a life, even one filled with suffering, a person is disturbing the timing of the cycle of death and rebirth. This is a bad thing to do, and those involved in the euthanasia will take on the remaining karma of the patient
Death is a natural process, and will come in time.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

It is clearly stated in the Vedas that man has only two trustworthy friends in life, the first is called Vidya (knowledge), and the 2nd is called Mrityu (Death). The former is something that is beneficial and a requirement in life, and the latter is something that is inevitable sometimes even unexpected.  It is not the euthanasia that is the act of sin, but worldly attachment which causes euthanasia to be looked upon as an act of sin. Even a Sannyasin or Sannyasini if they decide to, are permitted to end his or her life with the hope of reaching [[moksha]] i.e. emancipation of the soul.

== Islam ==
Muslims are against euthanasia. They believe that all humans life is sacred because it is given by God, and that God chooses how long each person lives. Human beings should not interfere in this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Jainism==
{{Main|Sallekhana}}
[[Jainism]] is based on the principle of non-violence (''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahinsa]]'') and is best known for it.{{sfn|Kakar|2014|p=175}} Jainism recommends voluntary death or ''sallekhana'' for both [[Jain monasticism|ascetics]] and [[Śrāvaka#Jainism|srāvaka]] (householders) at the end of their life.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=102}} ''[[Sallekhana]]'' (also known as ''Santhara'', ''Samadhi-marana'') is made up of two words ''sal'' (meaning 'properly') and ''lekhana'', which means to thin out. Properly thinning out of the passions and the body is ''sallekhana.''{{sfn|Kakar|2014|p=174}} A person is allowed to fast unto death or take the vow of ''sallekhana'' only when certain requirements are fulfilled. It is not considered suicide as the person observing it, must be in a state of full consciousness.{{sfn|Kakar|2014|p=174}} When observing ''sallekhana'', one must not have the desire to live or desire to die. Practitioner shouldn't recollect the pleasures enjoyed or, long for the enjoyment of pleasures in the future.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=111}} The process is still controversial in parts of India. Estimates for death by this means range from 100 to 240 a year.&lt;ref&gt;"Fasting to Death" in: Docker C, Five Last Acts – The Exit Path, 2013:428-432 (details benefits and difficulties)&lt;/ref&gt; Preventing santhara invites social ostracism.&lt;ref&gt;Colors of Truth Religion, Self and Emotions: Perspectives of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Islam, Sikhism and Contemporary Psychology by Sonali Bhatt Marwaha, 2006:125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
Like the trend among Protestants, [[Jewish medical ethics]] have become divided, partly on denominational lines, over euthanasia and [[End-of-life (medical treatment)|end of life treatment]] since the 1970s. Generally, [[Jewish]] thinkers oppose voluntary euthanasia, often vigorously,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[J. David Bleich]], [[Eliezer Waldenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt; though there is some backing for voluntary passive euthanasia in limited circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Such as the writings of [[Daniel Sinclair]], [[Moshe Tendler]], [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]], [[Moshe Feinstein]]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, within the [[Conservative Judaism]] movement, there has been increasing support for passive euthanasia (PAD)&lt;ref&gt;See [[Elliot Dorff]] and, for earlier speculation, [[Byron Sherwin]].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Reform Judaism]] [[responsa]], the preponderance of anti-euthanasia sentiment has shifted in recent years to increasing support for certain passive euthanasia options.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Secular Judaism is a separate category with increasing support for euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shj.org/physician-assisted-death/&lt;/ref&gt; A popular sympathiser for euthanasia is Rabbi Miriam Jerris.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifshj.net/id91.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A study performed in 2010 investigated elderly Jewish women who identified themselves as either Hasidic Orthodox, non-Hasidic Orthodox, or secularized Orthodox in their faith.  The study found that all of the Hasidic Orthodox responders disapproved of voluntary euthanasia whereas a majority of the secularized Orthodox responders approved of it.&lt;ref&gt;Baeke, Goedele, Jean-Pierre Wils, and Bert Broeckaert, “‘We are (not) the master of our body’: elderly Jewish women’s attitudes towards euthanasia and assisted suicide,” Ethnicity and Health 16, no. 3 (2011): 259-278, SocINDEX with full text, EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shinto==
In [[Japan]], where the dominant religion is [[Shinto]], 69% of the religious organisations agree with the act of voluntary passive euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Japan"&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.eubios.info/ABC4/abc4288.htm
|title=9.3. Implications of Japanese religious views toward life and death in medicine
|publisher=www.eubios.info
|accessdate=2009-02-14
|last=
|first=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding figure was 75% when the family asked for it. In Shinto, the prolongation of life using artificial means is a disgraceful act against life.&lt;ref name="Japan" /&gt; Views on active euthanasia are mixed, with 25% Shinto and Buddhist organisations in Japan supporting voluntary active euthanasia.

==Unitarian Universalism==
The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) recommends observing the ethics and culture of the resident country when determining euthanasia. In 1988 the UUA gathered to share a commitment to The Right to Die with Dignity document which included a resolution supporting self-determination in dying.&lt;ref&gt;Euthanasia: A Reference Handbook - Page 24, Jennifer Fecio McDougall, Martha Gorman - 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence of religious views ==
Religious views on euthanasia are both varied and complicated.  While one's view on the matter doesn't necessarily connect directly to their religion, it often impacts a person's opinion. While the influence of religion on one's views toward palliative care do make a difference, they often play a smaller role than one may think.  An analysis of the connection between the religion of US adults and their view on euthanasia was done in order to see how they combine.  The findings concluded that the religious affiliation one associates with does not necessarily connect with their stance on euthanasia. &lt;ref&gt;Moulton, Benjamin E., Terrence D. Hill, and Amy Burdette. "Religion and Trends in Euthanasia Attitudes among U.S. Adults, 1977–2004." Sociological Forum 21.2 (2006): 249-72. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that while many belong to a specific religion, they may not always see every aspect as relevant to them.

Some metadata analysis has supported the hypothesis that nurses’ attitudes towards euthanasia and physician assisted suicide are influenced by religion and world view. Attributing more importance to religion also seems to make agreement with euthanasia and physician assisted suicide less likely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuleuven.be/thomas/images/cms/Elisabeth/Gielen%20Religion%20and%20Nurses%20Attitudes%20to%20Euthanasia%20and%20Physician%20Assisted%20Suicide.pdf Religion and Nurses’ Attitudes to Euthanasia and Physician Assisted Suicide, Nursing Ethics 2009]. The subject is also dealt with at length in Johannes A. van der Ven, Hans-Georg Ziebertz (eds.) ''Human Rights and the Impact of Religion,'' Koninklijke 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 study of public opinion found that the tendency to see a distinction between active euthanasia and suicide was clearly affected by religious affiliation and education.&lt;ref&gt;Caddell D, Newton R, ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7660180 Euthanasia: American attitudes toward the physician's role].'' Soc Sci Med. 1995 Jun;40(12):1671-81.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, more doctors without formal religious affiliation were sympathetic to active voluntary euthanasia, and acknowledged that they had practised it, than were doctors who gave any religious affiliation. Of those identifying with a religion, those who reported a Protestant affiliation were intermediate in their attitudes and practices between the agnostic/atheist and the Catholic groups. Catholics recorded attitudes most opposed, but even so, 18 per cent of Catholic medical respondents who had been so requested, recorded that they had taken active steps to bring about the death of patients.&lt;ref&gt;Baume P, O'Malley E, Bauman A, ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1376534/ Professed religious affiliation and the practice of euthanasia].'' J Med Ethics 1995;21(1): 49–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:San Pedro de Larrede.jpg|thumb|The church of [[San Pedro de Lárrede]] is an example of ''Repoblación'' architecture closely linked to Asturian architecture and distinct from Mozarabic.&lt;ref name=Rutas/&gt;]]
The designation ''arte'' (or ''arquitectura'') ''de'' (''la'') ''repoblación'' (literally, "art or architecture of [the] repopulation") was first proposed by [[:es:José Camón Aznar|José Camón Aznar]] in 1949&lt;ref&gt;Although presented in a conference in 1949, it was not published and widely read until 1963. Cf. Utrero Agudo (2006), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; to replace the term [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] as applied to certain works of [[architecture]] from the Christian kingdoms of northern Spain between the end of the 9th and beginning of the 11th centuries. Camón argued that these buildings were related stylistically to the [[Asturian architecture|architecture of Asturias]] and owed little to [[Moorish architecture|Andalusian styles]]. Moreover, since they were built by Christians living under Christian rule, neither were they Mozarabic (the [[Mozarabs]] being the Christians of Muslim Spain).&lt;ref name=Rutas&gt;Canellas López and San Vicente (1996), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spanish historiography, the ''[[repoblación]]'' is the expansion of Christian settlement in the [[Duero]] basin and the [[Meseta Central]] in the 9th–10th centuries.

==History==
The religious influences were inevitable given the presence of the  Islamic state of the [[Caliph of Córdoba]], which was highly developed culturally, artistically and economically. However, it had long been suggested that the monumental buildings in northern Spain from this period were crafted by the modest groups of Mozarabic immigrants that settled in the areas of repopulation when the living conditions in Muslim [[al-Andalus]] became difficult to bear. As stated by professor Isidro Bango Torviso, suggesting that these immigrants were responsible for these buildings would be akin to suggesting that:
{{quote|when the Duero River Valley was repopulated under the auspices of the Asturian-[[Kingdom of León|Leonese]] kingdom, northerners settlers would have forsaken all their knowledge and experience and submitted themselves to the 'very rich and demonstrated creative capacity' of poor, rural southern immigrants.}}

The Art and Architecture of the Repoblación is identified as the third subset of the ''Hispanic'' [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]] period, by the phases that correspond to the [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]] and [[Asturian architecture|Asturian art]]. Its architecture is a summary of elements of diverse extraction, irregularly distributed, in such a way that on occasion elements of paleo-Christian, Visigothic or Asturian origin come to predominate, while at other times Muslim characteristics come to the fore.

==Characteristics==
{{list to prose|date=January 2018}}
Some of the identifying characteristics of this Repoblación ecclesiastic architectural style are:
* Basilica or centralized plan; sometimes with opposing [[apse]]s.
* Main chapel on a rectangular plan on the exterior and ultra-semicircular in the interior.
* Use of the [[horseshoe arch]] of Muslim derivation, somewhat more closed and sloped than the Visigothic.
* Generalized use of the horseshoe arch doorway or ''alfiz''.
* Use of the twin and triple windows of Asturian tradition.
* Roofs composed of segmented [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], including traditional [[barrel vault]]s.
* Grouped [[column]]s forming composite pillars, with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capitals]] decorated with stylized elements and cinctures joining the capital to the columns.
* Walls re-enforced by exterior buttresses.
* Evolution of rafter ornaments to great lobed offsets that support very pronounced eaves.
* Decoration similar to the Visigothic based on volutes, [[swastika]]s, and vegetable and animal themes forming projecting borders.
* A great command of the technique in construction, employing principally ashlar by ''[[bond (masonry)|length and width]]''.
* Absence or sobriety of exterior decoration.
* Diversity in the floor plans, with small proportions and discontinuous spaces covered by [[cupolas]] (groined, segmented, ribbed of horseshoe transept, etc.).

[[File:Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland logo.svg|100px|thumb|Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland logo]]
The '''Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland''' ('''RIAS''') is the [[professional body]] for [[architects]] in [[Scotland]].

==History==
Previously the (lapsed) '''Architectural Institute of Scotland''', it was re-founded in 1916 as the '''Incorporation of Architects in Scotland''' by architect [[Robert Rowand Anderson]] (1834–1921) from his sick bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200041 |title=(Sir) Robert Rowand Anderson, DSA Architect Biography Report |work=Dictionary of Scottish Architects |accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson donated his [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[townhouse]] in [[Edinburgh]] to be used as its home, where the organisation remains to this day.  It was given its first [[Royal charter]] in 1922, followed by a second in 1929.

==Organisation==
The RIAS comprises six chapters across Scotland:- 
*[[Aberdeen Society of Architects]] (ASA)
*[[Dundee Institute of Architects|Dundee Institute of Architects (DIA)]]
*Edinburgh Architectural Association (EAA)
*Glasgow Institute of Architects (GIA)
*Inverness Architectural Association (IAA)
*Stirling Society of Architects (SSA)
Associate membership is available to anyone registered as an architect who lives and works in Scotland.

The Incorporation is an independent body representing Architects working in Scotland although it consults regularly with the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) regarding UK-wide professional issues.  It lobbies Scottish Ministers and the [[Scottish Government]] directly on relevant issues.

The President is Willie Watt and the Treasurer and Secretary is Neil Baxter.  The Incorporation is run by an elected National Council comprising representatives of individual Chapters and nationally elected members.

The Incorporation offers accreditation in specialist fields including historic building conservation and environmental sustainability.

==RIAS Award for Architecture==

{{main|RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture}}

The RIAS award was founded in 2002 by the architect Andrew Doolan, whose work included the Point Hotel in Edinburgh.  The award is given to the best new building in Scotland, as judged by a jury of assessors. The value of the prize is £25,000, making it the largest prize for architecture in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Initially the prize money came from Doolan, but following his death in 2004 there were doubts as to whether the award could continue. The responsibility now lies with his mother Mrs Margaret Doolan who now patronises the award and from 2005 the award has been renamed the "RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture" in his memory.  Winners have included: the [[Enric Miralles]]' [[Scottish Parliament building]]; [[Bennetts Associates]]' University of Edinburgh [[Informatics Forum]]; and Reiach &amp; Hall's [[Pier Arts Centre]] in [[Orkney]].  The [[Maggie's Centres]] in [[Dundee]], [[Kirkcaldy]] and [[Inverness]] have all been nominated, with the one in Inverness by [[Page\Park Architects]] winning the award in 2006.

==Fellows of the RIAS==

For notable elected Fellows of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (FRIAS) see [[:Category:Fellows of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland]].

==RIAS Publishing==

RIAS publications include a series of architectural guides covering Scotland aimed at the general reader. Although smaller in size and more limited in scope, the aims are similar to [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]'s eponymous series of [[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Architectural Guides]] to England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Some volumes were published under RIAS's imprint, The Rutland Press. Others were co-published with [[Mainstream Publishing]]. Several volumes (marked *) have been updated as new editions, but not all volumes are currently in print.

'''Rujm el-Hiri''' ({{lang-ar|رجم الهري}}, ''Rujm al-Hīrī''; {{lang-he-n|גִּלְגַּל רְפָאִים}} ''Gilgal Refā'īm'' or ''Rogem Hiri'') is an ancient [[megalith]]ic monument consisting of concentric circles of stone with a [[tumulus]] at center.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt; It is located in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-occupied]] portion of the [[Golan Heights]], some {{convert|16|km}} east of the coast of the [[Sea of Galilee]], in the middle of a large plateau covered with hundreds of [[dolmen]]s.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Avraham Negev|author2=Shimon Gibson|title=Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&amp;pg=PP1|accessdate=30 March 2011|date=July 2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-8571-7|pages=207, 443, 518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]]|title=The Holy Land:An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3Yy9FDcT8gC&amp;pg=PT531|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=28 February 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-164766-6|page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Made up of more than 42,000 [[basalt]] rocks arranged in concentric circles, it has a mound {{convert|15|ft|m}} tall at its center.&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"/&gt; Some circles are complete, others incomplete. The outermost wall is {{convert|520|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|8|ft|m}} high. The establishment of the site, and other nearby ancient settlements, is dated by archaeologists to the [[Bronze Age#Age sub-divisions|Early Bronze Age II]] period (3000–2700 BCE).&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt;

Since excavations have yielded very few material remains, [[Israel]]i archeologists theorize that the site was not a defensive position or a residential quarter but most likely a ritual center, possibly linked to the cult of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-3a82d460d57c4e598c18e3de8bce3c8a.html Grisly theory for Holy Land mystery]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there is no consensus regarding its function, as no similar structure has been found in the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/27926134?uid=3738240&amp;uid=377779673&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=60&amp;sid=21102112483707 Rogem Hiri: A Megalithic Monument in the Golan, Mattanyah Zohar, [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Rujm el-Hiri, "stone heap of the wild cat",&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"/&gt; was originally taken from [[Syria]]n maps.&lt;ref name="Museumsle-arkheʾologyah1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yonathan Mizrachi|author2=Mattanyah Zohar|author3=Moshe Kochavi|author4=Vincent Murphy|author5=Simcha Lev-Yadun|journal=Israel Exploration Journal|title = The 1988–1991 Excavations at Rogem Hiri, Golan Heights|year=1996|pages=167–195|volume=46|number=3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[rujm]]'' in Arabic (pl. ''rujum''; Hebrew: ''rogem'') can also refer to a [[tumulus]], a heap of stones underneath which human burial space was located.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt; The name is sometimes [[Romanization|romanized]] as Rujm Hiri or Rujum al-Hiri.

Rogem Hiri is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] version of the Arabic name Rujm el-Hiri.&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"/&gt; A modern Hebrew name used for the site is ''Gilgal Refā'īm'' or ''Galgal Refā'īm'', "Wheel of Spirits" or "Wheel of Ghosts" as ''Refa'im'' means "ghosts" or "spirits".&lt;ref name=MFA&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-08-24|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/israelexperience/history/pages/rogem%20hiri%20-%20ancient-%20mysterious%20construction.aspx|title=Rogem Hiri - Ancient Mysterious Construction|publisher=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204852/http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/israelexperience/history/pages/rogem%20hiri%20-%20ancient-%20mysterious%20construction.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel's answer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/leisure/in-the-wildcat-s-pile-of-stones-1.11251|title=In the wildcat's pile of stones|publisher=[[Ha'aretz]]|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and description==
[[File:Rujm el Hiri View Top.jpg|thumb|150px|Entrance to burial cave]]
The site's size and location, on a wide plateau which is also scattered with hundreds of [[dolmen]]s, means that an aerial perspective is necessary to see the complete layout.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt; The site was made from Basalt rocks, common in the Golan Heights due to the region's history of [[volcano|volcanic]] activity. It is made from 37,500 - 40,000&lt;ref name="Freikman 2012"/&gt; tons of partly worked stone stacked up to {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=us}} high.&lt;ref name="Aveni2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony F. Aveni|title=Skywatchers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDBu_x6vlZ4C&amp;pg=PA323|accessdate=30 March 2011|year=2001|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-70502-9|pages=323–324}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated by Freikman that the transportation and building of the massive monument would have required more than 25,000 working days.&lt;ref name="Freikman 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freikman|first=M.|title=A Near Eastern Megalithic Monument in Context|journal=[http://journal.topoi.org/index.php/etopoi Journal for Ancient Studes]|year=2012|issue=3|pages=143–147|url=http://journal.topoi.org/index.php/etopoi/article/download/99/129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is often referred to as the "[[Stonehenge]] of the [[Levant]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2774727411.html What's in a (wine's) name, Washington Jewish Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains consist of a large circle (slightly oval) of [[basalt]] rocks, containing four smaller concentric circles, each getting progressively thinner; some are complete, others incomplete.&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005"/&gt; The walls of the circles are connected by irregularly placed smaller stone walls perpendicular to the circles.&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005"/&gt;

The central [[tumulus]] is built from smaller rocks, and is thought to have been constructed after the surrounding walls were constructed.&lt;ref name="Aveni2001"/&gt; Connecting to it are four main stone walls. The first wall, shaped like a semicircle, is 50m in diameter and 1.5m wide. That wall is connected to a second one, an almost complete circle 90m in diameter. The third wall is a full circle, 110m in diameter and 2.6m wide. The fourth and outermost wall is the largest: 150m in diameter and 3.2m wide.

A central tumulus {{convert|65|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|15|ft|m}} high is surrounded by concentric circles, the outermost of which is {{convert|520|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|8|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt; Two entrances to the site face the northeast ({{convert|29|m|ft|sp=us}} wide) and southeast ({{convert|26|m|ft|sp=us}} wide).&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"/&gt; The northeast entrance leads to an accessway {{convert|20|ft|m}} long leading to the center of the circle which seems to point in the general direction of the [[Solstice|June solstice]] sunrise.&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aveni2001"/&gt; The axis of the tomb discovered at the site's center is similarly aligned.&lt;ref name="Aveni2001"/&gt; [[Mount Hermon]] is almost due north and [[Mount Tabor]] is close to December solstice sunrise. Geometry and astronomy are visually connected by the temple's design.&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005"/&gt;

==History and purpose==
The site was cataloged during an archaeological survey carried out in 1967-1968 by Shmarya Gutman and Claire Epstein.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt;  The site is probably the source of the legends about "a remnant of the giants" or [[Rephaim]] for [[Og]].&lt;ref name="Yuval Ne'eman"&gt;[http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/judaism/jewish_astro.html Astronomy in Israel: From Og's Circle to the Wise Observatory], [[Yuval Ne'eman]], [[Tel Aviv University]]&lt;/ref&gt; The surveyors used Syrian maps, and a Syrian [[Triangulation station|triangulation post]] was found on top of its [[cairn]].&lt;ref name="Museumsle-arkheʾologyah1996"/&gt; After this initial study, serious [[Archeology|archaeological excavation]]s commenced in the 1980s under Israeli professors [[Moshe Kochavi]] and Yoni Mizrachi, as part of the Land of Geshur Archaeological Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kochavi|first=Moshe|author2=Renner, Timothy |author3=Spar, Ira |author4= Yadlin, Esther |title=Rediscovered! The Land of Geshur|journal=[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]|date=July–August 1992|volume=18|issue=4|url=http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Rediscovered!_The_Land_of_Geshur,_Moshe_Kochavi,_Timothy_Renner,_Ira_Spar_and_Esther_Yadin,_BAR_18:04,_Jul/Aug_1992.|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Stephen Gabriel|title=The wheel of giants|url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/The-wheel-of-giants|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypotheses===
&lt;!--Better if converted to prose?--&gt;
* Worship - According to this hypothesis, the site was used for special ceremonies during the longest and shortest days of the year. It seems, that in the year [[3rd millennium BC|3000 BCE]], on the longest day, the first rays of the sun shone through the opening in the north-east gate, which is 20 by 29 meters. However, they did not shine in a perfect angle. It is assumed this is because the builders did not have sufficiently accurate architectural tools. The residents probably used the site to worship [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] and [[Ishtar]], the gods of fertility,&lt;ref name="Aveni2001"/&gt; to thank them for the good harvest during the year. After the erection of the tomb in the center, the rays' path was blocked.
* Burial site - It appears that the place of worship later became a burial site&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clive L. N. Ruggles|title=Ancient astronomy: an encyclopedia of cosmologies and myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9YYqiXm-lkC&amp;pg=PA366|accessdate=29 March 2011|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-477-6|pages=366–368}}&lt;/ref&gt; for leaders or other important individuals. Supporting this theory was the tomb in the dolmen. However, no human remains were found, only objects pointing to its function as a tomb. Also, even if it were a tomb, that was not the site's original function, as the tomb is 1,000 years newer than the site itself.
* [[Dakhma]] – Archaeologist Rami Arav suggests the site was used like the Dakhmas of the Zoroastrians, in which dead persons were laid out for birds to remove the flesh from their bones.&lt;ref name="Israel's answer" /&gt;
* Calendar - Some believe the site was used as an ancient [[calendar]]. At the times of the two [[equinox]]es, the sun's rays would pass between two rocks, 2m in height, 5m in width, at the eastern edge of the compound.  According to Anthony Aveni and Yonatan Mizrachi the entrance to the center opens on sunrise of the summer solstice. Other notches in the walls indicate the spring and fall equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeoastronomy/a/rujmelhiri.htm Ancient Archaeoastronomy in the Golan Heights]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Astronomical observations - Perhaps the site was used for [[Astronomy|astronomical]] observations of the [[constellation]]s, probably for [[Religion|religious]] calculations. Researchers found the site was built with dimensions and scales common for other period structures, and partly based on the stars' positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeoastronomy/a/rujmelhiri.htm Ancient Astronomy at Rujm el-Hiri: Star Watching in Ancient Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
In 2007, the site was excavated by Yosef Garfinkel and Michael Freikman of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Freikman returned in the summer of 2010 for further investigation of the site's date and function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digs.bib-arch.org/digs/rujm-el-hiri.asp Rujm el Hiri, Israel – Find a dig]&lt;/ref&gt; Freikman believes that the tomb in the center was built at the same time as the rings. Tomb robbers looted the remains, which included jewelry and weapons, but based on the discovery of one Chalcolithic pin dropped in a passageway, Freikman's theory is that the tomb was the centerpiece of the rings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britam.org/megaliths/MT14.html Brit-Am Megalithic Bulletin Update]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sound design''' is the art and practice of creating sound tracks for a variety of needs. It involves specifying, acquiring or creating auditory elements using audio production techniques and tools. It is employed in a variety of disciplines including [[filmmaking]], [[television production]], [[video game development]], [[theatre]], [[sound recording and reproduction]], [[Concert|live performance]], [[sound art]], [[post-production]], [[Radio broadcasting|radio]] and [[musical instrument]] development. Sound design commonly involves performing (see e.g. [[Foley (filmmaking)|foley]]) and editing of previously composed or recorded audio, such as sound effects and dialogue for the purposes of the medium. A '''sound designer''' is one who practices sound design.

==History==
[[File:KDujardinsCommedia.jpg|thumb|Karel Dujardins, ''commedia dell'arte'' show, 1657]]
{{see also|Prehistoric Music}}
The use of sound to evoke emotion, reflect mood and underscore actions in plays and dances began in [[prehistoric]] times. At its earliest, it was used in religious practices for healing or recreation. In ancient Japan, theatrical events called ''[[kagura]]'' were performed in [[Shinto shrine]]s with music and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brazell | first = Karen | year = 1999 | title = Traditional Japanese Theater | publisher = Columbia University Press | isbn = 0-231-10873-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plays were performed in medieval times in a form of theatre called ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'', which used music and sound effects to enhance performances. The use of music and sound in the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan Theatre]] followed, in which music and sound effects were produced off stage using devices such as bells, whistles, and horns. Cues would be written in the script for music and sound effects to be played at the appropriate time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kaye | first1 = Deena | last2 = Lebrecht | first2 = James | year = 1992 | title = Sound and Music For The Theatre | publisher = Back Stage Books, an imprint of Watson-Guptill Publications | isbn = 0-8230-7664-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian composer [[Luigi Russolo]] built mechanical sound-making devices, called "[[intonarumori]]," for [[futurism (music)|futurist]] theatrical and music performances starting around 1913. These devices were meant to simulate natural and man-made sounds, such as trains and bombs. Russolo's treatise, [[The Art of Noises]], is one of the earliest written documents on the use of abstract noise in the theatre. After his death, his intonarumori' were used in more conventional theatre performances to create realistic sound effects.

===Recorded sound===
Possibly the first use of recorded sound in the theatre was a phonograph playing a baby’s cry in a London theatre in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Booth | first = Michael R. | year = 1991 | title = Theatre In The Victorian | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-34837-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen years later, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] used recordings in his London production of Stephen Phillips’ tragedy NERO. The event is marked in the Theatre Magazine (1906) with two photographs; one showing a musician blowing a bugle into a large horn attached to a disc recorder, the other with an actor recording the agonizing shrieks and groans of the tortured martyrs. The article states: “these sounds are all realistically reproduced by the gramophone”. As cited by [[Bertolt Brecht]], there was a play about [[Rasputin]] written in (1927) by [[Alexej Tolstoi]] and directed by [[Erwin Piscator]] that included a recording of [[Lenin]]'s voice. Whilst the term "sound designer" was not in use at this time, a number of stage managers specialised as "effects men", creating and performing offstage sound effects using a mix of vocal mimicry, mechanical and electrical contraptions and gramophone records. A great deal of care and attention was paid to the construction and performance of these effects, both naturalistic and abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Napier | first = Frank | year = 1936 | title = Noises Off | publisher = Frederick Muller }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the twentieth century the use of recorded sound effects began to take over from live sound effects, though often it was the [[Stage management|stage manager]]'s duty to find the [[sound effect]]s and an [[electrician]] played the recordings during performances.

Between 1980 and 1988, [[Charlie Richmond (inventor)|Charlie Richmond]], USITT's first Sound Design Commissioner, oversaw efforts of their [[Sound Design Commission]] to define the duties, responsibilities, standards and procedures which might normally be expected of a theatre sound designer in [[North America]].  This subject is still regularly discussed by that group, but during that time, substantial conclusions were drawn and he wrote a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070308153444/http://www.richmondsounddesign.com/txt/sound-design.txt document] which, although now somewhat dated, provides a succinct record of what was expected at that time.  It was subsequently provided to both the ADC and David Goodman at the Florida USA local when they were both planning to represent sound designers in the 1990s.

===Digital technology===
[[File:Tainted blue studios control room.jpg|thumb|Modern digital control room at Tainted Blue Studios, 2010]]
[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] and [[digital audio]] technology have contributed to the evolution of sound production techniques in the 1980s and 1990s. [[Digital audio workstation]]s and a variety of digital signal processing algorithms applied in them allow more complicated sound tracks with more tracks as well as auditory effects to be realized. Features such as unlimited undo and sample-level editing allow fine control over the sound tracks.

In [[theatre sound]], features of computerized theatre sound design systems have also been recognized as being essential for live [[show control]] systems at [[Walt Disney World]] and, as a result, Disney utilized systems of that type to control many facilities at their ''[[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]]'' theme park, which opened in 1989. These features were incorporated into the [[MIDI Show Control]] (MSC) specification, an open [[communications protocol]] used to interact with diverse devices. The first show to fully utilize the MSC specification was the [[Magic Kingdom Parade]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]] in September, 1991.

The rise of interest in game audio has also brought more advanced interactive audio tools that are also accessible without a background in computer programming. Some of such software tools (termed "implementation tools" or "audio engines") feature a workflow that's similar to that in more conventional [[digital audio workstation]] programs and can also allow the sound production personnel to undertake some of the more creative interactive sound tasks (that are considered to be part of sound design for computer applications) that previously would have required a computer programmer. Interactive applications have also given rise to a plethora of techniques in "dynamic audio" that loosely means sound that's "parametrically" adjusted during the run-time of the program. This allows for a broader expression in sounds, more similar to that in films, because this way the sound designer can e.g. create footstep sounds that vary in a believable and non-repeating way and that also corresponds to what's seen in the picture. The digital audio workstation cannot directly "communicate" with game engines, because the game's events occur often in an unpredictable order, whereas traditional digital audio workstations as well as so called linear media (TV, film etc.) have everything occur in the same order every time the production is run. Especially games have also brought in dynamic or adaptive mixing.

The [[World Wide Web]] has greatly enhanced the ability of sound designers to acquire source material quickly, easily and cheaply.  Nowadays, a designer can preview and download crisper, more "believable" sounds as opposed to toiling through time- and budget-draining "shot-in-the-dark" searches through record stores, libraries and "the grapevine" for (often) inferior recordings.  In addition, software innovation has enabled sound designers to take more of a [[DIY|DIY (or "do-it-yourself")]] approach.  From the comfort of their home and at any hour, they can simply use a computer, speakers and headphones rather than renting (or buying) costly equipment or studio space and time for editing and mixing.  This provides for faster creation and negotiation with the director.

==Applications==

===Film===
{{See also|Sound editor (filmmaking)|Foley artist|Director of audiography}}
In motion picture production, a ''Sound Editor/Designer'' is a member of a [[film crew]] responsible for the entirety or some specific parts of a film's sound track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sound designer|url=http://filmsound.org/terminology/designer.htm|website=FilmSound.org|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]], the title ''Sound Designer'' is not controlled by any professional organization, unlike titles such as [[film director|Director]] or [[Screenwriter]].

The terms ''sound design'' and ''sound designer'' began to be used in the motion picture industry in 1969.  At that time, The title of ''Sound Designer'' was first granted to [[Walter Murch]] by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] in recognition for Murch's contributions to the film [[The Rain People]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ondaatje |first1=Michael |last2=Murch |first2=Walter |title=The conversations: Walter Murch and the art of editing film |date=2003 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The original meaning of the title ''Sound Designer'', as established by Coppola and Murch, was "an individual ultimately responsible for all aspects of a film's audio track, from the [[dialogue]] and [[sound effects]] recording to the [[re-recording (sound/film)|re-recording]] (mix) of the final track".&lt;ref name=reeves&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reeves|first1=Alex|title=A Brief History of Sound Design|url=http://www.theawsc.com/2014/01/31/a-brief-history-of-sound-design/|website=Advertising Week Social Club|publisher=Advertising Week|accessdate=13 October 2015|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084311/http://www.theawsc.com/2014/01/31/a-brief-history-of-sound-design/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''sound designer'' has replaced monikers like ''supervising sound editor'' or ''re-recording mixer'' for what was essentially the same position: the head designer of the final sound track.  Editors and mixers like Murray Spivack (''King Kong''), George Groves (''The Jazz Singer''), James G. Stewart (''Citizen Kane''), and Carl Faulkner (''Journey to the Center of the Earth'') served in this capacity during Hollywood's studio era, and are generally considered to be sound designers by a different name.

The advantage of calling oneself a sound designer beginning in later decades was two-fold.  It strategically allowed for a single person to work as both an editor and mixer on a film without running into issues pertaining to the jurisdictions of editors and mixers, as outlined by their respective unions.  Additionally, it was a rhetorical move that legitimated the field of post-production sound at a time when studios were down-sizing their sound departments, and when producers were routinely skimping on budgets and salaries for sound editors and mixers. In so doing, it allowed those who called themselves sound designers to compete for contract work and to negotiate higher salaries.  The position of Sound Designer therefore emerged in a manner similar to that of [[Production Designer]], which was created in the 1930s when [[William Cameron Menzies]] made revolutionary contributions to the craft of [[art director|art direction]] in the making of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bordwell|first1=David|title=William Cameron Menzies: One Forceful, Impressive Idea|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/menzies.php|website=davidbordwell.net|accessdate=13 October 2015}}{{sps|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The audio production team is a principal member of the production staff, with creative output comparable to that of the [[film editor]] and [[director of photography]]. Several factors have led to the promotion of audio production to this level, when previously it was considered subordinate to other parts of film:

* [[movie theater|Cinema]] [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]]s became capable of [[high-fidelity]] reproduction, particularly after the adoption of [[Dolby Stereo]]. These systems were originally devised as gimmicks to increase theater attendance, but their widespread implementation created a content vacuum that had to be filled by competent professionals. Before stereo soundtracks, film sound was of such low fidelity that only the dialogue and occasional sound effects were practical. The greater dynamic range of the new systems, coupled with the ability to produce sounds at the sides or behind the audience, provided the audio production team new opportunities for creative expression in film sound.
* Some directors were interested in realizing the new potentials of the medium. A new generation of filmmakers, the so-called "[[Easy Riders and Raging Bulls]]"—[[Martin Scorsese]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[George Lucas]], and others—were aware of the creative potential of sound and wanted to use it.
* Filmmakers were inspired by the [[popular music]] of the era. [[Concept albums]] of groups such as [[Pink Floyd]] and [[The Beatles]] suggested new modes of storytelling and creative techniques that could be adapted to motion pictures.
* New filmmakers made their early films outside the [[Hollywood]] [[the establishment|establishment]], away from the influence of film [[labor union]]s and the then rapidly dissipating [[studio system]].

The contemporary title of ''sound designer'' can be compared with the more traditional title of ''[[supervising sound editor]]''; many sound designers use both titles interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Bastian|title=Sound Design: The Development of Sound Design for Hollywood Films and its Impact on Modern Cinema|date=2008|publisher=diplom.de|location=Hamburg|isbn=9783836618922|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fpxAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of ''supervising sound editor'', or ''sound supervisor'', developed in parallel with the role of '''sound designer'''. The demand for more sophisticated soundtracks was felt both inside and outside Hollywood, and the '''supervising sound editor''' became the head of the large sound department, with a staff of dozens of [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]]s, that was required to realize a complete sound job with a fast turnaround.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollyn|first1=Norman|title=The Film Editing Room Handbook: How to Tame the Chaos of the Editing Room|date=2009|publisher=Peachpit Press|location=Berkeley CA|isbn=0321679520|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IRSq9qWQeMIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dakic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dakic|first1=Vesna|title=Sound Design for Film and Television|date=2009|publisher=GRIN Verlag|location=Norderstedt|isbn=9783640454792|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSVPl1TSOm8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
{{See also|Sound reinforcement system|Architectural acoustics}}
Sound design, as a distinct discipline, is one of the youngest fields in [[stagecraft]], second only to the use of [[Digital cinema|projection]] and other [[multimedia]] displays, although the ideas and techniques of sound design have been around almost since theatre started. [[Dan Dugan (audio engineer)|Dan Dugan]], working with three stereo tape decks routed to ten loudspeaker zones&lt;ref name=AES1969&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=1540 |title=A New Music and Sound Effects System for Theatrical Productions |last=Dugan |first=Dan |date=December 1969 |work=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society |volume=17 |number=6 |pages=666–670 |publisher=[[Audio Engineering Society]] |accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the 1968–69 season of [[American Conservatory Theater]] (ACT) in San Francisco, was the first person to be called a sound designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Deena |last1=Kaye |first2=James |last2=LeBrecht |title=Sound and music for the theatre: the art and technique of design |publisher=Focal Press |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2gHgjAjGPYC&amp;pg=PT31 |page=8 |isbn=0-240-81011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern audio technology has enabled theatre sound designers to produce flexible, complex, and inexpensive designs that can be easily integrated into live performance. The influence of film and television on playwriting is seeing plays being written increasingly with shorter scenes, which is difficult to achieve with scenery but easily conveyed with sound. The development of film sound design is giving writers and directors higher expectations and knowledge of sound design. Consequently, theatre sound design is widespread and accomplished sound designers commonly establish long-term collaborations with directors.

====Musicals====
Sound design for [[musical theatre|musicals]] often focuses on the design and implementation of a sound reinforcement system that will fulfill the needs of the production. If a sound system is already installed in the performance venue, it is the sound designer's job to tune the system for the best use for a particular production. Sound system tuning employs various methods including [[equalization (audio)|equalization]], delay, volume, speaker and [[microphone]] placement, and in some cases, the addition of new equipment. In conjunction with the director and musical director, if any, the sound reinforcement designer determines the use and placement of microphones for actors and musicians. The sound reinforcement designer ensures that the performance can be heard and understood by everyone in the audience, regardless of the shape, size or acoustics of the venue, and that performers can hear everything needed to enable them to do their jobs. While sound design for a musical largely focuses on the artistic merits of sound reinforcement, many musicals, such as ''Into the Woods'' also require significant sound scores (see Sound Design for Plays). Sound Reinforcement Design was recognized by the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards with the Tony Award for Best Sound Design of a Musical until the 2014-15 season,&lt;ref name="2010-2011 Tony Award Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010-2011 Tony Award Rules|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/about/Rules-2010-2011FINAL.pdf|publisher=American Theatre Wing|accessdate=26 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319152200/http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/about/Rules-2010-2011FINAL.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; later reinstating in the 2017-18 season.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/news/articles/2017-04-24/best_sound_design_categories_to_return_to_the_tony_awards.html|title=Best Sound Design Categories to Return to the Tony Awards|website=TonyAwards.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plays====
Sound design for plays often involves the selection of music and sounds (sound score) for a production based on intimate familiarity with the play, and the design, installation, calibration and utilization of the sound system that reproduces the sound score. The sound designer for a play and the production's [[theater director|director]] work together to decide the themes and emotions to be explored. Based on this, the sound designer for plays, in collaboration with the director and possibly the composer, decides upon the sounds that will be used to create the desired moods. In some productions, the sound designer might also be hired to compose music for the play. The sound designer and the director usually work together to "spot" the cues in the play (i.e., decide when and where sound will be used in the play). Some productions might use music only during scene changes, whilst others might use sound effects. Likewise a scene might be underscored with music, sound effects or abstract sounds that exist somewhere between the two. Some sound designers are accomplished composers, writing and producing music for productions as well as designing sound. Many sound designs for plays also require significant sound reinforcement (see Sound Design for Musicals). Sound Design for plays was recognized by the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards with the Tony Award for Best Sound Design of a Play until the 2014-15 season,&lt;ref name="2010-2011 Tony Award Rules"/&gt; later reinstating the award in the 2017-18 season.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Professional organizations====
* The Association of Sound Designers is a trade association representing theatre sound designers in the UK.
* United Scenic Artists (USA) Local USA829, which is integrated within [[IATSE]], represents theatrical sound designers in the United States.
* Theatrical Sound Designers in English Canada are represented by the Associated Designers of Canada (ADC), and in Québec by l'Association des professionnels des arts du Québec (APASQ).

===Music===
In contemporary music business, especially in the production of [[rock music]], [[ambient music]], [[progressive rock]], and similar [[genre]]s, the [[record producer]] and [[recording engineer]] play important roles in the creation of the overall sound (or [[soundscape]]) of a recording, and less often, of a live performance. A record producer is responsible for extracting the best performance possible from the musicians and for making both musical and technical decisions about the instrumental timbres, arrangements, etc. On some, particularly more electronic music projects, artists and producers in more conventional genres have sometimes sourced additional help from artists often credited as "sound designers", to contribute specific auditory effects, ambiences etc. to the production. These people are usually more versed in e.g. electronic music composition and synthesizers than the other musicians on board.

In application of electroacoustic techniques (e.g. binaural sound) and sound synthesis for contemporary music or film music, a sound designer (often also an electronic musician) sometimes refers to an artist who works alongside a composer to realize the more electronic aspects of a musical production. This is because sometimes there exists a difference in interests between artists calling themselves composers and artists calling themselves electronic musicians or sound designers. The latter being sometimes more experienced as well as interested in electronic music techniques, such as sequencing and synthesizers, but the former often wanting to use elements of electronic music in compositions but often being more experienced in writing music in a variety of genres. Since electronic music itself is quite broad in techniques and often separate from techniques applied in other genres, this kind of collaboration can be seen as fairly natural as well as beneficial.

Notable examples of (recognized) sound design in music are the contributions of [[Michael Brook]] to the [[U2]] album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', [[George Massenburg]] to the [[Jennifer Warnes]] album ''[[Famous Blue Raincoat]]'', [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] to the [[Pink Floyd]] album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', and [[Brian Eno]] to the [[Paul Simon]] album ''[[Surprise (Paul Simon album)|Surprise]]''.

In 1974,  [[Suzanne Ciani]] started her own production company, Ciani/Musica. Inc., which became the #1 sound design music house in New York.&lt;ref&gt;http://sevwave.com/electronic%20music.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer applications and other applications===
Sound is widely used in a variety of [[human-computer interface]]s, in [[computer game]]s and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = Viviane | last1 = Gal | first2 = Cécile | last2 = Le Prado | first3 = J. B. | last3 = Merland | first4 = Stéphane | last4 = Natkin | first5 = Liliana | last5 = Vega | title = Processes and tools for sound design in computer games | booktitle = Proceedings of International Computer Music Conference | location = Goetborg | date = September 2002 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.78.5543 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = Olivier | last1 = Veneri | first2 = Stéphane | last2 = Natkin | first3 = Cécile | last3 = Le Prado | first4 = Marc | last4 = Emerit | title = A Game Audio Technology Overview | url = http://www.smcnetwork.org/files/proceedings/2006/10-A_Game_Audio_Technology_Overview.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound production for computer applications adds few extra concerns and requirements to the sound. Some of them are: non-repetitiveness, interactivity/dynamicity and low memory and CPU use. For example, the most computational resources are usually devoted to graphics, which in turn means that the sound playback is often limited to some upper memory consumption as well as CPU use limits. These have to be added to the concerns of audio production, since it is often not enough to merely "create good sound", but the sound also has to fit to the given computational limits, while still sounding good, which may require e.g. the use of audio compression or voice allocating systems. However, sound for computer applications also adds some new creative aspects to music and sound, because computer sound (especially in games) often involves the sound having or desired to be ''interactive''. Adding interactivity can involve using a variety of playback systems or logic, using tools that allow the production of interactive sound (e.g. Max/MSP, Wwise) and it also deviates from being just an art form to also requiring software or electrical engineering, since implementing interactivity of sound also requires engineering of the systems that play the sound or e.g. process user input. Therefore, in interactive applications, a sound designer often collaborates with an engineer (e.g. a sound programmer) who's concerned with designing the playback systems and their efficiency.

==Awards==
Sound designers have been recognized by awards organizations for some time, and new awards have emerged more recently in response to advances in sound design technology and quality. The [[Motion Picture Sound Editors]] and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] recognizes the finest or most aesthetic sound design for a film with the Golden Reel Award for Sound and Music editing, and the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] respectively. In 2007, the [[Tony Award for Best Sound Design]] was created to honor the best sound design in American theatre on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Starting in 2007-08, Sound Designers Will Be Recognized by Tony Awards | url = http://www.playbill.com/news/article/108956.html | date = 19 Jun 2007 | first = Kenneth | last = Jones | work = Playbill.com | access-date = 2008-06-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626051746/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/108956.html# | archive-date = 2007-06-26 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American theatrical award organizations that recognize sound designers include these:
* [[Dora Mavor Moore Awards]]
* [[Drama Desk Awards]]
* [[Helen Hayes Awards Resident Design|Helen Hayes Awards]]
* [[Obie Awards]]
* [[Joseph Jefferson Awards]]

Major British award organizations include the [[Olivier Awards]]. The [[Tony Awards]] retired the awards for Sound Design as of the 2014-2015 season,&lt;ref&gt;Bowgen, Phillipe.

[[File:Lydinstallation ARoS.jpg|thumb|290px|[[Janet Cardiff]]'s ''Forty Part Motet'' (2001) in the [[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum]], Denmark]]
'''Sound installation''' (related to [[sound art]] and [[sound sculpture]]) is an [[intermedia]] and time based art form. It is an expansion of an [[art installation]] in the sense that it includes the sound element and therefore the time element. The main difference with a sound sculpture is that a sound installation has a three-dimensional space and the axes with which the different sound objects are being organized are not exclusively internal to the work, but also external. A work of art is an installation only if it makes a dialog with the surrounding space. A sound installation is usually a [[site-specific art|site-specific]] but sometimes it can be readapted to other spaces. It can be made either in close or open spaces, and context is fundamental to determine how a sound installation will be aesthetically perceived.
The difference between a regular art installation and a sound installation is that the later one has the time element, which gives the visiting public the possibility to stay a longer time due possible curiosity over the development of sound. This temporal factor also gives the audience the excuse to explore the space thoroughly due to the dispositions of the different sounds in space.

Sound installations sometimes use interactive art technology ([[computers]], [[sensors]], [[Machine|mechanical]] and [[kinetic art|kinetic]] devices, etc.) but we also find this type of art form using only sound sources placed in different space points (like [[loudspeakers|speakers]]), or acoustic music instruments materials like piano strings that are played by a performer or by the public (see [[Paul Panhuysen]]).

==Sound structure in sound installations==

#The simplest sound form is a repeating sound loop. This is mostly used in [[ambient art]], and in this case the sound is not the determinant factor of the art work.
#The most used sound structure is the [[Aleatoric music#"Open form" chance music|open form]], since the public can decide to experience a sound installation for just a few minutes or for a longer period of time. This obliges the artist to construct a sound organization that is capable of working well in both of the two cases.
#There is also the possibility to have a linear sound structure, where sound develops in the same way as in a [[musical composition]]. In this case, the artist might risk not having the audience staying for the whole length of the sound.

It is part of the [[Ashcan School]] movement known in particular for depicting scenes of daily life in  early twentieth century [[New York City]], often in the city's poorer neighborhoods. Bellows used quick strokes to create a blurred image, simulating the two fighters in motion. He also chose a low point of view to put the viewer among the crowd watching the fight.

Participants in the boxing ring were usually members of the club, but occasionally outsiders would fight with temporary memberships. These fighters were known as "stags".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=PBS| title=Sister Wendy's American Collection| accessdate=2014-07-09| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/sisterwendy/works/sta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stećak''' ({{Cyrl|Стећак|sr}}, {{IPA-sh|stetɕak|}}; plural: '''Stećci''', Стећци, {{IPA-sh|stetɕtsi|}}) is the name for monumental [[medieval]] [[tombstone]]s that lie scattered across [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and the border parts of [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]]. An estimated 60,000 are found within the borders of modern Bosnia and Herzegovina and the rest of 10,000 are found in what are today Croatia (4,400), Montenegro (3,500), and Serbia (2,100), at more than 3,300 odd sites with over 90% in poor condition.&lt;ref name="Unesco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/about-this-office/single-view/news/joint_nomination_for_inclusion_of_stecci_medieval_tombstones_in_the_world_heritage_list#.Vv3BqvmLTIU |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414002411/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/about-this-office/single-view/news/joint_nomination_for_inclusion_of_stecci_medieval_tombstones_in_the_world_heritage_list |title=Joint Nomination for Inclusion of Stećci - Medieval Tombstones in the World Heritage List |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |date=14 April 2014 |archive-date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{cite news |last=Musli |first=Emir |title=Čiji su naši stećci? |url=http://www.dw.com/bs/%C4%8Diji-su-na%C5%A1i-ste%C4%87ci/a-18078579 |date=23 November 2014 |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |language=Bosnian |access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearing in the mid 12th century, with the first phase in the 13th century, the tombstones reached their peak in the 14th and 15th century, before disappearing during the [[Ottoman occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ottoman occupation]] in the very early 16th century.&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt; They were a common tradition amongst [[Bosnian Church|Bosnian]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Church followers alike,&lt;ref name="WM"&gt;{{cite web |last=Walasek |first=Helen |title=Marian Wenzel 18 December 1932 - 6 January 2002 |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=874&amp;reportid=153 |publisher=Bosnian Institute |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often related to the autochthonous [[Vlachs in medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina|Vlach]] population,{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=52, 72, 176, 307}} however the original ethnic and religious affiliation is still undetermined.{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=71–72, 73–74}} The [[epitaph]]s on them are mostly written in extinct [[Bosnian Cyrillic]] alphabet. The one of largest collection of these tombstones is named [[Radimlja]], west of [[Stolac]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;

Stećci were inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2016. It includes a selection of 4,000 stećci at 28 necropolises – of which 22 from Bosnia and Herzegovina, two from Croatia, three from Montenegro, and three from Serbia.&lt;ref name="Unesco2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/6802 |title=Examination of nominations of cultural properties to the World Heritage List |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |date=2016 |access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word itself is a [[Contraction (grammar)|contracted form]] of the older word *''stojećak'', which is derived from the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] verb ''stajati'' (engl. ''stand'').{{sfn|Kužić|1999|p=176}} It literally means the "tall, standing thing".{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=114}} In Herzegovina they are also called as ''mašeti'' / ''mašete'' (Italian ''massetto'' meaning "big rock", or Turkish ''meşhet''/''mešhed'' meaning "tombstone of a fallen hero"{{refn|group="nb"|Turkish word ''meşhed'' means a monument erected to Islamic dead martyr ''şehid''. The issue with the derivation is that stećci are attributed to, for Islam, [[infidel]] Christians and Bogomils, term ''mašet'' can also be derived from Turkish ''maşatlik'' meaning "non-Muslim cemetery", term ''mašet'' is of male while ''mašeta'' is of female gender, which is specific for Muslims.{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=72}}}}), in Central and Western Bosnia as ''mramori'' / ''mramorje'' / ''mramorovi'' (marble), while in Serbia and Montenegro as ''usađenik'' (implantation). On the stećci inscriptions they are called as ''bilig'' (mark), ''kamen bilig'' (stone mark), ''kâm'' / ''kami'' / ''kamen'' (stone), ''hram'' (shrine), ''zlamen'' (sign), ''kuća'' (house), ''raka'' (pit), ''greb/grob'' (grave).{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=72}}{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=114}}{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=59–60}}&lt;ref name="UnescoBiH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5607 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820104920/http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5607/ |title=Stećaks - Mediaeval Tombstones (Bosnia and Herzegovina) |date=18 April 2011 |archive-date=20 August 2016 |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1495 lectionary they are recorded as ''kamy'' (stone).{{sfn|Kužić|2001|p=272}}{{sfn|Bulog|2007|p=390}}

Although under the name ''stećak'' is meant high monolithic standing stones (i.e. ''sanduk'' and ''sljemenjak'' form), in the 20th century the word ''stećak'' was accepted in science as general term, including for plate tombstones (i.e. ''ploče'').{{sfn|Kužić|1999|p=176}}{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=322}} The original reference to the word ''stećak'' itself is uncertain and seems to be modern invention as it can only be traced from the note by [[Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski]] from 1851,{{sfn|Kužić|2001|p=269}} dictionary by [[Vuk Karadžić]] from 1852 (in the first edition from 1812 the term did not exist), although he contradicted himself as the commoners from [[Zagvozd]] called them ''starovirsko'' ("of the old faith"),{{sfn|Kužić|2001|p=268}} dictionary by [[Bogoslav Šulek]] from 1860 and so on,{{sfn|Kužić|2001|p=270}} while academic dictionaries mention it only from 1956/58.{{sfn|Kužić|2001|p=267}} It is considered that the term was usually used in [[East Herzegovina]] and in the area of [[Raška (region)|Stari Vlah]] in Serbia.{{sfn|Kužić|2001|p=268}} Until the very early 20th century there was wandering in terminology, and some scholars proposed general terms like ''nadgrobni biljezi'' (gravestone markers) and ''mramorje'' (marble) to be more appropriate.{{sfn|Kužić|1999|p=176}}

The term ''stećak'' is uncommon in regional dialects and without [[Etiology|etiological]] value,{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=114}} and [[Semantics|semantically]] incorrect and contradicting as it derives from the verb "to stand", while the chest-type to which it refers predominantly is laid down, while another sub-type of pillars and crosses is the one predominantly upright; this upright or standing sub-type does not amount even 5% of the overall number of stećci; in the original stećci inscriptions they are most often called as ''kami'' (meaning "stone" regardless of the form), thus some scholars proposed the term ''kamik'' (pl. ''kamici'') for all forms of headstones, while ''stećak'' would mean only the upright sub-type.{{sfn|Kužić|2001|p=271–273}} The term ''kamik'' is more close to the original meaning and sometime is used instead of ''stećak'' in professional literature.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=60}}

The stećci area or cemetery folk names show respect and admiration for their dimensions, age or representations: Divsko groblje (Giants’ cemetery), Mašete (big stones), Mramori/Mramorje (marble blocks), Grčko groblje (Greek cemetery), Tursko groblje (Turkish cemetery), Kaursko groblje ([[Giaour]]’s cemetery).{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=59}}&lt;ref name="Unesco2016"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Definition===
[[File:Radimlja pobliz Stolce, nejvetsi nekropole stecku v BaH1.jpg|thumb|250px|Stećci at [[Radimlja]] necropolis.]]
They are characteristic for the territory of present-day [[Hercegovina]], central [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Podrinje]] and [[Dalmatia]] (especially South of river [[Cetina]]), and some minor parts of [[Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]] and Western [[Serbia]], [[Posavina]] and Northwestern Bosnia.{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=321}}

Stećci are described as horizontal and vertical tombstones, made of stone, with a flat or gable-top surface, with or without a pedestal.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=6, 61}}{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=321}} The common classification was established by Dmitrij Sergejevski in 1952, who divided them into recumbent stećci and standing stećci.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=62}} The systematization of stećci is not currently complete. According to [[Šefik Bešlagić]], there are seven main shapes: slab, chest, chest with pedestal, ridge/gable, ridge/gable with pedestal, pillar, and cross;{{sfn|Kužić|2001|p=271–273}} while according to Lovrenović, there are nine types in [[Radimlja]]: slab, slab with pedestal, chest, chest with pedestal, tall chest, tall chest with pedestal, sarcophagus (i.e. ridge/gable), sarcophagus with pedestal, cruciform.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=62}}

For instance, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, according to UNESCO, "about 40,000 chests, 13,000 slabs, 5,500 gabled tombstones, 2,500 pillars/obelisks, 300 cruciform tombstones and about 300 tombstones of indeterminate shape have been identified. Of these, more than 5,000 bear carved decorations".&lt;ref name="UnescoBiH"/&gt;

The chronology established by [[Marian Wenzel]] assumes they developed from the plate [[headstone]]s, the oldest one dating back to 1220 (the first were probably erected sometime in the mid-12th century&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt;), the monumental ones emerged somewhere around 1360, those with visual representations around 1435&amp;ndash;1477, and that total production ended circa 1505.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=6}}{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=322}} However, some consider that it lasted until the late 16th century, with rare examples that continued until the 18th century.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=244}} Stećci in the form of chest (''sanduk'') and ridge/saddle-roofed (''sljemenjak'') do not seem to have appeared before the middle or the end of the 14th century (1353-1477{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=176}}), while the remaining two basic forms - the upright pillar (''stup'') and cross (''krstača'' / ''križina''), no earlier than mid-15th century. In the case of the latter, upright or standing forms could be influenced by the ''nišan'' - the upright monolithic stones on top of the Muslim (Turkish) graves, which had already emerged by the end of the 14th century in conquered parts of Macedonia and Serbia.{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=321}}{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=69–71}} This form is predominantly found in Serbia and Eastern Bosnia.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=244}}

The initial stage of their development, which included simple recumbent plates or slabs isn't specific for the region, but it is of broad West Mediterranean origin, and as such the term ''stećak'' (implying the chest and ridge form) is misleading for all tombstone forms. The slabs were typical for a kind of burial in the West Mediterranean world of the 14th and 15th centuries, which had a special method of production and ornamentation in the Balkans, customized according to the stonemasonry skills and microenvironment.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=6–7}}{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=326}} The dated monuments indicate they were initially made by/for the feudal nobility, while later this tradition was embraced and adopted by the indigenous [[Vlachs in medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina|Vlachs]] who have almost exclusively built them from the mid-15th century on.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=72, 176}}{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=118}}

===Decorations===
{{quote box|width=18%|align=right|quote="I have for long lain here, and for much longer shall I lie"; "I was born into a great joy and I died into a great sorrow"; "I was nothing then, I am nothing now"; "You will be like I, and I can not be like you"; "May he who topples this stone be cursed" |source=— Some translated examples of inscriptions.{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=121}}{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=249}}}}
A fraction of stećci (384{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=73}}) bear inscriptions, mostly in extinct [[Bosnian Cyrillic]], some in [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] script. The language has some archaic phrases, characterized by [[Serbo-Croatian#Division by jat reflex|Ikavian]] while toward the end by Ijekavian [[yat]] reflex.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=248}} The inscriptions can be roughly divided into those of: religious phrase, description of heroic death, information of the deceased, information of the deceased's relatives and circumstances of death, information with only personal name (sometime with smith-pupil name), moral (or religious) lesson.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=371}} The last are mostly brazen reminders of wisdom and mortality, relay a dread of death, more anxiety than peace.{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=121}}

The most remarkable feature is their decorative motifs roughly divided in six groups which complement each other: social symbols, religious symbols, images of posthumous [[Kolo (dance)|kolo]], figural images, clear ornaments, and unclassified motifs (mostly symbolic, geometrical, or damaged).{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=369}} Many of them remain enigmatic to this day; [[spiral]]s, arcades, [[Rosette (design)|rosettes]], [[Vine|vine leaves and grapes]], [[lilium]], stars (often six-pointed) and [[Crescent|crescent Moon]]s are among the images that appear. Figural images include processions of [[deer]], [[horse]], dancing the kolo, [[hunting]], chivalric tournaments, and, most famously, the image of the [[man]] with his right hand raised, perhaps in a gesture of [[fealty]].{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=322}}{{sfn|Lovrenović|2014|p=73–122}}

A series of visual representations on the tombstones can not be simplistically interpreted as real scenes from the life, and symbolic explanation is still considered by the scholarship.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=251}} The shield on the tombstones, usually with the crossbar, crescent and star, cannot be coat of arms, neither the lilium which is stylized is used in the heraldic sense. On one stećak is displayed tied lion and above him winged dragon. Already in 1979, historian Hadžijahić noted that the horsemen are not riding with [[rein]]s, yet (if are not hunting) their hands are free and pointed to the sky, implying possible cult significance.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=328}} In 1985, Maja Miletić noted the symbolic and religious character of the stećak scenes.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=329}} All the "life scenes" are considered to be part of ceremonial.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=334}} Several scholars concluded that the motifs, as well tradition of posthumous indigenous cult,{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=61}} show the continuity of old Balkan pre-Christian symbolism from [[Prehistory of the Balkans|prehistoric]] time and the autochthonous Romanized [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] (i.e. [[Vlachs in medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina|Vlachian]]) tribes.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=329–335}} [[Alojz Benac]] noted that the displays of sole horse with snake, as well sole deer with bird, symbolize the soul of the deceased going to otherworld, which representations are resembling to those found on [[Iapydes]] artefacts.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=332–333}} The Illyrian god ''[[Paleo-Balkan mythology#Illyrian|Medaurus]]'' is described as riding on horseback and carrying a lance.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=333}}

[[File:Radimlje, bogumil nekropolisz sírkő 7.JPG|thumb|200px|The sacral motif of deer is considered to be of [[Paleo-Balkan mythology|Paleo-Balkan]] and pre-Christian origin.]]
Of the all animals deer is the most represented, and mostly is found on stećci in Herzegovina.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=332}} According to [[Dragoslav Srejović]], spread of Christianity didn't cause disappearance of old cult and belief in sacred deer.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=331}} Wenzel considered it lead the deceased to [[underworld]].{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=251}} Historian [[Šefik Bešlagić]] synthesized the representations of deer: sometime accompanied by a bird (often on the back or horns), cross or lilium, frequently are shown series of deer or doe, as well with a bow and arrow, dog and hunter(s) with a spear or sword (often on a horse). It is displayed in hunting scenes, as well some kolo processions which are led by a man who is riding a deer.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=328–329}} There scenes where deers calmly approach the hunter, or deers with enormous size and sparse horns.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=329}} Most of the depictions of "deer hunting" are facing the [[West]], which had the symbolic meaning for death and otherworld. In the numerous hunting scenes in only one deer is wounded (the stećak has some anomalies), indicating unrealistic meaning. In the [[Roman art|Roman]] and [[Parthian art|Parthian]]-[[Sasanian art|Sasanian]] art hunted animals are mortally wounded, and deer is only one of many, while on stećci is the only hunted animal.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=336}}

[[File:Stećci, Risovac, Bosnia and Herzegoivna II.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Two stećci with motifs of [[Kolo (dance)|kolo]].]]
The motifs of ''kolo'' (in total 132{{sfn|Lovrenović|2014|p=91}}) procession along a deer, and its specific direction of dancing, although not always easily identifiable, show its a mortal dance compared to cheerful dance. From [[Iapydes]] urns, up to present day women in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro, remorseful dances are played in the westward{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=251}} direction toward sunset. In Eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina so-called ''Ljeljenovo kolo'',{{refn|group="nb"|See [[spring procession of Ljelje/Kraljice]] in Croatia with swords and flowers, similarly danced by [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] east of [[Beograd]] at the day of [[Pentecost]].{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=334}} The etymological and cultural relation of ''jelen'' (deer), ''Ljelja'' and ''Ljeljo'' which are children of [[Perun]], as well flower ''ljiljan'' (lilium) also called as ''perunika'' is still to be confirmed.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=335}} [[Ivo Pilar]] noted that the use of name ''Ljeljen'' for hills in toponymy of Herzegovina and Eastern Bosnia is common.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=331–332}}}} with ''ljeljen'' local name for ''jelen'' (deer) implying ''jelenovo kolo'', is danced by making the gate of the raised hand and ringleader of these gates tries to pull all kolo dancers through them until the kolo is entangled, after that, playing in the opposite direction, until the kolo is unraveled. Its origin is in mortuary ritual guiding the soul to another world and the meaning of renewal of life.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=334}}

The vast regional, but scarce (usually only one) in-graveyard distribution mostly in the center or some notable position of cross-type stećci (''križine''), and their almost exclusively ornament of the crescent Moon and stars, could indicate cemetery label for specific (pagan) religious affiliation. The symbolism of the Moon and stars (Sun), which are often found on them, could be traced to combination of pagan and Christian beliefs, {{sfn|Lovrenović|2014|p=80–81}} pix-pointed star represent [[Venus]] (in Slavic mithology called Danica) and with Moon could represent "astral marriage",{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=250}} or even [[Mithraism]] which had old [[Mazdak]]ism belief that the dead body goes to the Moon and souls to the Sun,{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=42}} while some considered a connection between astral simbols with the position of celestial bodies at the time of death of the deceased.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2014|p=81}}

===Schools===
They were carved by ''kovač'' / ''klesar'' (smith, mason; in the sense of Latin ''faber'', "master"{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=369}}), while the inscriptions, probably as a template, were compiled by ''dijak'' / ''pisar'' (pupil, scribe). Until now are known 33 personal names of masons, among whom most notable is Grubač due to quality and being both a mason and scribe. He made four stećci in Boljuni and four stećci in Opličići near [[Stolac]].{{sfn|Lovrenović|2014|p=86}} The most notable scribe was Semorad who also worked around Stolac. It is considered that the masons studied the craft in Dalmatia and Ragusa, and from them those in hinterland.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=247}}

Stećci were mostly carved out of huge blocks, mostly of [[limestone]]. The vicinity of quarry was most significant for the cemetery location. Some of them weight more than 29 [[tonnes]], and it is supposed they were transported by horse or ox carriage while the heaviest with a combination of sledges and flat billets. They were placed directly above the pit, often in cardinal direction West-East, therefore so were the deceased. Seemingly it was related to the [[Sun path]] and was of importance that the dead watch the rising Sun.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=245}}

Stećci in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be roughly divided on two stonemasonry schools Herzegovian (sarcophagi with arcades, figurative scenes, a wealth of motifs) and East Bosnian (sarcophagi in the form of chalets, floral motives).{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=327, 336}} The leading position had schools on the territory of Herzegovina, with center around [[Stolac]], in area of [[Trebinje]] and [[Bileća]], [[Gacko]] and [[Nevesinje]]. The fourth workshop was in the area of [[Konjic]], while the fifth around [[Široki Brijeg|Lištica]]. The stonemasons center in Western Bosnia was between [[Kupres]] and [[Duvno]], in Central Bosnia around [[Travnik]], while in Eastern Bosnia were four workshops, one between [[Kladanj]], [[Olovo]] and [[Ilijaš]], second around [[Zvornik]], third in [[Ludmer]], and fourth around [[Rogatica]].{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=372}}

[[File:Stećak ploča.JPG|thumb|200px|A slab stećak at Cista Velika.]]
In Croatia supposedly were two workshops, one in Cista Velika, and second in Čepikuće.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=247}} Local characteristic of stećci in the territory around [[Cetina]] river in [[Croatia]] is their rare ornateness, of which only 8-10% have simple decoration.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=40}}{{sfn|Milošević|2013|p=91}} Those from upper Cetina are smaller and by type and style relate to those from Knin and [[Livno]], while those from mid Cetina are more monumental.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=61}} Specific plate stećci were found in village Bitelić which are decorated with identical geometric ornament, not found in [[Dalmatia]] nor in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however by the nature of ornament and surface treatment is considered possible connection with several monuments near Church of St. Peter in [[Nikšić]], [[Montenegro]].{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=40}}{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=323}}

In Montenegro one center could have existed around Nikšić, while second in [[Pljevlja]]. According to Bešlagić, in Serbia seemingly were no specific centers yet the masons arrived from Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=247}}

==Origin==
There are different and still inconclusive theories on their cultural-artistic, religious and ethnic affiliation.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=7}}{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=71–72, 73–74}} According to common thesis, especially represented by Bešlagić, stećci are an original Bosnian-Herzegovinian cultural-artistic medieval phenomenon.{{sfn|Zorić|1984|p=208}} Some scholars like [[Milovan Gavazzi]] (1978) examined a much broader context, and considered their connection to [[megalith]]ic tradition of the region and Eurasia from prehistoric and contemporary period.{{sfn|Zorić|1984|p=207–211}} Some scholars considered that the ''chest'' form could have been inspired by [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic houses]] from the coastal cities, while the ''ridge'' form by medieval Christian [[sarcophagus]] or local Bosnian wooden house.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=244}} It is established that they are mainly related to mountainous places which became deserted over a period of time because of migrations caused by new social events and [[Ottoman occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ottoman occupation]].{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=42–43}}

===Religion===
Since the middle of the 19th century, specifically since the 1875 thesis by [[Arthur Evans]],{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=75}}{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=33, 367}} many scholars including [[Alexander Soloviev (historian)|Alexander Soloviev]], Kosta Hörmann and [[Ćiro Truhelka]] have initially argued that they were related to the origin of the [[Bosnian Church]] i.e. [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] or other [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] groups.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=7}}{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=322}} Others have asserted that the church was actually founded by [[Franciscan|Franciscan monks]] from the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Fine|2007|p=}} However, Benac noted that the stećci were not built in [[First Bulgarian Empire]], and that in Central Bosnia where were centers of [[Bosnian Kingdom|Kingdom of Bosnia]] and Bosnian Church is smaller concentration, as well higher number of stećci of poor design, but also older date.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=327}} The exclusive relation between stećci and Bogomils was propagated from the late 19th century due to political and ideological reasons, like by [[Béni Kállay]] and Austro-Hungarian authorities who promoted post-Ottoman and pan-Bosnian identity because since 1878 the territory was part of Austro-Hungarian administration,{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=242}}&lt;ref name="Textbook"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ronelle Alexander |author2=Ellen Elias-Bursac |title=Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, a Textbook: With Exercises and Basic Grammar |date=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BziI02At36UC |publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres |page=270 |isbn=9780299236540}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than scientifical reasons.{{sfn|Kužić|2001|p=273}} Although was already questioned in the 1899 by Kosta Hörmann the first director of [[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], for almost a century it was a predominant theory in international historiography.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=35, 367}}

Since the mid-20th century many scholars like [[Marian Wenzel]],{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=368}} the world's once leading authority on the art and artifacts of medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/mar/05/arts.guardianobituaries |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Marian Wenzel | date=March 5, 2002 |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |first=Anthea |last=Brook}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the stećci tombstones were a common tradition amongst Catholic, Orthodox and Bosnian Church followers alike.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=38–43}}&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt; Wenzel's conclusion supported other historians' claims that they reflect a regional cultural phenomenon rather than belonging to a particular religious faith.&lt;ref name="Textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fine |first=John V. A. |author-link=John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr. |title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest |year=1991 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-08149-7 |page=486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime the inscriptions/motifs do reveal the confessional affiliation of necropolis/deceased to one of the three Church organizations in medieval Bosnia and Zachlumia.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=253}}{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=373}} This interconfessionality of stećci is one of their most remarkable features, and indicates high degree of [[Christianization]] of medieval Bosnian community.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=373}} However, it is considered that there is not enough basis to be perceived as exclusively Christian.{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=80}}

[[Christian Gottlob Wilke]] sought origins of the simbolic motifs in the old Mediterranean spirituali and religious concepts. Đuro Basler in the artistic expression saw some parallels in late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] art, while in simbolic motifs three components; pre-Christian, Christian and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] (i.e. Bogomil).{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=7}} Bešlagić asserted that those who have raised and decorated them were not completely Christianized because they practiced the old custom of putting attachments with the dead, and many artefacts made of metals, textiles, ceramics and skin, coins, earrings of silver, gilded silver and solid gold have been found in graves beneath stećci.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=338}} The customs like placing coin in mouth ([[Charon's obol]]),{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=245}} and placing drinking vessel near graves and heads, are from antique time.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=338}} Tomb pits were mostly used for one burial, but sometime were for two and more. Based on one stećak inscription in Montenegro, Bešlagić argued that there was a pre-Christian custom of re-burial, in which the bones were washed and returned to the pit.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=245–246}}

===Ethnic origin===
The ethnic identity of the stećci has not yet been fully clarified. Until now the most dominant, but still not fully accepted,{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=327}} theory relates them with the autochthonous [[Vlachs in medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina|Vlach]] communities in the Balkan.{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=322}}{{sfn|Kurtović|2013|p=2}} Opponents of this theory consider that their demographic number was too small, were profane and isolated, argue that the Vlachs did not built them from the fall of [[Western Roman Empire]], or that mythological symbols are related to Old Slavic rather than "Vlach" pagan beliefs.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=252}}

Bešlagić and others related them to formation of Bosnian Kingdom and especially Bogomils, however the shortage of this theory is in the fact Bosnian Kingdom existence was presumably too short for change in folk tradition, Bosnian Church existed later and ended sooner than stećci, Bosnian Church area of influence can not explain them in littoral and Serbian lands, other Bogomils did not built them, many necropolises are located around contemporary church ruins as well some stećci were secondarily embedded into churches and mosques,{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=48}} and that the Bogomils did not respect the simbol of [[Christian cross|cross]] yet on the stećci it is very common.{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=252}}

Some other scholars proposed unconvincing and rejected theories; [[Ivo Pilar]] (1918) ideologically argued Croatian origin of medieval Bosnia,{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=37–38}} later [[Dominik Mandić]] considered them to be part of the ritual of burial by the pagan Croats from the [[Red Croatia]], Ante Škobalj similarly argued the Croatian theory,{{sfn|Purgarić-Kužić|1995|p=252}} Vaso Glušac ideologically argued Serbian-Orthodox origin of both Bosnian Church and stećci,{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=37}} while Vladislav Skarić considered they have represented Old Slavic "eternal home", and that initially were built from wood.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=7}} [[Vladimir Ćorović]] pointed out that the "Old Slavs have not used monoliths or larger blocks of stone to make their apartments, let alone for the grave signs. Even the less for their writing or decorations".{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=332}}

====Vlachs====
[[File:Bosnia Bogomil Tombstone 1901.jpg|thumb|250px|Broken stećak depicted by [[Hugo Charlemont]], 1901.]]
The autochthonous Vlachian theory was proposed by Bogumil Hrabak (1956) and Marian Wenzel (1962), and more recently was supported by the archeological and anthropological researches of skeleton remains from the graves under stećci.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=8}} However, the theory is much older and was first proposed by [[Arthur Evans]] in his work ''Antiquarian Researches in Illyricum'' (1883). While doing research with [[Felix von Luschan]] on stećak graves around [[Konavle]] found out that a large number of skulls weren't of Slavic origin yet similar to older Illyrian and [[Arbanasi people|Arbanasi]] tribes, as well noted that [[Dubrovnik]] memorials recorded those parts to be inhabited by the Vlachs until the 15th century.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=322}}

Hrabak was the first scholar to connect the historical documents and their relation to the persons mentioned on rare inscriptions on the stećci. In 1953 he concluded that the smith-stonemason Grubač from Boljun necropolis near [[Stolac]] built stećak of Bogavac Tarah Bol(j)unović not later than 1477, and that most of the monuments of Herzegovinian Vlachs, and not only Herzegovian and not only Vlachs,{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=118}} could be dated to the second half of the 15th century.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=322}} Wenzel in one of her studies researched sixteen stećci with similar dating and historically known persons. She noted the possibility that initially the stone monuments as such could have been introduced by the feudal nobility in the mid 14th century, which tradition was embraced by the Vlach tribes who introduced figural decoration.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=322}}{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=118}} The termination of the stećci production Wenzel related to the Ottoman invasion and new social circumstances, with the transition of Vlachs and near Slavs to Islam resulting with loss of tribal organization and characteristics of specific ethnic identity.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=8}}{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=322}}

[[Sima Ćirković]] (1964) and [[Marko Vego]] (1973) argued that the emergence of the stećci among Vlachs coincides with their social-economical rise, confirmed in region of [[Zachlumia]] where is located the most well known necropolis of [[Radimlja]] related to the Vlachian family Miloradović-Stjepanović from genus Hrabreni.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=72}} Financial possibilities of ordering such expensive ways of burial among Vlachs are supported and confirmed in the historical documents, with an example of Vlach from Cetina, Ostoja Bogović, who in 1377 paid the cost of burial of Vlach Priboja Papalić for 40 [[Lira|libra]]. At the time burial in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] costed 4-8 libra, while for a sum of 40 libra could be bought family grave in the church of Franciscan order in [[Šibenik]].{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=45}}{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=323}}

Benac concluded that the distribution of the stećci in the lands right of the Cetina river coast in the parts of Dalmatian [[Zagora (Croatia)|Zagora]], while their absence in the lands left of the river (with graveyards along Early Middle Age churches), show these tombstones in those parts belonged to the Vlachian communities.{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=321}} The triangle between [[Šibenik]], [[Trogir]] and [[Knin]], as well surroundings of [[Vrlika]] and [[Trilj]], which were the main centers of Vlachs, have the most number of stećci in Dalmatia.{{sfn|Milošević|2013|p=90}} In 1982, Benac noted that the highest concentration of them is in South Herzegovina (territory of [[Trebinje]], [[Bileća]], [[Ljubinj]] and [[Stolac]]), where was high concentration of Vlach population. Some of the stećci inscriptions (by anthroponyms) clearly relate them to some Vlachian chieftains; Tarah Boljunović from Boljun-Stolac, Vukosav Vlaćević from [[Vlahovići]]-Lubinje, Hrabreni and Miloradović in Radimlja-Stolac,{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=323}} as well other distinctive members from Vlach groups like Bobani, Pliščići, Predojevići, [[Drobnjaci]]{{sfn|Kurtović|2015|p=316}} and to such chieftains belong finest monuments.{{sfn|Kurtović|2013|p=12}}

The occurrence of stećci in the Cetina county is related to the [[Nelipić noble family]] efforts to return economic and political power to whom was confiscated [[Knin]] in 1345 by king [[Louis I of Hungary]] in exchange for [[Sinj]] and Cetina county. They thrived with the support from the Vlachs, who for the service were rewarded with benefits and common [[Vlach law]].{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=40}} After many conflicts and death of last noble Nelipić, then [[Ivan Frankopan]], Vlachs supported [[Stjepan Vukčić Kosača]].{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=52–53}} The ridge stećci of ''Dalmatian type'' can be found only in regions of Dalmatia and Southwestern Bosnia, parts ruled by the [[Kosača noble family]]. It was in his interest to settle militant and well organized Vlachs in the most risky part of his realm, to defend from Talovac forces in Cetina and Venice forces in [[Republic of Poljica|Poljica]] and the coast. Thus Dalmatian type is found only West and South of Kosača capital [[Imotski]], and later also North after [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|fall of Bosnia]].{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=54}}

Anthropological research in 1982 on skeletons from 108 stećak graves (13-14th century) from Raška Gora near [[Mostar]], as well some from [[Grborezi]] near [[Livno]], shown homogeneity of the serials with clean [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]] anthropological type, without other admixtures, indicating non-Slavic origin, yet autochthonous Vlachian population.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=323}} The research of 11 skeletons from necropolis at Pavlovac near [[Prača (Pale-Prača)|Prača]], often attributed to the [[Pavlović noble family]], also shown clean Dinaric type, indicating Vlachian origin, although historical sources don't call Pavlovići as Vlachs.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=326}} The anthropological research in 1991 on the 40 skeletons from 28 burials (dated 1440-1450s) beneath stećci at plateau Poljanice near the village of [[Bisko]] showed that the vast majority of the population belonged to the autochthonous Dinaric type, concluding they were anthropologically of non-Slavic origin.{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=322}} 21 skeleton belonged to child burial, while of 19 adult burials 13 belonged to males.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=35}} The [[quarry]] for stećci was found in the Northwestern part of the plateau, with one ridge as semi-finished work without any ornament.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=37}}

Archeologically, some Middle Age burials from Cetina county have local specifics by which Cetina county differs from other parts of Dalmatia. In the county the burials weren't done in the ground without additional stone architecture. Some scholars related this phenomenon to the specific ethnic identity, however due to still groundbreaking research for now is considered only regional and narrow local occurrence.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=35}}

==Legacy==
One of their enigma is the fact they were not mentioned in local and foreign medieval documents. Franciscan chronicles which recorded many unusual things, like Turkish cemetery, did not mention them.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=30–32}} Folk tradition preserved mythical perception full of superstitions and fantasy tales. It implies that occurred discontinuity of historical memory among all three ethnic groups, caused by ethnic migrations and religious conversions during the Ottoman occupation.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=31}} It is considered that the first [[Travel literature|itinerary]] mention of stećci is by [[Benedikt Kuripešić]] from 1530.{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=75}} [[Evliya Çelebi]] in 1626 described them as tombstone monuments of some unknown heroes.{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=75}} The oldest local author to mention them is [[Andrija Kačić Miošić]] in the mid-18th century.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=30}} [[Alberto Fortis]] in his work ''Travels into Dalmatia'' (1774) recorded them in [[Romanticist]] spirit of the time as described the tombstones in Cetina as warrior graves of the giants.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=39}}{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=75}} They also attracted attention by [[Aleksander Antoni Sapieha]], [[Ami Boué]], Otto Blau, [[John Gardner Wilkinson]] and Heinrich Sterneck.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=30}}

Since the second half of the 19th century, stećci are seen as a symbol of Bosnia and Herzegovina,&lt;ref name="Textbook"/&gt; being objects of South Slavic ideological ethno-national building myths and ownership,{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=115}} as well different opinions on their archaeological, artistic and historical interpretation.&lt;ref name="Unesco2016"/&gt; Although both Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian nationalism tried to annex them to their own culture, paradoxally, none of the three ethnic groups ([[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serbs]] and [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Croats]]) in Bosnia and Herzegovina originally remember them in their collective consciousness, leaving them to nature or human destruction (which at least halved the number{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=36}}), implying the annexation was based on constructions.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=28–38, 368}} Specifically, the thesis about the Bogomil origin of the stećci leaned along the theory of Bogomil origin of the Bosnian Muslims i.e. Bosniaks, which ideologisation and distortion of history was criticized by many scholars, and some like Wenzel stated that "thus stećci were given as a gift to Muslims, emphasizing their inheritance rights to the land and implying that the later Christians, comparatively, were the 'newcomers'".{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=35}} The [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995) caused a resurgence of Bogomil theory in public papers which sought historial-political legitimacy, ideologically aspired that Islamization was not only caused by Ottoman occupation yet it was an event dependent on Bogomils, and thus affirmed ethnical and confessional difference between Bogomil population and population of Catholic and Orthodox confession.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=43–46}} However, it did not make a significant influence on scientific thinking and comparative research.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=46–48}}

Europe's first public presentation of the gravestones is attributed to Russian immigrant and Yugoslav diplomat of Polish origin, [[Alexander Soloviev (historian)|Alexander Soloviev]] (1890-1971). He apparently wrote about them in the accompanying prospectus of Paris exhibition "Medieval art of the people of Yugoslavia" (1950).{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=75}} First regional public presentation was held in 2008 at [[Klovićevi Dvori Gallery]], and represented an example of encouraging public dialogue between four nations.{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=79}} They have influenced different art forms and were inspirational theme for sculptors, painters, poets, filmmakers, writers and photographers.&lt;ref name="Unesco2016"/&gt;

==Notable Stećci==
[[File:Grd3.jpg|thumb|250px|The inscription on stećak of [[Grdeša]] from the 12th century, considered the oldest one found.{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=62}}]]

Stećci are commonly concentrated in groups: in cemeteries of individual families with few specimens, in cemeteries of whole families with approximately 30 up to 50 specimens, big necropolis of rural [[Opština|districts]] occasionally with several hundred specimens. Examples of family necropolis are those by [[Sanković noble family|Sanković]] in village Biskup near [[Konjic]], by Miloradović-Stjepanović (Hrabreni) in [[Radimlja]] near [[Stolac]], by [[Pavlović noble family|Pavlović]] near [[Sarajevo]], and by unknown family at Donja Zgošća near [[Kakanj]].{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=372}} Today many Stećci are also displayed in the garden of the [[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in Sarajevo. The medieval [[Mramorje (Perućac)|Mramorje]] necropolis in [[Serbia]] is part of [[Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance]] and contains large number of stećak tombs.&lt;ref name="SANU" &gt;{{CHS-SANU|Link=525|Name=Некропола стећака}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other notable or studied individual stećci:

* It is considered that the oldest known stećak is that of [[Grdeša]], a 12th-century [[župan]] of [[Trebinje]].{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=74}}{{sfn|Lovrenović|2013|p=63}}
* It is considered that the oldest known stećak with inscription is that of Marija, wife of priest Dabiživ, with inscribed number and presumed year-date 1231, from Vidoštak near Stolac.{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=74}}
* [[Vlatko Vuković|Vlatko Vuković Kosača]]'s grave lies marked near the village of Boljuni near [[Stolac]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the late 14th century. The inscription on the grave was written in [[Bosnian Cyrillic]] in [[Ikavian accent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Šimić|first=Marinka|title=Jezik Boljunskih Natpisa|url=http://www.post.ba/download/boljuni.pdf|publisher=Staroslavenski institut}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The two ridge stećci which belonged to Bogumil Jerko Kustražić and his wife Vladna from the mid 15th century, in [[Cista Provo|Cista]] near [[Imotski]], and [[Split, Croatia]]{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=54, 62}}
* The ridge stećak of Vlkoj Bogdanić (son of Radmil) who died in battle in the mid 15th century, made by mason Jurina, in [[Lovreć]], Croatia{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=54, 62}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4409">[[Australian]] [[composer]] [[Malcolm Williamson]] wrote his '''Symphony No. 7''' in 1984 to a joint commission from the Chamber Youth Strings of Melbourne and the [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]], [[Australia]]. It was written mostly at the composer's home in [[Sandon, Hertfordshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;''Malcolm Williamson: A 70th Birthday Tribute'' (Paul Conway)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Work==

[[Malcolm Williamson|Williamson]] was commissioned to write his Seventh Symphony by Dr Alexandra E. Cameron in 1984 on behalf of the Chamber Youth Strings of [[Melbourne]]. The piece originally had a dual purpose: to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]], and to give the youth orchestra a showpiece to take on a European tour in 1985. Williamson enjoyed long and fruitful relationships with youth orchestras and other organisations throughout his long career, and also wrote his '''Symphony No. 5 ''Aquerò''''', the '''Little Mass of St. Bernadette''' and the ballet '''Heritage''' for young players, singers and dancers respectively. The score is dedicated to the memory of a long-time friend of Williamson's who died a year after the work's composition, Dr. Derek Goldfoot, husband of soprano Sybil Michelow (a staunch advocate of Williamson's vocal music).&lt;ref&gt;''Malcolm Williamson: A 70th Birthday Tribute'' (Paul Conway)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first performance of the symphony was planned for 10 January 1985 at [[Australia House]] in [[London]], but in the event only three of the four movements were played (the scherzo was omitted). This was due to the challenging nature of the music, which meant it was not possible for the youth orchestra to rehearse all the movements sufficiently in time. The first complete performance of the symphony was given by the Chamber Youth Strings of Melbourne in the Irving Hall of the Lauriston Girls' School, [[Melbourne]], on 12 August 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Malcolm Williamson: A Mischievous Muse'' (Paul Harris &amp; Anthony Meredith)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes on the Symphony==

Since part of the commission for the '''Symphony No. 7''' was to celebrate the 150th anniversary of [[Victoria (Australia)|The State of Victoria]], [[Malcolm Williamson|Williamson]] decided to take Australian landscape and culture as the basis of his [[symphony]], not unlike the '''Symphony No. 6''' of 1982.&lt;ref&gt;''Malcolm Williamson: A 70th Birthday Tribute'' (Paul Conway)&lt;/ref&gt; Although each movement has a separate impetus behind it, the whole work is unified by the idea of (in the composer's words) "the unforeseen cross-pollination of ethnic groups that has enriched Australian life".&lt;ref&gt;SIGCD053&lt;/ref&gt; This "cross-pollination" is represented by a portrait of the [[Kelly Gang]] in the first movement (illuminating the strong [[Irish people|Irish]] connection), [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] dances in the [[scherzo]] (highlighting the thriving Macedonian community of [[Melbourne]]), and further [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] references in the finale. A celebration of the vivid landscape of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is most overt in the introverted third movement, an eight-minute lament of great poise capturing the majesty of the [[Dandenongs]] and [[Wilsons Promontory]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Meredith, p.404&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The [[symphony]] is broken up into four clearly defined [[Movement (music)|movements]], as follows:

*'''''I.''''' ''Andante - Allegro vivo - Andante''
*'''''II.''''' ''Allegro molto''
*'''''III.''''' ''Andante''
*'''''IV.''''' ''Allegro maestoso ma non troppo''&lt;ref&gt;SIGCD053&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orchestration==

Williamson's Seventh [[Symphony]] requires the least resources of all his symphonies. Unlike the massive [[orchestral]] Sixth Symphony ''Liturgy of Homage'' (1982) or the [[choral]]-[[orchestral]] Third Symphony ''The Icy Mirror'' of 1973, the Seventh Symphony is scored for [[string orchestra]] only (consisting of [[violins]], [[violas]], [[celli]] and [[double basses]]). This gives the work its unique sense of [[chamber music|chamber]]-like intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;SIGCD053&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Agnew Clinic''''' (or ''The Clinic of Dr. Agnew'') is an 1889 [[oil painting]] by American artist [[Thomas Eakins]]. It was commissioned to honor anatomist and surgeon [[David Hayes Agnew]], on his retirement from teaching at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

==Background==
[[File:EakinsTheGrossClinic.jpg|thumb|left|175px|''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' (1875). Comparing ''The Agnew Clinic'' with Eakins's earlier darker treatment of the same subject illustrates the evolving understanding of surgical hygiene during the intervening 14 years.]]

''The Agnew Clinic'' depicts Dr. Agnew performing a partial [[mastectomy]] in a medical [[amphitheater]]. He stands in the left foreground, holding a [[scalpel]]. Also present are Dr. [[J. William White]], applying a bandage to the patient; Dr. Joseph Leidy (nephew of paleontologist [[Joseph Leidy]]), taking the patient's pulse; and Dr. Ellwood R. Kirby, administering [[anesthetic]]. In the background, the operating room nurse, Mary Clymer, and [[University of Pennsylvania]] medical school students observe. Eakins placed himself in the painting – he is the rightmost of the pair behind the nurse – although the actual painting of him is attributed to his wife, [[Susan Macdowell Eakins]].&lt;ref name=Upenn/&gt; The painting, also, records the significant transition, in just 14 years, from the earlier ''status quo'' – the participants' black frock coats represented in ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' (1875) – to the "[[white coat]]s" of 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, "Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress", ''Fashion Theory'', (2015), pp.1–23. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653 doi=10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is Eakins's largest work.&lt;ref name=Schatzki&gt;Stefan C. Schatzki. "[https://www.ajronline.org/doi/pdf/10.2214/ajr.160.5.8470607 The Agnew Clinic]." The American Journal of Roentgenology. Volume 160, Issue 5, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It was commissioned for $750 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|750|1889}}}} today) in 1889 by three undergraduate classes at the University of Pennsylvania, to honor Dr. Agnew on the occasion of his retirement.&lt;ref name=Schatzki/&gt; The painting was completed quickly, in three months, rather than the year that Eakins took for ''[[The Gross Clinic]]''. Eakins carved a Latin inscription into the painting's frame. Translated, it says: "D. Hayes Agnew M.D. Most experienced surgeon, clearest writer and teacher, most venerated and beloved man."&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, 396.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/gmbernstein/2413993814/ Agnew Clinic with frame] from Flickr.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
{{TheAgnewClinic|size=300px|caption=Roll cursor over figures for their names.}}

The work is a prime example of Eakins's [[scientific realism]]. The rendering is almost photographically precise – so much so that art historians have been able to identify everyone depicted in the painting, with the exception of the patient.&lt;ref name=Upenn&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1800s/1889med/agnewclinic.html Medical Class of 1889 and Thomas Eakins' painting of "The Agnew Clinic"]. University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center.&lt;/ref&gt; It largely repeats the subject of Eakins's earlier ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' (1875), seen at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. The painting echoes the subject and treatment of [[Rembrandt]]'s famous ''[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'' (1632) (in the [[Mauritshuis]] museum in [[The Hague]], the [[Netherlands]]), and other earlier depictions of public surgery such as the frontispiece of [[Vesalius|Andreas Vesalius]]'s ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (1543), the ''Quack Physicians' Hall'' (''c.'' 1730) by the Dutch artist [[Egbert van Heemskerck]], and the fourth scene in [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty]]'' (1751).

== Mary V. Clymer ==
Students of the medical class of 1889 who commissioned The Agnew Clinic are portrayed as the audience for the surgery—as historian Amanda Mahoney&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=pennalumni|title="The Agnew Clinic: Through the Eyes of a Nurse" (Penn Homecoming 2009)|date=November 12, 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI-CpBpQATo|accessdate=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out, all individuals depicted in the work can be identified by name, except for the patient—and this audience of male medical students creates a composition that highlights power dynamics between the masculine and the feminine in the academic medical hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Central to the medical care of the patient yet separate in her femininity stands the woman in white—the nurse, Mary Clymer, who serves as the surgeon Agnew's "structural counterpart" in the composition of the painting, the only other figure on the same level as the surgeon.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mc_2_B4iNcUC|title=The Female Body: Figures, Styles, Speculations|last=Fryer|first=Judith|date=1991|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472064770|location=|pages=237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credited by the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) as the first trained operating room nurse in Philadelphia, Mary V. Clymer was born in Mercer County, New Jersey, in 1861 to a prominent Civil War veteran.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the age of 28, Clymer enrolled in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Training School for Nurses.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nursing.upenn.edu/history/archives-collections/mary-clymer-collection/|title=Bates Center Finding Aid Mary V. Clymer papers|last=|first=|date=|website=Barbara Bates Center for The Study of The History of Nursing|access-date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1889 at the top of her class,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Clymer was among the first graduates of HUP's nurse training school, which was established in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nursing.upenn.edu/about/history/|title=History|website=www.nursing.upenn.edu|language=en|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clymer was the recipient of the Nightingale Award for her exceptional patient care and scholarship.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fittingly, Clymer missed her graduation ceremony from the Training School because she was providing emergency care to victims of the 1889 Williamsport flood&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some art historians read Clymer's presence in the painting as sympathetic to the female patient: Clymer looks down at the objectified female figure and feels connection with another body separate from the male-dominated hospital hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Athens|first=Elizabeth|date=July 2006|title=Knowledge and Authority and Thormas Eakin's 'The Agnew Clinic'|jstor=20074493|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=148|pages=482–485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Clymer's presence challenges this dynamic: Clymer’s presence demonstrates the increasing technical advancements within nursing and medicine, her placement in the scene is a nod to the contributions to sanitation and organization that nurses brought to the operating room.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Clymer may not look down at the female figure in sympathy but with the cool attention of a trained operating room nurse, one who closely monitors her patient’s status and anticipates the needs of the surgical team.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Founded in 1878 and opened in 1886, the HUP Training School for Nursing engaged nursing students in rigorous hands-on and lecture-based learning.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/internal-newsletters/hupdate/2010/september/a-cornerstone-of-nursing-education-hups-schoo|title=A Cornerstone of Nursing Education: HUP's School of Nursing – PR News|website=www.pennmedicine.org|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first month of nursing training, "probationers" began their nursing education providing dietary and cleaning services at the hospital.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As they progressed through their nursing education, trainee nurses learned nursing skills on the floor of the hospital and participated in lectures given by physicians at the university hospital.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At HUP, Clymer received training through clinical experience providing patient care and lectures presented by the hospital's physicians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Between 1887 and 1889, Mary Clymer kept diaries that included clinical and lecture notes that have been preserved through the Barbara Bates Center for the Study of the History of Nursing archives. Clymer's diaries reveal daily nursing tasks, practical knowledge learned, and the occasional student's gripe--"Am not learning anything new."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/medren/9914651853503681|title=Lecture Notes c. 1887–1889.|last=Clymer|first=Mary|date=October 2017|website=Archives of the Barbara Bates Center for the History of Nursing|page=69r V.1|access-date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clymer's notes reveal Eakins’ artistic license in the depiction of the mastectomy in The Agnew Clinic—Clymer wrote that, when preparing a patient for operation, one must cover the healthy breast and reveal the affected breast;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/medren/9914651853503681|title=Lecture Notes c. 1887–1889|last=Clymer|first=Mary|date=October 2017|website=Archives of the Barbara Bates Center for the History of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania|access-date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is confirmed in Agnew's own writings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Eakins’ choice to leave the patient nude may have been for shock value, to clarify the nature of the depicted procedure, or to simply fulfill the artist's desire to portray a nude female figure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Controversy==
''The Agnew Clinic'' is one of Eakins's most hotly debated works.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick, 390"&gt;Kirkpatrick, 390.&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to portray a partially nude woman observed by a roomful of men (even though they were doctors, and in an undeniably medical setting) was controversial. It was rejected for exhibition at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in 1891, and at New York's [[Society of American Artists]] in 1892. Its exhibition at Chicago's 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] was criticized.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick, 390"/&gt;

Eakins made preparatory sketches for ''The Agnew Clinic'' – a drawing of Dr. David Hayes Agnew, an oil study of Agnew, and a compositional sketch for the entire work. Individual studies of all 33 figures were probably made, but none are known to survive.

Eakins later painted a black and white version, specifically to be photographed and reproduced as a [[photogravure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/69110.html?mulR=30795 Philadelphia Museum of Art Website]&lt;/ref&gt; His friend and protégé, [[Samuel Murray]], modeled a statuette of Eakins at work on the painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/objectview.aspx?oid=20011993 Thomas Eakins by Samuel Murray] from Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, ''The Agnew Clinic'' was on loan from the University of Pennsylvania to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;ref name=Upenn/&gt;

'''''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time''''' is a play by [[Simon Stephens]] based on [[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time|the novel of the same name]] by [[Mark Haddon]]. During its premiere run, the play tied the record for winning the most [[Olivier Awards]] (seven), including [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play|Best New Play]] at the [[2013 Laurence Olivier Awards|2013 ceremony]] (this record was surpassed by ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'' in [[2017 Laurence Olivier Awards|2017]] with 9 wins).

The play premiered on 2 August 2012 in the Cottesloe Theatre at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in [[London]] before transferring to the [[Apollo Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] on 12 March 2013. The production won 7 [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Awards]] in 2013 (including [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play|Best New Play]]), at the time equaling the record with ''[[Matilda the Musical]]'' in 2012, before both were surpassed by ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'' in 2017 with 9 awards. During a performance on 19 December 2013, the ceiling of the Apollo Theatre collapsed causing the production to close. It reopened on 9 July 2014 at the [[Gielgud Theatre]]. The play closed at the Gielgud on 3 June 2017.

The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production debuted at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on 5 October 2014 and closed on 4 September 2016. It won the 2015 [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play]], 2015 [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] Outstanding New Broadway Play, the 2015 [[Drama League Award]] for Outstanding Production of a Broadway or Off-Broadway Play, and the 2015 [[Tony Award for Best Play]].

The story concerns a mystery surrounding the death of a neighbour's dog that is investigated by young Christopher Boone, who has an [[autism spectrum]] condition, and his relationships with his parents and school mentor. The play reworked the source material by changing its voice and presenting the story as a [[play-within-a-play]]. The play has received a generally warm reception, with most critics impressed by its ability to convey the point of view of the young protagonist and the compassion of his school mentor. Critics also generally spoke highly of the visual effects employed during the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Plot==
The play involves a significant reworking of the source material. Rather than present the story in the [[first-person narrative]] as the original novel did, the play is presented as a reading of Boone's own writing, read aloud in segments by his teacher.&lt;ref name=BMG/&gt;&lt;ref name=TCIotDJtB/&gt; The result is that the play is presented as a [[play-within-a-play]].&lt;ref name=TCIotDinNMIWtB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/2600953/curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time-broadway-play-alexander-sharp/|title=The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time Makes Its Way to Broadway|accessdate=17 October 2014|date=8 October 2014|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|author=Green, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is about a 15-year-old amateur detective named Christopher John Francis Boone who is a mathematical genius.  He appears to have an unspecified [[autism spectrum]] disorder that is variously described as either [[autism]]&lt;ref name=PtGoSO/&gt; or [[Asperger's Syndrome]],&lt;ref name=ACIos&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/25/curious-tale-dog-night-time|title=A Curious Incident on stage|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=25 July 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Costa, Maddy}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the condition is never explicitly stated in the play.&lt;ref name=TNTHIM&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/arts/08iht-lon08.html|title=The National Theatre Hits Its Mark|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=7 August 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Wolf, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The titular curious incident is the mystery surrounding the death of a neighbour's dog, Wellington, found speared by a garden fork.&lt;ref name=TNTHIM/&gt;

While searching for the murderer of the dog, he encounters resistance from many neighbours, but mostly from his father, Ed Boone. Christopher argues to himself that many rules are made to be broken, so he continues to search for an answer; he compares himself to [[Sherlock Holmes]]. When he discovers that his father had both lied about his mother's death for several years and killed Wellington, Christopher is distraught and fears for his own life. For the first time, he travels alone to London to find and live with his mother. He finds the journey overstimulating and stressful, but succeeds and is welcomed by his mother. However, his ambitions lead him back to [[Swindon]], where he wants to sit an [[GCE Advanced Level|A Level]] mathematics exam. Christopher achieves the best possible result and gradually reconciles with his father.

In a short scene after the curtain call, Christopher reappears to brilliantly solve his "favourite question" from the mathematics exam.

==Critical response==

===West End===
[[Lyn Gardner]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote a rave review, commenting that "There are times when the show comes perilously close to sentimentality, but the clarity of Christopher's gaze is so unflinching that it often makes you uncomfortable, and the show is equally clear-eyed on the difficulties of parenting, messiness of life, and torment of a child who cannot bear to be touched. ... Leading a fine cast, Luke Treadaway is superb as Christopher, appealing and painful to watch, like the show itself."&lt;ref name=TCIotDitNTrTG&gt;{{cite news |last= Gardner |first= Lyn |authorlink= Lyn Gardner |title= The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time – review |work= [[The Guardian]] |location= London |publisher= Guardian News and Media |date= 13 March 2013 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/13/curious-incident-dog-night-time-review |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susannah Clapp]], of ''[[The Observer]]'', wrote in 2013, "''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time'' was one of the most original shows and startling successes at the [[Royal National Theatre|National]] last year. It's hard to recall the surprise of this... Yet it at first seemed unlikely that Mark Haddon's novel about a boy with a mathematical gift and 'behavioural problems' could possibly work in the theatre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Clapp |first= Susannah |title= The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time; A Midsummer Night's Dream; Untold Stories – review |work= [[The Observer]] |date= 16 March 2013 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/17/curious-incident-midsummer-untold-review |accessdate= 20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Taylor of ''[[The Independent]]'' described the work as an "imaginative adaptation" and "brilliant production" saying that it was presented in a "fresh and arresting light" while balancing humor and tragedy. Taylor judged Treadaway's performance superlative citing, among other things, his rhythm, movements and delivery.&lt;ref name= "Taylor"&gt;{{cite news |last= Taylor |first= Paul |title= The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Apollo Theatre, London |work= [[The Independent]] |location= London |date= 15 March 2013 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-nighttime-apollo-theatre-london-8535852.html |accessdate= 20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Wolf of ''[[The New York Times]]'' added that the play's debut was well-timed in relation to the [[2012 London Summer Olympics]]: "its triumphalist spirit tallies exactly with the mood of this summer's athletic aspirations".&lt;ref name=TNTHIM/&gt;

[[Ben Brantley]], the chief theatre critic of ''The New York Times'', wrote: "As directed by Marianne Elliott, working with an inspired set of designers, Christopher's maiden voyage into an alien metropolis becomes a virtuoso study in sensory overload. Those lights, noises, street signs, road maps, random words that spell themselves into being, and, oh yes, that moving staircase that materializes out of nowhere: it all keeps coming at you". Brantley went on to say that the "extraordinary accomplishment" of the play "is that it forces you to look at the world through Christopher's order-seeking eyes. In doing so you're likely to reconsider the dauntless battle your own mind is always waging against the onslaught of stimuli that is life. Scary, isn't it? Exhilarating too." Brantley found fault, however, with "having Siobhan ... recite the story he has written, presented as a school project. Ms. Cusack does this with a gushy, artificial sense of wonder that you associate with grown-ups talking to small children ... Yuck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Brantley |first= Ben |authorlink= Ben Brantley |title= Unnerved, Like All of Us, by Life's Strangeness: ''Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time'' in London |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= 13 March 2013 |url= http://theater.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/theater/reviews/curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time-in-london.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |accessdate= 20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Spencer (journalist)|Charles Spencer]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', on the other hand, thought that Siobhan's turning the book Christopher writes into a play "may sound cumbersome but it works superbly".  Like others, Spencer praised Treadaway: "He is unbearably poignant in moments of distress when he kneels with his face on the ground and moans, but also movingly captures the character's courage, his brilliance at mathematics, and his startling perspectives on the world ... thanks to Treadaway's pained honesty and twitchy awkwardness, as well as his moments of exultant joy, Christopher Boone feels like both a hero and a friend, though the happy ending is rightly qualified." Spencer also praised Gleason and Cusack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Spencer |first= Charles |title= The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Apollo Theatre, review |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 13 March 2013 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/9927821/The-Curious-Incident-of-the-Dog-in-the-Night-Time-Apollo-Theatre-review.html |accessdate= 20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadway===
[[Richard Zoglin]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the play as "a demonstration of the power of theater to transport us to exotic places".&lt;ref name=BMG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3475874/curious-incident-dog-night-time-theater-review/|title=Broadway Mind Games: The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time|accessdate=17 October 2014|date=6 October 2014|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Zoglin, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Suskin]], drama critic for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', said the play entertains, illuminates, and brings us to an exalted new place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-suskin/stage-alchemy-brilliant-a_b_5936918.html|title=Stage Alchemy, Brilliant as Stars|accessdate=17 October 2014|date=5 October 2014|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|author=Suskin, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Green (journalist)|Adam Green]] of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' says the play is "a testament to the singular power of theater".&lt;ref name=TCIotDinNMIWtB/&gt; Brantley, in his review of the New York production, called the work "manipulative", writing that it "retunes the way you see and hear" by forcing you to embrace a heightened sensory perception along with the main protagonist.&lt;ref name=PtGoSO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/theater/the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time-opens-on-broadway.html|title=Plotting the Grid of Sensory Overload: ''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time'' Opens on Broadway|accessdate=15 October 2014|date=5 October 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Brantley, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elysa Gardner of ''[[USA Today]]'' described the experience of viewing the play as a journey "inside Christopher's gifted, troubled mind using inventive visual and sonic effects".&lt;ref name=Gardner&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/theater/2014/10/05/broadway-review-the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-nighttime/16637669/|title=A boy's life, fears transcended in 'Curious Incident'|accessdate=15 October 2014|date=5 October 2014|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Gardner, Elysa}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lauded Sharp's "movement, expressions and voice making the boy's terrors and his ferocious intelligence seem equally natural".&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt;

Peter Marks of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised the visual graphics of the show as being better presented than the "textual and performance elements" noting that the working of Boone's brain upstaged the detective work of finding the killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/10/05/broadways-bountifully-imaginative-curious-incident/|title=Broadway's bountifully imaginative ‘Curious Incident’|accessdate=15 October 2014|date=5 October 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Marks, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Farrar of the [[Associated Press]] thought the show a "charming, intricately choreographed and dynamic theatrical experience" and that Alex Sharp's presentation of Christopher exemplifies the life skill of overcoming personal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://news.yahoo.com/review-bways-curious-incident-dazzling-002143791.html|title=Review: B'way's 'The Curious Incident' is dazzling|accessdate=15 October 2014|date=5 October 2014|agency=[[Associated Press]]|author=Farrar, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'''s Jeremy Gerard felt that the production combines the obsessed math prodigy element of ''[[A Beautiful Mind (book)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' with the mentoring compassion of ''[[Billy Elliot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/broadway-curious-incident-a-brilliant-mash-up-of-billy-elliot-beautiful-mind-846310/|title=Broadway: ''Curious Incident'' a Brilliant Mash-Up of ''Billy Elliot, Beautiful Mind''|accessdate=15 October 2014|date=5 October 2014|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|author=Gerard, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Dziemianowicz of The ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' found Sharp's performance "dazzling" and "physical and emotionally intense" and praised the design, lighting, music and video displays.&lt;ref name=TCIotDitNtrDN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/curious-incident-dog-night-time-theater-review-article-1.1962441|title=‘The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,’ theater review|accessdate=15 October 2014|date=5 October 2014|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|author=Dziemianowicz, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Teachout]], drama critic for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' dissented, describing the "fantastically elaborate video projections" pejoratively, saying that they are smothering. He felt the show was popular because of the trendy nature of Asperger's syndrome and that it was too reliant on trickery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time-starring-alex-sharp-ian-barford-and-enid-graham-1412905129|title=Lost in (Inner) Space|accessdate=16 October 2014|date=9 October 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Teachout, Terry}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Wall Street Journal'' colleague Stefanie Cohen thought the play suffered from difficulty in adapting the book to the stage.&lt;ref name=TCIotDJtB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time-journeys-to-broadway-1412269508|title='The Curious Incident of the Dog' Journeys to Broadway: The challenges of bringing the best-selling book to the stage|accessdate=16 October 2014|date=2 October 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Cohen, Stefanie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===19th century===
University Circle was known during the early 19th century as Doan’s Corners, after Nathanial Doan, a member of the [[Connecticut Land Company]], who settled his family and started a community here.&lt;ref&gt;http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=UC&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "University Circle" began to take shape in the 1880s. Western Reserve University moved its campus from [[Hudson, Ohio]], to [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]] in 1883. [[Case School of Applied Science]] moved from [[Downtown Cleveland]] to a site next to WRU in 1885.  Their relocation led to the birth of an educational center and the creation of a new community called University Circle, named in part after these new institutions—but also the circular street intersection and trolley turnaround located at [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]] and Doan Brook Boulevard ([[Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard]] today).&lt;ref name="universitycircle15"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.universitycircle.org/uci.aspx?page=15 |title = History |publisher = University Circle |date = October 15, 1957 |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1890s, the Western Reserve School of Design for Women ([[Cleveland Institute of Art]]) moved to University Circle, and the concept of developing a world-class arts and cultural center came to life. The concept became more concrete when [[Jeptha Wade]], a trustee of Western Reserve University, set aside land for the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] to be built in the Circle. The Historical Society ([[Western Reserve Historical Society]]) joined these institutions before the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=UC |work = Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |title =University Circle  |date = July 23, 1997 |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
The Circle began to grow rapidly in the early 20th century. The [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] opened its doors in 1916. By the 1920s and 1930s, 19 educational and cultural institutions were located in the area, from the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]] to the [[Cleveland Hearing &amp; Speech Center|Cleveland Hearing and Speech Center]] to the [[Cleveland Botanical Garden]] and others.

Cleveland's [[college football]] scene began in University Circle through both [[Case Western Reserve Spartans football|Case and Western Reserve football]] teams.   Van Horn Field hosted games against [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]], [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], and [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]].  Famed Notre Dame coach [[Knute Rockne]] made his coaching debut against Case in University Circle in [[1918 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1918]].  In [[1920 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1920]], The [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] played their first ever game in the [[Northern United States|north]] at Van Horn Field against Case. 

The arrival of [[University Hospitals]] in 1931 (founded in 1866) led to health care becoming another center of innovation in University Circle. Less than {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} away from University Hospitals, the [[Cleveland Clinic]] had been serving its patients since 1921. Also in 1931 [[Severance Hall]], home of the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], was constructed at the corner of Euclid and East Boulevard.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; By 1950, 34 institutions had chosen University Circle as their home.&lt;ref name="universitycircle15"/&gt; In 1967, Case School of Applied Science and Western Reserve University confederated to become [[Case Western Reserve University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CWRU |work = Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |title = Case Western Reserve University |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
University Circle remains [[Cleveland]]'s center for cultural, educational, religious, and social-service institutions.  The area is currently undergoing many construction projects with many institutions expanding, and private development of residential and commercial dwellings.  New housing developments in the area have increased the number of year-round residents in the area to an estimated 15,000 as of 2013.&lt;ref name="plainduc1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.cleveland.com/architecture/2013/03/can_university_circle_bring_th.html |title = Can University Circle lure the rich back to Cleveland, acquire a skyline and share the wealth? |location = Cleveland |work = The Plain Dealer |date = March 23, 2013 |accessdate = September 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MoCA) opened its new permanent location in University Circle at the corner of [[U.S. Route 322|Mayfield Road]] and [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland)|Euclid Avenue]].&lt;ref name="plaindmoca1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2012/10/museum_of_contemporary_art_cle_9.html |title = Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland to open permanent home after 44 years on the move |location = Cleveland |work = The Plain Dealer |date = March 23, 2013 |accessdate = October 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public transportation==
[[File:HealthLine 1.jpg|thumb|A [[HealthLine]] [[Bus rapid transit|BRT]] vehicle drives through University Circle passing the [[Allen Memorial Medical Library]].]]
University Circle is served by multiple forms of transportation, including rapid train, bus, [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT), and circulators. Unique from other [[Cleveland]] neighborhoods, it contains two train stops on the [[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority|RTA]]'s [[Red Line (Cleveland)|Red Line]], the [[Little Italy–University Circle (RTA Rapid Transit station)|Little Italy-University Circle Station]] and the [[University Circle (RTA Rapid Transit station)|University Circle-Cedar Rapid Station]]. The CircleLink shuttle service (colloquially known as the "Greenie") provides free public transportation within University Circle. It provides service between the north and south sides of the CWRU campus, from University Circle to Coventry Village, around the CWRU campus and the [[University Hospitals of Cleveland]], and between the [[Urban Child Research Center]] and the main Case campus.&lt;ref name="greenie.case.edu"&gt;http://greenie.case.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  The new BRT [[HealthLine]], which opened on October 24, 2008, is the newest option to the neighborhood, being a major destination on the line along [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]] that connects [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] to [[Louis Stokes Station at Windermere]] in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]]. In a $197 million project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Michelle |last = Jarboe |url = http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2009/11/clevelands_euclid_corridor_pro.html |title = Cleveland's Euclid corridor project has paved the way to economic development |work = The Plain Dealer |location = Cleveland |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid Avenue was rebuilt during construction, with the installation of public art, new lighting, and sidewalks along the entire length of the HealthLine, along with dedicated bus lanes.  There are seven [[HealthLine]] stops in University Circle and runs 24 hours.  Additionally, many bus routes have stops in University Circle, including bus numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, 32, 38, and 48/48A.

==Construction and expansion projects==
University Circle is undergoing $2 billion in construction and renovation projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =  |url = http://www.city-data.com/forum/21052288-post15.html |work = City-Data Forum |title = What is the best urban neighborhood in the Midwest? |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uptown project===
[[File:Cleveland Uptown Apartments University Circle.jpg|thumb|Apartments and Retail in the Uptown construction project]]

The Uptown project is a multi-phase, $150 million-plus retail, entertainment, restaurant and cultural project under development by MRN Ltd. of Cleveland, and sponsored by [[Case Western Reserve University]] and University Circle Inc.  Its location creates a true center to University Circle.

A $44.5 million "Phase I" broke ground on August 2, 2010, creating two mixed-use buildings of 102 apartments above first floor retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Michelle |last = Jarboe |url = http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2010/07/developer_mrn_ltd_to_break_gro.html |title = Developer MRN Ltd. to break ground Monday on Uptown project in University Circle |work = The Plain Dealer |location = Cleveland |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional anchors of the project currently under construction include the $66 million expansion of the [[Cleveland Institute of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2011/11/gund_foundation_and_family_mem.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the $32 million new home for the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland|Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Foreign Office Architects |url = http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/11/moca_cleveland_board_approves.html |title = MOCA Cleveland board approves building new home in University Circle's Uptown development |work = The Plain Dealer |location = Cleveland |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new MOCA is designed by the London architect [[Farshid Moussavi]]. The surrounding pedestrian plaza is designed by [[James Corner|James Corner Field Operations]], the same landscape architecture firm who designed the [[High Line]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/realestate/commercial/cleveland-ignites-job-growth-with-rebuilding-project.html?_r=1 |work = The New York Times |first = Keith |last = Schneider |title = Cleveland Ignites Job Growth With Rebuilding Project |date = November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The $21 million "Phase II" consists of 43 apartments, dormitories for the [[Cleveland Institute of Art]], and retail.  The anchor tenant is a two-story bowling alley, known as Corner Alley.  Completion date was in fall 2014.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2013/05/uptown_project_picks_up_corner.html&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Euclid–East 120th (RTA Rapid Transit station)]] has been relocated to Mayfield Road at East 119th Street.  With a total cost of $17.5 million, it was renamed the Little Italy-University Circle Rapid Station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riderta.com/majorprojects/littleitalyuc&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 2011, the ''[[New York Times]]'' showcased the project with an article entitled "Cleveland Turns Uptown Into New Downtown".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

===Cleveland Museum of Art expansion===
On March 7, 2005 the Cleveland Museum of Art embarked on a multi-year project to renovate and expand into the next century. The project is designed by architect [[Rafael Viñoly]], combining old and new styles. At a total cost of $350 million, it is the largest cultural project in the history of the state of Ohio and one of the most comprehensive renovation and expansion projects in the museum field in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.clevelandart.org/about/the%20building%20project.aspx |title = The Building Project |publisher = The Cleveland Museum of Art |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111103102849/http://www.clevelandart.org/about/the%20building%20project.aspx |archivedate = November 3, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University Hospitals/Case Medical Center expansion===
Three new facilities and structures opened in summer of 2011.  They include the $250 million [[commons:File:Seidman Cancer Center.jpg|Seidman Cancer Center]], $41 million Center for Emergency Medicine, and a $30 million new parking structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.cleveland.com/pdgraphics_impact/photo/14fguhnetworkjpg-9522855e3d84a04c.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Train stations===
Both current University Circle train stations were rehabbed and reconstructed by August 2015.

The [[University Circle (RTA Rapid Transit station)|University Circle-Cedar Rd rapid station]] underwent a complete rehab, using an [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]]-compliant design to include a new rail entry plaza, waiting area, and train loading platform.  A new bus terminal was also constructed on the north side of Cedar Road with a pedestrian connection between the bus terminal and the rail station.  Secured funding included a $10.5 million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and a $2 million grant from the [[Federal Transit Administration]]—totaling $12.5 million in federal funds.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.cleveland.com/sunpress/2011/05/university_circle_rapid_statio_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Euclid–East 120th (RTA Rapid Transit station)|Euclid–East 120th rapid station]] was relocated in conjunction with the Uptown Project to E.119 St and Mayfield Rd.  Funding was received through a $12.5 million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]], via the [[Federal Transit Administration]]. The final cost of the new station was around $17.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/12/post_545.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louis Stokes VA Medical Center expansion===
Totaling a $526 million expansion, this project includes a seven-story administrative office tower, living space for 122 homeless veterans, a 2,000-car parking garage, and a seven-story tower with 222 patient beds.

===Case Western Reserve University expansion===
Two major new construction projects are readying to break ground:
*Tinkham Veale Student Center
*Wyant Field House

In Spring 2012, [[Case Western Reserve University]] campus will undergo the construction of $50 million student center in the center of campus.  It will be known as the Tinkham Veale Student Center designed by [[Ralph Johnson (architect)|Ralph Johnson]] of [[Perkins and Will|Perkins + Will]].  It will encompass  82,000-square-feet, have 24/7 student access, and be environmentally friendly—with a green roof to absorb rainwater and windows designed to prevent excessive heat from sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Steven |last = Litt |url = http://blog.cleveland.com/architecture/2011/10/architect_ralph_johnsons_new_t.html |title = Architect Ralph Johnson's new Tinkham Veale University Center at CWRU will bring 21st-century flair to University Circle |work = The Plain Dealer |location = Cleveland |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second project will be known as the Wyant Field House, enclosing the last open portion of [[DiSanto Field]].  The Wyant Field House will be approximately 24,000 square feet and will serve as a facility for varsity athletes and the 2,500 students who reside at The Village. The facility will include weight training and cardiovascular areas, a Varsity Club lounge, and multipurpose space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.case.edu/case-news/2010/06/07/wyantfieldhouse |title = Case Western Reserve University &amp;#124; News Center |publisher = Blog.case.edu |date = June 7, 2010 |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Little Italy==
[[Image:Cleveland's Little Italy.jpg|thumb|left|One of Little Italy's best known culinary landmarks, Presti's Bakery, sits at the corner of Mayfield and Coltman]]
'''Little Italy''' (known locally as "Murray Hill" or "The Hill")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://clevelandlittleitaly.com/about/ |title = About |publisher = Cleveland Little Italy |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[ethnic neighborhood|ethnic enclave]] that serves as the historic center of Cleveland's [[Italian American]] community. It is located from E. 119th to E. 125th streets on Murray Hill and [[U.S. Route 322|Mayfield]] roads, situated at the eastern city limits, along a long, moderately sloping grade that ascends in elevation approximately 300 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:1205774897574425::NO::P3_FID:1066654 |title = GNIS Detail: Cleveland |publisher = United States Geological Survey |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    It is bounded to the east and south by suburban [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]], to the northeast by [[Lakeview Cemetery]], and to the west by [[CSX]], [[Norfolk Southern]], and [[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority]] [[Red Line (Cleveland)|Red Line]] railroad tracks, which separates it from the rest of University Circle.

===Points and events of interest===
Little Italy is known for its several culinary, historic, and cultural sites. Its biggest attractions are the restaurants, bakeries, and pizzerias.  It is also home to a thriving [[art gallery]] scene and many boutique shops.  The best known historic structure is [[Holy Rosary Church (Cleveland, Ohio)|Holy Rosary Church]] built in 1908.  Culturally, the Alta House is the community center for the neighborhood founded in 1895.  The private elementary and middle school is Montessori Elementary at [[Holy Rosary Church (Cleveland, Ohio)|Holy Rosary Church]].  Tony Brush Park&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universitycircle.org/locations/tony-brush-park&lt;/ref&gt; provides the neighborhoods green space and playgrounds.

[[File:MurrayHillLittleItalyCleveland.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The annual highlight event of Little Italy in Cleveland is the [[Cleveland Feast of the Assumption Festival|Feast of the Assumption]].]]

Each August, the [[Roman Catholic]] congregation of the historic [[Holy Rosary Church (Cleveland, Ohio)|Holy Rosary Church]] celebrates the 4-day festival for the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], in which Little Italy stages Greater Cleveland's [[Cleveland Feast of the Assumption Festival|largest Italian-American street festival]].   Every October, Little Italy hosts the city's [[Columbus Day]] Parade.  The neighborhood enjoys artwalks a few times a year, usually in June, October, and December.

===History===
Little Italy began in 1895 when immigrant Joseph Carabelli saw the need for monument work in Cleveland's [[Lakeview Cemetery]] and established what soon became the city's leading marble and granite works.  Local Cleveland industrial billionaire [[John D. Rockefeller]] took a special liking to the Italian immigrants of the neighborhood and commissioned the building of the community center Alta House, named after his daughter [[Alta Rockefeller Prentice]], in 1900.  Little Italy is also home to the first Italian restaurant to open in the [[State of Ohio]], Guarino's.  The first hand-crank pasta machine was invented in Little Italy by Angelo Vitantonio, an Italian immigrant to Cleveland. He received a [[patent]] for the product in 1906, and went on to found the Italian kitchenware manufacturer [[VillaWare]], which continues to operate today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.peasandcornco.com/villawares.asp |title = Villawares home kitchen appliances from the Peas and Corn Company |publisher = Peasandcornco.com |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911 it was estimated that 96% of the inhabitants were Italian-born, and another 2% were of Italian parents.  [[Ettore Boiardi]] (Chef Boyardee) opened his first restaurant, Il Giardino d'Italia, in the 1920s.  In 1993, the community dedicated Tony Brush Park, named for champion boxer and Little Italy resident Anthony Brescia, at Mayfield and Random roads. Major residential project expansions occurred in 2003 with the 20-unit Villa Carabelli,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bxmagazine.com/article.asp?ID=225&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 with the 15-unit Random Road Lofts townhomes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clevelandheights.com/upload/newsletter/TopoftheHill.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 the 27-unit 27 Coltman townhouses.&lt;ref&gt;http://27coltman.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood [[bocci]] courts are located at the Alta House, and in 2011 underwent a complete remodeling in a $110,000 project, being named in honor of Nick and Dorothy Lucarelli.

For a large part of its history, Cleveland was home to the largest [[Cleveland crime family|Mafia organization]] between New York and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.clevelandmob.com/ |title = Cleveland Mafia |publisher = Clevelandmob.com |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayfield Road Mob was the name of a gang which began around 1920 in Little Italy. Among the members of the "Mayfield Road Mob" were [[James T. Licavoli]] and [[Jimmy Fratianno]]. This Mafia faction was even mentioned by its old name in the movie "[[The Godfather (movie)|The Godfather]]" as the Lakeview Road Gang, as [[Lakeview Cemetery]] borders Mayfield Road Hill.

The work, which measures 37.25" x 49.25", framed, is made from collaged paper gathered from magazines, upon which Cruse-Griffin then paints, often allowing the underlying magazine paper to show through.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/wading-water|title=Wading in the Water {{!}} Public Art Archive|last=|first=|date=|website=www.publicartarchive.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiacg.wix.com/artist#!artist-spotlight|title=INDIA CRUSE-GRIFFIN MIXED MEDIA ARTIST {{!}} Wix.com|work=INDIA CRUSE-GRIFFIN MIXED MEDIA ARTIST|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her subjects are often clear and straightforward, this collage technique serves as a reminder of the accumulation of lived experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Walter John Bayes''' (31 May 1869 – 21 January 1956) was an English painter and illustrator who was a founder member of both the [[Camden Town Group]] and the [[London Group]] and also a renowned art teacher and critic.&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frances Spalding]]|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1990|title=20th Century Painters and Sculptors |ISBN=1 85149 106 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bayes was born in [[St Pancras, London]], the second of four children to Alfred Walter Bayes, a painter and etcher who exhibited regularly at the [[Royal Academy]], and Emily Ann Fielden. Walter's sister, [[Jessie Bayes|Jessie]], was a designer in the Arts and Crafts style and his younger brother was the sculptor [[Gilbert Bayes]].&lt;ref name="GMWaters"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Grant M. Waters|publisher=Eastbourne Fine Art|year=1975|title=Dictionary of British Artists Working 1900-1950|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Bayes attended the Quaker School at Saffron Waldon and then [[University College School]] before beginning work in a solicitor's office. He did not enjoy the work and in 1886 began to take evening classes at the City and Guilds of London Institute in Finsbury before studying full-time at the [[Westminster School of Art]].&lt;ref name="GMWaters"/&gt; In 1894 he spent a short period of time studying at the [[Academie Julian]] in Paris.

===Career===
By the turn of the century Bayes had already exhibited a landscape painting at the Royal Academy, in 1890, and had exhibited at the [[New English Art Club]] in 1892.&lt;ref name="Benezit1"/&gt; Later during the 1890s Bayes began teaching, first at the City and Guilds of London Institute, later at Bolt Court School of Art and then at the [[Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts]]. He also started writing on art theory and criticism with regular columns in ''Outlook'', ''Saturday Review'' and ''Weekend Review''. He continued to paint, mostly landscapes in oil and watercolour but also developed an interest in theatre design. The first work by Bayes purchased by a major British gallery was ''Top o' the Tide'' which the [[Walker Art Gallery]] acquired in 1900.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=1998|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 1, A to L |ISBN=0 95326 095 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 he had painted scenes for a production [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''John Gabriel Borkman'' and in 1911 would exhibit both costume and scenery designs.&lt;ref name=WBtate&gt;{{cite web |author=Nicola Moorby|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/camden-town-group/walter-bayes-r1105357 |title=The Camden Town Group in Context:Walter Bayes 1869-1956 |year=June 2003|accessdate=13 February 2014|work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 Bayes became the art critic of ''Athenaeum'' in place of [[Roger Fry]].

In 1908 Bayes was one of the initial eighty artists to join the [[Allied Artists' Association]] formed by [[Frank Rutter]]. At the first Allied Artist's Association exhibition Bayes met [[Walter Sickert]], who invited him to attend the regular weekly meetings of the [[Fitzroy Street Group]]. When the [[Camden Town Group]] was formed in 1911, Bayes was ideally placed to become one of its founding members, as they also met frequently at Sickert's studio.&lt;ref name="CTGodnb"/&gt; Bayes exhibited work at all three Camden Town Group exhibitions and, in 1913, became a founding member of the [[London Group]].&lt;ref name=WBtate/&gt; He also exhibited at the Franco-British Exhibition of 1908.&lt;ref name="Benezit1"&gt;{{cite book|authors=|publisher=Editions Grund, Paris|year=2006|title=Benezit Dictionary of Artists Volume 1 A-Bedeschini|ISBN=2 7000 3070 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1910s, a constant theme of Bayes's work were direct oil sketches of his wife and his sons.&lt;ref name="CTGodnb"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wendy Baron|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/64739|title=Camden Town Group|year=2004|accessdate=19 February 2014|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (online edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War One===
[[File:The Underworld Taking cover in a Tube Station during a London air raid (1918) (Art. IWM ART 935).jpg|thumb|upright=2|''The Underworld: Taking cover in a Tube Station during a London air raid'' (1918) (Art. IWM ART 935)]]
During World War One, Bayes continued to teach at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts, which was close to the [[Elephant &amp; Castle tube station]] on the London Underground. This was to be the site of one of Bayes's best known works, ''The Underworld: Taking cover in a Tube Station during a London air raid''. The scale and composition reflects Bayes's pre-war work as a theatre designer and creates the impression that the viewer is passing through the station, and past the cast of characters on the platform, as if on a train.&lt;ref name="WW1Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2008|title=Art from the First World War|ISBN=978-1-904897-98-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The picture was shown at the 1918 Royal Academy show and purchased by the [[Imperial War Museum]], who asked Bayes if he would do a further work for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]. Bayes spent some time in Devon in 1918 preparing for what became ''Landing Survivors from a Torpedoed Ship''. This painting was earmarked by the [[British War Memorials Committee]] for a proposed, but never built, national [[Hall of Remembrance]]. When that project was cancelled the painting was given to the Imperial War Museum but was destroyed by fire in 1977.&lt;ref name=IWMtorp&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1877|title=''Landing Survivors from a Torpedoed Ship''|year=|accessdate=14 February 2014|work=Imperial War Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IWMww1&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1050000263|title=First World War Art Archive Walter Bayes|year=|accessdate=13 February 2014|work=Imperial War Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===

IWM ART LD 2514).jpg|thumb|''Battle of Britain: Parachutists from an enemy aircraft brought down in an apparent attempt to bomb Buckingham Palace'' (1942) (Art. IWM ART LD 2514)]]
In 1918 Bayes was appointed Principal of the Westminster School of Art, a post he was to hold until 1934.&lt;ref name="GMWaters"/&gt; From 1927 to 1939 Bayes was a lecturer in Perspective at the [[Royal Academy Schools]] and when he left Westminster in 1934 he continued teaching as a visiting lecturer at [[Reading University]] until 1937.&lt;ref name=WBtate/&gt; Early in [[World War Two]] Bayes submitted works to the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] for purchase but was refused.&lt;ref name=IWMww2&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1050000925|title=War artist archive Walter Bayes|year=|accessdate=13 February 2014|work=Imperial War Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1942, however WAAC offered Bayes a short commission to produce a large oil painting on the subject of the air raids that had resulted in damage to parts of Buckingham Palace in 1940 and 1941. The resulting painting, ''Battle of Britain: Parachutists from an enemy aircraft brought down in an apparent attempt to bomb Buckingham Palace'', led to further war-time commissions.&lt;ref name="Foss"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brain Foss|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|title=War paint: Art, War, State and Identity in Britain, 1939-1945 |ISBN=978-0-300-10890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war Bayes was a prolific contributor to the [[Recording Britain]] scheme, producing numerous views of interior locations  that often focused on leisure activities and people eating and drinking.&lt;ref name="RecBrit"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gill Saunders (Editor)|publisher= V&amp;A Publishing|year=2011|title=Recording Britain|ISBN=978-1-85177-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced 29 watercolours of London for the project, 23 of Essex and 20 of other areas, including seven drawings of Oxford.&lt;ref name="RecBritain"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Mellor, Patrick Wright &amp; Gill Saunders|publisher= David &amp; Charles|year=1990|title=Recording Britain A Pictorial Domesday of pre-war Britain |ISBN=0-7153-9798-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 Bayes became Director of Painting at Lancaster School of Arts and Crafts, finally retiring in 1949, aged eighty.&lt;ref name=WBtate/&gt;
