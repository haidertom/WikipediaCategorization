The object of the game is to [[Scoring in association football|score]] by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal.

Association football is one of a family of [[Football|football codes]], which emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. The modern game traces its origins to 1863 when the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] were originally codified in England by [[The Football Association]].

Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] within the [[penalty area]]. Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] is declared or the game goes into [[extra time]] or a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] depending on the format of the competition. Association football is governed internationally by the [[FIFA|International Federation of Association Football]] (FIFA; {{lang-fr|Fédération Internationale de Football Association}}), which organises World Cups for both [[FIFA World Cup|men]] and [[FIFA Women's World Cup|women]] every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0,3509,10,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314003412/http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0%2C3509%2C10%2C00.html |archivedate=14 March 2005 |title=2002 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage |publisher=FIFA |date=5 December 2006 |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name ''association football'' was coined to distinguish the game from the [[Football|other forms of football]] played at the time, specifically [[rugby football]]. The first written "reference to the inflated ball used in the game" was in the mid-14th century: "Þe heued fro þe body went, Als it were a foteballe".&lt;ref name="Octavian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/hudson-octavian|title=Octavian - Robbins Library Digital Projects}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' states that the "rules of the game" were made in 1848, before the "split off in 1863".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101162441/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=football|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|date=1 January 2017|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''soccer'' comes from a slang or jocular abbreviation of the word "association", with the suffix "-er" appended to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/whats-the-origin-of-the-word-soccer/|title=What's the origin of the word "soccer"?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''soccer'' (which arrived at its final form in 1895) was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of ''socca.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/soccer#etymonline_v_23809|title=soccer {{!}} Origin and meaning of soccer by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[English-speaking world]], association football is now usually called "football" in the United Kingdom and mainly "soccer" in Canada and the United States. People in Australia, Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand use either or both terms, although national associations in Australia and New Zealand now primarily use "football" for the formal name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Soccer/Soccer-to-become-football-in-Australia/2004/12/16/1102787198357.html|title=Soccer to become football in Australia|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[FIFA]], the Chinese competitive game ''[[cuju]]'' (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball")&lt;!--transliterated as Tsu' Chu in ref--&gt; is the earliest form of football for which there is evidence.&lt;ref name="fifa-or"/&gt; ''Cuju'' players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to [[rugby football|rugby]] occurred.&lt;ref name="abd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Scott|title=Football For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGy_QNv-J4oC&amp;pg=PT33|date=30 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-66440-7|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFAClassicFootball|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/origins.html|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD), ''cuju'' games were standardised and rules were established.&lt;ref name="abd"/&gt;

''Phaininda'' and ''[[episkyros]]'' were Greek ball games.&lt;ref name="fifa.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/origins.html |title=Classic Football History of the Game |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/rivalries/newsid=2026693/index.html |title=A gripping Greek derby |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An image of an ''episkyros'' player depicted in low relief on a vase at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]&lt;ref name="NAMA" /&gt; appears on the [[UEFA European Championship]] Cup.&lt;ref name=bangkokpost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/413747/|title=Fury as FIFA finds a field of dreams in China|date=5 June 2014| newspaper=Bangkok Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athenaeus]], writing in 228 AD, referenced the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ball game ''[[harpastum]]''. ''Phaininda'', ''episkyros'' and ''harpastum'' were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled [[rugby football]], [[wrestling]] and [[volleyball]] more than what is recognizable as modern football.&lt;ref name="abd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Wilson, ''Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece'', Routledge, 2005, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel M.

Association football in itself does not have a classical history.&lt;ref name=bangkokpost/&gt; Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/Britain-home-of-football.html |title=Classic Football History of the Game |publisher=FIFA |date=10 June 2014 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely [[English public school football games|varying forms of football]] played in the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] of England. The history of football in England dates back to [[medieval football|at least the eighth century AD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Football&amp;nbsp;– Britain, the home of Football | publisher=FIFA| url = https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/game/historygame2.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701210540/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/game/historygame2.html| archivedate = 1 July 2007 | accessdate =20 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cambridge Rules]], first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], at a meeting attended by representatives from [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]] schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield Football Club]], formed by former public school pupils in 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Adrian |title=Football, the first hundred years |publisher=Routledge |page=126 |year=2005 |location=London |isbn=0-415-35018-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to formation of a [[Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire Football Association|Sheffield FA]] in 1867. In 1862, [[J. C. Thring|John Charles Thring]] of [[Uppingham School]] also devised an influential set of rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Winner |date=28 March 2005 | title = The hands-off approach to a man's game |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27-1544006,00.html |accessdate=7 October 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of [[The Football Association]] (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the [[Freemasons' Tavern]] in [[Great Queen Street]], London.&lt;ref name="FAhistory"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the FA |publisher=Football Association (FA) |url=http://www.thefa.com/about-football-association/history |accessdate=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only school to be represented on this occasion was [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]], withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other [[History of rugby union|English rugby clubs followed this lead]] and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the [[Rugby Football Union]]. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of [[Ebenezer Cobb Morley]], went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.&lt;ref name="FAhistory"/&gt; These rules included handling of the ball by "marks" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to [[Australian rules football|Victorian rules football]] being developed at that time in Australia.

The world's oldest football competition is the [[FA Cup]], which was founded by [[C. W. Alcock]] and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The [[1872 Scotland vs England football match|first official international football match]] also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in [[Glasgow]], again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first [[The Football League|football league]], which was founded in [[Birmingham]] in 1888 by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] director [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Football League |publisher=The Football League |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/History/HistoryDetail/0,,10794~1357277,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501121005/http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/History/HistoryDetail/0%2C%2C10794~1357277%2C00.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original format contained 12 clubs from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[Northern England]].

In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual [[Fan (aficionado)|fans]], local communities, and even nations. R.

====Early women's football====

Women may have been playing "football" for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that an ancient version of the game ([[Tsu Chu]]) was played by women during the [[Han Dynasty]] (25–220 CE). Two female figures are depicted in [[Han Dynasty]] (25–220 CE) frescoes, playing Tsu Chu.&lt;ref name="globalgame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Genesis of the Global Game |work=The Global Game |url=http://www.theglobalgame.com/aboutus.html |accessdate=22 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521234151/http://www.theglobalgame.com/aboutus.html |archivedate=21 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, a number of opinions about the accuracy of dates, the earliest estimates at 5000 BCE.&lt;ref name="footballnetwork"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chinese and Tsu Chu | work=The Football Network | url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/historyoffootball/history1.asp | accessdate=1 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Association football, the modern game, also has documented early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too.&lt;ref name="SFA"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Women's Football|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=409|publisher=Scottish Football Association|accessdate=18 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308172042/http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=409|archivedate=8 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12080678.display/|title=A game of two sexes|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow|date=8 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play.&lt;ref name="FA"/&gt; The first match recorded by the [[Scottish Football Association]] took place in 1892 in [[Glasgow]]. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.&lt;ref name="FA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/Womens/EnglandSenior/History/|title=Women's Football History| publisher=The Football Association| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325030003/http://www.thefa.com/Womens/EnglandSenior/History/| archive-date=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/4607171.stm|title=How women's football battled for survival|date=3 June 2005|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well-documented early European team was founded by activist [[Nettie Honeyball]] in England in 1894. It was named the [[British Ladies' Football Club]]. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, "I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of [[Feminism|emancipation]], and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in [[Parliament]] and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." &lt;ref name="Nettie Honeyball"&gt;{{cite web | title=Women's involvement with soccer was part of the emancipation process | work=SoccerTimes | url=http://www.soccertimes.com/oped/1999/jul20.htm | accessdate=4 May 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116204454/http://www.soccertimes.com/oped/1999/jul20.htm | archivedate=16 November 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mårtensson|first=Stefan|title=Branding women's football in a field of hegemonic masculinity|journal=Entertainment and Sports Law Journal|date=June 2010|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Women's football match Menai Bridge against Penrhos (24622680915).jpg|thumb|A Welsh women's football team pose for a photograph in 1959]]
Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the [[World War I|First World War]], when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was [[Dick, Kerr's Ladies]] of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston, England]]. The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from [[Paris]], France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22-0.&lt;ref name="SFA"/&gt;

Despite being more popular than some men's football events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leighton|first1=Tony|title=FA apologies for 1921 ban|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/11/newsstory.womensfootball|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 August 2014|date=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when [[The Football Association]] outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, on the grounds that the game (as played by women) was distasteful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witzig|first1=Richard|title=The Global Art of Soccer|date=2006|publisher=CusiBoy Publishing|isbn=0977668800|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=1921+fa+ban#v=onepage&amp;q=1921%20fa%20ban|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/4603149.stm|title=Trail-blazers who pioneered women's football|date=3 June 2005|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the formation of the [[English Ladies Football Association]] and play moved to [[rugby football|rugby]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newsham|first1=Gail|title=In a League of Their Own. The Dick, Kerr Ladies 1917-1965|date=2014|publisher=Paragon Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Association football has been played by women since at least the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/no-longer-the-game-of-two-halves.19185657 |title=No longer the game of two-halves |work=The Herald |publisher=Herald &amp; Times Group |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=9 March 2014 |first=Alan |last=Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"/&gt; It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/women/4607171.stm |title=How women's football battled for survival |last=Gregory |first=Patricia |work=BBC sport |publisher=BBC |date=3 June 2005 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and early 1970s women's association football was organised in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the most prominent [[team sport]] for British women.&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"/&gt;

====20th and 21st century====
The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both [[Women's football around the world|national]] and [[international competitions in women's football|international]] level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football has faced many struggles. It had a "golden age" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/women/4603149.stm |title=Trail-blazers who pioneered women's football |last=Alexander |first=Shelley |work=BBC sport |publisher=BBC |date=3 June 2005 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs. The FA's ban was rescinded in December 1969 with UEFA voting to officially recognise women's football in 1971.&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"/&gt; The [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=103/awards/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430044344/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament%3D103/awards/index.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |title=Tournaments: Women's World Cup |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=11 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while women's football has been an Olympic event [[football at the 1996 Summer Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Women's tournament|since 1996]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:U20-WorldCup2007-Okotie-Onka edit2.jpg|thumb|A goalkeeper saving a close-range shot from inside the penalty area]]

Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. The game is played using a spherical ball of {{convert|68|–|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} circumference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Become-a-licensee/Tests/Circumference/ Circumference - FIFA Quality Programme&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119053959/http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Become-a-licensee/Tests/Circumference/ |date=19 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the ''[[Ball (association football)|football]]'' (or ''soccer ball''). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a [[Captain (association football)|captain]] who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent his or her team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kicks]].&lt;ref name="laws51-52"/&gt;

The primary law is that players other than [[Goalkeeper (football)|goalkeepers]] may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a [[throw-in]] restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body (notably, "heading" with the forehead)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://expertfootball.com/wp/heading/ |title=How to head a football |accessdate=3 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101215132821/http://expertfootball.com/training/heading.php| archivedate= 15 December 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; other than their hands or arms.&lt;ref name="fouls"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws12_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 12) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011115718/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws12_02.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an [[Offside (association football)|offside]] position.&lt;ref name="offsidelaw"&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 11&amp;nbsp;– Offside |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20121209 PSG-Juvisy - Kenza Dali 04.jpg|thumb|A player executing a slide [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]] to dispossess an opponent]]
During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by [[dribbling]], passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through [[Tackle (football move)#Association football|tackling]] the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.&lt;ref name="restart"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws8_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 8) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142456/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws8_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the [[FA Premier League 2005-06|2005–06 season]] of the English [[Premier League]] produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England Premiership (2005/2006) |work=''Sportpress.com'' |url=http://www.sportpress.com/stats/en/738_england_premiership_2005_2006/11_league_summary.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023234/http://www.sportpress.com/stats/en/738_england_premiership_2005_2006/11_league_summary.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |accessdate=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,&lt;ref name=LAW301&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 3–Number of Players) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142527/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but a number of [[association football positions|specialised roles]] have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: [[Striker (association football)|strikers]], or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; [[Defender (association football)|defenders]], who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and [[midfielder]]s, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4196830.stm |title=Positions guide, Who is in a team? |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=24 September 2007 | date=1 September 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061105213730/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4196830.stm| archivedate=5 November 2006| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout of a team's players is known as a ''[[Formation (association football)|formation]]''.

==Laws==
{{redirects here|Rules of football|the rules of other football games|Football}}
{{main|Laws of the Game (association football)}}
There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html| title=Laws of the Game |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=2 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070901044035/http://fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html| archivedate= 1 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.

[[File:Howard Webb3.jpg|thumb|The [[referee (association football)|referee]] officiates in a football match]]
Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding [[substitute (association football)|substitutes]]), one of whom must be the [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]]. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the [[penalty area]] in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of [[association football positions|positions]] in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.&lt;ref name=LAW301/&gt;

The basic equipment or ''[[Kit (association football)|kit]]'' players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate [[shin guard]]s. An [[jockstrap|athletic supporter]] and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strikingeagles.tripod.com/health_advice_for_boys.htm |title=Health Advice for Boys |publisher=Strikingeagles.tripod.com |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.leagueathletics.com/Images/Club/6097/The%20Prevention%20of%20injuries.pdf |title=Soccer Position Paper |format=PDF |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Association football headgear|Headgear]] is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football's biggest headache|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2017/03/12/58c54bab268e3e64368b45a8.html|accessdate=17 May 2018|work=Marca|location=Spain|date=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws4_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 4–Players' Equipment) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141601/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws4_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three in ninety minutes with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in [[exhibition game|friendly matches]]. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or [[timewasting]] at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 3–Substitution procedure) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144947/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_02.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFAB recommends "that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team." Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 3&amp;nbsp;– The Number of Players |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Match officials}}
A game is officiated by a [[referee (association football)|referee]], who has "full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referees]]. In many high-level games there is also a [[fourth official]] who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws5_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 5–The referee) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141909/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws5_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goal line technology]] is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining if a goal has or hasn't been scored, this was brought in to prevent there being controversy. [[Video assistant referee]] (VAR) has also been increasingly introduced to assist officials through video replay to correct clear and obvious mistakes. There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.&lt;ref name="protocol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knvb.nl/downloads/bestand/9844/var-handbook-summary |title=Video Assistant Referees (VARs) Experiment – Protocol (Summary) |publisher=[[International Football Association Board]] |date=26 April 2017 |accessdate=26 April 2017 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ball===
{{main|Ball (association football)}}

The ball is spherical with a circumference of between {{convert|68|and|70|cm|in}}, a weight in the range of {{convert|410|to|450|g|oz}}, and a pressure between {{convert|8.5|and|15.6|psi|bar|1|order=flip|lk=on|abbr=off}} &lt;!-- rounding and flipped to get the values to equal FIFA's --&gt; at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2013/2014|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/81/42/36/log2013en%5fneutral.pdf|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Football-facts/Football-manufacturing/|title=Football manufacturing|work=FIFA quality program|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=3 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904193101/http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Football-facts/Football-manufacturing|archivedate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pitch===
{{Main|Football pitch}}
[[File:Football pitch metric.svg|thumb|Standard pitch measurements ([[:File:Football pitch imperial.svg|See Imperial version]])]]
As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within [[IFAB]], the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in [[imperial units]]. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate [[SI|metric]] equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of [[metrication]] (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will we ever go completely metric? |work=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3934353.stm |date=2 September 2004 |last=Summers |first=Chris |accessdate=7 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071010064850/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3934353.stm| archivedate= 10 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110&amp;nbsp;m (110–120&amp;nbsp;yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75&amp;nbsp;m (70–80&amp;nbsp;yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120&amp;nbsp;m (100–130&amp;nbsp;yd) length and 45–90&amp;nbsp;m (50–100&amp;nbsp;yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105&amp;nbsp;m (344&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 68&amp;nbsp;m (223&amp;nbsp;ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/ifab/media/news/newsid=707751/|title=Goal-line technology put on ice |publisher=FIFA |date=8 March 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ref for last sentence only --&gt; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/77/82/55/circularno.1145-amendmentstothelawsofthegame-2008.pdf |title=FIFA Amendments to the Laws of the Game, 2008 |publisher=FIFA |format=PDF |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longer boundary lines are ''touchlines'', while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are ''goal lines''. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.1–The field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142202/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_01.htm| archivedate = 13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be {{convert|24|ft|m}} apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be {{convert|8|ft|m}} above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_04.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.4–The Field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144942/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_04.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5&amp;nbsp;m (18&amp;nbsp;yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5&amp;nbsp;m (18&amp;nbsp;yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at [[Kick-off (association football)|kick-offs]], goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_03.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.3–The field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011084145/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_03.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duration and tie-breaking methods===
A standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.&lt;ref name="rule7.2"/&gt; The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called ''additional time'' in FIFA documents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/23/interpretation_law07_en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721055324/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/23/interpretation_law07_en.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2012|title=Interpretation of the Laws of the Game&amp;nbsp;– Law 07|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/refereeing/law_7_the_duration_of_the_match_en_47401.pdf|title=Law 7 - The Duration of the Match|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is most commonly referred to as ''stoppage time'' or ''injury time'', while ''lost time'' can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is [[Ball in and out of play|out of play]], and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of "effective playing time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football reforms: Scrapping 45-minute half to be debated at Ifab|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40311889|accessdate=7 March 2018|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.&lt;ref name="rule7.2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 7.2–The duration of the match) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144952/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_02.htm |archivedate=11 October 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90&amp;nbsp;minutes had elapsed and the game was over.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Sunday Times]] ''Illustrated History of Football'' Reed International Books Limited 1996. p.11 {{ISBN|1-85613-341-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_03.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019042952/http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_03.htm |archivedate=19 October 2007 |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 7.3–The duration of the match) |accessdate=3 March 2010 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Didier Drogba Manuel Neuer last penalty kick Champions League Final 2012.jpg|thumb|Some football competitions use a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] to decide the winner if a match ends as a draw]]
In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke [[Replay (sports)|replays]].&lt;ref&gt;For example in the [[FA Cup]] prior to the semi-finals.&lt;/ref&gt; A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] (known officially in the Laws of the Game as "kicks from the penalty mark") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).&lt;ref name="laws51-52"&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Procedures to determine the winner of a match or home-and-away |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In competitions using [[two-legged match]]es, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the [[away goals rule]] may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.&lt;ref name="laws51-52"/&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the [[IFAB]] experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (''[[golden goal]]''), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time (''[[silver goal]]''). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was [[France national football team|France]]'s victory over [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in 1998. [[Germany national football team|Germany]] was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in the final of [[Euro 1996]]. Silver goal was used in [[Euro 2004]]. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Time running out for silver goal |publisher=Rediff.com |agency=Reuters | url = http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/jul/02silver.htm | last=Collett |first=Mike | date = 2 July 2004 | accessdate =7 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071102232630/http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/jul/02silver.htm| archivedate= 2 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ball in and out of play===
{{Main|Ball in and out of play}}

Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ''ball in play'' and ''ball out of play''. From the beginning of each [[playing period]] with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:
[[File:Shunsuke1 20080622.jpg|thumb|right|A player takes a free kick, while the opposition form a "wall" to try to block the ball]]
* [[Kick-off (association football)|Kick-off]]: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.&lt;ref name="restart"/&gt;
* [[Throw-in]]: when the ball has crossed the touchline; awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws15_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 15–The Throw-in) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142556/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws15_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Goal kick]]: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team; awarded to defending team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws16_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 16–The Goal Kick) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141725/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws16_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Indirect free kick]]: awarded to the opposing team following "non-penal" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly (without the ball first touching another player) from an indirect free kick.&lt;ref name="freekick"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws13_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 13–Free Kicks) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142645/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws13_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Direct free kick]]: awarded to fouled team following certain listed "penal" fouls.&lt;ref name="freekick"/&gt; A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick.
* [[Penalty kick (association football)|Penalty kick]]: awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws14_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 14–The Penalty Kick) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142717/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws14_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dropped-ball]]: occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.&lt;ref name="restart"/&gt;

===Misconduct===
{{main|Foul (association football)}}

====On-field====
{{double image|right|Yellow card.svg|60|Red card.svg|60|Players are cautioned with a yellow card, and dismissed from the game with a red card. These colours were first introduced at the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] and used consistently since.}}
A [[foul (football)|foul]] occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of "penal fouls", punishable by a [[direct free kick]] or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an [[indirect free kick]].&lt;ref name="fouls"/&gt;

The referee may punish a player's or substitute's [[misconduct (football)|misconduct]] by a caution ([[Penalty card|yellow card]]) or dismissal ([[Penalty card|red card]]). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been "booked", the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of "unsporting behaviour" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.&lt;ref name="fouls"/&gt;

Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as "playing an advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4188646.stm |title=Referee's signals: advantage |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=4 March 2011 |date=14 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referee may "call back" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within "a few seconds". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 5: The Referee: Advantage |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Laws of the Game |chapter=Law 5: The Referee|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12_en.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=5 May 2012 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.

====Off-field====
{{see also|Foul (association football)#Post-match}}
Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, [[Doping in sport|doping]], [[Age fraud in association football|age fraud]] and [[match fixing]]. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.&lt;ref name=FAsuspensions&gt;For example, see [[The Football Association]]'s rules regarding player suspensions in FA competitions: {{cite web|title=DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES|url=http://www.thefa.com/~/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/rules-of-the-association/2015-16/031g_memorandum-of-disciplinary-procedures-_section-d.ashx |publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.{{efn|For example, the [[English Premier League]] fined and levied an 8-match suspension on [[Luis Suárez]] for [[Luis Suárez#Racial abuse incident|racially abusing]] [[Patrice Evra]]}} Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.&lt;ref name=FAsuspensions/&gt;

Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the [[English Football League]]  deduct 12 points from any team that enters [[Administration (British football)|financial administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football League administration penalty raised to 12 points|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33027933|accessdate=17 May 2018|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.

==Governing bodies==
{{See also|Association football around the world}}
[[File:FIFA-Headquarter.jpg|thumb| Headquarters of [[FIFA]], the world governing body of football]]
The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as [[futsal]] and [[beach soccer]]) is [[FIFA]]. The FIFA headquarters are located in [[Zürich]], Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:&lt;ref name="confeds"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/confederations/ |title=Confederations |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asia: [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC)
* Africa: [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF)
* Europe: [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] (UEFA)
* North/Central America &amp; Caribbean: [[CONCACAF|Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football]] (CONCACAF)
* Oceania: [[Oceania Football Confederation]] (OFC)
* South America: [[CONMEBOL|Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol/Confederação Sul-americana de Futebol]] (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL)

National associations oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the [[Fédération Camerounaise de Football]] in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the [[Scottish Football Association]] in Scotland). 209 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.&lt;ref name="confeds"/&gt;

While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the [[International Football Association Board]], where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.&lt;ref name="IFAB works"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/ifab/aboutifab.html |title=The IFAB: How it works |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International competitions==
{{main|List of association football competitions}}
[[File:Roman Weidenfeller World Cup 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[FIFA World Cup]] is the largest international competition in association football]]
The major international competition in football is the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], organised by FIFA. This competition takes place every four years since [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] with the exception of 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled due to [[World War II]]. Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.{{efn|The number of competing teams has varied over the history of the competition. The most recent changed was in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], from 24 to 32.}} The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the [[Olympic Games]]; the cumulative audience of all matches of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]], a ninth of the entire population of the planet.&lt;ref name="2006coverage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/marketing/news/newsid=111247/index.html |title=2006 FIFA World Cup broadcast wider, longer and farther than ever before |publisher=FIFA |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dunmore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9j1wbp2t1usC&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage Historical Dictionary of Soccer], page 235, quote "The World Cup is now the most-watched sporting event in the world on television, above even the Olympic Games."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dobson and John Goddard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GxyG0XXdvR4C&amp;pg=PA407#v=onepage The Economics of Football], page 407, quote "The World Cup is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world: the estimated cumulative television audience for the 2006 World Cup in Germany was 26.2 billion, an average of 409 million viewers per match."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glenn M. Wong, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEELS7T_Tm0C&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage The Comprehensive Guide to Careers in Sports], page 144, quote "The World Cup is the most-watched sporting event in the world. In 2006, more than 30 billion viewers in 214 countries watched the World Cup on television, and more than 3.3 million spectators attended the 64 matches of the tournament."&lt;/ref&gt; The current champion is [[France national football team|France]], which won its second title at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 tournament]] in Russia. [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] has been held every four years since [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]]. Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for 23 slots in a three-year [[FIFA Women's World Cup qualification|qualification phase]]. (The host nation's team is automatically entered as the 24th slot.) The current champion is the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]], after winning their third title in the [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]].

There has been a [[Football at the Summer Olympics|football tournament]] at every Summer Olympic Games since [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], except at the 1932 games in [[1932 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/football-equipment-and-history?tab=1 |title=Football Equipment and History |publisher=International Olympic Committee (IOC) |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only.&lt;ref name=Wherebegan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://access.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,3504,4,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608215029/http://access.fifa.com/en/history/history/0%2C3504%2C4%2C00.html |archivedate=8 June 2007 |title=Where it all began |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=8 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the [[Soviet Bloc]] countries of [[Eastern Europe]], where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] and [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Games]], the [[IOC]] decided to admit professional players. [[FIFA]] still did not want the Olympics to rival the World Cup, so a compromise was struck that allowed teams from Africa, Asia, Oceania and [[CONCACAF]] to field their strongest professional sides, while restricting [[UEFA]] and [[CONMEBOL]] teams to players who had not played in a World Cup. Since [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] male competitors must be under 23 years old, and since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], players under 23 years old, with three over-23 year old players, are allowed per squad. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olympics.sportinglife.com/olympics/story/0,23911,14986,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430181217/http://olympics.sportinglife.com/olympics/story/0%2C23911%2C14986%2C00.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |title=Event Guide&amp;nbsp;– Football |work=sportinglife |publisher=365 media group |accessdate=5 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Torres, Mata and Ramos Euro 2012 trophy 01.jpg|thumb|Spanish footballers celebrating winning the [[UEFA European Championship]]]]
After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] (UEFA), the [[Copa América]] (CONMEBOL), [[African Cup of Nations]] (CAF), the [[Asian Cup]] (AFC), the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] (CONCACAF) and the [[OFC Nations Cup]] (OFC). The [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current [[FIFA World Cup]] champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the [[UEFA Champions League]] in Europe and the [[Copa Libertadores]] in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the [[FIFA Club World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organising Committee strengthens FIFA Club World Cup format |publisher=FIFA |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2007/releases/newsid=570740.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531094715/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2007/releases/newsid%3D570740.html |archivedate=31 May 2008 |date=14 August 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic competitions==
{{Main|Geography of association football|Geography of women's association football}}
[[File:David Villa in Clasico.jpg|thumb|upright|A 2011 Spanish [[La Liga]] match between [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. This fixture, known as ''[[El Clásico]]'', is one of the most renowned in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMahon|first1=Bobby|title=El Clásico Is A Must-See Game, But Is Its Global Audience Overstated?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2017/12/21/el-clasico-is-a-not-to-be-missed-game-but-dont-believe-the-viewing-figures-youre-told/|accessdate=17 May 2018|work=Forbes|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The governing bodies in each country operate [[league system]]s in a [[Domestic association football season|domestic season]], normally comprising several [[division (sport)|divisions]], in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into [[Table (information)|tables]], placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a [[round-robin tournament]]. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to a lower division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scottish Journal of Political Economy |last=Fort |first=Rodney |date=September 2000 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=431–455 |doi=10.1111/1467-9485.00172 |journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in [[List of association football competitions|international club competitions]] in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named [[Apertura and Clausura]] (Spanish for ''Opening'' and ''Closing''), awarding a champion for each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/latinamerica/story/Estudiantes-win-Argentina-Apertura-title |title=Estudiantes win Argentina Apertura title |date=13 December 2010 |publisher=Fox Sports |agency=Associated Press |quote=Under the system used in Argentina and most of Latin America, two season titles are awarded each year&amp;nbsp;– the Apertura and Clausura.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more "cup" competitions organised on a [[single elimination tournament|knock-out]] basis.

Some countries' top divisions feature highly paid star players; in smaller countries, lower divisions, and most of women's clubs, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues&amp;nbsp;– the [[Bundesliga]] (Germany), [[Premier League]] (England),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7321408.stm |work=BBC Sport |title= Premier League conquering Europe |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=27 May 2008 | first=Ian | last=Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Liga]] (Spain), [[Serie A]] (Italy), and [[Ligue 1]] (France)&amp;nbsp;– attract most of the world's best players and each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of £600 million/€763 million/US$1.185 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Louise |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/29/premierleague |newspaper=The Guardian |title=Leading clubs losing out as players and agents cash in |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=28 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Football hooliganism}}
Football hooliganism is the term used to describe disorderly, violent or destructive behaviour perpetrated by spectators at football events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/find_out/guides/sport/international_football/newsid_3089000/3089728.stm | title=What is football hooliganism? |work=BBC News| accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent38673"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Another sorry outbreak of the English disease|work=[[The Independent]]|date=17 June 2004|url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article38673.ece|accessdate=25 July 2007|location=London|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155241/http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article38673.ece|archivedate=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants and casual play==
{{see also|Variants of association football|Street football}}
[[File:O Jogo Bonito (The Beautiful Game).webm|thumb|To many, football is more than just a sport: a video short on the many styles and ethnicities who play football.]]
Variants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. [[five-a-side football]]) play in non-field environments (i.e. [[beach soccer]], [[indoor soccer]], and [[futsal]]) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. [[paralympic association football]]).

[[Street football|Casual games]] can be played with only minimal equipment&amp;nbsp;– a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.

The '''Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society''' was first established in 1974 to promote philosophical conferences, workshops, summer schools, and research that are inspired by the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[Vienna Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graz: Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society |url=http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224042/http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/ |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ALWS&gt;{{cite web|title=Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society|url=http://www.alws.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an international society, which also has a publication series.&lt;ref name =ontos&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society|url=http://www.ontos-verlag.de/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=21&amp;Itemid=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1974, [[Elisabeth Leinfellner]], [[Werner Leinfellner]], Rudolf Haller, Paul Weingartner, and Adolf Hübner founded the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society (ALWS), but it was the impetus of the first [[International Wittgenstein Symposium]] in [[Kirchberg am Wechsel]], [[Lower Austria]] that led to its development as an international society. The location of the ALWS is in Kirchberg am Wechsel and the location was selected because Ludwig Wittgenstein taught at elementary schools close Kirchberg am Wechsel in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=ALWS/&gt;

==Goals==

The ALWS has two primary goals. 
*To promote the analysis, tradition, and dissemination of Wittgenstein’s philosophy.  
*To promote, more generally, philosophy that has its roots in Austria and other countries with emphasis on [[analytic philosophy]] inspired by Wittgenstein and [[philosophy of science]] inspired by, but not limited to, the philosophy of the Vienna Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goals|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/alws/view/unsere_ziele/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

They currently report 120 members both national and international.  Individuals can download an application form their website.  Membership is decided by the Executive Committee of the ALWS based on academic criteria.  Students pay half the fee.  Members receive a 30% discount on fees for the International Wittgenstein Symposium and for ALWS publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/alws/view/mitgliedschaft/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Since the first International Wittgenstein Symposium, the ALWS has published its proceedings.  In 2006, they started a new series (published by ontos verlag). The new series contains:&lt;ref name=ontos/&gt; 
*The official proceedings of the International Wittgenstein Symposium
*Special workshops 
*High-quality publications submitted to and reviewed by the ALWS.

==International Ludwig Wittgenstein Institute (ILWI)==

The ILWI was recently founded by the ALWS and supports scientific and cultural projects that are related to Wittgenstein’s philosophy and the goals of the ALWS. The ILWI presents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ILWI|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/ilwi/view/ilwi_general_information/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Workshops
*Summer schools
*Wittgenstein lectures
*Research opportunities at the ILWI

==Sponsorship==

The Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society is funded by the government of [[Lower Austria]], the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science and Research, Austrian National Bank, Raiffeisenbank NÖ-Süd Alpin, Kirchberg am Wechsel, membership fees, and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sponsors|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/credit/view/sponsoren/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2547">'''Bachelor of Social Services''' (called ''socionom'' in Swedish and Danish, ''sosionom'' in Norwegian, and ''sosionomi'' in Finnish) is a degree in [[social welfare]] from [[Scandinavia]]n universities. At the core it is based on the competences needed to work in social services. Courses in [[sociology]], [[human rights]], [[gerontology]], [[Community practice|community services]], [[psychology]], [[social security]] and [[entrepreneurship]] are part of the degree. Service orientation and client work is seen through a [[Social pedagogy|social pedagogical]] framework. The studies  take 3 to 5 years. Degree holders are usually hired for services in [[Nordic model|Scandinavian welfare systems]].

'''Baldwin Wallace University''' is a four-year private, [[coeducational]], [[liberal arts college]] in [[Berea, Ohio]], United States. The school was founded in 1845 as [[Baldwin Institute]] by [[Methodism|Methodist]] settlers.

Both the university and the town of [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]] were founded by [[Methodism|Methodist]] settlers from [[Connecticut]]. These settlers moved west after their homes were burned by the British in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. The region in Northern [[Ohio]] became known as the [[Western Reserve]] (a part of which was designated the [[Firelands]], as the state of [[Connecticut]] gave land grants to these fire victims). Among early settlers of this area was [[John Baldwin (educator)|John Baldwin]]. Baldwin enjoyed early success in the [[sandstone]] [[quarry]] industry. He eventually founded Baldwin Institute in 1845. Baldwin Institute became [[Baldwin University]] in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gesink|first1=Indira Falk|title=Barefoot Millionaire:  John Baldwin and the Founding Values of Baldwin Wallace University|date=2013|publisher=Baldwin Wallace University|location=Berea, Ohio|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin's sense of equality led to the school accepting any student regardless of race or gender,&lt;ref name=bwhis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bw.edu/quickfacts/history|title=B-W: History of Baldwin Wallace University|accessdate=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the first in the nation to do so. Moreover, Baldwin University's courses were not segregated. The surge of German workers in Baldwin's sandstone quarries led to the establishment of a German department at the Institute.

The Reverend Jacob Rothweiler, a professor at Baldwin University, named his project after [[James Wallace (benefactor)|James Wallace]], and [[German Wallace College]] was founded in 1855. Students at both institutions were free to enroll in courses at Baldwin or German Wallace. Baldwin and Wallace were the primary benefactors to the two Berea colleges. After their deaths, and the decline of the quarry industry in Ohio, Baldwin University came close to financial ruin. Options were thin, and the [[United Methodist Church]] considered merging the schools with the more successful [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in 1874, to form the University of Cleveland. The University of Cleveland concept was abandoned for a more elegant solution. Baldwin University and German Wallace College merged in 1913 to form Baldwin–Wallace College.

The college's present day campus can be much accredited to the leadership of [[Alfred Bryan Bonds]]; through much of the mid-20th century, Baldwin Wallace grew to be a large and well respected suburban institution. Bonds oversaw the construction of fifteen buildings on campus during his 26-year tenure. [[Neal Malicky]]'s tenure as college president stabilized the college's finances and endowment, finally placing Baldwin Wallace in financial security after years of financial struggle. Following Malicky's presidency, Mark Collier served as president for seven years, overseeing a campus master plan that has led to many major renovations on campus. In recent years the college has expanded and renovated residence halls and academic buildings. In addition, the college has purchased existing buildings in the [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]] community for academic and student residential use.

In the fall of 2011, a task force was developed by BW President Dick Durst. On February 11, 2012, it was announced that Baldwin–Wallace College would become Baldwin Wallace University after approval by the BW Board of Trustees. The name would become effective on July 1 of 2012, with complete implementation by the end of 2012. In addition to the new university designation, seal, and logo, "B-W" would drop the hyphen in its name.&lt;ref name="BW University"/&gt;

In recent years, BW has been a stopping point for political candidates.  During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential campaign]], BW hosted eventual President [[Barack Obama]] and 2008 Presidential candidate [[John McCain]]. In 2012 BW hosted vice presidential candidate [[Paul Ryan]] along with [[Condoleezza Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/mccain-praises-obamas-style-but-says-he-will-prevail-on-issues/?scp=1&amp;sq=obama%20baldwin%20wallace&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=McCain Praises Obama's Style, but Says He Will Prevail on Issues | first=Elisabeth | last=Bumiller | date=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/one-nations-underguarded-individual/?scp=3&amp;sq=obama%20baldwin%20wallace&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=One Nation's Underguarded Individual | first=Tobin | last=Harshaw | date=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last sitting President prior to Obama to visit BW was [[Ronald Reagan]] during George H.

The campus is located in [[Berea, Ohio]], a suburb of [[Cleveland]], Ohio. The campus is built around land that originally was two separate schools that combined in 1913. The campus itself is located next to [[Berea High School]] and is integrated into the neighborhoods of Berea.  The majority of the Campus that exists today was expanded in the 1960s and 1970s. BW prides itself on its many green spaces around campus, such as the North Quad where residence halls, Ritter Library, and academic buildings surround a large field with sidewalks. Buildings that surround the quad include Malicky Center, Wheeler Hall, The Life &amp; Earth Science building, the Center for Innovation and Growth, the Observatory, the President's house, several residence halls and the Alumni Wall. During the presidency of Alfred Bryan Bonds, the Alumni Wall (located behind North Hall) was created to recognize alumni who have contributed to the development of the campus. The North Quad is also home to a diverse tree collection, a Greenhouse, a native Ohio plants garden and a commons area (located behind Lang Hall). In 2009, BW opened the Thomas Family Center for Science and Innovation. The project connected the Life &amp; Earth Science building and Wilker Hall.

===Sustainability===
[[File:EhousenHallBaldwinWallaceUniversity.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Ernsthausen Hall]]
BW has been first in several areas in sustainability. In 2005, BW became the first to have a residence hall in Ohio with [[geo-thermal heating]] and cooling. Ernsthausen Hall which was originally built in 1961 was renovated in 2005 to use geo-thermal heating and cooling. In the fall of 2008, Baldwin Wallace became the first college in Ohio to offer a bachelor's degree in sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bw.edu/news/sustainmajor/ B-W: Doing Well by Doing Good: B-W Launches Ohio's First Sustainability Major] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314221603/http://www.bw.edu/news/sustainmajor/ |date=March 14, 2010 }}.

The Strosacker Student Union houses the campus's largest dining facility, The Student Life Center (campus life offices), various administrative offices, student organization offices, meeting rooms, the Cyber Cafe and the campus bookstore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BW student union|url=http://www.bw.edu/stulife/union/services/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Student Activity Center (SAC), renovated in the late 1990s, was the women's gym in the 1930s, and today is used for concerts and various student events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BW SAC|url=http://www.bw.edu/stulife/union/sac/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing===
[[File:Kohler BWC.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Kohler Hall]]
There are two locations where students are housed. The first is north campus which encompasses halls north of Bagley Road. North campus includes Lang, Findley, North and Hamilton Apartments. The College acquired a former practice field and office building when the team was moved to Baltimore. Findley Hall, North Hall, and Lang Hall all house typically upperclassmen students, but occasionally North Hall has housed first-year students. Lang Hall was the only all-female residence hall until 2008.

[[File:Lang Hall BWC.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Lang Hall]]
South campus typically encompasses residence halls that are south of Bagley Road. Davidson Commons makes up the new freshman complex.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.bw.edu/stulife/reslife/halls/ B-W: Residence Halls]. Bw.edu. Retrieved on 2012-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt; 21 Beech is also home to Honors housing. Ernsthausen, Heritage, and Constitution typically house upperclassmen and Greek organizations. Greek organizations are housed in residence halls because there are no fraternity/sorority houses. Kohler Hall, the Carmel Center for Living and Learning (referred to as Carmel Hall) and the Berea Townhouses are also located on the southern end of campus. Ernsthausen Hall is the first campus residence hall in Ohio to utilize [[geothermal power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=175580 |title=College will heat, cool with geothermal system |accessdate=January 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192600/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=175580 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson Commons opened during the 2013-14 academic year, and is the campus' only freshman-only living quarters. It combines Davidson, Klein and Saylor halls, all of which were renovated with suite-styled dorm rooms, each consisting of either two or three bedrooms and a single shared bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bw.edu/stulife/reslife/halls/beech/|title=Housing - Baldwin Wallace University|author=|date=|website=bw.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1781">In the year 616 an anonymous scholar extended [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]] to an Easter table covering the years 532 up to and including 721.   Dionysius' table was published in 525 and only a century later accepted by the church of Rome, which from the third century up till then had given preference to go on using her own, relatively inadequate, Easter tables.   From about the middle of the seventh century all controversy between Alexandria and Rome as to the correct date of Easter ceased, as both churches were now using identical tables.   

In the year 725 [[Bede#Scientific writings|Bede]] (Latin name Beda Venerabilis) published a new extension of Dionysius’ Easter table to a great '''Easter cycle''', which is periodic in its entirety and in which consequently not only the sequence of (Julian calendar) dates of Alexandrian [[Paschal full moon]] but also the sequence of (Julian calendar) dates of Alexandrian [[Easter Sunday]] is periodic. Bede’s Easter cycle contains lunar cycles (of 19 years) as well as solar cycles (of 28 years), and therefore it has a period of 532 years. In the [[Byzantine empire]] thanks to the Paschal cycle of [[Annianus of Alexandria]] at all times the churches were acquainted with the correct date of the next Easter Sunday. It is Beda Venerabilis’ Easter cycle by means of which also the churches in the part of Europe outside the Byzantine empire got that possibility.

Biomedicine involves the study of ([[pathophysiology|patho]]-) [[physiological]] processes with methods from [[biology]] and [[physiology]]. Approaches range from understanding [[molecular interaction]]s to the study of the consequences at the [[in vivo]] level. These processes are studied with the particular point of view of devising new strategies for [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and [[therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graduateschools.uni-wuerzburg.de/life_sciences/research/sections/biomedicine/ |title=University of Würzburg Graduate Schools: Biomedicine |work=graduateschools.uni-wuerzburg.de |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2012-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716101044/http://www.graduateschools.uni-wuerzburg.de/life_sciences/research/sections/biomedicine/ |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monocolonal Antibodies to Migraine: Witnesses to Modern Biomediceine, An A-Z: Ed.

Depending on the severity of the disease, biomedicine pinpoints a problem within a patient and fixes the problem through medical intervention. Medicine focuses on curing diseases rather than improving one's health.&lt;ref name=Greenhalgh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenhalgh|title=UNDER THE MEDICAL GAZE|publisher=California Digital Library|isbn=978-1-59734-971-0|pages=84|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=kt5x0nc6st;brand=ucpress|ref=Author}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In social sciences biomedicine is described somewhat differently. Through an anthropological lens biomedicine extends beyond the realm of biology and scientific facts; it is a [[Socio-cultural anthropology|socio-cultural]] system which collectively represents reality. While biomedicine is traditionally thought to have no bias due to the evidence-based practices, Gaines &amp; Davis-Floyd (2004) highlight that biomedicine itself has a cultural basis and this is because biomedicine reflects the norms and values of its creators.&lt;ref&gt;Gaines, A. D., &amp; Davis-Floyd, R. (2004). Biomedicine. In Encyclopedia of medical anthropology (pp. 95-109). Springer US.&lt;/ref&gt; Another basis for defining biomedicine as a cultural system is the involvement of hierarchies - a common theme within cultures - between health care practitioners and the prioritizing of different groups, such as patient versus doctor, general physician versus surgeon, or young versus old. Gaines and Davis-Floyd's final point of labelling biomedicine as its own culture suggests that studies constructed within the biomedical field tend to aim at confirming previously established 'knowledge' rather than questioning it.

== Molecular biology ==
{{main|molecular biology}}
Molecular biology is the process of synthesis and regulation of a cell’s DNA, RNA, and protein. Molecular biology consists of different techniques including Polymerase chain reaction, Gel electrophoresis, and macromolecule blotting to manipulate DNA.

[[Polymerase chain reaction]] is done by placing a mixture of the desired DNA, [[DNA polymerase]], [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]], and [[nucleotide bases]] into a machine. The machine heats up and cools down at various temperatures to break the hydrogen bonds binding the DNA and allows the nucleotide bases to be added onto the two DNA templates after it has been separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polymerase chain reaction|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/probe/docs/techpcr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gel electrophoresis]] is a technique used to identify similar DNA between two unknown samples of DNA. This process is done by first preparing an agarose gel. This jelly-like sheet will have wells for DNA to be poured into. An electric current is applied so that the DNA, which is negatively charged due to its [[phosphate]] groups is attracted to the positive electrode. Different rows of DNA will move at different speeds because some DNA pieces are larger than others. Thus if two DNA samples show a similar pattern on the gel electrophoresis, one can tell that these DNA samples match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gel electrophoresis|url=http://www.geneticseducation.nhs.uk/laboratory-process-and-testing-techniques/gel-electrophoresis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macromolecule [[blotting]] is a process performed after gel electrophoresis. An alkaline solution is prepared in a container. A sponge is placed into the solution and an agaros gel is placed on top of the sponge. Next, nitrocellulose paper is placed on top of the agarose gel and a paper towels are added on top of the nitrocellulose paper to apply pressure. The alkaline solution is drawn upwards towards the paper towel. During this process, the DNA denatures in the alkaline solution and is carried upwards to the nitrocellulose paper. The paper is then placed into a plastic bag and filled with a solution full of the DNA fragments, called the probe, found in the desired sample of DNA. The probes anneal to the complementary DNA of the bands already found on the nitrocellulose sample. Afterwards, probes are washed off and the only ones present are the ones that have annealed to complementary DNA on the paper. Next the paper is stuck onto an x ray film. The radioactivity of the probes creates black bands on the film, called an autoradiograph. As a result, only similar patterns of DNA to that of the probe are present on the film. This allows us the compare similar DNA sequences of multiple DNA samples. The overall process results in a precise reading of similarities in both similar and different DNA sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern blot|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=southernblot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biochemistry ==
{{main|biochemistry}}
Biochemistry is the science of the chemical processes which takes place within living organisms. Living organisms need essential elements to survive, consisting of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium, and phosphorus. These elements make up the four big macromolecules that living organisms need to survive- carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.&lt;ref name=Schopf&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schopf|first1=J. William|authorlink=J. William Schopf|title=Life's Origin|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23391-1|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=kt9v19q7jz;brand=ucpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbohydrates]], made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, are energy storing molecules. The simplest one of carbohydrates is [[glucose]], C{{sub|6}}H{{sub|12}}O{{sub|6}}, is used in cellular respiration to produce ATP, [[adenosine triphosphate]], which supplies cells with energy.&lt;ref name=Schopf /&gt;

[[Proteins]] are chains of amino acids that function to contract skeletal muscle, function catalysts, transport molecules, and storage molecules. Proteins can facilitate biochemical processes, by lowering the activation energy of a reaction. Hemoglobins are also proteins, that carry oxygen to the cells in an organisms body.&lt;ref name=Schopf /&gt;

[[Lipid]]s, also known as fats, also serve to store energy, but in the long term. Due to their unique structure, lipids provide more than twice the amount of energy that carbohydrates do. Lipids can be used as insulation, as it is present below the layer of skin in living organisms. Moreover, lipids can be used in hormone production to maintain a healthy hormonal balance and provide structure to your cell walls.&lt;ref name=Schopf /&gt;

[[Nucleic acid]]s are used to store DNA in every living organism. The two types of nucleic acids are DNA and RNA. DNA is the main genetic information storing substance found oftentimes in the nucleus, which controls the processes that the cell undergoes. DNA consists of two complimentary antiparallel strands consisting varying patterns of nucleotides. RNA is a single strand of DNA, which is transcribed from DNA and used for DNA translation, which is the process for making proteins out of RNA sequences.&lt;ref name=Schopf /&gt;

A '''calendar era''' is the '''year numbering''' system used by a [[calendar]]. For example, the [[Gregorian calendar]] numbers its years in the Western [[Christian era]] (the [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] churches have their own Christian eras). The instant, date, or year from which time is marked is called the ''[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]'' of the era. There are many different calendar eras such as [[Saka Era]].

In antiquity, [[regnal year]]s were counted from the accession of a monarch. This makes the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East]] very difficult to reconstruct, based on disparate and scattered king lists, such as the [[Sumerian King List]] and the Babylonian [[Canon of Kings]]. In East Asia, reckoning by [[era name]]s chosen by ruling monarchs ceased in the 20th century except for [[Japan]], where they are still used.

==Ancient dating systems==

===Assyrian eponyms===
{{main|Eponym dating system}}

For over a thousand years, ancient [[Assyria]] used a system of [[Eponym dating system|eponyms]] to identify each year. Each year at the [[Akitu]] festival (celebrating the Mesopotamian new year), one of a small group of high officials (including the king in later periods) would be chosen by lot to serve as the ''[[limmu]]'' for the year, which meant that he would preside over the Akitu festival and the year would bear his name. The earliest attested ''limmu'' eponyms are from the Assyrian trading colony at [[Kültepe|Karum Kanesh]] in Anatolia, dating to the very beginning of the 2nd millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CDLI: The Old and Middle Assyrian limmu officials|url=http://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=list_of_old_assyrian_limmu_officials|website=Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they continued in use until the end of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]], ca. 612 BC.

Assyrian scribes compiled ''limmu'' lists, including an unbroken sequence of almost 250 eponyms from the early 1st millennium BC. This is an invaluable chronological aid, because a solar eclipse was recorded as having taken place in the ''limmu'' of Bur-Sagale, governor of [[Tell Halaf|Guzana]]. Astronomers have identified this eclipse as [[Assyrian eclipse|one that took place on 15 June, 763 BC]], which has allowed absolute dates of 892 to 648 BC to be assigned to that sequence of eponyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millard|first1=Alan|title=The Eponyms of the Assyrian Empire, 910-612 BC (State Archives of Assyria Studies, Vol. 2)|date=1994|publisher=Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-9514567155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list of absolute dates has allowed many of the events of the Neo-Assyrian Period to be dated to a specific year, avoiding the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|chronological debates]] that characterize earlier periods of Mesopotamian history.

===Olympiad dating===
Among the ancient Greek historians and scholars, a common method of indicating the passage of years was based on the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], first held in [[776 BC]]. The Olympic Games provided the various independent city-states with a mutually recognizable system of dates. Olympiad dating was not used in everyday life. This system was in use from the 3rd century BC. The modern Olympic Games (or Summer Olympic Games beginning 1896) do not continue the four year periods from ancient Greece: the 669th Olympiad would have begun in the summer of 1897, but the modern Olympics were first held in 1896.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;Blackburn, B. &amp; Holford-Strevens, L. (1999, 2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the Year: an exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning'' (corrected printing). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-214231-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|769}}

===Indiction cycles===
Another common system was the [[indiction]] cycle (15 indictions made up an agricultural tax cycle in Roman Egypt, an indiction being a year in duration). Documents and events began to be dated by the year of the cycle (e.g., "fifth indiction", "tenth indiction") in the 4th century, and this system was used long after the tax ceased to be collected. It was used in [[Gaul]], in [[Egypt]], and in most parts of Greece until the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt|Islamic conquest]], and in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] until its conquest in 1453. 

The rule for computing the indiction from the AD year number, which he had just invented, was stated by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]: add 3 and divide by 15; the remainder is the indiction, with 0 understood to be the fifteenth indiction.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|770}} Thus 2001 was the ninth indiction.&lt;ref&gt;Nautical Almanac Office of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] and [[Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]]. (2000)''[[The Nautical Almanac]] for the year 2001''. [[Washington, DC]]: [[Government Printing Office]] and [[London, England]], UK: [[The Stationery Office]]. p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the year for the indiction varied.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|769–71}}

===Seleucid era===
{{main|Seleucid era}}

The Seleucid era was used in much of the Middle East from the 4th century BC to the 6th century AD, and continued until the 10th century AD among Oriental Christians. The era is computed from the epoch 312 BC: in August of that year [[Seleucus I Nicator]] captured [[Babylon]] and began his reign over the Asian portions of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire. Thus depending on whether the calendar year is taken as starting on 1 [[Tishri]] or on 1 [[Nisan]] (respectively the start of the Jewish civil and ecclesiastical years) the Seleucid era begins either in 311 BC (the Jewish reckoning) or in 312 BC (the Greek reckoning: October–September).

===Ancient Rome===

====Consular dating====
An early and common practice was Roman '[[Roman consul|consular]]' dating. This involved naming both [[Consul Ordinarius|''consules ordinarii'']] who had taken up this office on January 1 (since 153 BC) of the relevant civil year.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|6}} Sometimes one or both consuls might not be appointed until November or December of the previous year, and news of the appointment may not have reached parts of the Roman empire for several months into the current year; thus we find the occasional inscription where the year is defined as "after the consulate" of a pair of consuls.

The use of consular dating ended in AD 541 when the emperor [[Justinian I]] discontinued appointing consuls. The last consul nominated was [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius]]. Soon afterwards, imperial regnal dating was adopted in its place.

====Dating from the founding of Rome====
Another method of dating, rarely used, was ''[[anno urbis conditae]]'' (Latin: "in the year of the founded city" (abbreviated AUC), where "city" meant Rome). (It is often incorrectly given that AUC stands for ''[[ab urbe condita]]'', which is the title of [[Livy|Titus Livius]]'s history of Rome.)

Several epochs were in use by Roman historians. Modern historians usually adopt the epoch of [[Varro]], which we place in 753 BC.

The system was introduced by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in the 1st century BC. The first day of its year was Founder's Day (April 21), although most modern historians assume that it coincides with the modern historical year (January 1 to December 31). It was rarely used in the [[Roman calendar]] and in the early Julian calendar – naming the two [[consul]]s that held office in a particular year was dominant. AD {{CURRENTYEAR}} is thus approximately the same as AUC {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} ({{CURRENTYEAR}} + 753).

About AD 400, the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] used the AUC era. Pope [[Boniface IV]] (about AD 600) may have been the first to use both the AUC era and the ''Anno Domini'' era (he put AD 607 = AUC 1360).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007|reason='although it occurs occasionally in papal documents of the time of John XIII (965-972), it was not the rule before the twelfth century': http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04636c.htm - and that's not even about using abbreviations}}

====Regnal years of Roman emperors====
Another system that is less commonly found than might be thought was the use of the [[regnal year]] of the [[Roman emperor]]. At first, [[Augustus]] indicated the year of his reign by counting how many times he had held the office of consul, and how many times the [[Roman Senate]] had granted him [[Tribune|Tribunican]] powers, carefully observing the fiction that his powers came from these offices granted to him, rather than from his own person or the many [[Roman legion|legion]]s under his control. His successors followed his practice until the memory of the [[Roman Republic]] faded (about AD 200), when they began to use their regnal year openly.

====Dating from the Roman conquest====
Some regions of the [[Roman Empire]] dated their calendars from the date of Roman conquest, or the establishment of Roman rule.

The [[Spanish era]] counted the years from 38 BC, probably the date of a new tax imposed by the Roman Republic on the subdued population of Iberia. The date marked the establishment of Roman rule in Spain and was used in official documents in Portugal, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], and in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], into the 14th century. This system of calibrating years fell to disuse in 1381 and was replaced by today's ''Anno Domini''.&lt;ref&gt;Gedaliah ibn Jechia the Spaniard, ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah'', Jerusalem 1962, p. 271 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods, the [[Decapolis]] and other Hellenized cities of Syria and Palestine used the [[Pompeian era]], counting dates from the Roman general [[Pompey]]'s conquest of the region in 63 BC.

===Maya===
A different form of calendar was used to track longer periods of time, and for the inscription of calendar dates (i.e., identifying when one event occurred in relation to others). This form, known as the Long Count, is based upon the number of elapsed days since a mythological starting-point. According to the calibration between the Long Count and Western calendars accepted by the great majority of Maya researchers (known as the GMT correlation), this starting-point is equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or 6 September in the Julian calendar (−3113 astronomical).

===Other dating systems===
A great many local systems or [[era]]s were also important, for example the year from the foundation of one particular city, the regnal year of the neighboring [[History of Persia|Persian emperor]], and eventually even the year of the reigning [[Caliph]].

==Late Antiquity and Middle Ages==
Most of the traditional calendar eras in use today were introduced at the time of transition from [[Late Antiquity]] to the [[Early Middle Ages]], roughly between the 6th and 10th centuries.

===Christian era===
*The ''[[Etos Kosmou]]'' of the [[Byzantine Calendar]] places Creation at the beginning of its year 1, namely 5509 BC. Its first known use occurred in the 7th century AD, although its precursors were developed about AD 400. The year 7509 of this era began in September 2000.
*The [[Era of Martyrs]] or Era of Diocletian is reckoned from the beginning of the reign of Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]]; the first year of this era was 284/5. It was not the custom to use regnal years in Rome, but it was the custom in Roman Egypt, which the emperor ruled through a prefect (the king of Egypt). The year number changed on the first day of the Egyptian month [[Thoth]] (29 August three years out of four, 30 August the year before a Roman leap year.) Diocletian abolished the special status of Egypt, which thereafter followed the normal Roman calendar: consular years beginning on 1 January. This era was used in the Easter tables prepared in Alexandria long after the abdication of Diocletian, even though Diocletian was a notorious persecutor of Christians. The Era of Diocletian was retained by the [[Coptic calendar|Coptic Church]] and used for general purposes, but by 643 the name had been changed to Era of the Martyrs.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|766–7}}
*The [[Ethiopian calendar|Incarnation Era]] is used by [[Ethiopia]]. Its epoch is August 29, AD 8 in the Julian calendar.
*The [[Armenian calendar]] has its era fixed at AD 552.

====Dionysian "Common Era"====
{{Main|Anno Domini|Common Era}}

The era based on the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of [[Christ]] was introduced by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in 525 and is in continued use with various reforms and derivations. The distinction between the Incarnation being the conception or the [[Nativity of Jesus]] was not drawn until the late ninth century.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|881}} The beginning of the numbered year varied from place to place: when, in 1600, Scotland adopted January 1 as the date the year number changes, this was already the case in much of continental Europe. England adopted this practice in 1752.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|7}}

* A.D. (or AD) – for the [[Latin]] ''[[Anno Domini]]'', meaning "in the year of (our) Lord". This is the dominant or Western Christian Era; AD is used in the Gregorian calendar. ''[[Anno Salutis]]'', meaning "in the year of salvation" is identical. Originally intended to number years from the Incarnation of [[Jesus]], according to modern thinking the calculation was a few years off. Years preceding AD 1 are numbered using the BC era, avoiding zero or negative numbers. AD was also used in the medieval [[Julian calendar]], but the first day of the year was either March 1, [[Easter]], March 25, September 1, or December 25, not January 1. To distinguish between the Julian and Gregorian calendars, ''O.S.'' and ''N.S.'' were often added to the date, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries, when both calendars were in common use. [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] (O.S.) was used for the Julian calendar and for years not beginning on January 1. [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] (N.S.) was used for the Gregorian calendar and for Julian calendar years beginning on January 1. Many countries switched to using January 1 as the start of the numbered year at the same time as they switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, but others switched earlier or later.
* B.C. (or BC) – meaning "Before Christ". Used for years before AD 1, counting backwards so the year ''n'' BC is ''n'' years before AD 1. Thus there is no [[year zero|year 0]].
* C.E. (or CE) and B.C.E. (or BCE)  – meaning "[[Common Era]]" and "Before the Common Era", numerically equivalent to AD and BC, respectively (in writing, "AD" ''precedes'' the year number, but "CE" ''follows'' the year: AD 1 = 1 CE.)&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press Stylebook''. (2007). New York: Basic Books. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00489-8}}. "Because the full phrase would read ''in the year of the Lord 96'', the abbreviation A.D. goes before the figure for the year: ''A.D. 96.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The  Latin equivalent ''vulgaris aera'' was used as early as 1615  by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;A 1635 English edition of that book has the title page in English – so far, the earliest-found usage of "Vulgar Era" in English. The English phrase "common Era" appears at least as early as 1708.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
In Latin, "Common Era" is written as ''Vulgaris Aera''. It also occasionally appears as ''æra vulgaris'', ''aera vulgaris'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aera Christiana'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.&lt;/ref&gt; The English abbreviations C.E. and B.C.E. were introduced in the 19th century  by Jewish intellectuals, wishing to avoid the abbreviation for ''dominus'' "lord" in implicit reference to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Use of "C.E." and "B.C.E.": [[Morris Jacob Raphall]]. ''Post-Biblical History of The Jews'' (1856). 
Explicit use of "b.c.e." for "before the common era": 
Max Stern, ''Lemaʼan Yilmedu: A Second Hebrew Reader for Jewish Schools and Private Instruction'' (1881), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; By the later 20th century, the abbreviations had come into wider usage by authors who wished to emphasize [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt; John Sumser, ''The Conflict Between Secular and Religious Narratives in the United States: Wittgenstein, Social Construction, and Communication'' (2016), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5SFsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69   p. 69].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dionysian-derived=====
* [[Astronomical year numbering]] equates its year 0 with 1 BC, and counts negative years from 2 BC backward (−1 backward), so 100 BC is −99.
* The [[Holocene calendar|human era]], also named Holocene era, proposed by [[Cesare Emiliani]] adds 10,000 to AD years, so that AD 1 would be the year 10,001.&lt;ref&gt;Cesare, E. (1993). [Correspondence]. ''Nature, 336'', 716.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Anno Lucis]]'' of [[Freemasonry]] adds 4000 years to the AD year.

===Islamic===
*[[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] (or AH) – for the Latinized ''[[Anno Hegirae]]'', meaning "in the year of the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]", [[Muhammad]]'s flight from Mecca to Medina in September 622, which occurred in its first year, used in the [[Islamic calendar]]. Since the Islamic calendar is a purely [[lunar calendar]] of about 354 days, its year count increases faster than that of [[solar calendar|solar]] and [[lunisolar calendar]]s.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}
*[[A.H.S.]] (or AHS){{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} is used by the [[Iranian calendar]] to denote the number of ''solar'' years since the Hijra. The year beginning at the vernal equinox equals the number of the Gregorian year beginning at the preceding January 1 minus 621.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}

===Hindu===
*[[Hindu calendar]], counting from the start of the [[Kali Yuga]], with its epoch on February 18, 3102 BC Julian (January 23, 3102 BC Gregorian), based on Aryabhata (6th century).
*[[Vikrama Samvat]], 56-57 BC, introduced about the 12th century.
*[[Saka Era|S.E.]] or (SE) – for the [[Saka|Saka Era]], used in some [[Hindu calendar]]s and in the [[Indian national calendar]], with an epoch near the vernal equinox of year 78 (its year 0); its usage spread to Southeast Asia before year 1000. This era is also used (together with the Gregorian calendar) in the Indian national calendar, the official civil calendar used in communiques issued by the Government of India.

===Southeast Asia===
The Hindu Saka Era influences the calendars of southeast Asian [[Greater India|indianized kingdom]]s.
*[[Buddhist calendar|B.E.]] – for the [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]], introduced by [[Vajiravudh]] in 1912, which has an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] (origin) of 544 BC. This year is called year 1 in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Burma]], but year 0 in [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]. Thus the year 2500 B.E. occurred in 1956 in the former countries, but in 1957 in the latter. In Thailand in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era, dating from the founding of [[Bangkok]] on April 6, 1782. In 1912 New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941 Prime Minister [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [[Thai solar calendar]] using the Thai Buddhist Era aligned to the western solar calendar.
*'''BE''' for Burmese Era – from [[Burmese calendar]] originally with an epochal year 0 date of 22 March 638; from which derived '''CS''' for [[Chula Sakarat]] era; variously known as '''LE''' Lesser Era; '''ME''' Minor Era – the Major or Great Era being the [[Saka Era]] of the [[Indian national calendar]]
:B.E. of the Bahá'í calendar is below.

===Bahá'í===
*[[Bahai calendar|B.E.]] – The [[Bahá'í calendar]] dates from the year of the declaration of the [[Báb]]. Years are counted in the Bahá'í Era (BE), which starts its year 1 from March 21, 1844.

===Jewish===
*[[Anno Mundi|A.M.]] (or AM) – for the Latin ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', meaning "in the year of the world", has its epoch in the year 3761 BC. This was first used to number the years of the modern [[Hebrew calendar]] in 1178 by [[Maimonides]]. Precursors with epochs one or two years later were used since the 3rd century, all based on the [[Seder Olam Rabba]] of the 2nd century. The year beginning in the northern autumn of 2000 was 5761 AM).

===Zoroastrian===
*The [[Zoroastrian calendar]] used regnal years since the reform by [[Ardeshir I]], but after the fall of the [[Sassanid empire]], the ascension of the last Sassanid ruler, [[Yazdegerd III of Persia]], crowned June 16, 632, continued to be used as the reference year, abbreviated [[Yazdegerd era|Y.Z.]] or "Yazdegerd era".

==Modern==
{{main|List of calendars}}

===Political===
*The Republican Era of the [[French Republican Calendar]] was dated from September 22, 1792, the day of the proclamation of the [[French First Republic]]. It was used in Revolutionary France from October 24, 1793 (on the Gregorian calendar) to December 31, 1805.
*The [[Positivist calendar]] of 1844 takes 1789 as its epoch.
*The [[Minguo calendar|Republican era]] is used by the [[Republic of China]] since 1912, which is the first year of the republic. Coincidentally, this is the same as the [[Juche#Calendar|Juche era]] used in [[North Korea]], the year of the birth of its founder [[Kim Il-Sung]].
* The [[Era Fascista]] 'Fascist Era' was instituted by the [[Fascism|Italian Fascists]] and used [[Roman numerals]] to denote the number of years since the [[March on Rome]] in 1922. Therefore, 1934, for example, was XII E.F. (''era fascista''). This era was abolished with the fall of fascism in Italy on July 25, 1943, but restored in the northern part of the country during the [[Italian Social Republic]]. The Gregorian calendar remained in simultaneous use and a double numbering was adopted: the year of the [[Common era]] was presented in Arabic numerals and the year of the fascist era in Roman numerals. The year of the Fascist calendar began on October 29, so, for example, October 27, 1933 was XI E.F. but October 30, 1933 was XII E.F.
*China traditionally reckoned by the regnal year of its emperors, see [[Chinese era name]]. Most Chinese do not assign numbers to the years of the [[Chinese calendar]], but the few who do, like expatriate Chinese, use a continuous count of years from the reign of the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]], using 2698 BC as year 1. Western writers begin this count at either 2637 BC or 2697 BC (see [[Chinese calendar#Beginnings|Chinese calendar]]). Thus, the Chinese years 4637, 4697, or 4698 began in early 2000.
*In Korea, from 1952 until 1961 years were numbered via ''[[Dangun#Dating|Dangi]]'' years, where 2333 BC was regarded as the first such year.
*The [[Assyrian calendar]], introduced in the 1950s, has its era fixed at 4750 BC.
*The [[Japanese calendar]] dates from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan]]. The current emperor took the throne in early 1989, which became Heisei 1, which was until then Shōwa 64 (for its first seven days).
*The [[United States]] government sometimes uses a calendar of the era of its [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence]], fixed on July 4, 1776, together with the ''Anno Domini'' civil calendar. For instance, its [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] is dated "the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html U.S. Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presidential proclamation (United States)|Presidential proclamations]] are also dated in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/ The White House: Presidential Actions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
*[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health#Role in Scientology|A.D.]] – "After [[Dianetics]]". In [[Scientology]], years are numbered relative to the first publication of the book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' (1950).&lt;ref name="LATcostly"&gt;Sappell, J., &amp; Welkos, R. W. (1990, June 28). [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062890,0,6570814.story Costly Strategy Continues to Turn Out Bestsellers]. ''Los Angeles Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Discordian calendar|Y.O.L.D.]] – In the [[Discordian calendar]], the standard designation for the year number is YOLD (Year of [[Eris (mythology)|Our Lady of Discord]]). The calendar begins counting from January 1, 1166 BC in the [[Discordian]] year 0, ostensibly the date of origin of the [[Greyface|Curse of Greyface]]. An alternate designation, A.D.D. has been occasionally seen (Anno Domina Discordia, a Latin translation of YOLD, but presumably also a play on [[attention deficit disorder]]).
*e.v. – ''Era vulgaris''. (From Latin, meaning "common era", usually stylized in lowercase.) The [[Thelemic]] calendar is used by some Thelemites to designate a number of years since [[Aleister Crowley]]'s inauguration of the so-called [[Aeon_(Thelema)#Aeon_of_Horus|Aeon of Horus]], which occurred on March 20, 1904, and coincides with both the Thelemic new year and a holiday known as the Equinox of the Gods. The abbreviation "A.N.", for ''Aerae Novae'' ("New Era" in Latin), is sometimes also used.

===Practical===
*[[Before Present|B.P.]] – for [[Before Present]], specifically, the number of [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] years before 1950.
*[[Human Era|HE]] – for counting elapsed years of the [[Holocene]] from near the beginning of the [[Neolithic revolution]] of the [[Holocene epoch]], specifically by adding exactly 10,000 years to AD (Anno Domini) or CE (Common Era) years, and subtracting BC/BCE years from 10001.
*[[Julian day number]] – for counting days, not years, its era fixed at noon January 1, 4713 BC in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]]. This equals November 24, 4714 BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]. From noon of this day to noon of the next day was day 0. Multiples of 7 are Mondays. Negative values can also be used. Apart from the choice of the zero point and name, this Julian day and Julian date are not related to the [[Julian calendar]]. It does not count years, so, strictly speaking, it has no era, but it does have an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]. Today (noon-to-noon UTC) the value is {{#expr:({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}-0.5) round 0}}.
* [[Unix time]] – for counting elapsed seconds since the [[Unix epoch]] set at 00:00:00 or midnight UTC of January 1, 1970, though there are problems with Unix implementation of [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC).

{{Hermeticism}}

The '''Church of Light''' was incorporated  November 2, 1932 in Los Angeles, California. Its mission is  “to teach, practice, and disseminate The Religion of The Stars, a way of life for the Aquarian Age, as set forth in writings of C.C. Zain.”  The Church is the continuation of an initiatic organization, the Brotherhood of  Light, established in the same city in 1915. The 1932 reorganization as The Church of Light was a response to ordinances passed that year by Los Angeles County “prohibiting both the teaching and practice of astrology.”&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Christopher, "The Religion of the Stars: The Hermetic Philosophy of C.C. Zain",''Gnosis Magazine'', Winter 1996, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Brotherhood of Light==
[[File:Elbert Benjamine AKA C. C. Zain.gif|thumb|left|upright=1.3|alt=Refer to caption|Elbert Benjamine AKA C. C. Zain]]
The Church is the continuation of an initiatic organization, the Brotherhood of  Light, established also in Los Angeles in 1915. The Brotherhood of  Light lessons, on the three branches of occult science, were written between the spring of 1910 and 1950 by Elbert Benjamine (also known as C.C. Zain, born Benjamin Parker Williams).&lt;ref&gt;Volume XVI titled 'Stellar Anatomy' Copyright, 1947, Serial No. 197 Reprinted December, 1966 The Church of Light, Los Angeles, California&lt;/ref&gt;  Benjamine had been invited in 1909 by the leaders of the [[Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor]] (HBofL) in Denver to join them as successor to Minnie Higgin, who had been the order’s astrologer until her death that year.&lt;ref&gt;"Elbert Benjamine", ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology,'' 5th ed. (Detroit: Gale, 2000.)&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving Council members  proposed to Benjamine that he rewrite the order’s teachings in a systematic form as the basis for a new organization that would “bring occultism to the life of ordinary people.”&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Mitch, ''Occult America'' (New York: Bantam, 2009), 217&lt;/ref&gt; This change was inspired by orders from [[Max Theon]] to close the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor following the death of his wife the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, Chanel, and Deveney, eds., ''The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor''. (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1995), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; After five years of preparation and study, Elbert Benjamine came to Los Angeles in 1915 and began to hold meetings. “At that point it still operated as a secret society. On November 11, 1918, the Brotherhood of Light opened its doors to the public, offering classes and a home-study course.”&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Christopher, "The Religion of the Stars: The Hermetic Philosophy of C.C. Zain,''Gnosis Magazine'', Winter 1996,61.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Influences===
Astro-Philosophical Publications, founded in Denver in 1892, was a publishing arm of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor created by Henry and Belle Wagner. The authors it published included Thomas H. Burgoyne and Sarah Stanley Grimke, both cited by Benjamine as sources of Brotherhood teachings. He accorded the same status to  ''Ghost Land'' and ''Art Magic'' by [[Emma Hardinge Britten]].&lt;ref&gt;Zain, C.C., ''Laws of Occultism'', (Los Angeles: The Church of Light, 1994), 152,156.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early HBofL member, [[Genevieve Stebbins]], relocated to California from England in 1917 with her husband Norman Astley, and provided assistance to the Benjamines in establishing the Brotherhood of Light.&lt;ref&gt;"C.C. Zain", Greer, John Michael, ''The New Encyclopedia of the Occult''.(St. Paul, MN: LLewellyn, 2003, 527.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founders==
The 1932 reorganization as The Church of Light was a response to ordinances passed that year by [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] “prohibiting both the teaching and practice of astrology.” The three founding officers were 

*C.C. Zain, pen name of Elbert Benjamine (1882-1951) - President
*Fred Skinner (1872-1940) - Vice President
*Elizabeth D. Benjamine (1875-1942) - Secretary-Treasurer

==Schisms==

Following the 1943 remarriage of Elbert Benjamine, his son and heir apparent Will Benjamine departed in acrimony and established the Stellar Ministry, “a short-lived religious group that taught a mixture of Hermeticism and Christianity.” &lt;ref name="GibsonChristopher"&gt;Gibson, Christopher, "The Religion of the Stars: The Hermetic Philosophy of C.C. Zain",''Gnosis Magazine'', Winter 1996, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this interim disharmony, Church of Light membership continues to steadily grow with continual newcomers.

==Activities==

The 21 volume Brotherhood of Light lessons are publicly accessible to nonmembers of the church, but only members participate in a system of written examinations covering each volume. Each examination passed advances the member one degree. Seven volumes each are devoted to astrology, alchemy, and magic. Students who complete all 21 degrees (including examinations) are awarded a “Hermetician’s Certificate.”&lt;ref name="GibsonChristopher" /&gt;

Church headquarters were located through 1999 at 117 (later 2341) Coral Street in Los Angeles, which had been the home of the Benjamines.  After several years based in Brea, California, in 2005 it relocated to Albuquerque,  New Mexico. Regular classes and services are held at its headquarters, 2119 Gold Avenue, many of which are viewable as live streams and archived on the church website. The current president is Christopher Gibson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.light.org/meet-the-staff.cfm ''Meet the Staff'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of neon objects''' is the process of caring for and maintaining neon objects (artworks), and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to insure their long-term viability, when desired.

==Neon Technology==
[[Georges Claude]], a French engineer, developed neon technology in 1910.  Claude introduced neon technology in [[Paris]], and it later became popular in America during the 1920s for use in advertising signage. Its popularity rose until the 1940s, after which neon signage was used less due to the invention of inexpensive plastics.

Neon lights are low-pressure gas discharge bulbs. They produce light by charging [[noble gases]] in glass cathode tubes with electricity.

===Tubes===
Neon bulbs are composed of noble gases sealed in glass tubing. The tubing can be bent by a professional glass blower or neon vendor into a variety of shapes to produce different imagery or text. The tube is vacuum-pumped to remove all air, after which a small amount of selected gases are pumped into the tube prior to permanently sealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stern |first=Rudi |date=1979 |title=Let There Be Neon |url=https://www.amazon.com/Let-there-neon-Rudi-Stern/dp/0810912554 |location=New York |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers |page=132 |isbn=0-8109-1255-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each end of the tube is fitted with metal terminals called electrodes, also as known as cathodes.  When the electrodes are connected an energy source, the tube will glow as the gas becomes electrically excited. Different gases produce different colors; in addition, the glass tubing can also be coated or tinted, and different tubing and gas combinations produce a range of 150 colors.

===Gases===
Noble gases are sealed inside airtight cathode tubes, and produce light when they are electrically excited. Different gases and gas combinations will produce different colors, and are used in varying degrees in neon lights:
{| class="wikitable"

==Neon in fine art==
Prior to the 1960s, neon technology was associated with advertising and was not considered fine art. In the 1960s, visual artists began experimenting with neon in mixed media and installation artworks. Prominent neon artworks during this time include [[Jasper Johns]]’ ''Field Painting'' (c. 1963-1964), [[James Rosenquist|James Rosenquist’s]] ''Tumbleweed'' (1963-1966), and [[Robert Rauschenberg|Robert Rauschenberg’s]] ''Green Shirt'' (1965-1967).

Chryssa, a Greek artist, is largely credited with establishing neon as a visual art form. She was very active in the 1960s and 70s and created large-scale works with a focus on and constant incorporation of neon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/arts/chryssa-artist-who-saw-neons-potential-as-a-medium-dies-at-79.html |title=Chryssa, Artist Who Saw Neon’s Potential as a Medium, Dies at 79|last=Fox|first=Margalit|publisher=Arts |date=18 January 2014 |website=The New York Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists began exploring the neon technology in 1970s, and have continued to do so in contemporary art making.

Some artists both design and create neon artworks by learning the skill set; however, the majority of artists rely on professional neon vendors to fabricate artworks following the artists’ design.

Neon artworks can be found in many permanent public collections, including the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], Chicago, IL, and the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington, D.C. In 1981, [[Lili Lakich]] and Richard Jenkins founded the [[Museum of Neon Art]] (MONA) in Los Angeles, whose collection preserves and exhibits historical neon advertisements and neon fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-neon-downtown25-2009sep25-story.html |title=L.A.'s Museum of Neon Art is Glowing, Glowing, Gone|last=DiMassa|first=Cara Mia|date=25 September 2009 |website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the museum closed its Los Angeles location, and reopened in November, 2015, in [[Glendale, California]].

==Collection care and maintenance of neon artworks==

===Unpacking===
Unpacking a neon artwork slowly and carefully will help avoid damage. As the glass tubes are fragile, they may become damaged during shipping. Preparing a condition report of the work after receipt will document if any of the tubes or components were cracked or broken during transit, and can be addressed prior to display. Unpacking artworks in teams of at least two people will better allow safer handling of the work, and may aid in documentation and recording.

===Cleaning===
Over time, neon artworks may collect dust. To ensure safety of personnel and the artwork, neon artworks should be turned off and unplugged prior to any cleaning. Trained professionals may undertake cleaning the work with approved materials such as a feather duster or dry paintbrush. The use of water or other cleaning liquids may pose a safety hazard due to potential contact with the electrical components. A professional conservator, specialist, or electrician should be consulted whenever:

*Any component of the artwork requires more than a light dusting.
*Part or all of the neon tubes are flickering/failing to illuminate.
* There is any rusting of the metal support structures. 
*The piece incurs any damage.

===Electrical safety===
'''Outlets:''' Neon artworks require electricity in order to function. A building electrical engineer should always be consulted prior to installing and displaying a neon artwork to confirm safe use of an electrical outlet. An outlet should never be overloaded. If an outlet feels warm, an electrician should be consulted before further use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nfpa.org/safety-information/for-consumers/causes/electrical/electrical-safety-in-the-home/electrical-safety-tips|title=Electrical Safety Tips |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=National Fire Prevention Association |access-date=2 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cords:''' Electrical cords connecting a neon artwork to a power source should be checked on a regular basis for any signs of fraying or wear and tear. The placement of cords is also important. If cords are run in high traffic areas, they may pose a tripping hazard to visitors, which could potentially result in personal injury and damage to the cord and/or artwork. The placement of cords in and against walls and out of traffic areas provide better safety and use. Use of [[extension cords]] are not recommended, as they increase the risk of potential electrical and tripping hazards. Review of the artwork and its installation, including outlet and cord placement,by curatorial, installation, and electrical staff will help ensure the safety of the artwork.

'''Transformers:''' A transformer  is used to convert electricity into use by the neon sign. Transformers last approximate ten to fifteen years, and older transformers may fail or pose safety risks, and require replacement. Failure to replace an older transformer may result in flickering in the neon artwork, or complete failure to light. It is important to consult an electrical engineer or professional to confirm the voltage type and requirements for the replacement transformer. When cataloging a neon artwork, the transformer type and age may be noted in the artwork record, along with a reminder about potential future transformer replacements.

Like other media, neon artworks should be monitored and condition reports performed on a regular basis. If an artwork appears to flicker or fails to illuminate, the work can first be assessed on display. Potential problems may include damage to the tubes, disruptions to the electrical components, including frayed wires or unplugged cords, or potential disruptions of the electrical supply (such as a power outage in the building or circuit). Prior to removing from display, the work should be turned off and disconnected from the electrical source. Flickering may indicate a problem with gas pressures inside the tubes (possibly a result of age and/or damaged tubes) or a failing transformer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/25-signs.htm|title=The Preservation of Historic Signs|last=Auer |first=Michael J. |date=October 1991| publisher=Preservation Briefs|website=National Park Service|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling damaged neon===
Cracked or damaged neon tubes present potential health risks from contact with broken glass and exposure to mercury, a heavy metal contaminant, in gas form.  Though any mercury vapor, if present, will be in small amounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMERC Fact Sheet Mercury Use in Lighting|url=http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/imerc/factsheets/lighting.cfm |date=2008|website=Interstate Mercury Education &amp; Reduction Clearinghouse|publisher=Northeast Management Waste Officials' Association|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; steps should still be taken to avoid contamination. If a neon tube appears damaged, it should not be handled. If handling is required for removal, barrier gloves, such as nitrile, and protective covering, such an apron or smock, will help avoid potential contamination to personnel. Broken tubes should be stored separately from other collection items to avoid contamination, and clearly labeled with hazard labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Contaminated Museum Collections|url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/upload/Contaminated_Collections_FAQs.pdf|date=2006 |website=Interior Museum|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broken tubes will require assessment from a professional conservator/neon specialist.

==Re-fabrication==
Neon technology is non-archival. The gases have limited lifespans, and older electrical components will degrade over time. This may result in a limited display capacity for a neon work, e.g. diminished or intermittent light, or a complete loss of function, as well as pose safety risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winslow|first1=Margaret|title=Conservation of Rafael Ferrer's Neon Corner|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/http://www.delart.org/conservation-of-rafael-ferrers-neon-corner/|publisher=Delaware Art Museum|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other traditional art mediums, such as painting, conservation for neon artworks and other new materials does not necessarily focus on preserving and repairing the original materials. As neon is a newer technology and media, there is less data available about how the media changes over time and how to inhibit further degradation. In order to successfully conserve a contemporary artwork such as neon, the conservator must 
* identify the materials and understand are they were applied and function.
*collect detailed information about their alteration overt time.
*preserve the artist's intent, which must therefore be documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chiantore|first1=Oscar|last2=Rava |first2=Antonio|date=2012 |title=Conserving Contemporary Art: Issues, Methods, Materials, and Research |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|page=16 |isbn=978-1-60606-104-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the media or technology cannot be safely recovered or addressed, new and replacement technology may be used to return the artwork closest to the state originally envisioned by the artist. This refabrication may be undertaken by a conservator, or potentially by the artist himself/herself. This may include replacing the neon tubes, electrical components such as cords and transformers, the work's support structure, or other media included in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hileman|first1=Kristen|title=BMA Voices: Re-fabricating a beloved sculpture|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/bma-voices-re-fabricating-a-beloved-sculpture/|website=BMA Blog|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of refabrication is the conservation of [[Rockne Krebs]]' ''Miami Line''. In 1984, the Miami-Dade County's Art in Public Places program commissioned Krebs to create a public artwork for the Metrorail bridge. The resulting work, ''Miami Line'', consisted of a rainbow of neon lights spanning the 1,540 bridge. Over time, the vibrations caused by trains on the bridge caused the neon lights to burn out, and by 2013, the entire work was no longer illuminated. The Art in Public Places program worked with the artist's estate to develop a plan to recreate the work using LED lights, which would be resistant to train vibrations, but still maintain the visual effect created by the artist. Electrical assessments and conservation of the work began in 2014, and the work will be relit upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art in Public Places Annual Report 2014|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/mayor/library/memos-and-reports/2015/04/04.22.15-Art-in-Public-Places-Annual-Report-FY-2014.pdf|publisher=Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs|page=10|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a potentially burnt out neon tube, a conservator may identify the burned out tube portion of a neon artwork through use of a neon light tester, also known as a [[test light]] or voltage tester. This electronic test device is used to determine whether an electric current is running through the equipment being tested.

==Replication==
Replication differs from Re-fabrication in that the original artwork is not altered, and instead a copy is produced for temporary exhibition purposes. While the replica may not contain the same materials used in the original artwork, the finished product is approximately identical of the original.

Replication can only be undertaken with the approval of the artist or the artist’s estate. Bruce Nauman is an artist who requires four criteria be met to replicate his original neon artworks. These criteria are:
# The original neon must still be in existence and in working order.
# The current owner must agree to loan the work prior to the creation of a replica.
# The display credit line for the loaned artwork acknowledges the work on view is an exhibition copy and acknowledges the owner of the original artwork.
# The replica will be destroyed at the completion of the exhibition, which must be proven through photographic documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conservation of Bruce Nauman's Neon Templates|url=http://theglasshouse.org/learn/the-conservation-of-bruce-naumans-neon-templates/|website=The Glass House |publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6953">'''Descriptive research''' is used to describe characteristics of a  [[statistical population|population]] or phenomenon being studied.   It does not answer questions about how/when/why  the characteristics occurred.  Rather it addresses the "what" question (what are the characteristics of the population or situation being studied?)&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields|Shields, Patricia]] and Rangarajan, N. 2013. A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. See Chapter 4 for an in-depth discussion of descriptive research&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics used to describe the situation or population are usually some kind of categorical scheme also known as descriptive categories. For example, the [[periodic table]] categorizes the elements. Scientists use knowledge about the nature of electrons, protons and neutrons to devise this categorical scheme. We now take for granted the [[periodic table]], yet it took descriptive research to devise it.  Descriptive research generally precedes explanatory research. For example, over time  the periodic table’s description of the elements allowed scientists to explain chemical reaction and make sound prediction when elements were combined.
Hence, descriptive research cannot describe what caused a situation.  Thus, descriptive research cannot be used as the basis of a ''[[Causality|causal relationship]]'', where one variable affects another. In other words, descriptive research can be said to have a low requirement for [[internal validity]].

The description is used for [[frequency (disambiguation)|frequencies]], [[average]]s and other statistical calculations.  Often the best approach, prior to writing descriptive research, is to conduct a survey investigation. [[Qualitative research]] often has the aim of ''description'' and researchers may follow-up with examinations of why the observations exist and what the implications of the findings are.

==Social science research==
In addition, the conceptualizing of descriptive research (categorization or taxonomy) precedes the hypotheses of explanatory research.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia and HassanTajalli. 2006. Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link in Successful Student Scholarship. Journal of Public Affairs Education. Vol. 12, No. 3. Pp. 313-334. http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/39/&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of how the underlying conceptualization of [[Exploratory research]], Descriptive research and explanatory research fit together see [[Conceptual framework]].
Descriptive research is also known as Statistical Research. The main goal of this type of research is to describe the data and characteristics about what is being studied. The idea behind this type of research is to study frequencies, averages, and other statistical calculations. Although this research is highly accurate, it does not gather the causes behind a situation. Descriptive research is mainly done when a researcher wants to gain a better understanding of a topic. That is, analysis of the past as opposed to the future. Descriptive research is the exploration of the existing certain phenomena. The details of the facts won't be known. The existing phenomena’s facts are not known to the person.

==Descriptive science==
Descriptive science is a category of [[science]] that involves descriptive research; that is, observing, recording, describing, and classifying [[phenomena]].  Descriptive research is sometimes contrasted with [[Hypothesis testing|hypothesis-driven research]], which is focused on testing a particular [[hypothesis]] by means of [[experimentation]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite journal

[[David Grimaldi (entomologist)|David A. Grimaldi]] and [[Michael S. Engel]] suggest that descriptive science in biology is currently undervalued and misunderstood:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Descriptive" in science is a pejorative, almost always preceded by "merely," and typically applied to the array of classical -ologies and -omies: anatomy, archaeology, astronomy, embryology, morphology, paleontology, taxonomy, botany, cartography, stratigraphy, and the various disciplines of zoology, to name a few. [...] First, an organism, object, or substance is not described in a vacuum, but rather in comparison with other organisms, objects, and substances. [...] Second, descriptive science is not necessarily low-tech science, and high tech is not necessarily better. [...] Finally, a theory is only as good as what it explains and the evidence (i.e., descriptions) that supports it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1641%2FB570802 BioScience Volume 57, Issue 8 (September 2007)] article ''Why Descriptive Science Still Matters'' by D.A. Grimaldi &amp; M.S. Engel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A negative attitude by scientists toward descriptive science is not limited to biological disciplines: [[Ernest Rutherford|Lord Rutherford's]] [[Ernest rutherford#Famous statements|notorious quote]], "All science is either physics or stamp collecting," displays a clear negative attitude about descriptive science, and it is known that he was dismissive of [[astronomy]], which at the beginning of the 20th century was still gathering largely descriptive data about stars, nebulae, and galaxies, and was only beginning to develop a satisfactory integration of these observations within the framework of [[physical law]], a cornerstone of the [[philosophy of physics]].{{According to whom|date=November 2014}}

==Descriptive versus design sciences==
[[Ilkka Niiniluoto]] has used the terms "descriptive sciences" and "design sciences" as an updated version of the distinction between [[Basic research|basic]] and [[applied science]].  According to Niiniluoto, descriptive sciences are those that seek to describe reality, while design sciences seek useful knowledge for human activities.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;[http://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/praatika/Valuefreedom%20of%20science.DOC Heikki J.

The '''Diploma in Engineering''' or '''Diploma in Technical Education''' are programs focused on practical and skills-oriented training. It is a technical degree that only covers the essentials when ranked with an undergraduate engineering degree. It aims to provide students with industry or job related engineering knowledge, scientific skills, computing &amp; analysis, mathematical techniques, a sound knowledge of English to communicate in the field and ability to apply problem solving techniques.

Its duration is 2–3 years. Many countries in the world recognize it as equivalent to Pre-Engineering or Bridging course when considered for continuing studies in engineering related bachelors or associate degree programs. After successful completion of Diploma in Engineering course, students can either continue further Engineering studies in undergraduate level or get employment as technicians, technologists, supervisors, superintendents, foremen, machinist, workshop technicians, draughtsman, station technicians (energy, thermal, aeronautical), automobile technicians, maintenance &amp; service technicians, equipment mechanics and technicians, [[CAD/CAM]] programmer, agricultural overseers, instrument technicians, junior instructors, manufacturing, tool and die designers, electricians...etc.

In most of the countries one can apply for studying diploma in engineering degree after completion of [[10th grade]] ([[Secondary School Certificate]]).

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5874">The '''directed listening and thinking activity''' (DLTA) is a strategy that was first identified by Stauffer (1980). It is used with [[early childhood]] students or students who are not yet successful [[independent reading|independent readers]]. Teachers use this strategy to establish a purpose for reading with their students. With the use of this strategy students can become engaged in a text that they could not otherwise read on their own. Students are prepared to listen to a story that will be read by their teacher by being given specific information that they are to focus on as they listen. The strategy utilizes pre-reading, reading, and post-reading questions and discussions. Teachers use this strategy in an attempt to build on the knowledge that students already know and apply it to new information and situations. Students are provided with a framework to organize and recall information from storybooks. The directed reading and thinking activity is a very similar strategy that can be applied once this strategy is mastered and students become more advanced, independent readers.

==Purpose==
Students need to be explicitly taught strategies for the [[reading comprehension|comprehension]] of a story. The purpose of this strategy is to give the students skills so that they can eventually internalize reading skills such as, setting purposes for reading and [[:wikt:summarize|summarizing]] what they have read. As a result of continuously using this strategy in the classroom students should develop [[metacognition]] of their own reading abilities and as a result a better comprehension, understanding, and connections to texts.

==Procedure==
===Preparing for reading===

===Reading the story===
The teacher now begins to read the story. It is important to make sure that students can see all of the [[Book illustration|illustrations]]. The teacher should stop one or two times to discuss the story and to ask the students which previous predictions were correct. Students should also continue to make predictions at a few points in the story as well. It is important not to ask too many questions while reading the story. To help students to focus attention on the story, it is better to wait until after reading it through once to ask most of the questions about the students’ reactions, comments, and questions.

===Discussion after reading===
This is the final part of the directed listening and thinking activity. At this time there should be a discussion between the students and the teacher that is connected to the objectives and purposes for reading that were originally established. For example, if the skill that was established was sequencing the students will need to recall information about the order of the events in the story. The end is a way to tie together the skills that the students were focusing on and to summarize what they have learned as a result of listening to the story. If the students do not respond to particular questions that are asked about the story it is the teacher’s responsibility to model or scaffold their responses. This can be done by asking a question in a different or simpler way or by giving the student more information. This should also be a time to go back to the predictions that were initially listed and revise and discuss them. After the teacher has discussed the story and the objectives as a group an independent activity can be done to assess what the students have learned.

==Reading objectives==
There are a wide range of objectives that you can use with this strategy. Basically any skill that pertains to the text can be employed. Examples of the different types of skills that the directed listening activity can be used to enhance are: literal information such as, sequencing and recalling facts, inferential responses such as, interpreting the feelings of characters, making predictions, relating story events to real-life experiences and visualizing, or critical responses such as, evaluating and problem solving. The strategy can also be used with various genres and story structures. However, it is important to remember that the three steps to using this strategy are always the same:

#preparation for reading
#reading
#discussion after reading.

==Conclusion==
In a study conducted by Morrow (1984) children scored higher on comprehension tests when this strategy was utilized in the classroom because of its focus on many skills that are important to good readers. The study also proved that the modeling and scaffolding used by the teacher during this technique better prepared students to understand unfamiliar texts. When this strategy is used in classrooms it will allow students to better comprehend and connect with the texts that are being read to them. If this strategy is done correctly and frequently it will bring students more independence and [[reading readiness]]. It will lead to the creation of more engaged and skilled readers who possess the ability to [[critical thinking|think critically]] and analyze the texts that they have read.

'''Five Towns College''' is a [[for-profit colleges|for-profit]] college in [[Dix Hills, New York|Dix Hills]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==History==
Five Towns College was founded as a [[business school]] in 1972 by Lorraine Kleinman Cohen and Stanley G. Cohen, Ed.D. Programs at the college have expanded to cover popular music, theatre, film, and communications.

The original proposed site for this college was to be in [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]] in southwestern [[Nassau County, New York]], an area known as "The [[Five Towns]]", but the college was actually sited in [[Merrick, New York]]. Five Towns College moved to [[Seaford, New York]] in 1982 and to its current location in Dix Hills in [[Suffolk County, New York]] in 1992.

Although the college is a [[for-profit colleges|for-profit college]], its board of trustees and its founding president Stanley Cohen have argued that the college would be "better positioned to build an endowment if it were a nonprofit." Cohen, however, was removed from office in 2014 and shareholders have filed suit against the plan to make the college non-profit.&lt;ref name=Newsday_2014_05_23&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/stanley-cohen-five-towns-college-founder-ousted-by-trustees-1.8167224 |title=Five Towns College founder removed by trustees |author= |publisher=[[Newsday]] |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College is the licensee of [[WFTU (AM)|WFTU]], 1570&amp;nbsp;kHz, in [[Riverhead, New York]] a full-time AM broadcast station, which returned to the air in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=18238 |title=Station Search Details |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French Gothic architecture''' is a style which emerged in France in 1140, and was dominant until the mid-16th century. The most notable examples are the great Gothic cathedrals of France, including [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], [[Chartres Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  Its main characteristics were the search for verticality, or height, and the innovative use of [[flying buttress]]es and other architectural innovations to distribute the weight of the stone structures to supports on the outside, allowing unprecedented height and volume,  The new techniques also permitted the addition of larger windows, including enormous stained glass windows, which filled the cathedrals with light.  The French style was widely copied in other parts of northern Europe, particularly Germany and England.  It was gradually supplanted as the dominant French style in the mid-16th century by [[French Renaissance architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pages 46-54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
French Gothic architecture was the result of the emergence in the 12th century of powerful French state centered in the [[Ile-de-France]]. During the reign of [[Louis VI of France]] (1081-1137),  Paris was the principal residence of the Kings of France, [[Reims]]  the place of coronation, and the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] became their ceremonial burial place.  The Abbot of Saint-Denis,  [[Suger]], was a counselor of Louis VI and Louis VII, as well as an historian.  He oversaw the reconstruction of the ambulatory of Saint-Denis, making it the first and most influential example of Gothic architecture in France.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the later course of the [[Capetian dynasty]] (1180 to 1328), three Kings; [[Philip Augustus]] (1180-1223); [[Louis IX of France]] (1226-1270) and [[Philip le Bel]] (1285-1314) established France as the major economic and political power on the Continent. The period also saw the founding of the University of Paris or [[Sorbonne]].  It produced the high Gothic and the Flamboyant Gothic styles, and the construction of some of the most famous cathedrals, including [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rib vault===
The Gothic style emerged from innovative use of existing technologies, such as the pointed arch and the [[rib vault]].   The [[rib vault]] was known in the earlier Romanesque period, but it was not widely or effectively used until the Gothic period.  The crossed ribs of the vault carried the weight outwards and downwards, to clusters of supporting pillars and columns.  The earlier rib vaults, used at [[Sens Cathedral]] and [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]], had six compartments bordered by ribs and the crossing arch, which transferred the weight to alternating columns and pillars.  A new innovation appeared during the High Gothic: the four-part rib vault, which was used in [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Amiens Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]].  The ribs of this vault distributed the weight more equally to the four supporting pillars below, and established a closer connection  between the nave and the lower portions of the church walls, and between the arcades below and the windows above. This allowed for greater height and thinner walls, and contributed to the strong impression of verticality given by the newer Cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===The flying buttress===
The second major innovation of the Gothic style was the [[flying buttress]], which was first used at [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. This transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof outside the walls, where it was countered by the weight of the buttress.  Heavy stone pinnacles were added to the top of the buttresses, to precisely counterbalance the thrust from inside the walls. The buttress allowed a significant reduction in the thickness of the cathedral walls, and permitted the use of larger windows in the interior of the church.   In churches such as [[Sainte Chapelle]], thanks to buttresses, the walls were made almost entirely of stained glass.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of rib-vaults and buttresses brought gradual changes to the interior structure of cathedrals.  Early Gothic cathedrals had the walls of the nave built in four levels,  a gallery with columns on the ground level; then the tribune, a gallery with windows; then the triforium, a row of smaller windows, and finally the high windows. just below the vaults.   During the high Gothic period, with the development of the four part rib vault and the flying buttress, the tribune was eliminated at Chartres and other new cathedrals, allowing taller windows and arcades. By the 15th century, at Rouen Cathedral, the triforium also disappeared, and the walls between the traverses were filled with high windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pages 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

===The portal and tympanum===
Another innovative feature of the French Gothic cathedral  was the design of the portal or entry, which by long Christian tradition faced west. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had a triple portal, decorated with columns in the form of statues of apostles and saints around the doorways, and biblical scenes crowded with statuary over the doorways.  This  triple portal was adopted by all the major cathedrals.  A [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]]  over the portal, crowded with sculptural figures illustrating  a biblical story became a feature of Gothic cathedrals. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stained glass and the rose window===

Large [[stained glass]] windows and [[rose windows]] were another defining feature of the Gothic style.  Some Gothic windows, like those at Chartres, were cut into the stone walls. Other windows, such as those in the chapels of Notre-Dame and Reims, were in stone frames installed into the walls.  The most common form was an oculus, a small round window with two lancets, or windows with pointed arches, just below it.  The [[Rose window]] was the most famous type of the Gohtic style.  They were plead in the transepts and the portals to provide light to the nave. The largest rose windows were ten meters in diameter.  They had a framework of stone armatures often in an ornate floral pattern, to help them resist the wind.  Gothic windows were in a stone frame separate from the wall, not cut into the wall.

The early windows were made of pieces of tinted glass, touched up with grisaille painting, and held in place by pieces of lead that outlined the figures. As the windows grew larger, more intense colors were used.  After 1260, the colors became lighter, and the combination of  [[grisaille]] and pale shades of yellow became more common.  [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Le Mans Cathedral]] have some of the finest surviving original windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequence of Gothic styles==
The periods of French Gothic architecture are generally given as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pgs. 31-17&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Early Gothic''' '''Transition''' or '''Primitive Gothic''' (1130-1230)
* '''High Gothic''' or '''Classic Gothic''' (1230-1330)
* '''[[Rayonnant]]'''  (14th Century)
* '''[[Flamboyant]]''' (15th Century)
* '''Late Gothic'''  (16th Century)

Because of the lengthy period of construction of Gothic Cathedrals, very few were built in a single style.  Most, like Notre Dame, have a combination of features constructed in several different periods, as well as features constructed after the Gothic age.

==Early Gothic Style - Saint-Denis, Sens, Senlis, and Notre Dame==

File:Gothic architecture of Notre Dame de Paris.jpg|Flying buttress at [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] (1163-1345)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The birthplace of the new style was the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] in the [[Île-de-France]], not far north of Paris,  where in 1137 The [[Abbé Suger]] began the reconstruction of the [[Carolingian]]-era abbey church. He began building a new structure with two towers to the west of the original church, and then from  1140 to 1144  began to reconstruct the old church. Most of his modifications were traditional, but he made one remarkable innovation; he decided to create a new choir at the east end of the building, eliminating the traditional supporting walls of the old chapels, giving the interior a striking appearance of openness and greater height.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pages 46-54&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve his aims, Suger's masons drew on the several new elements which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture: the [[pointed arch]]; the ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]; the [[ambulatory]] with radiating chapels; and the columns wrapped in the ribs which supported the vaults.   The builders constructed the walls of the church in four levels;  the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], whose two rows of columns received the ribs of the ceiling vaults; the tribune above it, a gallery which concealed the massive contreforts or buttresses which pressed against the walls; the [[triforium]], another, narrower gallery;  and, just below the ceiling, the ''claire-voie'' or [[clerestorey]], where the windows were located.  All of these features had existed in the Romanesque period, but it was the first time had all been combined and the result differed  dramatically  from the previous Romanesque architecture.  Another innovation introduced by Suger was the use of columns in the form of statues of saints to decorate the portal of the church, adding a new element of verticality to the facade. This idea too was copied in new cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The new style quickly became known to the builders of new cathedrals, notably [[Sens Cathedral]], the first Gothic Cathedral  (begun 1135); [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new  Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the [[flying buttress]], heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Gothic Cathedrals: Chartres, Bourges, Reims, Amiens==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
From the end of the 12th century until the middle of the 13th century, the Gothic style spread from the cathedrals in Île-de-France to appear in other cities of northern France, notably  [[Chartres Cathedral]] (begun 1200); [[Bourges Cathedral]] (1195 to 1230), [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211–1275), and [[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1250);&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic Gothic elements were refined to make the new cathedrals taller, wider, and more full of light. At Chartres, the use of the flying buttresses allowed the elimination of the tribune level, which allowed much higher arcades and nave, and larger windows. The pillars were made of a central column surrounded by four more slender columns, which reached up to support the arches of the vaulted ceiling. The [[rib vault]] changed from six to four ribs, simpler and stronger. The [[flying buttress]]es at Amiens and Chartes were strengthened by with an additional arch and with a supporting arcade, allowing even higher and walls and more windows. At Reims, the buttresses were given greater weight and strength by the addition of heavy stone pinacles on top. These were often decorated with statues of angels, and became an important decorative element of the High Gothic style. Another practical and decorative element, the gargoyle, appeared; it was an ornamental rain spout which channeled the water from the roof away from the building. At Amiens, the windows of the nave were made larger, and an additional row of clear glass windows (the claire-voie) flooded the interior with light. The new structural technologies allowed the enlargement of the transepts and the choirs at the east end of the cathedrals, creating the space for a ring of well-lit chapels.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rayonnant Gothic - Sainte-Chapelle and the rose windows of Notre Dame==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The next period of French gothic architecture, from the second half of the 13th century until the 1370s, was termed ''Rayonnant'' ("Radiant"), describing the tendency  toward the use of more and more stained glass and less masonry in the design of the structure, until the walls seemed entirely made of glass.  The most celebrated example was the chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], attached to the royal residence on the [[Palais de la Cité]].  An elaborate system of exterior columns and arches reduced the walls of the upper chapel to a thin framework for the enormous windows. The weight of each of the masonry gables above the [[archivolt]] of the windows also helped the walls to resist the thrust and to distribute the weight.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Another landmark of the Rayonnant Gothic are the two rose windows on the north and south of the transept of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], whereas earlier rose windows, like those of [[Amiens Cathedral]], were framed by stone and occupied only a portion of the wall, these two windows, with a delicate lacelike framework, occupied the entire space between the pillars.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Flamboyant Gothic style appeared in the second half of the 14th century. Its characteristic features were more exuberant decoration, as the nobles and wealthy citizens of mostly northern French cities competed to build more and more elaborate churches and cathedrals. It took its name from the sinuous, flame-like designs which ornamented windows. Other new features included the ''arc en accolade'', a window decorated with an arch, stone pinnacles and floral sculpture. It also featured an increase in the number of ''nervures'', or ribs, that supported and decorated each vault of the ceiling, both for greater support and decorative effect.  Notable examples of Flamboyant Gothic include the western facade of [[Rouen Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] in Paris, both built in the 1370s; and the Choir of [[Mont Saint Michel Abbey]] (about 1448).&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous examples of Gothic architecture are found in the [[Île-de-France]] and [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], but other French regions created their own original versions of the style. The Angevin Gothic style in the province of [[Anjou]] features a vaults with elegant decorative ribs, as well as very ornate columns.  The style is found in the interior of [[Angers Cathedral]] (1032–1523), though many of the Gothic elements of the facade were replaced with Renaissance elements and towers. A very fine example of Angevin Gothic is found in the medieval Saint Jean Hospital in Angers, which now contains the Musée Jean-Lurçat, a museum of contemporary tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poitiers Cathedral]] in the historic province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] also features a distinctive regional Gothic style. It was begun in 1162 under KingH [[Henry II of England]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Its distinctive features, like those of Angevin Gothic, include convex vaults with ribs in decorative designs.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgundy also had its own version of Gothic, found in [[Nevers Cathedral]] (1211–1331), [[Dijon Cathedral]] (1280–1325), and [[Chalon Cathedral]] (1220–1522). The Burgundian Gothic tended to be more sober and monumental than the more ornate northern style, and often included elements of earlier romanesque churches on the same site.

The south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style : the [[Southern French Gothic]]. A prominent example is [[Albi Cathedral]] in the [[Tarn Department]], built between 1282 and 1480. It was originally constructed as a fortress, then transformed into a church. Due to a lack of suitable stone, it was constructed almost entirely of brick, and is one of the largest brick buildings in the world.

==Gothic civil architecture==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The largest civic building built in the Gothic style in France was the [[Palais des Papes]] (Palace of the Popes) constructed between 1252 and 1364, when the Popes fled the political chaos and wars enveloping Rome. Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.

In the 15th century, following the late Gothic or flamboyant period, some elements of Gothic decoration  borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in civil architecture, particularly in the region of [[Flanders]] in northern France, and in Paris. The Hôtel de Ville of [[Compiègne]] has an imposing  gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate ''accolades'' or ornamental arches. Similarly flamboyant town halls were found in [[Arras]], [[Douai]], and [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]], and across the border in Belgium in [[Brussels]] and [[Bruges]]. Unfortunately many of the finest buildings were destroyed during World War I,  due to their proximity to the front lines.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), page 64&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
Gothic features also appeared in the elaborate residences built by the nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie in Paris and other large cities.  examples include the [[Hôtel Cluny]] (now the [[Musée de Cluny – Musée national du Moyen Âge]]  in Paris, and particularly the palatial house built by merchant [[Jacques Cœur]] in [[Bourges]] (1440–50).  Another good example in Paris is the [[Tour Jean-sans-Peur]],  which features a Gothic watch tower and a flamboyant gothic ceiling.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the Middle Ages Prosperous French cities competed to build the largest cathedral or the highest tower. One of the drawbacks of French Gothic architecture was its immense cost; it required small armies of skilled craftsmen working intently for decades. Due to downturns in the economy, a notable number of French cathedrals were begun but never finished. They also sometimes suffered when the ambitions of the architects exceeded their technical skills. One example was [[Beauvais Cathedral]]. Its patrons and architects sought to build the tallest church in the world. with a vaulted choir 48 meters high, taller than its nearby competitor, [[Amiens Cathedral]], at 42 meters. Work began in 1225 but the roof of the vault was too heavy for the walls, and partially collapsed in 1272. They thickened the walls and rebuilt the vault and in 1569 they completed a tower, 72 meters high, which from 1569–1573  made Beauvais Cathedral the tallest structure in the world. However, in 1573, the new tower collapsed, fortunately without any casualties. The church remains today as it was, with the choir, some of the ambulatory, apse, some chapels, but no nave or tower.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Bonnet-Laborderie, ''La Cathédrale de Beauvais: histoire et architecture'', La Mie-au-Roy, G.E.M.O.B., 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1530s, the style of French religious and civil architecture also began to show the influence of the [[Italian Renaissance]].  [[Charles VIII of France]] and [[Louis XII of France]] had both participated in military campaigns in Italy, and had seen the new architecture there. Large numbers of Italian stonemasons had come to Paris to work on the new [[Pont Notre-Dame]] (1507–1512) and other construction sites. The [[Fontaine des Innocents]], built by sculptor [[Jean Goujon]] to celebrate the entrance of Henry II into Paris in 1549, was the first Renaissance monument in the city.  It was soon followed by the new facade of the Cour Carré of the [[Louvre]], also decorated by [[Jean Goujon]]. The new Paris [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]]  (1533–1568) was also constructed in an Italianate rather than Gothic style.  Most important of all, the new [[Tuileries Palace]] by [[Philippe Delorme]], built for [[Catherine de' Medici]], begun in 1564, was inspired by Italian palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Texier (2012) page 26–27)&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious –buildings were slower to change. The Church of the Carmes-Deschaussé (1613–1620) on rue Vaugirard in Paris, and especially the church of [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] by [[Salomon de Brosse]] (1615–21) with a facade based on the superposition of the three orders of classical architecture, represented the new model.  However, the Gothic style remained prominent in new churches.  The Church of [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint Eustache]] in Paris, (1532–1640) which rivaled Notre-Dame in size, combined a gothic plan with renaissance decoration.

In the course of the 17th century, the French classical style of [[François Mansart]] began to dominate; then, under Louis XIV, the grand French classical style, practiced by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], [[Louis Le Vau]], and [[Claude Perrault]], took center stage. Landmarks of the Gothic style, such as Notre-Dame, were modified with new interiors designed in the new style.  Following the new fashion of his patron, Louis XIV, the poet [[Molière]] ridiculed the Gothic style in a 1669 poem: "...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...".

During the [[French Revolution]], Gothic churches were symbols of the old regime and became targets for the Revolutionaries;  the cathedrals were nationalized, and stripped of ornament and valuables.  The statues of the Biblical figures on the facade of Notre-Dame were beheaded, under the false belief they were statues of the French Kings.  Under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the cathedrals were returned to the church, but were left in a lamentable state of repair.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]].   The new kind of fortification was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the center, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured.  The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example.  It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.

In the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round  were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other.  The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''Crénaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire  arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings  (''Merlons'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''Mâchicoulis''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''Échauguettes'' and ''Bretéches'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below.  In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''Meurtriéres'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbalètes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pgs. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Castles were surrounded by deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge.  The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed.    The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers, to  One good surviving example is the [[Château de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337-1453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants;  the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls.   The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, portions of the Gothic walls and towers of the city of [[Carcasonne]] were restored, with some modification,  by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]].  He also rebuilt the [[Château de Pierrefonds]], (1393-1407)  an unfinished medieval castle, making it into a neo-Gothic residence for [[Napoleon III]]. This project was incomplete when Napoleon III was overthrown in 1870, but can be visited today.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
A large part of the Gothic architectural heritage of France, particularly the churches and monasteries, had been damaged or destroyed during the Revolution. Of the 300 churches in Paris in the 16th century, only 97 still were standing in 1800. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had been stripped of its stained glass and monumental tombs, while the statues on the façade of the cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] had been beheaded and taken down. Throughout the country, churches and monasteries had been demolished or turned into barns, cafes, schools, or prisons. The first effort to catalog the remaining monuments was made in 1816 by Alexandre de Laborde, who wrote the first list of "Monuments of France". In 1831 interest in Gothic architecture grew even greater following the huge popular success of the romantic novel ''[[Notre-Dame de Paris (novel)|Notre-Dame de Paris]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]]. In 1832 Hugo wrote an article for the ''Revue des deux Mondes'' which declared war against the "massacre of ancient stones" and the "demolishers" of France's past. Louis Philippe declared that restoration of churches and other monuments would be a priority of his regime. In October 1830, the position of Inspector of Historical Monuments had been created by the Interior Minister, [[François Guizot]], a professor of history at the Sorbonne.  In 1833 Prosper Mérimée became its second Inspector, and by far the most energetic and long-lasting. He held the position for twenty-seven years.{{Sfn|Darcos|1998|pages=156–159}}

Under Louis Philippe,French Gothic architecture was officially recognized as a treasure of French culture.  Under Mérimée's direction, the first efforts to restore major Gothic monuments began. In 1835 The church of [[Saint-Séverin, Paris|Saint Séverin]] in Paris was among first to undergo restoration, followed in 1836 by  [[Sainte-Chapelle]],  which had been turned into a storage house for government archives after the Revolution,  The restoration of Saint-Chapelle as led by [[Félix Duban]] with [[Jean-Baptiste Antoine Lassus]] and a young [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]].   In 1843 Lassus and Viollet-le-Duc won the competition for restoration of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] &lt;ref&gt;Darcos (1988), page 156-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the rest of the 19th century, all of the major Gothic cathedrals of France underwent extensive restoration.

French Gothic architecture also experienced a modest  revival, largely confined to new churches. Neo-Gothic churches built in Paris included [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clothilde]] by [[Theodore Ballu]] (1841–57);  and [[Saint-Laurent, Paris]] by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862–65).  Jean=Baptiste  Lassus became the most prolific neo-Gothic architect in France, constructing Saint-Nicolas de Nantes (1840), Sacré-Coeur de Moulins (1849), Saint-Pierre de Dijon (1850), Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Belleville (1853) and the Église de Cusset (1855).{{sfn|Leniaud|2015}}   The [[Église Saint-Eugène-Sainte-Cécile|Saint-Eugene-Sainte-Cécile]] in Paris by Louis-Auguste Boileau and Adrien-Louis Lasson (1854–55) was the most innovative example of neo-Gothic;  it combined a traditional Gothic design with a modern iron framework.  [[Jules Verne]] was married in the church in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Texier (2012), pgs. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture and Symbolism - the "Book for the Poor"==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200"&gt;

File:Labyrinthchartres.jpg|[[Labyrinth]] of [[Chartres Cathedral]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Gothic cathedral was a ''liber pauperum'', literally a "book for the poor", covered with sculpture illustrating biblical stories, for the vast majority of parishioners who were illiterate. These largely illustrated stories from the Bible, but also included stories and figures from mythology and more complicated symbols taken from medieval philosophical and scientific teachings such as [[alchemy]].

The exteriors of Cathedrals and other Gothic churches were decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters, These included the [[gargoyle]], the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], the [[dragon]], the [[tarasque]], and others, taken largely from legend and mythology.  They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshipers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pages 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gargoyle]] also had a more practical purpose.  They were the rain spouts of the Cathedral; rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses to the mouths of the gargoyles.  The longer the gargoyle, the farther the water was projected from the walls, protecting the walls and windows from water damage.  Multiple numbers were used to distribute the water as widely as possible.

Amid all the religious figures, some of the sculptural decoration was devoted to illustrating medieval science and philosophy.  The porch of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris and of [[Amiens Cathedral]] are decorated with similar small carved figures holding circular plaques with symbols of transformation taken from alchemy.  The central pillar of the central door of Notre Dame features a statue of a woman on a throne holding a scepter in her left hand, and in her right hand, two books, one open (symbol of public knowledge), and the other closed (esoteric knowledge), along with a ladder with seven steps, symbolizing the seven steps alchemists followed in their scientific quest of trying to transform ordinary metal into gold.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pages 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common feature of Gothic cathedrals was a design of a [[labyrinth]], usually found in stone on the floor in a central part of the Cathedral.  Inapired by the labyrinth in Greek legend constructed by King [[Minos]] as the home of the [[Minotaur]],  In Cathedrals, they were known as the "Path of Jerusalem" and symbolized the difficult and often roundabout path that a Christian sometimes had to follow in life to reach the gates of Paradise and salvation. Large labyrinths were originally found in [[Auxerre Cathedral]], [[Sens Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Arras Cathedral]], but these removed during various renovations in the 18th century.  The best surviving examples are in [[Chartres Cathedral]], in its original form,  and in [[Amiens Cathedral]], which was reconstructed in 1894.

==Sculpture==
The portal sculpture of [[Burgundy]] integrates Classical, literary elements with its 13th century Gothic style. In [[Auxerre]], two such examples of sculptures are upon the Cathedral of [[Saint-Étienne]] depicting [[Hercules]], a satyr, and a sleeping faun; the Chartres–[[Reims]] cathedral's north transept illustrates the biblical tale of [[David]] and [[Bathsheba]]. The [[Sens Cathedral]]'s "Coronation of the Virgin" reflects a similar relief cathedral on the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris, and was created in a workshop that made minor contributions to [[Spanish Gothic architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Paul. "Gothic Sculpture 1140–1300". {{ISBN|978-0300074529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4352">'''Fuzzy rules''' are used within [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy logic systems]] to infer an output based on input variables. [[Modus ponens]] and [[modus tollens]] are the most important rules of inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A mathematical introduction to logic|last=B.|first=Enderton, Herbert|date=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0122384523|edition= 2nd|location=San Diego, Calif.|oclc=45830890}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A modus ponens rule is in the form
:Premise: ''x is A''
:Implication: '''''IF''' x is A '''THEN''' y is B''
:Consequent: ''y is B''

In crisp logic, the premise ''x is A'' can only be true or false. However, in a fuzzy rule, the premise ''x is A'' and the consequent ''y is B'' can be true to a degree, instead of entirely true or entirely false.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncertain rule-based fuzzy logic systems : introduction and new directions|last=1938-|first=Mendel, Jerry M.,|date=2001|publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|isbn=978-0130409690|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|oclc=45314121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved by representing the linguistic variables ''A'' and ''B'' using [[fuzzy set]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a fuzzy rule, modus ponens is extended to ''generalised modus ponens:.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''

:Premise: ''x is A''*
:Implication: '''''IF''' x is A '''THEN''' y is B''
:Consequent: ''y is B''*

The key difference is that the premise ''x is A'' can be only partially true. As a result, the consequent ''y is B'' is also partially true. Truth is represented as a [[real number]] between 0 and 1, where 0 is false and 1 is true.

== Comparison between Boolean and fuzzy logic rules ==
As an example, consider a rule used to control a three-speed fan. A binary IF-THEN statement may be

:'''IF'''   ''temperature'' &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; ''30''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is 3''

The disadvantage of this rule is that it uses a strict temperature as a threshold, but the user may want the fan to still function at this speed when temperature = 29.9. A fuzzy IF-THEN statement may be
:'''IF'''   ''temperature is hot''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is fast''

where ''hot'' and ''fast'' are described using [[fuzzy set]]s.

== Fuzzy rule connectors ==
Rules can connect multiple variables through [[fuzzy set operations]] using [[t-norm]]s and [[T-norm|t-conorms]].

'''T-norms''' are used as an ''AND'' connector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin Larsen|first=P.|date=1980|title=Industrial applications of fuzzy logic control|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020737380800502|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|volume=12|issue=1|pages=3–10|doi=10.1016/s0020-7373(80)80050-2|issn=0020-7373|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mamdani|first=E.H.|date=1974|title=Application of fuzzy algorithms for control of simple dynamic plant|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Electrical Engineers|volume=121|issue=12|pages=1585|doi=10.1049/piee.1974.0328|issn=0020-3270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fuzzy Set Theory - and Its Applications|last=H.-J.|first=Zimmermann,|date=1991|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401579490|edition= Second, revised|location=Dordrecht|oclc=851369348}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example,

:'''IF'''   ''temperature is hot '''AND''' humidity is high''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is fast''

A degree of truth is assigned to ''temperature is hot'' and to ''humidity is high.'' The result of a t-norm operation on these two degrees is used as the degree of truth that ''fan speed is fast''.

'''T-conorms''' are used as an ''OR'' connector.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example,

:'''IF'''   ''temperature is hot '''OR''' humidity is high''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is fast''

The result of a t-conorm operation on these two degrees is used as the degree of truth that ''fan speed is fast''.

The [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of a fuzzy set is used as a negator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example,

:'''IF'''   ''temperature is '''NOT''' hot''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is slow''

The fuzzy set ''not hot'' is the complement of ''hot.'' The degree of truth assigned to ''temperature is not hot'' is used as the degree of truth that ''fan speed is slow''.

T-conorms are less commonly used as rules can be represented by ''AND'' and ''OR'' connectors exclusively.

The '''Grantham Institute - Climate Change and Environment''' (formerly Grantham Institute for Climate Change) is one of five Global Institutes at [[Imperial College London]] and one of three Grantham sponsored centres in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk|title=Imperial College London|author=|date=|website=Imperial College London|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute was founded in 2007 with a £12m donation from the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granthamfoundation.org|title=Grantham Foundation|author=|date=|website=Grantham Foundation|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organisation set up by Hannelore and [[Jeremy Grantham]].

The Institute brings together climate and global environmental change expertise from across the College for [[climate change]] related research and translation into real world impact. Their aim is to improve the interaction between researchers and decision makers in business and governments, communicating research to help ensure that choices are based on the best understanding of the science and evidence available.

==Research==
Research at the Institute is focused on four core ‘themes’:  First, Earth systems science, including modelling of climate processes, and  biosphere-atmosphere interactions and feedbacks.  Second, Risks, extremes and irreversible change, including: the likelihood of extreme events in the future, and their potential impact. Third,  Sustainable futures, including   transition to a low-carbon economy,   natural mitigation and  carbon storage in ecosystems, and policy and market frameworks to support a low-carbon economy. Fourth, vulnerable ecosystems and human wellbeing, including the impact of environmental change and climate change on ecosystems,  and sustainable management plans and policy mechanisms to manage impacts.

==Policy implications==
A dedicated Policy Team  delivers research projects, publications, partnerships, and events, aimed at communicating the science behind global environmental change and its impacts. The team publishes Briefing Paper documents disseminating the scientific understanding, possible solutions, and outcomes to government, business and NGOs.

==Affiliated institutes==
The Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment also funds two other research institutes: one at the [[London School of Economics]], the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/Home.aspx|title=Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment|author=|date=|website=www2.lse.ac.uk|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other at the [[Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore]], the '''Divecha Centre for Climate Change'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://caos.iisc.ernet.in/divech.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Het Gulden Cabinet vande Edel Vry Schilder-Const''''' or '''''The Golden Cabinet of the Noble Liberal Art of Painting''''' is a book by the 17th-century Flemish notary and ''[[Chamber of rhetoric|rederijker]]'' [[Cornelis de Bie]] published in Antwerp.  Written in the [[Dutch language]], it contains artist biographies and [[panegyric]]s with engraved portraits of 16th- and 17th-century artists, predominantly from the [[Southern Netherlands]].  The work is a very important source of information on the artists it describes.  It formed the principal source of information for later art historians such as [[Arnold Houbraken]] and [[Jacob Campo Weyerman]].  It was published in 1662, although the work also mentions 1661 as date of publication.

==Background==
''Het Gulden Cabinet'' stands in a long tradition of artist biographies. This tradition goes back to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and was revived during the [[Renaissance]].  In 1550, the Italian [[Giorgio Vasari]] published his ''[[Vite]]'' on the lives of famous artists. [[Karel van Mander]] was the first author to introduce this genre in the Dutch language with his ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' of 1604.  Cornelis de Bie explicitly placed himself in the tradition of van Mander and did what van Mander did for 15th and 16th Netherlandish artists for 17th-century artists.

In his ''Het Gulden Cabinet'', de Bie presents himself as a ''rederijker'' whose duty it is to broadcast the fame of the artists.  By doing so he followed an existing tradition already seen in [[Dominicus Lampsonius]]' 1572 ''Pictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae Inferioris effigies'' and the Antwerp painter and rederijker [[Alexander van Fornenbergh]]'s 1658 ''Antwerpschen Proteus ofte Cyclopschen Apelles'', which sang the praises of the painter [[Quinten Matsys]].

The concept of ''Het Gulden Cabinet'' did not come from Cornelis de Bie himself, but from the [[Antwerp]] printer [[Jan Meyssen]].  In 1649 Meyssen had already published ''Image de divers hommes'', which contained engraved portraits of famous men, including painters, in imitation of [[Anthony van Dyck]]'s ''Iconography''.  Most of the artist portraits in ''Het Gulden Cabinet'' are taken from this ''Image de divers hommes'' and only a few new engravings were made especially for de Bie's work.&lt;ref name=chr/&gt;

==The work==

===General===
The full title of the work is ''Het gulden cabinet vande edel vry schilder const: inhoudende den lof vande vermarste schilders, architecten, beldthouwers ende plaetsnyders, van dese eeuw'', which translates as ''The Golden Cabinet of the Noble Liberal Art of Painting: Containing the Praise of the Most Famous Painters, Architects, Sculptors and Engravers of This Century''.  Despite its title, the book also deals with artists from the 16th century.

The work was dedicated to the Antwerp art collector Antoon van Leyen who had provided some of the information for the book and may also have helped finance the publication.&lt;ref name=chr&gt;Christiaan Schuckman. "Bie, Cornelis de." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toon Houdt, ''On the Edge of Truth and Honesty: Principles and Strategies of Fraud and Deceit in the Early Modern Period'', BRILL, 1 Jan, 2002, p 153&lt;/ref&gt;  Other persons who had provided information on contemporary artists included de Bie’s own father, [[Erasmus Quellinus II]], [[Luigi Primo]] and [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]]’s son Richard.&lt;ref name=chr/&gt;

===Structure and style===
The book has three parts. The first deals with artists who had died before de Bie's time and relies heavily on van Mander's ''Schilder-boeck''. The second part deals with artists living at the time of de Bie and is mostly based on original research by de Bie and on the comments added to the engravings borrowed from Meyssens' ''Image de divers hommes''. The third part deals with artists who had been omitted in the first two parts and also includes engravers, sculptors, architects, and painters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flandrica.be/items/show/1025/ Het Gulden Cabinet] on Flandrica.be {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A general treatise on the art of painting is woven into the entire work.&lt;ref name=dic/&gt;

The book is mainly written in verse, some of them in Latin, and is as a result rather difficult to read today.  There are also some prose sections.  It is over 500 pages long and contains engravings of more than 50 painters derived mainly from Meyssen's earlier work.

==Influence==
While ''The Gulden Cabinet'' never gained the level of popularity of van Mander’s ''Schilder-boeck'', it is an important source of information on Flemish artists of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=dic&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/biec Cornelis de Bie] in the Dictionary of Art Historians.&lt;/ref&gt;  De Bie’s most important contribution was to provide a theoretical basis for his appreciation of (then) less valued painting genres such as [[still life]]s, [[genre art|genre painting]], [[portrait]]s and [[landscape art|landscapes]].  He unreservedly praised the artists who practised in these genres.&lt;ref name=chr/&gt;
 
''Het Gulden Cabinet'' is included in the ''Basic Library'' of the [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature]], which contains 1000 works of Dutch-language literature from the Middle Ages to today, which are deemed by its compilers to be of particular importance to Dutch-language literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/basisbibliotheek/index.php?c=17 Website of the ''Basic Library'' of the dbnl, the section on the Golden Age] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second edition==
De Bie seems to have planned a second edition of the work, but this was never published.  The hand-written manuscript of de Bie is still extant and is kept at the [[Royal Library of Belgium]].  The manuscript is dated 1672.  In it de Bie mentioned his intention to have a second edition published.  The reason why the second edition was never published is unclear.  It may have been due to the fact that the publisher and promotor of the first edition [[Jan Meyssen]] had died in 1670 and de Bie had difficulty finding another publisher.

==Historical reliability==
Like Vasari and Van Mander before him, de Bie's biographies are interspersed with amusing anecdotes. Although such literary motifs belong to a long rhetorical tradition, many of these stories were labelled "historically unreliable" by leading historians in the 19th century.  Only recently have some of the stories been reinstated.  Since the book was often the only surviving source of information on certain painters, these stories have often been repeated as hard facts about the lives of the painters described.

For instance, Cornelis de Bie postulates certain apprenticeships, which are now considered improbable because the pupil painted in a completely different genre than the teacher.  De Bie's statement that [[Philips Wouwerman]] trained with [[Frans Hals]] was deemed implausible by later historians since Wouwerman painted landscapes with horses and Hals was principally a portrait painter. Some scholars still consider this apprenticeship as unlikely, but in view of Hals' large workshop it cannot be entirely excluded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5897">'''Human–animal marriage'''  is a marriage between a (non-human) animal and a human. This topic has appeared in mythology and [[magic in fiction|magical fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diacronia.ro/en/journal/issue/4/A58/en/pdf Naithani, Sadhana (2014). Folklore Theory in Postwar Germany.] University Press of Mississippi. pp. 48–52. {{ISBN|9781617039942}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century there have been numerous reports from around the world of humans marrying their pets and other animals. Human–animal marriage is often seen in accordance with [[zoophilia]], however they are not necessarily linked. Although animal-human marriage is not mentioned specifically in national laws, the act of engaging in [[Zoophilia and the law|sexual acts with an animal]] is illegal in many countries under animal abuse laws.

== Animal-human marriage in mythology ==
The practice of animal-human marriage has made appearances in several [[Mythology|mythological]] stories and [[folklore]], and is often understood to mean a deity-human marriage involving gods or heroes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Alan L.|date=1995-01-01|title=The Woman Who Married a Horse: Five Ways of Looking at a Chinese Folktale|jstor=1178945|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|volume=54|issue=2|pages=275–305|doi=10.2307/1178945}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese folktale 'The Goddess Of The Silkworm' is an example of a tale where a woman marries a horse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A similar Irish legend tells of a king who marries a horse, symbolizing a divine union between the king and the goddess of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_Y-7XvMVeYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=St. Patrick of Ireland: A Biography|last=Freeman|first=Philip|date=2004-03-17|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743267496|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the indigenous [[Cheyenne]] have a story of animal-human marriage in 'The Girl who Married a dog'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stensland|first=Anna Lee|date=1977-01-01|title=The Indian Presence in American Literature|jstor=815804|journal=The English Journal|volume=66|issue=3|pages=37–41|doi=10.2307/815804}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are many Native American stories about people who married animals. In these Native American myths, animal spirits frequently assume human form.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Mi-Ni/Native-American-Mythology.html|title=Native American Mythology - Myth Encyclopedia - god, story, legend, names, ancient, animal, snake, world, creation, life|website=www.mythencyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not seen as literal animals, but representatives from the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Animal-Human marriage in the real world ==
Although it is uncertain if there is a legal basis for marrying an animal, several individuals claim to have done so. The [[Sudanese goat marriage incident]] made big headlines in 2006 when a man was forced to marry a goat after being caught in a sexual interaction with the goat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1550479/Man-marries-goat-captivates-millions.html|title='Man marries goat' captivates millions|last=Staff|first=By Our Foreign|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports of marriage include animals such as dogs, cats, frogs and a dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3004930.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} South Asia {{!}} Girl weds dog to break 'evil spell'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/11/13/man-in-india-marries-dog-to-atone-for-stoning-to-death-mating-canines.html|title=Man in India Marries Dog to Atone for Stoning to Death Mating Canines|date=2007-11-13|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334993/Joseph-Guiso-marries-dog-Honey-sunset-ceremony.html|title=Sealed with a kiss: Man 'marries' his dog in sunset ceremony - but assures guests 'it's not sexual'|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8658327.stm|title=BBC News - German man 'marries' his dying cat|website=news.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4290761/Seven-year-old-Indian-girls-marry-frogs.html|title=Seven-year-old Indian girls 'marry' frogs|last=Delhi|first=By Dean Nelson in|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/01/03/british-woman-marries-dolphin.html|title=British Woman Marries Dolphin|date=2006-01-03|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other incidents of human animal relations took place in 2010, when 18-year-old Balinese man Ngurah Alit was found having sexual intercourse with a cow, who he claimed flirted with him.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/bali-teenager-passes-out-marrying-cow-he-had-sex-with/|title=Bali Teenager Passes Out Marrying Cow He Had Sex With {{!}} Jakarta Globe|work=Jakarta Globe|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a Pecaruan ritual, the man was forced to marry the animal.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The ceremony was thought to cleanse the village of the immoral act of bestiality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The cow was drowned in the ocean, while Alit was symbolically drowned as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IERC campus.jpg|thumb|right|Building at IERC campus in Midnapore, WB, India]] --&gt;

==Branches==
There are currently three branches at several places in West Bengal where people working in different fields of astrophysics: Malda, Coochbehar, and Midnapore.

==Faculties and departments==
ICSP has four major departments working on several branches of astrophysics and related subjects.

===Instrumentation for Space Exploration===
Space exploration by means of balloon borne detectors is the main concern of this department. ICSP has pioneered in this field of low cost exploration of near earth space using light weight payloads on board weather balloons. In the course of the experiments ICSP payloads has visited the space more than 100 times and has gathered a multitude of data from extraterrestrial radiation sources, atmospheric radiation data due to cosmic ray interactions and other atmospheric data. These data has provided new understandings about the cosmic radiation sources as well as the radiation effects on the earth atmosphere.

===Astrochemistry and astrobiology===

===Ionospheric sciences===
The main research activities of this department includes study on solar-terrestrial environment including solar disturbances, Earth’s magnetosphere, ionosphere, thermosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere etc. Peoples also work on seismo-ionospheric precursors, lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling processes, long-term and transient solar activity and ionospheric climatology using both ground and space based VLF receiver. Monitoring of galactic X-ray transients, Soft Gamma ray Repeaters (SGRs) and Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) etc. are also active research topic in this department.

===High energy astrophysics===
This department mainly deals with Black Hole astrophysics. There are two branches of black hole astrophysics: Theoretical and Observational.

==Activities and collaborations==
ICSP is collaborating with several national and international institutions and universities. It is a member of Erasmus Mundus joint PhD programme in astronomy funded by European Union. Several of its scientists have been trained at [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics|ICTP]] (The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics), Italy. Scientist from ICSP has been taken part in the Antarctica expeditions. In the balloon borne science mission, this institute has been visited the near space for more than 100 times.

The '''Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World''' is an interdisciplinary center for research and teaching of [[archaeology]], particularly archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Near East, at [[Brown University]].

==History==
The Joukowsky Institute was established in 2004, with a gift from Artemis Joukowsky, a former Chancellor of Brown University&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/portraits/display.php?idno=230 Brown Portrait Collection biography of Artemis A.W. Joukowsky]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martha Sharp Joukowsky]], a former associate professor of Anthropology at Brown. A new director, [[Susan E. Alcock]], took up her appointment in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.browndailyherald.com/campus-news/alcock-to-oversee-expansion-of-interdisciplinary-archaeology-institute-1.1678566 Alcock to oversee expansion of interdisciplinary archaeology institute], by Sara Walter, ''Brown Daily Herald'', February 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter van Dommelen succeeded Alcock, becoming Director of the Institute in July 2015.

The Institute has continued and expanded the activities of Brown’s former Center for Old World Archaeology and Art (COWAA). COWAA was founded in 1978 by R. Ross Holloway, professor of classics, Rudolf Winkes, historian of ancient Roman art, and Martha Sharp Joukowsky.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0240 COWAA]" in ''[[Encyclopedia Brunoniana]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joukowsky Institute moved to the newly renovated Rhode Island Hall,&lt;ref&gt;Rhode Island Hall earned Brown its first gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. [http://today.brown.edu/articles/2010/09/leed Today at Brown]&lt;/ref&gt; located on Brown University's Main Green, in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070827194852/http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/Building_Brown/projects/rihall/ Building Brown]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HORIBA MIRA Ltd.''' (formerly the '''Motor Industry Research Association''') is an [[automotive]] engineering and development consultancy company headquartered near [[Nuneaton]] in [[Warwickshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. It provides product engineering, research, testing, information and certification services to the automotive sector. Its headquarters are in the '''MIRA Technology Park Enterprise Zone'''. On 14 July 2015 MIRA announced that it was being bought by the Japanese-owned testing equipment group [[Horiba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horiba-mira.com/news-and-events/2015/july/horiba-acquires-mira-in-historic-sale]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
MIRA was formed in 1946 and was mostly government-funded. It is based just off the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] near the junction with the [[A444 road|A444]] in the parish of [[Higham on the Hill]] (also near [[Fenny Drayton]]), [[Leicestershire]], where around five hundred staff work, with another establishment in [[Basildon]] in [[Essex]]. The company dates back to the foundation of the [[Cycle Engineers' Institute]] (CEI) in 1898, which became the Incorporated Institution of Automobile Engineers (IAE) in 1906. The IAE became the Automotive Branch of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers|IMechE]] in 1946. The IAE and the [[Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders]] were largely responsible for creating MIRA.

===Pooling of expertise===
After World War Two, the UK car industry was finding it difficult to export to countries where it formerly had little trouble finding markets for its wide range of cars. It was decided by the government to pool the research resources of UK car manufacturers into one site to reduce costs and possibly find new technological advances sooner that could be incorporated into all ranges of UK vehicle makes. The principal auto-makers were located in the [[Birmingham]] area, apart from [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] which had its factory in Luton and [[Ford of Britain|Ford]] which by now was located at [[Ford Dagenham assembly plant|Dagenham]] to the east of London.&lt;ref name=Motor196905/&gt; The Motor Industry Research institution under its director Dr Albert Fogg (who would later become Engineering Chief at [[British Leyland]]) therefore looked for a location that was reasonably accessible from all these locations, and the site near Nuneaton fulfilled that criterion.&lt;ref name=Motor196905&gt;{{cite magazine | authorlink =Harold Hastings |title = What MIRA stands for|magazine=Motor| volume =  | pages =75–78| date = 10 May 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The facilities became available to MIRA member companies in October 1948, though at this stage the test tracks consisted only of disused runways.&lt;ref name=Motor196905/&gt; They were finally opened on 28 April 1949 by Dr Fogg who used explosives to cut the ceremonial tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MIRA: World-class Vehicle Engineering, Test and Development {{!}} MIRA|url = http://www.mira.co.uk/about-mira/mira-heritage#timeline-milestone_835|website = www.mira.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facilities were nevertheless developed under Dr Fogg and [[Professor Robert Macmillan]] who took over the directorship from Fogg in 1964.&lt;ref name=Motor196905/&gt; Such examples include the half mile [[Belgian Pavé]] road used in vehicle tests, completed in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MIRA: World-class Vehicle Engineering, Test and Development {{!}} MIRA|url = http://www.mira.co.uk/about-mira/mira-heritage#timeline-milestone_139|website = www.mira.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary safety===
Marking the increasing concern with [[secondary safety]] at the time was the opening by the [[Minister of Technology]] [[Tony Benn]], in April 1968, of MIRA's indoor rig for crash-testing cars in head-on impacts.&lt;ref name=Motor196804&gt;{{cite magazine | authorlink = Charles Bulmer (Ed)|title = News: New MIRA test facility|magazine=Motor| volume =  |page=73| date = 6 April 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Such tests, at {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on}}, had recently become mandatory for cars sold in the US.&lt;ref name=Motor196804/&gt;   The MIRA crash rig featured the UK's largest industrial [[linear induction motor]].&lt;ref name=Motor196804/&gt; It was based on a design by Professor [[Eric Laithwaite]] of Imperial College. It replaced a complicated outdoor system that had involved the "victim" car's final seconds being controlled by means of a radar-operated remote device from a following vehicle.&lt;ref name=Motor196804/&gt;

===Commercial organisation===
Since 1975, the funding arrangements for belonging to the organisation went from a membership subscription (or levy – mostly irrespective of the quantity of work that took place for individual manufacturers) for car companies to a fee-based system. Currently, the site has around £110 million of test equipment. On 4 July 2001, the organisation changed its name to '''MIRA Ltd'''. At this point, it also became liable for [[United Kingdom corporation tax|corporation tax]]. It bought the Creative Automotive Design consultancy in March 2003. The company's turnover has increased 4.9% to £45.7m in 2013, producing a £6m surplus which was all reinvested back into itself. On 14 July 2015 MIRA announced that it was being bought by the Japanese-owned testing equipment group HORIBA and changed its name to '''HORIBA MIRA Ltd.'''

==Technology park==
HORIBA MIRA is headquartered within the MIRA Technology Park, a park for automotive research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/business/nuneaton-based-mira-reveals-impressive-year-4872512 |title=Nuneaton-based MIRA reveals impressive year of growth | last=Waddington |first=Jenny |publisher=[[Coventry Telegraph]] |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the UK government announced that the 850 acre park would become an [[enterprise zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14552193 |title=New 'enterprise zones' announced around England |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies who have moved into the park include [[Haldex (company)|Haldex]] and [[Aston Martin]]. In February 2015 the government announced that the enterprise zone would be expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/local-news/nuneaton-based-mira-gets-green-light-8637459 |title=Nuneaton-based MIRA gets green light to expand Technology Park | last=Waddington |first=Jenny |publisher=Coventry Telegraph |date=12 February 2015 |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former airfield==
The [[proving ground]] which forms the largest area of HORIBA MIRA is built on {{convert|760|acres}} of the former [[RAF Lindley]] airfield, named after the nearby Lindley Hall Farm&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/337265 Lindley Hall Farm] photo&lt;/ref&gt; after the former Lindley Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webspinners.org.uk/weddingtoncastle2/new_page_49.htm Lindley Hall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709171930/http://www.webspinners.org.uk/weddingtoncastle2/new_page_49.htm |date=9 July 2009 }} at the website of [[Weddington Castle]]. 2008. Retrieved 2011-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; This farm claims to be the centre of England,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2271925.stm A tale of two centres], BBC News, 22 October 2002 Retrieved 2011-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; if calculated by the centre of mass method, similar to a [[centroid]]. [[Meriden, West Midlands|Meriden]] also makes a similar claim. The [[Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway]] used to pass along the south-east perimeter of HORIBA MIRA, and is now the Weddington Country Walk. The line was open to freight until 1971, and had a station at Higham on the Hill on the perimeter of HORIBA MIRA.

==Operations==
HORIBA MIRA is a provider of product engineering, [[research]], testing, development and certification to the worldwide transport industry. Its work includes crash testing, aerodynamic design and vehicle ergonomics. It was developed to provide research for UK companies but now provides engineering consultancy to clients worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">'''Map algebra''' is a set-based [[algebra]] for manipulating [[geographic]] data, proposed by Dr. [[Dana Tomlin]] in the early 1980s.  It is a set of primitive operations in a [[geographic information system]] (GIS) which allows two or more [[Raster graphics|raster]] [[Layers (digital image editing)|layer]]s ("maps") of similar dimensions to produce a new raster layer (map) using algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction etc.

Depending on the spatial neighborhood, GIS transformations are categorized into four classes: ''local'', ''focal'', ''global'', and ''zonal''. Local operations works on individual raster cells, or [[pixel]]s. Focal operations work on cells and their neighbors, whereas global operations work on the entire layer. Finally, zonal operations work on areas of cells that share the same value. The input and output for each operator being map, the operators can be combined into a procedure or script, to perform complex tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geographic Information Systems and Science|author=Longley|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|ISBN=978-0-470-72144-5|pages=414–7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When map algebra is performed in cells from local operations, different types of operations can be used:
* Arithmetic operations uses basic mathematical functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
* Statistical operations uses statistical operations such as minimum, maximum, average and median.
* Relational operations compares cells using functions such as greater than, smaller than or equal to.
* Trigonometric operations uses sine, cosine, tangent, arcsine between two or more raster layers.
* Exponential and logarithmic operations use exponent and logarithm functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=GISGeography|title=Map Algebra-Global, Zonal, Focal and Local Functions|url=http://gisgeography.com/map-algebra-global-zonal-focal-local/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several major GIS systems use map algebra concepts, including [[ERDAS Imagine]] and [[ArcGIS]]. ArcGIS 10 implements Map Algebra in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]; functions are imported Python methods and Python's overloading capability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3.4. Special method names¶|url=https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html|website=The Python Language Reference|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used for operators. For example, rasters can be multiplied using the "*" arithmetic operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esri|first1=Inc.|title=ArcGIS 10.0 Help|url=http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//00p600000002000000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are some examples, in [[MapBasic]]:
&lt;source lang="MapBasic"&gt;
# demo for Brown's Pond data set
# Give layers
#  altitude
#  development – 0: vacant, 1: major, 2: minor, 3: houses, 4: buildings, 5 cement

  where 1 replaces 4 5 6
  where VOID replaces ...

# create layer unifying water and development

  where water replaces VOID

notbad = LocalRating of occupied and toosteep
  where 1 replaces VOID and VOID
  where VOID replaces ... and ...

roads = LocalRating of development

==Early life, education and military service==
Mary E. Williamson was born on April 24, 1924, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], to Elmer C. Williamson and Ruth Peterman Williamson.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt; Mary was an only child, whom her mother Ruth raised on her own. The two remained very close throughout her life.&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;

Williamson decided to attend [[Baker University]] after high school in 1941, but soon transferred to the [[Missouri School of Journalism]] at the [[University of Missouri]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. She finished this two-year program quickly and left for Sweetwater, Texas, in April 1944 to train as a pilot in the WASP ([[Women Air Force Service Pilots]]) program.&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt; She served from April 1 to September 1, 1944, but never served on a mission before the war came to an end.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;
            
==Career==
After her discharge, Williamson returned to Kansas City and acquired a job as the public relations director for the Kansas City Tuberculosis Society. Through this position, she was offered an opportunity to further her education, and eventually went on to obtain her master's degree from [[Columbia University]] in New York. After graduating, Williamson moved to Washington D.C., and took a job as an editor. However, wanting to be closer to her home, Williamson returned to St. Louis and accepted a position in broadcasting.&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;&lt;ref name=reflections&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=John|title=Reflections in Time Dr. Mary E. Williamson Interview|url=http://unomaha.worldcat.org/oclc/52643375|website=Reflections in Time|publisher=University of Nebraska at Omaha|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson began teaching in the Department of Speech and Mass communication at the [[University of Nebraska Omaha]] (UNO) in 1969.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt; Her first year at UNO Williamson taught courses such as Speech 101, Introduction to Mass Communications, Television Production and Radio Production. Williamson also served as [[PanHellenic]] advisor to the Greek communities on campus.&lt;ref name=gateway1976&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kurtz|first1=Terry|title=Greek Life Analyzed to Update '50s Image|url=http://digital.olivesoftware.com/olive/apa/unomaha/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=GTW%2F1976%2F10%2F22&amp;id=Ar00400&amp;sk=AD66CB0E|accessdate=31 March 2015|publisher=The Gateway|date=22 October 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson finished her doctoral program in 1973 with the publication of her thesis "An Inquiry into Excellence in Commercial Broadcasting". Williamson incorporated work experience with the Nebraska Business Development Center (NBDC) in many of her courses, so that students were able to provide services and advice to small business owners in the Omaha area.
            
Throughout her time at UNO, Williamson served in various roles across campus. She was elected to Faculty Senate and served her second term as Vice President in 1977 and then as President in 1978.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt; During this service, she successfully removed gendered language from UNO's diploma despite some strong opposition. (7) Williamson served as the executive assistant to UNO Chancellor Del Weber from 1980 until 1986. Also in this time period, she was appointed Interim Dean for the College of Fine Arts for two years and later as the Interim University Relations Director, where she was responsible for public outreach for the university.&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;&lt;ref name=morewomen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Marge|title=More Women Rank High at UNO|url=http://digital.olivesoftware.com/olive/apa/unomaha/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=GTW%2F1981%2F02%2F06&amp;id=Ar00500&amp;sk=C47EE9D5|accessdate=31 March 2015|publisher=The Gateway|date=6 February 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson Appointed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Williamson Appointed to Aid UNO Chancellor Weber|url=http://digital.olivesoftware.com/olive/apa/unomaha/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=GTW%2F1981%2F01%2F16&amp;id=Ar00301&amp;sk=520BFC36|publisher=The Gateway|date=16 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her interim stints in both departments, Williamson returned to the Communications Department as acting department chair. She took partial retirement shortly after and began working closely with NBDC as a business consultant.&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt; Williamson retired in 2004 after 35 years of teaching at UNO.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;

In 1981, Williamson became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.
            	
==Community service==
Williamson also worked as the Vice President of Nebraska Cable Television and was later appointed by the mayor of Omaha to the community's Cable Television Advisory Committee for two terms.
            
After retirement she remained active around Omaha by filling a volunteer capacity in various organizations. Williamson served as an [[ombudsman]] at the Ambassador Rehabilitation Center, a counselor at the [[Service Corps of Retired Executives]] (SCORE), and assisted the Hearts United for Animals shelter.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;
 
==Awards==
Williamson received recognition for her service to the Faculty Senate in the 1970s and a certificate from the University of Nebraska Board of Regents in 1982 for her dedication to improving UNO. NBDC presented Williamson with the UNO Small Business Institute Award in 1987 and 1990 and then an award for her contribution to the Nebraska Small Business Community in 1992. Chancellor Nancy Belck presented Williamson with a plaque recognizing her service and devotion to UNO upon retirement. In 2007, the United Way of Midlands honored Williamson for her services and time, and she also received a certificate from her time as ombudsman at the Ambassador Rehabilitation Center.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;
            
In 2010, at the age of 86, Williamson was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] for her service as a Women Airforce Service Pilot (WASP) in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=WWII&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hovey|first1=Art|title=WWII Women Pilots Get Belated Recognition|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/wwii-women-pilots-get-belated-recognition/article_18f95106-768a-11df-bb07-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=31 March 2015|agency=Lincoln Journal Star|date=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2977">'''Metanoetics''' (from {{lang-el|μετανόησις}} "conversion, repentance" from μετανοῶ "I repent"; {{lang-ja| zangedō 懺悔道, dō 道 (path) and zange 懺悔 (metanoia}})) is a neologism coined by [[Hajime Tanabe]] in ''Philosophy as Metanoetics'' to denote a way of doing philosophy that understands the limits of reason and the power of [[radical evil]]. Though the method used by Tanabe to reach this conclusion relies on the transcendental analysis developed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Tanabe aligns the method with the Buddhist concept of Absolute Nothingness and the preaching of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], [[Zen]], and Christianity.

Tanabe states that Kant did not take the critique of reason far enough. By this Tanabe means that a radical critique of reason should question whether reason itself can understand its ability to embody self-awareness and ultimate reality. The individual exercising reason should remain aware of the crisis of reason and see the [[antinomies|antinomy]], those rationally unsolveable contradictions that reason unearths, as the basis for personal renewal.

The crisis of reason is not just a disruption of thought; it also involves a crisis of will. As the individual understands the radical limits of reason in facing the antinomies, they become aware of what Kant called [[radical evil]]. This is the will to act according to desires beyond those presented by rational reflection. With this realization comes further crisis and thereby the possibility of metanoia.

In this state of crisis, the individual gains the perspective required to see another source of enlightenment. Tanabe uses the Shin Buddhist term of "Other-power" to denote this source, also called Absolute Nothingness. This metanoia realizes the inadequacy of human efforts to discover the source of self-awareness and surrenders to it. This surrender provides the power to continue the search for meaning within the midst of everyday life and to act in a compassionate and charitable way to bring others to self-realization.

'''Military step''' or '''march''' is a regular, ordered and synchronized [[walking]] of [[military formation]]s.

==History==
The steady, regular [[marching]] step was a marked feature of [[Roman legion]]s. [[Vegetius]], the author of the only surviving treatise on the Roman Empire's military, ''[[De Re Militari]]'', recognized the importance of

&lt;blockquote&gt;constant practice of marching quick and together. Nor is anything of more consequence either on the march or in the line than that they should keep their ranks with the greatest exactness. For troops who march in an irregular and disorderly manner are always in great danger of being defeated. They should march with the common military step twenty [[Mile#Roman_mile|miles]] in five summer-hours, and with the full step, which is quicker, twenty-four miles in the same number of hours. If they exceed this pace, they no longer march but run, and no certain rate can be assigned.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Re Militari]]'', Book I: ''The Selection and Training of New Levies''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Military marching of foot formations into a battle was a common practice in most European countries for centuries, and was even carried over into the new world as recently as the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. Since then, it has been phased out by advances in [[military equipment]] and [[military tactics|tactics]]; however, [[Foot drill]] remains an important part of [[military education and training]].

== Marching types ==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:German Troops In Warsaw.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Wehrmacht]] troops [[Goose-Step]] through [[Warsaw]]]] --&gt;
The following commands specify different types of marching:

* '''Quick March''': This is an instruction to begin marching at the Quick March speed with the left foot. The standard pace is 116 beats per minute with a 30-inch step, with variations for individual regiments, the pace given by the commander, and the speed of the band's rhythm: British [[light infantry]] and rifle regiments, for example, Quick March at 140 beats per minute, a legacy of their original role as highly mobile skirmishers. [[Highland regiments]], which march to bagpipe music, march at 112 paces per minute.
* Australian Army Quick Time is 116 paces per minute with a 75cm pace  
* Canadian Forces Quick March is 120 paces per minute with a 75cm pace

The way the march is performed is based on the regiment's nationality. [[Western Bloc]] nations typically lift their opposite arm up to the breast pocket, kept straight and used similar to a guided pendulum. [[Eastern Bloc]] nations and several Latin American, Asian and African nations frequently used the [[goose step]], with legs straight during the entirety of the step. Both of these function to maintain individual pace, unit pace uniformity, and actually help the soldiers march in their relatively elevated pace. The [[United States]] command is '''"For-ward, MARCH."''' Arm movement is kept to 9&amp;nbsp;inches to the front and 6&amp;nbsp;inches to the rear (6&amp;nbsp;inches and 3&amp;nbsp;inches, respectively, in the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force) while marching, while the interval between ranks and files is both 40&amp;nbsp;inches. The light infantry version of the march is also used by the [[Spanish Legion]] during parades, as well as the [[Chasseurs]] of the [[French Army]] ([[Chasseurs alpins]] inclusive).
* '''Slow March''': This is a ceremonial pace, used for funeral marches and when a unit's colours are marched out in front of the troops.  The feet are kept parallel to the ground and the arms are never used. In the United States Marine Corps, arms swing as the distance they normally would in quicktime, but at the same pace as marching.  U.S. Marine Color Guards do not swing their arms.  Slow March is typically used in the Marine Corps for funeral details and ceremonies such as the Marine Corps Ball (when the cake is escorted out).  In Spain, Latin America, and the Philippines this is done during religious processions whenever a military band joins it. This march style is the official parade march in the armed forces of [[Bolivia]] and [[Ecuador]] and the military academies and schools of [[Venezuela]], done with the goose step during parades and ceremonies. It is the iconic march step used in the [[French Foreign Legion]]. The standard pace is 60 paces per minute (88 for the FFL).
* Australian Army Slow Time is 70 paces per minute with a 75cm pace.
* '''Half Step March''' or '''Cut the pace''': This is a U.S. march pace. It is at the same tempo as Quick Time, but instead of 30&amp;nbsp;inches, the step is 15&amp;nbsp;inches.
* '''Double March''': This is essentially a moderate jog at approximately 180 36 inch paces per minute. It creates a travel speed of approximately double that of Quick Time, designed to be used even when carrying heavy burdens. This is often erroneously used to describe a sprint or an ordinary run. The U.S. command is '''"Double Time, MARCH."''' This is also used by the elite airborne units and special forces of the [[National Armed Forces of Venezuela]] as well as in the Armed Forces of Bolivia and soldiers of the Italian Army's [[Bersaglieri]] on parades and ceremonies.
* '''Easy March''': This is an unrestricted march at approximately Quick Time. This is designed for field marches and other rough conditions, though is not used in combat areas. The U.S. command is '''"Route-step, MARCH."'''
* '''Mark Time''': The [[military mark time]] is essentially a stationary march with the knees coming up parallel to the ground or the foot dangling six inches off the ground. The time of what they were previously marching is kept or Quick March is used if no time is supplied. This is designed to maintain the time of large parades when portions need no forward speed, but is also used as a common punishment for physical training because of its tiring nature. United States service members move the knees upward approximately 6&amp;nbsp;inches.
* '''Step For -Ward''' or '''Forward''' or '''Forward, March''': This causes troops marking time to resume a normal march. If it is implicitly used (as when the marking time is used to align formations or to wait for the former rank to pass when entering "Column of Route" from a depth-style formation) the (typically) Right Marker stomps his foot to signal it to the rest of the troops.

'''Mysticism''' is the practice of [[religious ecstasy|religious ecstasies]] (religious experiences during [[Altered state of consciousness|alternate states of consciousness]]), together with whatever ideologies, ethics, rites, myths, legends, and magic may be related to them.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; It may also refer to the attainment of insight in ultimate or hidden truths, and to human transformation supported by various practices and experiences.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}

The term "mysticism" has Ancient Greek origins with various historically determined meanings.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word μυω, meaning "to conceal",{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} mysticism referred to the biblical liturgical, spiritual, and contemplative dimensions of early and medieval [[Christianity]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} During the [[early modern period]], the definition of mysticism grew to include a broad range of beliefs and ideologies related to "extraordinary experiences and states of mind".{{sfn|King|2002|pp=17–18}}

In modern times, "mysticism" has acquired a limited definition, with broad applications, as meaning the aim at the "union with the Absolute, the Infinite, or God".&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; This limited definition has been applied to a wide range of religious traditions and practices,&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; valuing "mystical experience" as a key element of mysticism.

Broadly defined, mysticism can be found in all [[Religion#Types and demographics|religious traditions]], from [[indigenous religions]] and [[folk religions]] like shamanism, to organised religions like the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] faiths and [[Indian religions]], and modern spirituality, New Age and New Religious Movements.

Since the 1960s scholars have debated the merits of [[perennial philosophy|perennial]] and [[social constructionism|constructionist]] approaches in the scientific research of "mystical experiences".{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The perennial position is now "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} most scholars using a contextual approach, which takes the cultural and historical context into consideration.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Christian contemplation|Henosis}}

"Mysticism" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|μυω}}, meaning "I conceal",{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} and its derivative {{lang|grc|μυστικός}}, ''[[Wikt:μυστικός|mystikos]]'', meaning 'an initiate'. The verb {{lang|el|μυώ}} has received a quite different meaning in the Greek language, where it is still in use. The primary meanings it has are "induct" and "initiate". Secondary meanings include "introduce", "make someone aware of something", "train", "familiarize", "give first experience of something".&lt;ref group=web name="WordReference"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wordreference.com/gren/μυώ |title=μυώ |author=|date= |website=WordReference English-Greek Dictionary |publisher=WordReference.com |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related form of the verb {{lang|el|μυέω}} (mueó or myéō) appears in the [[New Testament]]. As explained in ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', it properly means shutting the eyes and mouth to experience mystery. Its figurative meaning is to be initiated into the "mystery revelation". The meaning derives from the initiatory rites of the pagan mysteries.&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3453.htm |title=3453. mueó |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also appearing in the New Testament is the related noun {{lang|el|μυστήριον}} (mustérion or mystḗrion), the root word of the English term "mystery".  The term means "anything hidden", a mystery or secret, of which initiation is necessary. In the New Testament it reportedly takes the meaning of the counsels of God, once hidden but now revealed in the Gospel or some fact thereof, the Christian revelation generally, and/or particular truths or details of the Christian revelation.&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3466.htm |title=3466. mustérion |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thayer's Greek Lexicon, the  term {{lang|el|μυστήριον}} in classical Greek meant "a hidden thing", "secret". A particular meaning it took in [[Classical antiquity]] was a religious secret or religious secrets, confided only to the initiated and not to be communicated by them to ordinary mortals. In the [[Septuagint]] and the New Testament the meaning it took was that of a hidden purpose or counsel, a secret will. It is sometimes used for the hidden wills of humans, but is more often used for the hidden will of God. Elsewhere in the Bible it takes the meaning of  the mystic or hidden sense of things. It is used for the secrets behind sayings, names, or behind images seen in visions and dreams. The [[Vulgate]] often translates the Greek term to the Latin {{lang|la|sacramentum}} ([[sacrament]]).&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3466.htm |title=3466. mustérion |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related noun {{lang|el|μύστης}}  (mustis or mystis, singular) means the initiate, the person initiated to the mysteries.&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3466.htm |title=3466. mustérion |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ana Jiménez San Cristobal in her study of [[Greco-Roman mysteries]] and [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], the singular form {{lang|el|μύστης}} and the plural form {{lang|el|μύσται}} are used in ancient Greek texts to mean the person or persons initiated to religious mysteries. These followers of mystery religions belonged to a select group, where access was only gained through an initiation. She finds that the terms were associated with the term {{lang|el|βάκχος}} ([[Dionysus|Bacchus]]), which was used for a special class of initiates of the Orphic mysteries. The terms are first found connected in the writings of [[Heraclitus]]. Such initiates are identified in texts with the persons who have been purified and have performed certain rites. A passage of the ''[[Cretans (Euripides)|Cretans]]'' by [[Euripides]] seems to explain that the {{lang|el|μύστης}} (initiate) who devotes himself to an ascetic life, renounces sexual activities, and avoids contact with the dead becomes known as {{lang|el|βάκχος}}. Such initiates were believers in the god Dionysus Bacchus who took on the name of their god and sought an identification with their deity.&lt;ref name="San Cristobal"&gt;San Cristobal (2009), p. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the sixth century the practice of what is now called mysticism was referred to by the term ''[[contemplatio]]'', c.q. ''[[theoria]]''.{{sfn|Johnson|1997|p=24}} According to Johnson, "[b]oth contemplation and mysticism speak of the eye of love which is looking at, gazing at, aware of divine realities."{{sfn|Johnson|1997|p=24}}

==Definitions==
According to Peter Moore, the term "mysticism" is "problematic but indispensable."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} It is a generic term which joins together into one concept separate practices and ideas which developed separately,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} According to Dupré, "mysticism" has been defined in many ways,{{sfn|Dupré|2005}} and Merkur notes that the definition, or meaning, of the term "mysticism" has changed through the ages.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; Moore further notes that the term "mysticism" has become a popular label for "anything nebulous, esoteric, occult, or supernatural."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}

Parsons warns that "what might at times seem to be a straightforward phenomenon exhibiting an unambiguous commonality has become, at least within the academic study of religion, opaque and controversial on multiple levels".{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} Because of its Christian overtones, and the lack of similar terms in other cultures, some scholars regard the term "mysticism" to be inadequate as a useful descriptive term.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} Other scholars regard the term to be an inauthentic fabrication,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; the "product of post-Enlightenment universalism."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}

===Union with the Divine or Absolute and mystical experience===
{{See also|Hesychasm|Contemplative prayer|Apophatic theology}}

Deriving from [[Neo-Platonism]] and [[Henosis]], mysticism is popularly known as union with God or the Absolute.{{sfn|McGinn|2005}}{{sfn|Moore|2005}} In the 13th century the term ''unio mystica'' came to be used to refer to the "spiritual marriage," the ecstasy, or rapture, that was experienced when prayer was used "to contemplate both God’s omnipresence in the world and God in his essence."&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; In the 19th century, under the influence of Romanticism, this "union" was interpreted as a "religious experience," which provides certainty about God or a transcendental reality.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Note that Parmenides' "way of truth" may also be translated as "way of conviction." [[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. Cook's translation "way of conviction" is rendered by other translators as "way of truth."}}

An influential proponent of this understanding was [[William James]] (1842–1910), who stated that "in mystic states we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}} William James popularized this use of the term "religious experience"{{refn|group=note|The term "mystical experience" has become synonymous with the terms "religious experience", [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience and [[sacred]] experience.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}}}} in his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'',{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} contributing to the interpretation of mysticism as a distinctive experience, comparable to sensory experiences.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Religious experiences belonged to the "personal religion,"{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}} which he considered to be "more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism".{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}} He gave a Perennialist interpretation to religious experience, stating that this kind of experience is ultimately uniform in various traditions.{{refn|group=note|William James: "This is the everlasting and triumphant mystical tradition, hardly altered by differences of clime or creed. In Hinduism, in Neoplatonism, in Sufism, in Christian mysticism, in Whitmanism, we find the same recurring note, so that there is about mystical utterances an eternal unanimity which ought to make a critic stop and think, and which bring it about that the mystical classics have, as been said, neither birthday nor native land."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}}}}

McGinn notes that the term ''unio mystica'', although it has Christian origins, is primarily a modern expression.{{sfn|McGinn|2005|p=6334}} McGinn argues that "presence" is more accurate than "union", since not all mystics spoke of union with God, and since many visions and miracles were not necessarily related to union. He also argues that we should speak of "consciousness" of God's presence, rather than of "experience", since mystical activity is not simply about the sensation of God as an external object, but more broadly about "new ways of knowing and loving based on states of awareness in which God becomes present in our inner acts."{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}

However, the idea of "union" does not work in all contexts. For example, in Advaita Vedanta, there is only one reality (Brahman) and therefore nothing other than reality to unite with it—Brahman in each person (''atman'') has always in fact been identical to Brahman all along. Dan Merkur also notes that union with God or the Absolute is a too limited definition, since there are also traditions which aim not at a sense of unity, but of [[Kenosis|nothingness]], such as [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Meister Eckhart]].&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; According to Merkur, [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] and Buddhism also emphasize [[Sunyata|nothingness]].&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; Blakemore and Jennett note that "definitions of mysticism [...] are often imprecise." They further note that this kind of interpretation and definition is a recent development which has become the standard definition and understanding.&lt;ref group=web name="Oxord-body" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Blakemore and Jennett: "Mysticism is frequently defined as an experience of direct communion with God, or union with the Absolute, but definitions of mysticism (a relatively modern term) are often imprecise and usually rely on the presuppositions of the modern study of mysticism — namely, that mystical experiences involve a set of intense and usually individual and private psychological states [...] Furthermore, mysticism is a phenomenon said to be found in all major religious traditions.&lt;ref group=web name="Oxord-body"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/mysticism.aspx#3 Colin Blakemore and Shelia Jennett (2001), ''The Oxford Companion to the Body'']&lt;/ref&gt; Blakemore and Jennett add: "[T]he common assumption that all mystical experiences, whatever their context, are the same cannot, of course, be demonstrated." They also state: "Some have placed a particular emphasis on certain altered states, such as visions, trances, levitations, locutions, raptures, and ecstasies, many of which are altered bodily states. Margery Kempe's tears and [[Teresa of Avila]]'s ecstasies are famous examples of such mystical phenomena. But many mystics have insisted that while these experiences may be a part of the mystical state, they are not the essence of mystical experience, and some, such as Origen, Meister Eckhart, and John of the Cross, have been hostile to such psycho-physical phenomena. Rather, the essence of the mystical experience is the encounter between God and the human being, the Creator and creature; this is a union which leads the human being to an ‘absorption’ or loss of individual personality. It is a movement of the heart, as the individual seeks to surrender itself to ultimate Reality; it is thus about being rather than knowing. For some mystics, such as Teresa of Avila, phenomena such as visions, locutions, raptures, and so forth are by-products of, or accessories to, the full mystical experience, which the soul may not yet be strong enough to receive. Hence these altered states are seen to occur in those at an early stage in their spiritual lives, although ultimately only those who are called to achieve full union with God will do so."&lt;ref group=web name="Oxord-body" /&gt;}}

According to Gelman, "A unitive experience involves a phenomenological de-emphasis, blurring, or eradication of multiplicity, where the cognitive significance of the experience is deemed to lie precisely in that phenomenological feature".{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|Gelman: "Examples are experiences of the oneness of all of nature, “union” with God, as in Christian mysticism, (see section 2.2.1), the Hindu experience that [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is [[Brahman]] (that the self/soul is identical with the eternal, absolute being), the Buddhist unconstructed experience, and “monistic” experiences, devoid of all multiplicity."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compare [[Plotinus]], who argued that ''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul," initiating an ascent of the soul by [[Abstraction#In philosophy|abstraction]] or "taking away," culminating in a [[Subitism|sudden appearance]] of ''the One''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=8}}}}

===Religious ecstasies and interpretative context===
{{Main article|Religious ecstasy|Altered state of consciousness|Cognitive science of religion|Neurotheology|Attribution (psychology)}}

Mysticism involves an explanatory context, which provides meaning for so-called mystical and visionary experiences, and related experiences like trances. According to Dan Merkur, mysticism may relate to any kind of ecstasy or altered state of consciousness, and the ideas and explanations related to them.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Merkur: "Mysticism is the practice of religious ecstasies (religious experiences during alternate states of consciousness), together with whatever ideologies, ethics, rites, myths, legends, and magic may be related to them."&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;}} Parsons stresses the importance of distinguishing between temporary experiences and mysticism as a process, which is embodied within a "religious matrix" of texts and practices.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=4–5}}{{refn|group=note|Parsons: "...episodic experience and mysticism as a ''process'' that, though surely punctuated by moments of visionary, unitive, and transformative encounters, is ultimately inseparable from its embodied relation to a total religious matrix: liturgy, scripture, worship, virtues, theology, rituals, practice and the arts.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=4–5}}}} Richard Jones does the same.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 1}} Peter Moore notes that mystical experience may also happen in a spontaneous and natural way, to people who are not committed to any religious tradition. These experiences are not necessarily interpreted in a religious framework.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356}} [[Ann Taves]] asks by which processes experiences are set apart and deemed religious or mystical.{{sfn|Taves|2009}}

===Intuitive insight and enlightenment===
{{Main article|Enlightenment (spiritual)|Divine illumination|Subitism}}

Some authors emphasize that mystical experience involves intuitive understanding of the meaning of existence and of hidden truths, and the resolution of life problems. According to Larson, "mystical experience is an intuitive understanding and realization of the meaning of existence."{{sfn|Lidke|2005|p=144}}{{refn|group=note|Larson: "A mystical experience is an intuitive understanding and realization of the meaning of existence – an intuitive understanding and realization which is intense, integrating, self-authenticating, liberating – i.e., providing a sense of release from ordinary self-awareness – and subsequently determinative – i.e., a primary criterion – for interpreting all other experience whether cognitive, conative, or affective."{{sfn|Lidke|2005|p=144}}}} According to McClenon, mysticism is "the doctrine that special mental states or events allow an understanding of ultimate truths."&lt;ref group=web name="Hartford" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|McClenon: "The doctrine that special mental states or events allow an understanding of ultimate truths. Although it is difficult to differentiate which forms of experience allow such understandings, mental episodes supporting belief in "other kinds of reality" are often labeled mystical [...] Mysticism tends to refer to experiences supporting belief in a cosmic unity rather than the advocation of a particular religious ideology."&lt;ref group=web name="Hartford"&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Mysticism.htm James McClenon, ''Mysticism'', Encyclopedia of Religion and Society]&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to James R. Horne, mystical illumination "a central visionary experience [...] that results in the resolution of a personal or religious problem.{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}{{refn|group=note|Horne: "[M]ystical illumination is interpreted as a central visionary experience in a psychological and behavioural process that results in the resolution of a personal or religious problem. This factual, minimal interpretation depicts mysticism as an extreme and intense form of the insight seeking process that goes in activities such as solving theoretical problems or developing new inventions.{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}}}

According to Evelyn Underhill, ''illumination''  is a generic English term for the phenomenon of mysticism. The term ''illumination'' is derived from the Latin ''[[Wikt:illuminatio|illuminatio]]'', applied to Christian [[prayer]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|Underhill|2008}} Comparable Asian terms are [[bodhi]], [[kensho]] and [[satori]] in [[Buddhism]], commonly translated as [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|"enlightenment"]], and [[vipassana]], which all point to cognitive processes of intuition and comprehension. According to Wright, the use of the western word ''enlightenment'' is based on the supposed resemblance of ''bodhi'' with ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Aufklärung]]'', the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world, and there are more resemblances with [[Romanticism]] than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.{{sfn|Wright|2000|pp=181–183}}

===Spiritual life and re-formation===
{{Main article|Spirituality|Spiritual development|Self-realization|Ego death}}

Other authors point out that mysticism involves more than "mystical experience." According to Gellmann, the ultimate goal of mysticism is human transformation, not just experiencing mystical or visionary states.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|Gellman: "Typically, mystics, theistic or not, see their mystical experience as part of a larger undertaking aimed at human transformation (See, for example, Teresa of Avila, Life, Chapter 19) and not as the terminus of their efforts. Thus, in general, ‘mysticism’ would best be thought of as a constellation of distinctive practices, discourses, texts, institutions, traditions, and experiences aimed at human transformation, variously defined in different traditions."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} According to [[Evelyn Underhill]], mysticism is "the science or art of the spiritual life."{{sfn|Underhill|2012|p=xiv}}{{refn|group=note|Original quote in "Evelyn Underhill (1930), ''Mysticism: A Study in the Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness''.{{sfn|Underhill|2012|p=xiv}}}}{{refn|group=note|Underhill: "One of the most abused words in the English language, it has been used in different and often mutually exclusive senses by religion, poetry, and philosophy: has been claimed as an excuse for every kind of [[occultism]], for dilute [[transcendentalism]], vapid [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], religious or aesthetic sentimentality, and bad [[metaphysics]]. on the other hand, it has been freely employed as a term of contempt by those who have criticized these things. It is much to be hoped that it may be restored sooner or later to its old meaning, as the science or art of the spiritual life."{{sfn|Underhill|2012|p=xiv}}}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Waaijman, the traditional meaning of spirituality is a process of re-formation which "aims to recover the original shape of man, the image of God. To accomplish this, the re-formation is oriented at a mold, which represents the original shape: in Judaism the [[Torah]], in Christianity [[Christ]], in Buddhism [[Buddha]], in the [[Islam]] [[Muhammad]]."{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=460}} Waaijman uses the word "omvorming",{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=460}} "to change the form". Different translations are possible: transformation, re-formation, [[Alchemy|trans-mutation]]. Waaijman points out that "spirituality" is only one term of a range of words which denote the praxis of spirituality.{{sfn|Waaijman|2002|p=315}} Some other terms are "Hasidism, contemplation, kabbala, asceticism, mysticism, perfection, devotion and piety".{{sfn|Waaijman|2002|p=315}}}} According to McGinn, personal transformation is the essential criterion to determine the authenticity of Christian mysticism.{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}{{refn|group=note|McGinn: "This is why the only test that Christianity has known for determining the authenticity of a mystic and her or his message has been that of personal transformation, both on the mystic's part and—especially—on the part of those whom the mystic has affected.{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}}}

==History of the term==
===Hellenistic world===
In the Hellenistic world, 'mystical' referred to "secret" religious rituals{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} The use of the word lacked any direct references to the transcendental.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} A "mystikos" was an initiate of a mystery religion.

===Early Christianity===
{{Main article|Greco-Roman mysteries|Early Christianity|Esoteric Christianity}}

In early Christianity the term "mystikos" referred to three dimensions, which soon became intertwined, namely the biblical, the liturgical and the spiritual or contemplative.{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The biblical dimension refers to "hidden" or allegorical interpretations of Scriptures.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The liturgical dimension refers to the liturgical mystery of the Eucharist, the presence of Christ at the Eucharist.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The third dimension is the contemplative or experiential knowledge of God.{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}}

Until the sixth century, the Greek term ''theoria,'' meaning "contemplation" in Latin, was used for the mystical interpretation of the Bible.{{sfn|Johnson|1997|p=24}} The link between mysticism and the vision of the Divine was introduced by the early [[Church Fathers]], who used the term as an adjective, as in mystical theology and mystical contemplation.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} Under the influence of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] the [[mystical theology]] came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible,{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} and "the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names."{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6341}} Pseudo-Dionysius' [[Apophatic theology]], or "negative theology", exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity.{{sfn|King|2002|p=195}} It was influenced by [[Neo-Platonism]], and very influential in [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology]]. In western Christianity it was a counter-current to the prevailing [[Cataphatic theology]] or "positive theology".

''Theoria'' enabled the Fathers to perceive depths of meaning in the biblical writings that escape a purely scientific or empirical approach to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6r7lQ6np94YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=breck+bible+interpretation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s4rJTJCkDs2eOpDmpLcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inspired%20vision&amp;f=false John Breck, ''Scripture in Tradition: The Bible and Its Interpretation in the Orthodox Church''], St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2001, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Antiochene Fathers, in particular, saw in every passage of Scripture a double meaning, both literal and spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6r7lQ6np94YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=breck+bible+interpretation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s4rJTJCkDs2eOpDmpLcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=double%20meaning&amp;f=false Breck, ''Scripture in Tradition''], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, ''theoria'' or contemplation came to be distinguished from intellectual life, leading to the identification of θεωρία or ''contemplatio'' with a [[contemplative prayer|form of prayer]]&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt; distinguished from discursive meditation in both East&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CpPnSHWu5d8C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Matt%C3%A1+al-Misk%C4%ABn+%22return+of+adam%22&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 Mattá al-Miskīn, ''Orthodox Prayer Life: The Interior Way'' (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2003] {{ISBN|0-88141-250-3}}), pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; and West.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Contemplation |title=Augustin Poulain, "Contemplation", in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' 1908 |access-date=2011-11-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113160224/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Contemplation |archive-date=2012-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval meaning===
{{See also|Middle Ages}}

This threefold meaning of "mystical" continued in the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} According to Dan Merkur, the term ''unio mystica'' came into use in the 13th century as a synonym for the "spiritual marriage," the ecstasy, or rapture, that was experienced when prayer was used "to contemplate both God’s omnipresence in the world and God in his essence."&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; Under the influence of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] the [[mystical theology]] came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible,{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} and "the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names."{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6341}} Pseudo-Dionysius' [[Apophatic theology]], or "negative theology", exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity, although it was mostly a male religiosity, since women were not allowed to study.{{sfn|King|2002|p=195}} It was influenced by [[Neo-Platonism]], and very influential in [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology]]. In western Christianity it was a counter-current to the prevailing [[Cataphatic theology]] or "positive theology". It is best known nowadays in the western world from [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[John of the Cross]].

===Early modern meaning===
{{See also|Early modern period}}
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 166.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25| ''The Appearance of the Holy Spirit before Saint Teresa of Ávila,'' [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]
In the sixteenth and seventeenth century ''mysticism'' came to be used as a substantive.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} This shift was linked to a new discourse,{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} in which science and religion were separated.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=16–18}}

[[Martin Luther|Luther]] dismissed the allegorical interpretation of the bible, and condemned Mystical theology, which he saw as more Platonic than Christian.{{sfn|King|2002|p=16}} "The mystical", as the search for the hidden meaning of texts, became secularised, and also associated with literature, as opposed to science and prose.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=16–17}}

Science was also distinguished from religion. By the middle of the 17th century, "the mystical" is increasingly applied exclusively to the religious realm, separating religion and "natural philosophy" as two distinct approaches to the discovery of the hidden meaning of the universe.{{sfn|King|2002|p=17}} The traditional hagiographies and writings of the saints became designated as "mystical", shifting from the virtues and miracles to extraordinary experiences and states of mind, thereby creating a newly coined "mystical tradition".{{sfn|King|2002|pp=17–18}} A new understanding developed of the Divine as residing within human, an essence beyond the varieties of religious expressions.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}}

===Contemporary meaning===
{{See also|Western esotericism|Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Syncretism|Spirituality|New Age}}

The 19th century saw a growing emphasis on individual experience, as a defense against the growing rationalism of western society.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; The meaning of mysticism was considerably narrowed:&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/400861/mysticism Dan Merkur, ''Mysticism'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The competition between the perspectives of theology and science resulted in a compromise in which most varieties of what had traditionally been called mysticism were dismissed as merely psychological phenomena and only one variety, which aimed at union with the Absolute, the Infinite, or God—and thereby the perception of its essential unity or oneness—was claimed to be genuinely mystical. The historical evidence, however, does not support such a narrow conception of mysticism.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;}}

Under the influence of [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]], which was popularised in both the west and the east by [[Unitarianism]], [[Transcendentalists]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], mysticism has been applied to a broad spectrum of religious traditions, in which all sorts of [[esotericism]] and religious traditions and practices are joined together.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996}}{{sfn|King|2002}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} The term mysticism was extended to comparable phenomena in non-Christian religions,&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; where it influenced Hindu and Buddhist responses to colonialism, resulting in [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Buddhist modernism]].{{sfn|King|2002}}{{sfn|McMahan|2010}}

In the contemporary usage "mysticism" has become an umbrella term for all sorts of non-rational world views.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3-5}} William Harmless even states that mysticism has become "a catch-all for religious weirdness".{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=3}} Within the academic study of religion the apparent "unambiguous commonality" has become "opaque and controversial".{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} The term "mysticism" is being used in different ways in different traditions.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} Some call to attention the conflation of mysticism and linked terms, such as spirituality and esotericism, and point at the [[Différance|differences]] between various traditions.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=3–4}}

==Variations of mysticism==
Based on various definitions of mysticism, namely mysticism as an experience of union or nothingness, mysticism as any kind of an altered state of consciousness which is attributed in a religious way, mysticism as "enlightenment" or insight, and mysticism as a way of transformation, "mysticism" can be found in many cultures and religious traditions, both in [[folk religion]] and [[organized religion]]. These traditions include practices to induce religious or mystical experiences, but also ethical standards and practices to enhance self-control and integrate the mystical experience into daily life.

Dan Merkur notes, though, that mystical practices are often separated from daily religious practices, and restricted to "religious specialists like monastics, priests, and other renunciates.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;

===Shamanism===
[[File:Khagdaev1.JPG|frameless|left|upright=0.9|Shaman]]
{{Main article|Shamanism}}

According to Dan Merkur, shamanism may be regarded as a form of mysticism, in which the world of spirits is accessed through [[religious ecstasy]].&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; According to [[Mircea Eliade]] shamanism is a "technique of [[religious ecstasy]]."&lt;ref name = Eli72&gt;Mircea Eliade, ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamanism  is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hop87|Hoppál 1987]].  p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of [[evocation|benevolent and malevolent spirits]], who typically enters into a [[trance|trance state]] during a [[ritual]], and practices [[divination]] and [[healing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/shaman?view=uk Oxford Dictionary Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "shamanism" was first applied by western anthropologists to the ancient religion of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Mongols]], as well as those of the neighboring [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]]-speaking peoples. The term is also used to describe similar magico-religious practices found within the [[ethnic religion]]s of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Americas. For instance, [[Louisiana Voodoo]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[West African Vodun]], [[Dominican Vudú]] and [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] are related{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} folk-religions with ecstatic elements.

[[Neoshamanism]] refers to  "new"' forms of  [[shamanism]], or methods of seeking visions or  healing, typically practiced in Western countries. Neoshamanism comprises an eclectic range of beliefs and practices that involve attempts to attain altered states and communicate with a spirit world, and is associated with [[New Age]] practices.&lt;ref name="Harner1"&gt;Harner, Michael ''The Way of the Shaman.'' 1980, new edition, HarperSanFrancisco, 1990, {{ISBN|0-06-250373-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equip.org/article/the-new-age-embraces-shamanism/ The New Age embaraces Shamanism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], (Greek: [[Wikt:Ἐλευσίς|Ἐλευσίνια]] [[Wikt:Μυστήρια|Μυστήρια]]) were annual initiation ceremonies in the cults of the goddesses [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]], held in secret at Eleusis (near [[Athens]]) in [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerényi, Karoly, "Kore," in C.G. Jung and C. Kerényi, ''Essays on a Science of Mythology: The Myth of the Divine Child and the Mysteries of Eleusis''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1963: pages 101–55.&lt;/ref&gt; The mysteries began in about 1600 B.C. in the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] period and continued for two thousand years, becoming a major festival during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] era, and later spreading to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mircea, A History of Religious Ideas: From the Stone Age to the Eleusinian Mysteries.

{{Main article|Christian contemplation|Christian mysticism|Mystical theology|Apophatic theology|German mysticism}}

=====Early Christianity=====
The [[apophatic theology]], or "negative theology", of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (6th c.) exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity, both in the [[Eastern Christianity|East]] and (by Latin translation) in the [[Western Christianity|West]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=195}} Pseudo-Dionysius applied [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] thought, particularly that of [[Proclus]], to Christian theology.

=====Orthodox Christianity=====
The [[Orthodox Church]] has a long tradition of ''[[theoria]]'' (intimate experience) and ''[[hesychasm|hesychia]]'' (inner stillness), in which [[contemplative prayer]] silences the mind to progress along the path of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'' (deification).

''Theosis'', practical unity with and conformity to God, is obtained by engaging in [[contemplative prayer]], the first stage of ''theoria'',&lt;ref name="Vlachos_difference"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=MHV|Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos: "Noetic prayer is the first stage of theoria."&lt;ref name="Vlachos_difference"/&gt;}} which results from the cultivation of watchfulness (''[[nepsis]]''). In ''theoria'', one comes to behold the "divisibly indivisible" divine operations (''[[Essence–energies distinction (Eastern Orthodox theology)|energeia]]'') of God as the "uncreated light" of [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], a grace which is eternal and proceeds naturally from the blinding darkness of the incomprehensible divine essence.{{refn|group=note|[[Theophan the Recluse]]: "The contemplative mind sees God, in so far as this is possible for man."&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophan the Recluse]], ''What Is prayer?''. Cited in ''The Art of Prayer: An Orthodox Anthology'', p.73, compiled by Igumen Chariton of Valamo, trans, E. Kadloubovsky and E.M. Palmer, ed. Timothy Ware, 1966, Faber &amp; Faber, London.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos: "This is what Saint Symeon the New Theologian teaches. In his poems, proclaims over and over that, while beholding the uncreated Light, the deified man acquires the Revelation of God the Trinity. Being in "theoria" (vision of God), the saints do not confuse the hypostatic attributes. The fact that the Latin tradition came to the point of confusing these hypostatic attributes and teaching that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son also, shows the non-existence of empirical theology for them. Latin tradition speaks also of created grace, a fact which suggests that there is no experience of the grace of God. For, when man obtains the experience of God, then he comes to understand well that this grace is uncreated. Without this experience there can be no genuine "therapeutic tradition.""&lt;ref name="Vlachos_difference"&gt;Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos, [http://orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/hierotheos_difference.aspx ''The Difference Between Orthodox Spirituality and Other Traditions'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is the main aim of [[hesychasm]], which was developed in the thought St. [[Symeon the New Theologian]], embraced by the monastic communities on [[Mount Athos]], and most notably defended by St. [[Gregory Palamas]] against the Greek [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] philosopher [[Barlaam of Seminara|Barlaam of Calabria]]. According to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] critics, hesychastic practice has its roots to the introduction of a systematic practical approach to [[quietism (Christian philosophy)|quietism]] by [[Symeon the New Theologian]].{{refn|group=note|Catholic Encyclopedia: "But it was Simeon, "the new theologian" (c. 1025-c. 1092; see Krumbacher, op. cit., 152–154), a monk of Studion, the "greatest mystic of the Greek Church" (loc. cit.), who evolved the [[quietist]] theory so elaborately that he may be called the father of Hesychasm. For the union with God in contemplation (which is the highest object of our life) he required a regular system of spiritual education beginning with baptism and passing through regulated exercises of penance and asceticism under the guidance of a director. But he had not conceived the grossly [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] practices of the later Hesychasts; his ideal is still enormously more philosophical than theirs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07301a.htm The Catholic Encyclopedia online article Hesychasm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, without the need for formal ordination. While Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience,&lt;ref name="deCatanzaro9-10"&gt;[[#refdeCatanzaro1980|deCatanzaro 1980]], pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; and met with strong resistance for his [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] approach, and his support of individual direct experience of God's grace.&lt;ref name="deCatanzaro9-10"/&gt;

=====Western Europe=====
[[File:Josep Benlliure Gil43.jpg|thumb|left|Life of [[Francis of Assisi]] by [[José Benlliure y Gil]] ]]
The [[High Middle Ages]] saw a flourishing of mystical practice and theorization in western Roman Catholicism, corresponding to the flourishing of new monastic orders, with such figures as [[Guigo II]], [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the [[Victorines]], all coming from different orders, as well as the first real flowering of [[popular piety]] among the laypeople.

The [[Late Middle Ages]] saw the clash between the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and [[Franciscan]] [[school of thought|schools of thought]], which was also a conflict between two different [[mystical theology|mystical theologies]]: on the one hand that of [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzmán]] and on the other that of [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Anthony of Padua]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Angela of Foligno]]. This period also saw such individuals as [[John of Ruysbroeck]], [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[Catherine of Genoa]], the [[Devotio Moderna]], and such books as the ''[[Theologia Germanica]]'', ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]''.

Moreover, there was the growth of groups of mystics centered around geographic regions: the [[Beguines]], such as [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]] and [[Hadewijch]] (among others); the [[German mysticism|Rhineland mystics]] [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Johannes Tauler]] and [[Henry Suso]]; and the English mystics [[Richard Rolle]], [[Walter Hilton]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The [[Spanish mystics]] included [[Teresa of Avila]], [[John of the Cross]] and [[Ignatius Loyola]].

The later post-[[reformation]] period also saw the writings of [[layperson|lay]] visionaries such as [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and [[William Blake]], and the foundation of mystical movements such as the [[Quaker]]s. Catholic mysticism continued into the modern period with such figures as [[Padre Pio]] and [[Thomas Merton]].

The [[philokalia]], an ancient method of [[Eastern Orthodox]] mysticism, was promoted by the twentieth century [[Traditionalist School]]. The allegedly inspired or "[[Mediumship|channeled]]" work ''[[A Course in Miracles]]'' represents a blending of non-denominational Christian and [[New Age]] ideas.

====Western esotericism and modern spirituality====
{{Main article|Western esotericism|Spirituality|New Age}}

Many western esoteric traditions and elements of modern spirituality have been regarded as "mysticism," such as [[Gnosticism]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the [[Fourth Way]],{{sfn|Magee|2016}} and [[Neo-Paganism]]. Modern western spiritually and [[transpersonal psychology]] combine western psycho-therapeutic practices with religious practices like meditation to attain a lasting transformation. Nature mysticism is an intense experience of unification with nature or the cosmic totality, which was popular with Romantic writers.{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6342}}

===Jewish mysticism===
{{Jewish mysticism}}
{{Main article|Jewish mysticism|Kabbalah}}

In the common era, Judaism has had two main kinds of mysticism: [[Merkabah mysticism]] and [[Kabbalah]].  The former predated the latter, and was focused on visions, particularly those mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel.  It gets its name from the Hebrew word meaning "chariot", a reference to Ezekiel's vision of a fiery chariot composed of heavenly beings.

Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal and mysterious [[Ein Sof]] (no end) and the mortal and finite universe (his creation). Inside Judaism, it forms the foundations of mystical religious interpretation.

Kabbalah originally developed entirely within the realm of [[Jewish thought]]. Kabbalists often use classical Jewish sources to explain and demonstrate its esoteric teachings. These teachings are thus held by followers in [[Judaism]] to define the inner meaning of both the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and traditional [[Rabbinic literature]], their formerly concealed [[Oral Torah|transmitted]] dimension, as well as to explain the significance of Jewish [[Halakha|religious observances]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabbalaonline.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380313/jewish/Imbued-with-Holiness.htm "Imbued with Holiness"] – The relationship of the esoteric to the [[exoteric]] in the fourfold [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]] interpretation of Torah and existence. From www.kabbalaonline.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabbalah emerged, after earlier forms of Jewish mysticism, in 12th to 13th century [[Hachmei Provence|Southern France]] and [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]], becoming reinterpreted in the Jewish mystical renaissance of 16th-century [[Safed|Ottoman Palestine]]. It was popularised in the form of [[Hasidic Judaism]] from the 18th century forward. 20th-century interest in Kabbalah has inspired cross-denominational [[Jewish renewal]] and contributed to wider non-Jewish [[New Age|contemporary spirituality]], as well as engaging its [[Gershom Scholem|flourishing emergence]] and historical re-emphasis through newly established [[Jewish studies|academic investigation]].

===Islamic mysticism===
{{Sufism|Persian mysticism}}
{{Main article|Sufism}}

Sufism is said to be Islam's inner and mystical dimension.&lt;ref name="Godlas"&gt;Alan Godlas, University of Georgia, ''Sufism's Many Paths'', 2000, [http://www.uga.edu/islam/Sufism.html University of Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nuh Ha Mim Keller, "How would you respond to the claim that Sufism is Bid'a?", 1995. Fatwa accessible at: [http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/nuh/sufism.htm Masud.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zubair Fattani, "The meaning of Tasawwuf", Islamic Academy. [http://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/Tasawwuf.htm Islamicacademy.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Sufi scholars have defined Sufism as
{{quote|[A] science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Zarruq, Zaineb Istrabadi, Hamza Yusuf Hanson—"The Principles of Sufism". Amal Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A practitioner of this tradition is nowadays known as a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣūfī}}'' ({{lang|fa|صُوفِيّ}}), or, in earlier usage, a [[dervish]]. The origin of the word "Sufi" is ambiguous. One understanding is that Sufi means wool-wearer; wool wearers during early Islam were pious ascetics who withdrew from urban life. Another explanation of the word "Sufi" is that it means 'purity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seyyedeh Dr. Nahid Angha |url=http://ias.org/sufism/origin-of-word-tasawouf/ |title=origin of the Wrod Tasawouf |publisher=Ias.org |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufis generally belong to a ''[[khalqa]]'', a circle or group, led by a Sheikh or ''[[Murshid]]''. Sufi circles usually belong to a ''[[Tariqa]]'' which is the Sufi order and each has a ''[[Silsila]]'', which is the spiritual lineage, which traces its succession back to notable Sufis of the past, and often ultimately to the last prophet [[Muhammed]] or one of his close associates. The ''turuq'' (plural of ''tariqa'') are not enclosed like Christian monastic orders; rather the members retain an outside life. Membership of a Sufi group often passes down family lines. Meetings may or may not be segregated according to the prevailing custom of the wider society. An existing Muslim faith is not always a requirement for entry, particularly in Western countries.
[[File:Mevlana Konya.jpg|thumb|left|Mawlānā [[Rumi]]'s tomb, [[Konya]], Turkey]]
Sufi practice includes
* ''[[Dhikr]]'', or remembrance (of God), which often takes the form of rhythmic chanting and breathing exercises.
* ''[[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]]'', which takes the form of music and dance — the whirling dance of the ''[[Mevlevi]]'' dervishes is a form well known in the West.
* ''[[Muraqaba]]'' or meditation.
* Visiting holy places, particularly the tombs of Sufi saints, in order to remember death and the greatness of those who have passed.

The aims of Sufism include: the experience of ecstatic states (''hal''), purification of the heart (''[[qalb]]''), overcoming the lower self (''[[nafs]]''), extinction of the individual personality (''[[fana (Sufism)|fana]]''), communion with God (''[[haqiqa]]''), and higher knowledge (''[[marifat]]''). Some sufic beliefs and practices have been found unorthodox by other Muslims; for instance [[Mansur al-Hallaj]] was put to death for blasphemy after uttering the phrase ''[[Ana'l Haqq]]'', "I am the Truth" (i.e. God) in a trance.

Notable classical Sufis include [[Jalaluddin Rumi]], [[Fariduddin Attar]], [[Sultan Bahoo]], [[Sayyed Sadique Ali Husaini]], [[Saadi Shirazi]] and [[Hafez]], all major poets in the [[Persian language]]. [[Omar Khayyam]], [[Al-Ghazzali]] and [[Ibn Arabi]] were renowned scholars. [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]], [[Moinuddin Chishti]], and [[Bahauddin Naqshband]] founded major orders, as did Rumi. [[Rabia Basri]] was the most prominent female Sufi.

Sufism first came into contact with the Judeo-Christian world during the
[[Moorish]] occupation of [[Spain]]. An interest in Sufism revived in non-Muslim countries during the modern era, led by such figures as [[Inayat Khan]] and [[Idries Shah]] (both in the UK), [[Rene Guenon]] (France) and [[Ivan Aguéli]] (Sweden). Sufism has also long been present in Asian countries that do not have a Muslim majority, such as [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/25/china-xinjiang-sufi-shrines/ Xinjiang Sufi Shrines]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian religions===
====Hinduism====
{{Main article|Hinduism}}

In Hinduism, various [[sadhana]]s aim at overcoming ignorance (''avidhya'') and transcending the limited identification with body, mind and ego to attain ''[[moksha]]''. Hinduism has a number of interlinked [[Sādhanā|ascetic traditions]] and [[Darsanas|philosophical schools]] which aim at [[moksha]]{{sfn|Raju|1992}} and the acquisition of higher powers.{{sfn|White|2012}} With the onset of the British colonisation of India, those traditions came to be interpreted in western terms such as "mysticism", drawing equivalents with western terms and practices.{{sfn|King|2001}}

[[Yoga]] is the [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], and [[soul|spiritual]] practices or disciplines which aim to attain a state of permanent peace.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=10, 457}} Various traditions of yoga are found in [[Hinduism]], Buddhism and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;Denise Lardner Carmody, John Carmody, ''Serene Compassion.'' Oxford University Press US, 1996, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Stuart Ray Sarbacker, ''Samādhi: The Numinous and Cessative in Indo-Tibetan Yoga.''

Classical [[Vedanta]] gives philosophical interpretations and commentaries of the [[Upanishads]], a vast collection of ancient hymns.  At least ten schools of Vedanta are known,{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} of which [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Vishishtadvaita]], and [[Dvaita]] are the best known.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=217}} Advaita Vedanta, as expounded by [[Adi Shankara]], states that there is no difference between [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. The best-known subschool is Kevala Vedanta or ''mayavada'' as expounded by [[Adi Shankara]]. Advaita Vedanta has acquired a broad acceptance in Indian culture and beyond as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality.{{sfn|King|1999}} In contrast [[Bhedabheda]]-Vedanta emphasizes that Atman and Brahman are both the same and ''not'' the same,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} while [[Dvaita]] Vedanta states that Atman and God are fundamentally different.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} In modern times, the Upanishads have been interpreted by [[Neo-Vedanta]] as being "mystical".{{sfn|King|2001}}

Various [[Shaivism|Shaivist]] traditions are strongly nondualistic, such as [[Kashmir Shaivism]] and [[Shaiva Siddhanta]].

====Tantra====
{{Main article|Tantra}}

Tantra is the name given by scholars to a style of meditation and ritual which arose in [[India]] no later than the fifth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Einoo |first=Shingo (ed.) |year=2009 |page=45 |title=Genesis and Development of Tantrism |publisher=University of Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tantra has influenced the [[Hindu]], [[Bön]], [[Buddhist]], and [[Jain]] traditions and [[silk road transmission of Buddhism|spread with Buddhism]] to [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]].{{sfn|White|2000|p=7}} Tantric ritual seeks to access the supra-mundane through the mundane, identifying the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] with the [[macrocosm]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tantric aim is to sublimate (rather than negate) reality.&lt;ref name=nikhilananda&gt;Nikhilanada (1982), pp. 145–160&lt;/ref&gt; The Tantric practitioner seeks to use ''[[prana]]'' (energy flowing through the [[universe]], including one's body) to attain goals which may be spiritual, material or both.&lt;ref&gt;Harper (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Tantric practice includes visualisation of deities, [[mantra]]s and [[mandala]]s. It can also include sexual and other ([[antinomian]]) practices.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

{{Main article|Sant (religion)|Nirguna Brahman|Sikhism}}

[[File:Miniature of Guru Nanak from Astronomical treatise.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Guru Nanak]] and [[Bhai Mardana]]]]
Mysticism in the [[Sikh]] [[dharma|dharm]] began with its founder, [[Guru Nanak]], who as a child had profound mystical experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalra|first=Surjit|title=Stories Of Guru Nanak|year=2004|publisher=Pitambar Publishing|isbn=9788120912755}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guru Nanak stressed that God must be seen with 'the inward eye', or the 'heart', of a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lebron|first=Robyn|title=Searching for Spiritual Unity...can There be Common Ground?: A Basic Internet Guide to Forty World Religions &amp; Spiritual Practices|year=2012|publisher=CrossBooks|isbn=9781462712618|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Arjan]], the fifth [[Sikh Guru]], added religious [[bhagat|mystics]] belonging to other religions into the [[Adi Granth|holy scriptures]] that would eventually become the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].

===Buddhism===
{{See also|Presectarian Buddhism|Buddhist meditation|Subitism}}

According to Oliver, Buddhism is mystical in the sense that it aims at the identification of the true nature of our self, and live according to it.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, P. ''Mysticism: A Guide for the Perplexed, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism originated in India, sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries [[Common Era|BCE]], but is now mostly practiced in other countries, where it developed into a number of traditions, the main ones being [[Therevada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]].

Buddhism aims at [[Moksha|liberation]] from the cycle of rebirth by self-control through meditation and morally just behaviour. Some [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Buddhist paths]] aim at a gradual development and transformation of the personality toward [[Nirvana]], like the Theravada [[Four stages of enlightenment|stages of enlightenment]]. Others, like the Japanese Rinzai Zen tradition, emphasize [[Subitism|sudden insight]], but nevertheless also prescribe intensive training, including meditation and self-restraint.

Although [[Theravada]] does not acknowledge the existence of a theistic Absolute, it does postulate Nirvana as a transcendent reality which may be attained.{{sfn|Harvey|1995}}{{sfn|Belzen|Geels|2003|p=7}} It further stresses transformation of the personality through meditative practice, self-restraint, and morally just behaviour.{{sfn|Harvey|1995}} According to Richard H. Jones, Theravada is a form of mindful extrovertive and introvertive mysticism, in which the conceptual structuring of experiences is weakened, and the ordinary sense of self is weakened.{{sfn|Jones|2016| p=12 }} It is best known in the west from the [[Vipassana movement]], a number of branches of modern [[Theravada|Theravāda]] Buddhism from [[Buddhism in Burma|Burma]], [[Buddhism in Laos|Laos]], [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thailand]] and [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], and includes contemporary [[Buddhism in the United States|American Buddhist teachers]] such as [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]] and [[Jack Kornfield]].

Chinese and Japanese Zen is grounded on the Chinese understanding of the [[Buddha-nature]] as one true's essence, and the [[Two truths doctrine]] as a polarity between relative and Absolute reality.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} Zen aims at insight one's true nature, or [[Buddha-nature]], thereby manifesting Absolute reality in the relative reality.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=168}} In Soto, this Buddha-nature is regarded to be ever-present, and [[shikan-taza]], sitting meditation, is the expression of the already existing Buddhahood.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} Rinzai-zen emphasises the need for a [[Kensho|break-through insight]] in this Buddha-nature,{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} but also stresses that further practice is needed to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life,{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}{{sfn|Maezumi|Glassman|2007|p=54, 140}} as expressed in the [[Linji Yixuan#Three Mysterious Gates|Three mysterious Gates]], the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]],{{sfn|Low|2006}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]].{{sfn|Mumon|2004}} The Japanese Zen-scholar [[D.T.

It holds that "mind-nature" is manifested when one is enlightened,{{sfn|Klein|Tenzin Wangyal|2006|p=4}} being nonconceptually aware (''[[rigpa]]'', "open presence") of one's nature,{{sfn|Klein|2011|p=265}} "a recognition of one's beginningless nature."{{sfn|Klein|2011|p=272}} [[Mahamudra]] has similarities with Dzogchen, emphasizing the meditational approach to insight and liberation.

===Taoism===
{{Main article|Taoism}}

Taoist philosophy is centered on the ''Tao'', usually translated "Way", an ineffable cosmic principle. The contrasting yet interdependent concepts of ''[[yin and yang|yin]]'' and ''[[yin and yang|yang]]'' also symbolise harmony, with Taoist scriptures often emphasing the ''Yin'' virtues of femininity, passivity and yieldingness.&lt;ref&gt;''Mysticism: A guide for the Perplexed''. Oliver, P.&lt;/ref&gt; Taoist practice includes exercises and rituals aimed at manipulating the life force ''[[Qi]]'', and obtaining health and longevity.{{refn|group=note|Extending to physical immortality: the Taoist pantheon includes ''[[Xian (Taoism)|Xian]]'', or immortals.}} These have been elaborated into practices such as ''[[Tai chi]]'', which are well known in the west.

===The Secularization of Mysticism===
{{see also|New Age}}

Today there is also occurring in the West what Richard Jones calls "the secularization of mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Jones, ''Philosophy of Mysticism'' (SUNY Press, 2016), epilogue.&lt;/ref&gt; That is the separation of meditation and other mystical practices from their traditional use in religious ways of life to only secular ends of purported psychological and physiological benefits.

==Scholarly approaches of mysticism and mystical experience==
{{Main article|Scholarly approaches of mysticism}}

===Types of mysticism===
[[R. C. Zaehner]] distinguishes three fundamental types of mysticism, namely theistic, monistic and panenhenic ("all-in-one") or natural mysticism.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The theistic category includes most forms of Jewish, Christian and Islamic mysticism and occasional Hindu examples such as Ramanuja and the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The monistic type, which according to Zaehner is based upon an experience of the unity of one's soul,{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{refn|group=note|Compare the work of [[C.G. Jung]].}} includes Buddhism and Hindu schools such as [[Samhya]] and [[Advaita vedanta]].{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Nature mysticism seems to refer to examples that do not fit into one of these two categories.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}

[[Walter Terence Stace]], in his book ''Mysticism and Philosophy'' (1960), distinguished two types of mystical experience, namely extrovertive and introvertive mysticism.{{sfn|Stace|1960|p=chap. 1}}{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=291}} Extrovertive mysticism is an experience of the unity of the external world, whereas introvertive mysticism is "an experience of unity devoid of perceptual objects; it is literally an experience of 'no-thing-ness'."{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=291}} The unity in extrovertive mysticism is with the totality of objects of perception. While perception stays continuous, “unity shines through the same world”; the unity in introvertive mysticism is with a pure consciousness, devoid of objects of perception,{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=292}} “pure unitary consciousness, wherein awareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely obliterated.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=The Teachings of the Mystics|date=1960|publisher=The New American Library|location=New York|isbn=0-451-60306-0|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stace such experiences are nonsensous and nonintellectual, under a total “suppression of the whole empirical content.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=The Teachings of the Mystics|date=1960|publisher=The New American Library|location=New York|isbn= 0-451-60306-0|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace argues that doctrinal differences between religious traditions are inappropriate criteria when making cross-cultural comparisons of mystical experiences.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Stace argues that mysticism is part of the process of perception, not interpretation, that is to say that the unity of mystical experiences is perceived, and only afterwards interpreted according to the perceiver’s background. This may result in different accounts of the same phenomenon. While an atheist describes the unity as “freed from empirical filling”, a religious person might describe it as “God” or “the Divine”.&lt;ref name="Mysticism and Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=Mysticism and Philosophy|date=1960|publisher=MacMillan|pages=44–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mystical experiences===
Since the 19th century, '''mystical experience''' has evolved as a distinctive concept. It is closely related to "mysticism" but lays sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior, whereas mysticism encompasses a broad range of practices aiming at a transformation of the person, not just inducing mystical experiences.

[[William James]]' ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' is the classic study on religious or mystical experience, which influenced deeply both the academic and popular understanding of "religious experience".{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} He popularized the use of the term "religious experience"{{refn|group=note|The term "mystical experience" has become synonymous with the terms "religious experience", [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience and [[sacred]] experience.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}}}} in his "Varieties",{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} and influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge of the transcendental:{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}
{{quote|Under the influence of William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience, heavily centered on people's conversion experiences, most philosophers' interest in mysticism has been in distinctive, allegedly knowledge-granting "mystical experiences.""{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}}}

Yet, Gelman notes that so-called mystical experience is not a transitional event, as William James claimed, but an "abiding consciousness, accompanying a person throughout the day, or parts of it. For that reason, it might be better to speak of mystical consciousness, which can be either fleeting or abiding."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}

Most mystical traditions warn against an attachment to mystical experiences, and offer a "protective and hermeneutic framework" to accommodate these experiences.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} These same traditions offer the means to induce mystical experiences,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} which may have several origins:
* Spontaneous; either apparently without any cause, or by persistent existential concerns, or by neurophysiological origins;
* Religious practices, such as [[contemplation]], [[meditation]], and [[mantra]]-repetition;
* Entheogens (psychedelic drugs)
* Neurophysiological origins, such as temporal lobe epilepsy.

The theoretical study of mystical experience has shifted from an experiential, privatized and perennialist approach to a contextual and empirical approach.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} The experientalist approach sees mystical experience as a private expression of perennial truths, separate from its historical and cultural context. The contextual approach, which also includes constructionism and attribution theory, takes into account the historical and cultural context.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}}{{sfn|Taves|2009}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.

===Perennialism versus constructionism===
The term "mystical experience" evolved as a distinctive concept since the 19th century, laying sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior. Perennialists regard those various experience traditions as pointing to one universal transcendental reality, for which those experiences offer the proof. In this approach, mystical experiences are privatised, separated from the context in which they emerge.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} Well-known representatives are William James, R.C. Zaehner, William Stace and Robert Forman.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356–6357}} The perennial position is "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} but "has lost none of its popularity."{{sfn|McMahan|2010|p=269, note 9}}

In contrast, for the past decades most scholars have favored a constructionist approach, which states that mystical experiences are fully constructed by the ideas, symbols and practices that mystics are familiar with.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356–6357}} Critics of the term "religious experience" note that the notion of "religious experience" or "mystical experience" as marking insight into religious truth is a modern development,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} and contemporary researchers of mysticism note that mystical experiences are shaped by the concepts "which the mystic brings to, and which shape, his experience".{{sfn|Katz|2000|p=3}} What is being experienced is being determined by the expectations and the conceptual background of the mystic.{{sfn|Katz|2000|pp=3–4}}

Richard Jones draws a distinction between "anticonstructivism" and "perennialism": constructivism can be rejected with respect to a certain class of mystical experiences without ascribing to a perennialist philosophy on the relation of mystical doctrines.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 2; also see Jensine Andresen, "Introduction: Towards  a Cognitive Science of Religion," in Jensine Andresen, ed., ''Religion in Mind''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001.}} One can reject constructivism without claiming that mystical experiences reveal a cross-cultural "perennial truth". For example, a Christian can reject both constructivism and perennialism in arguing that there is a union with God free of cultural construction. Constructivism versus anticonstructivism is a matter of the nature of ''mystical experiences'' while perennialism is a matter of ''mystical traditions and the doctrines they espouse''.

===Contextualism and attribution theory===
{{Main article|Attribution (psychology)|Neurotheology}}

The contextual approach has become the common approach.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} Contextualism takes into account the historical and cultural context of mystical experiences.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} The attribution approach views "mystical experience" as non-ordinary states of consciousness which are explained in a religious framework.{{sfn|Taves|2009}} According to Proudfoot, mystics unconsciously merely attribute a doctrinal content to ordinary experiences. That is, mystics project cognitive content onto otherwise ordinary experiences having a strong emotional impact.{{sfn|Proudfoot|1985}}{{sfn|Taves|2009}} This approach has been further elaborated by [[Ann Taves]], in her ''[[Religious Experience Reconsidered]]''. She incorporates both [[Neurotheology|neurological]] and cultural approaches in the study of mystical experience.

===Neurological research===
{{See also|Neurotheology}}

Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.{{sfn|Newberg|d'Aquili|2008}}{{sfn|Newberg|Waldman|2009}} This leads to a central philosophical issue: does the identification of neural triggers or neural correlates of mystical experiences prove that mystical experiences are no more than brain events or does it merely identify the brain activity occurring during a genuine cognitive event? The most common positions are that neurology reduces mystical experiences or that neurology is neutral to the issue of mystical cognitivity.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 4}}

Interest in mystical experiences and psychedelic drugs has also recently seen a resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{Harvnb|Richards|2015}}; {{Harvnb|Osto|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[temporal lobe]] seems to be involved in mystical experiences,&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 14 November 2015 | url = http://www.slideshare.net/dominic54/artikel-5593315 | title = The Neurophysiology of the Brain: Its Relationship to Altered States of Consciousness (With emphasis on the Mystical Experience) | author = Peter Fenwick | year = 1980 | publisher = Wrekin Trust | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160214151842/http://www.slideshare.net/dominic54/artikel-5593315 | archive-date = 14 February 2016 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Picard|2013}} and in the change in personality that may result from such experiences.&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt; It generates the feeling of "I," and gives a feeling of familiarity or strangeness to the perceptions of the senses.&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt; There is a long-standing notion that epilepsy and religion are linked,{{sfn|Devinsky|2003}} and [[List of people with epilepsy#Religious figures|some religious figures]] may have had [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE).&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt;{{sfn|Bryant|1953}}{{sfn|Leuba|1925}}{{sfn|Devinsky|2003}}

The [[anterior insula]] may be involved in [[ineffability]], a strong feeling of certainty which cannot be expressed in words, which is a common quality in mystical experiences. According to Picard, this feeling of certainty may be caused by a dysfunction of the [[anterior insula]], a part of the brain which is involved in [[interoception]], self-reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by "anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk".{{sfn|Picard|2013|p=2496–2498}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://www.worldcrunch.com/tech-science/can-epilepsy-unlock-the-secret-to-happiness-/epilepsy-happiness-brain-fabienne-picard/c4s13429/ Francesca Sacco (2013-09-19), ''Can Epilepsy Unlock The Secret To Happiness?'', Le Temps]}}

===Mysticism and morality===
A philosophical issue in the study of mysticism is the relation of mysticism to [[morality]]. Albert Schweitzer presented the classic account of mysticism and morality being incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Danto also argued that morality is at least incompatible with Indian mystical beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Danto 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Stace, on the other hand, argued not only are mysticism and morality compatible, but that mysticism is the source and justification of morality.&lt;ref&gt;Stace 1960, pp. 323–343.&lt;/ref&gt; Others studying multiple mystical traditions have concluded that the relation of mysticism and morality is not as simple as that.{{sfn|Barnard|Kripal|2002}}{{sfn|Jones|2004}}

Richard King also points to disjunction between "mystical experience" and social justice:{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}
{{quote|The privatisation of mysticism – that is, the increasing tendency to locate the mystical in the psychological realm of personal experiences – serves to exclude it from political issues as social justice. Mysticism thus becomes seen as a personal matter of cultivating inner states of tranquility and equanimity, which, rather than seeking to transform the world, serve to accommodate the individual to the status quo through the alleviation of anxiety and stress.{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}}}

The '''orgasmatron''' is a fictional electromechanical device that appears in the [[1973 in film|1973 movie]] ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'', which also shows the effects of a related device, an '''orgasmic orb'''. Similar devices have appeared in other fictional works. The term has also been applied to a non-fictional device capable of triggering an orgasm-like sensation using [[electrode]]s implanted at the lower spine.

Author [[Christopher Turner]] has suggested that the orgasmatron was a parody of [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s [[orgone]] accumulator.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter D. |last=Kramer |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2297527/ |title=The Great Proselytizer of Orgasm |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=June 27, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |quote=Orgasmatron is Woody Allen's name, in Sleeper, for a parody of Reich's orgone accumulator, a telephone booth-sized plywood and metal box said to store a healing and enlivening force. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Turner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/08/wilhelm-reich-free-love-orgasmatron |title=Wilhelm Reich: the man who invented free love |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |quote=Woody Allen parodied it in Sleeper (1973), giving it the immortal nickname the "Orgasmatron". }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ''Sleeper'' (1973)==
The orgasmatron is a fictional device in the fictional future society of 2173 in the [[Woody Allen]] movie ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''. It is a large cylinder big enough to contain one or two people. The orgasmatron was made by decorating an [[elevator]] in the home where the movie was filmed. Once entered, it contains some (otherwise undescribed) future technology that rapidly induces [[orgasm]]s. This is required, as almost all people in the ''Sleeper'' universe are [[impotent]] or [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder|frigid]], although males of Italian descent are considered the least impotent of all groups.

The main character Miles Monroe, played by Allen, is being hunted by the police as being [[subversive]] to security of the state, and attempts to hide in it, thinking it is a closet. He is discovered there, and easily captured in a daze, with a sheepish smile on his face.

Another related device, an orb, also appears in this movie. It is a silver-colored sphere about the size of a [[grapefruit]] that contains some (otherwise undescribed) future technology. When the orb is touched by a human, it induces pleasurable sensations. In a scene where Miles impersonates a [[robot]]ic servant, he is ordered by the hostess to pass the orb among the guests. Unlike the robot he is imitating, he is not immune to the effects of the orb. Much physical humor results from his reaction to firmly holding this device, which party participants only lightly caress.

Later on, they encounter a [[gay]] male couple, one of whom offers Miles a "hit off the orb". Miles reports that he's "cool" and does not need to indulge. It appears the effect of the orb is more like social [[alcoholic beverage|drinking]] or [[drug|drug use]], pleasurable rather than orgasmic.

(Referred to in both the [[Barbarella (comics)|comic]] and 1968 [[Barbarella (film)|film]]—the description below refers to the film.)

The device has been invented by Dr. Durand-Durand, the evil antagonist in ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]''. Instead of being called an Orgasmatron, Durand-Durand refers to it as the Excessive Machine. It resembles a clamshell that once grasping the passenger's entire body below the neck, gently (at first) and pleasurably massages the passenger by flexing its upper half with a wave-like motion from right to left. The lid is made of long, rigid rod-like paddles that lie in a row, side by side. The paddles themselves each have one end at the bottom of the lid, near the joint of the Excessive Machine's "clamshell", and the other end moves freely. Because the paddles are not glued or welded together but instead move together, and because the paddles pivot around the "clamshell" joint and move parallel to the [[sagittal plane]], they can have this wave-like motion. It is operated from a [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] resembling that used to control a large [[organ (music)|organ]]. By properly manipulating the keys the operator may induce great sexual pleasure in the victim, sufficient to cause death by [[orgasm]]. In one of the final scenes of the movie the evil opponent is torturing Barbarella with the pleasures of this machine, during which she vocalises extensively ("oh", "ooh", "ahh", etc.). But in the end the machine overloads and is destroyed, while she survives, and feels rather well.

See [[Magic Mountain (1973)]] by Jadorowski for another orgasmatron.

===In ''Flesh Gordon'' (1974)===
In the 1974 film ''[[Flesh Gordon]]'', a [[ribaldry|ribald]] parody of the science fiction adventures of [[Flash Gordon]], the villain "Emperor Wang" directs a "sex ray" at Earth which causes the planet's inhabitants to become uncontrollably sexually aroused.

===In ''Orgasmatron'' (1986)===
''[[Orgasmatron (album)|Orgasmatron]]'' is the seventh album by the British band [[Motörhead]], released in 1986. It is the only full Motörhead album to feature [[Pete Gill]] on the [[Drum kit|drums]], although he also played on the four new tracks recorded for the 1984 ''[[No Remorse (Motörhead album)|No Remorse]]'' [[compilation album]].

=== In ''Coneheads'' (1993) ===
"Senso-rings" were used in the movie ''[[Coneheads]]'' to provide pleasure to the other partner.

=== In ''Demolition Man'' (1993) ===
John Spartan (played by [[Sylvester Stallone]]) is introduced to an orgasmatron-like device by [[Lenina Huxley|Lt. Lenina Huxley]] ([[Sandra Bullock]]) in the 1993 movie ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]''. The device is in widespread use in the film's future world, since actual sex ("fluid exchange") has been deemed unsafe and become both illegal and socially taboo.

===In ''Orgazmo'' (1997)===
In ''[[Orgazmo]]'', the "Orgazmorator" was built in the form of an oversized water gun. It was operated by pointing it at a subject and firing. Apparently, it could even generate multiple successive orgasms in a man.

===Surgically implanted devices===
{{see also|Wirehead (science fiction)}}

Discovered serendipitously as a potential side effect of a [[spinal cord stimulator]] used in pain relief, the medical "orgasmatron" device has been judged effective by some recipients, but costs $3,000 and requires surgical insertion of electrodes near the [[spinal cord]]. Invented by Dr. Stuart Meloy in [[Winston-Salem]], the device employs a [[function generator]] manufactured by Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation (AME Corp.). It has been described as being of great potential in treating sexual dysfunction in women.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/story?id=235788&amp;|title=Doctor Discovers the 'Orgasmatron'|date=2004-11-09|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2008-10-12|work=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Call him doctor 'Orgasmatron' |first1=Regina |last1=Nuzzo |url=http://www.latimes.com/la-he-orside11feb11,1,5212599.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles, CA |oclc=71790328 |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |quote=Dr. Stuart Meloy stumbled upon an alternative -- and pleasurable -- use for an electrode stimulation device that treats pain. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The device and its inventor were featured in the first episode of the seventh season of the Showtime show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]''

'''Pacific Lutheran University''' ('''PLU'''), founded by Norwegian Lutheran pioneers in 1890, is a private university offering liberal arts and professional school programs located in [[Parkland, Washington|Parkland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Tallest Building in Parkland| work= Brielle Erickson| publisher = Campus Voice| url = http://news.plu.edu/node/2969|  accessdate = February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a suburb of [[Tacoma, Washington]], United States. PLU is sponsored by the 580 congregations of Region I of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]].  PLU has approximately 3,100 students enrolled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = About Pacific Lutheran University | publisher = Pacific Lutheran University| url = http://www.plu.edu/about | accessdate = May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the school employs approximately 220 full-time professors on the 156-acre (630,000 m²) woodland campus.

PLU consists of the College of Arts and Sciences (including of the Divisions of Humanities, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences), the School of Arts and Communication, the School of Business, the School of Education and Kinesiology, and the School of Nursing.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Pacific Lutheran University was chartered by the State of Washington on December 11, 1890. In naming the university, the Norwegian pioneers who founded it recognized the role that a Lutheran educational institution on the Western frontier could play in the region. They wanted the institution to help immigrants adjust to their new land and find jobs, but they also wanted it to produce graduates who would serve church and community. Education—and educating for service—was a venerated part of the Scandinavian traditions from which these pioneers came.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Catalog 2013-2014 | publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = https://www.plu.edu/catalog-2013-2014/university-information/ | accessdate = March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes first began in 1894 with the student body consisting of 30 students. Tuition at the time cost $1 per week.&lt;ref name="1890-1899"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1890-1899| publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1890-1899.html | accessdate = February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bjug Harstad]] was the school’s first president. The entire university was housed in one building from 1894-1912. This building was formerly known as Old Main but has since been renamed Harstad Hall in honor of the school’s founding president.

In 1898 the university's name was changed to Pacific Lutheran Academy and Business College. Attempting to eliminate the debt plaguing the school, Bjug Harstad left for Alaska to search for gold. He spent one and one half years there but was unable to discover any gold.&lt;ref name="1890-1899" /&gt; In 1902 the PLA athletic club celebrated its first victory in men's basketball with a 15-12 win over the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name="1900-1904"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1900-1904| publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1900-1904.html | accessdate = February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later women would be allowed to play basketball.

In 1912 a second building, a gymnasium, was constructed on the university campus. It included a track, a stage, and a science laboratory in the basement. Two years later students built a tennis court in what is now Red Square.&lt;ref name="1910-1914"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1910-1914| publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1910-1914.html | accessdate = February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914 PLA received full accreditation meaning students could transfer to universities and retain their credits.

Although founded as a university, the institution functioned primarily as an academy until 1918, when it suspended instruction for two years.&lt;ref name="1915-1919"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1915-1919| publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1915-1919.html | accessdate = February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reopened as the two-year Pacific Lutheran College, after merging with Columbia College, previously located in Everett. Further consolidations occurred when Spokane College merged with PLC in 1929.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; Four-year baccalaureate degrees were first offered in education in 1939 and in the liberal arts in 1942. The institution was reorganized as a university in 1960, reclaiming its original name.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

=== Pacific Lutheran College ===
[[File:PLU - Xavier Hall detail 02.jpg|thumb|left|The ''PLC'' initials can still be seen on this weather vane atop Xavier Hall.]]
In 1920 the school merged with Columbia College in [[Everett, Washington]], and reopened as Pacific Lutheran College. The reopening of the school also saw the construction of a new building, the Chapel. Classes were held in the Chapel until 1967. The Chapel was also the home of Trinity Lutheran Church until the congregation built its own church in 1937.&lt;ref name="1920-1924"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1920-1924| publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1920-1924.html | accessdate = February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's first football team was launched in 1926. They were originally known as the "Greyhounds", then the "Gladiators" (although they are unofficially referred to as the "Lutes").&lt;ref name="1925-1929"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1925-1929| publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1925-1929.html| accessdate = February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Polly Langlow, a member of PLC's women's basketball team, scored 270 points in 12-games setting a national record.&lt;ref name="Winter Scene 2001-2002"&gt;{{Cite web | title = A century of hoops history at PLU | publisher = PLU Scene | url = http://www.plu.edu/scene/issue/2001/winter/acenturyofhoops.html | accessdate = February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later in 1927 the college's great musical tradition, the Choir of the West, was founded. The Choir acquired its name on a trip to the Great Lakes region.&lt;ref name="1925-1929" /&gt;

Another merger occurred in 1929 when [[Spokane College]], another Northwest Norwegian Lutheran school, closed. Its academic records were merged with PLC's, and several of its faculty members came to PLC.&lt;ref name="1925-1929" /&gt; In 1937 the university acquired the golf course through a generous donation. The same year the cornerstone was laid for the new library.&lt;ref name="1935-1939"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1935-1939| publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1935-1939.html | accessdate = February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1939 saw the first of several visits by Norwegian royalty when [[Olav V of Norway|Crown Prince Olav]] and [[Princess Märtha of Sweden|Crown Princess Märtha]] came to PLC's campus.

[[File:PLU - Anderson University Center garden pano 01.jpg|thumb|400px|Rear view of Anderson University Center, showing the garden behind the building.]]
During the early 1940s PLC's student body was almost all female as most men were fighting in [[World War II]]. People returning to college post-war, specifically veterans using the [[G.I. Bill]], caused a boom in enrollment. The student body at that time was half veteran and no longer mostly female.&lt;ref name="1945-1949"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1945-1949| publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1945-1949.html | accessdate = February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of new buildings were completed in the following years including Ramstad Hall, Memorial Gymnasium, and the Student Union Building (now renamed as Anderson University Center). In 1952 the new Chapel-Music-Speech Building was constructed and later named Eastvold Chapel (renamed in 2013 as the Karen Hille Phillips Center for the Performing Arts). Chapel became mandatory for the first time with attendance being taken and seats being assigned.&lt;ref name="1950-1954"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1950-1954| publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1950-1954.html | accessdate = February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later North and South Halls, the first dormitories, were built (later renamed Hong Hall and Hinderlie Hall, respectively.) Until that time students had lived in Old Main or boarded with Parkland families.&lt;ref name="1950-1954" /&gt;

=== University status ===
Reclaiming the original name, Pacific Lutheran College became known as Pacific Lutheran University in 1960. Along with the name of the school being changed the PLU mascot was also changed from the Gladiators to the Knights.&lt;ref name="1960-1964"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1960-1964 | publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1960-1964.html | accessdate = February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s saw decade-long construction boom as ten buildings were built by 1970, almost as many as had been built in the previous 70 years.

The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great change on PLU's campus when restrictions on student life began to loosen. Chapel was no longer required and two dormitories become coed. Girls' dormitories' restrictive hours were replaced with a card-key system, and opposite-sex visitation was allowed 3 times a week instead of 2 times a year.&lt;ref name="1970-1974"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1970-1974 | publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1970-1974.html | accessdate = February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing was allowed for the first time on campus in 1963.&lt;ref name="1960-1964" /&gt; Several well known entertainers performed at PLU including [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Ray Charles]], [[The Steve Miller Band]], [[The Righteous Brothers]], [[B.B. King]], [[Ike Turner|Ike]] &amp; [[Tina Turner]], and [[Bob Hope]].&lt;ref name="1970-1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1965-1969"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1965-1969 | publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1965-1969.html | accessdate = February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its history PLU has remained close to its Scandinavian roots. In 1975 the school played host to King Olav V of Norway. Three years later in 1978, 14 members of [[Parliament of Norway|Stortinget]], the Norwegian Parliament, visited PLU.&lt;ref name="1975-1979"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1975-1979 | publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1975-1979.html | accessdate = February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|King Carl XVI Gustav]] and [[Queen Silvia of Sweden]] visited PLU and the following year [[Princess Astrid of Norway]] also paid a visit to the university. That same year a monument was erected in [[Valle, Norway]], to honor the Rev. Bjug Harstad, founder of PLU.&lt;ref name="1985-1989"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1985-1989 | publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1985-1989.html | accessdate = February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989 a Scandinavian Cultural Center would be completed on the lower floor of the University Center. [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald V]] and [[Queen Sonja of Norway]] came to PLU in 1995 with Queen Sonja receiving an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.&lt;ref name="1990-1994"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1990-1994| publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1990-1994.html | accessdate = February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|Crown Prince Haakon of Norway]] visited PLU in 1999.&lt;ref name="1995-1999"&gt;{{Cite web | title = PLU Timeline 1995-1999| publisher = PLU Archives &amp; Special Collections | url = http://www.plu.edu/archives/Timeline/1995-1999.html | accessdate = February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To mark its 125th anniversary in 2015, PLU awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree upon King Harald V of Norway.

=== New American University ===
PLU is a member of The New American Colleges and Universities, a national consortium of 22 selective, medium-sized (2,000-7,500 students) independent colleges and universities dedicated to the purposeful integration of liberal education, professional studies, and civic engagement.

This type of institution was called a New American College by [[Ernest Boyer]] in a series of influential essays and speeches in the 1990s.  Since Boyer coined this term, most of the institutions that have aligned with this identity are referred to as universities; so, the term has tended to become New American University.

===Study away===
In 2009 PLU received the Senator Paul Simon Award for Campus Internationalization.&lt;ref name="Wang Center Awards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wang Center: Awards, Recognition and Grants|url=http://www.plu.edu/wang-center/Globally-Focused%20University/Awards,-Recognition-and-Grants1.php|publisher=PLU|accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Five Award-Winning Institutions Overcame Hurdles|url=http://proposals.nafsa.org/Abstract_Uploads/1717.61212.GS123.pdf|publisher=NAFSA: Association of International Educators|accessdate=February 13, 2012|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year PLU matched a $1 million grant from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] to create an endowment to assist low-income students to participate in study away programs.&lt;ref name="Wang Center Awards" /&gt; The Wang Center for International Programs opened in 2002 as the result of a $4 million donation from Peter, a 1960 PLU graduate, and Grace Wang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wochnick|first=Megan|title=After four decades, PLU study abroad program flourishes|url=http://www.plu.edu/~indepth/articles/four-decades.html|publisher=PLU|accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 50% of PLU students study away.&lt;ref name="http://www.plu.edu/about"&gt;http://www.plu.edu/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The Pacific Lutheran University campus is located six miles (10 km) south of [[Tacoma, Washington]], in suburban [[Parkland, Washington|Parkland]], on a 156-acre (63 ha) woodland campus. [[Fort Lewis#Fort Lewis|Joint Base Lewis-McChord]] is less than a half mile (800 m) west of Parkland. The campus is unofficially divided into two sections, upper campus and lower campus.

Upper campus is home to many of the academic and administration buildings including the Phillip Hauge Administration Building, Mortvedt Library, Ramstad Hall and Xavier Hall. In 1964, the Board of Regents engaged [[Richard Haag]]—'the father of Northwest Landscape Architecture'—to design the landscape architecture plan for upper campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reflections Annual Magazine|url=http://issuu.com/plu-archives/docs/reflections_1964_october/7|work=Reflections|publisher=PLU|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haag is famous for his work on [[Gas Works Park]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] and on the [[Bloedel Reserve]] on [[Bainbridge Island]] as well as the [[Seattle Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grounds Tour|url=http://dill.plu.edu/facilities-management/misc/Grounds-Tour.php|work=PLU Website|publisher=PLU|accessdate=March 16, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091723/http://dill.plu.edu/facilities-management/misc/Grounds-Tour.php|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mortvedt Library offers over 260,000 volumes of books as well as over 23,000 full-text journals. The oldest book in the PLU collection is a [[psalter]] by [[Johann Bugenhagen]] published in 1524.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Library|url=http://www.plu.edu/library/about-the-library/home.php|publisher=PLU|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Built in 1937, Xavier Hall served as the library until the Mortvedt Library was built in 1967. Since then the Division of Social Sciences has been housed in Xavier. In 2000 Xavier underwent a $5 million renovation project that saw the addition of the Philip Nordquist Lecture Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xavier Hall Undergoes Extensive Renovation|url=http://www.plu.edu/scene/issue/2000/fall/xavier.html|work=Scene|publisher=PLU|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University Center is also located on upper campus. This building houses the all-campus cafeteria, called the University Commons, and the Old Main Market. In addition it houses the offices of Campus Ministry, Student Involvement and Leadership, Residential Life, the Diversity Center, the Scandinavian Center, Student Media, Residence Hall Association, the Associated Students of PLU (ASPLU), Dining Services, Conferences and Events, and the Chris Knutzen Lecture Hall.
[[File:Eastvold.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Eastvold Auditorium]]
Along with the academic and administration buildings upper campus also houses PLU's art programs. The Mary Baker Russell Music Center was built in 1997 and is the home of PLU's Department of Music. The acoustically impressive and well-known Lagerquist Concert Hall houses the Gottfried and Mary Fuchs Organ (the largest University-based mechanical action organ on the West Coast)&lt;ref name="Notable Facilities and Programs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Facilities and Programs|url=http://www.plu.edu/about/Profile/Notable-Facilities-and-Programs/home.php|publisher=PLU|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as state-of-the-art practice and performance facilities. Ingram Hall is home to a communication computer lab, a digital photography/graphic design lab, and studio art classrooms for painting, ceramics, sculpture, photography and printmaking. Ingram boasts two galleries: the University Gallery (which houses major shows and exhibitions) and the Wekell Gallery (which generally houses student and class work). Eastvold Auditorium, formal called Eastvold Chapel, seats 1100 and is the home of PLU Theatre. Eastvold hosts all main stage productions as well as a range of smaller productions throughout the year. In October 2011, PLU Theatre premiered a new addition to its arts department, the Karen H. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. Named after the former Regent, this space is a symbol of the completion of phase one in Eastvold Auditorium's renovations. Eastvold is set to reopen with a new performing arts center in the fall of 2013.

Lower campus is home to many of the university's athletic facilities. These include Olson Auditorium, Memorial Gymnasium, Names Fitness Center, and the university swimming pool. Also located on lower campus are the Rieke Science Center, Morken Center for Learning and Technology, Martin J. Neeb Building, and the Keck Observatory.

Additional buildings around the perimeter of campus are also used for University purposes, including offices, the Wang Center for International Studies, East Campus, the Women's Center, the University House and Trinity Lutheran Church.

===Residential Life===
PLU requires that all students under 20 years of age or junior status on or before September 1 live on campus or at home with a parent, spouse or child. Approximately half of all students enrolled at PLU live on campus. There are ten residence halls at PLU, with six located on upper campus and four located on lower campus.

Every year, the PLU Football team helps move new students into their PLU home.

The ten on campus residence halls: 
* '''Harstad Hall''', built in 1894, is the oldest building on campus and housed the entire university from 1894 to 1912. It became a residence hall in 1960. It is an all-female hall, the only single sex hall on campus. Harstad is five stories tall and houses approximately 200 female residents. In 1984 the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
* '''Hinderlie Hall''', built in 1954, Hinderlie Hall was first named South Hall but changed to Hinderlie in 1966 in honor of Berent and Ragna Hinderlie, university staff members between 1923 and 1955. The hall is four stories tall, with resident rooms on each floor including the south side of the basement, which is open to the hillside. Approximately 130 residents reside in Hinderlie.
* '''Hong International Hall''', built in 1954, was originally named North Hall. In 1966 the building was renamed in honor of Nils Joseph Hong, president from 1898 until 1918 and a faculty member at Pacific Lutheran College until he retired in 1938.&lt;ref name="1890-1899" /&gt; The hall has five language wings ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) and the International Honors wing. Approximately 75 residents reside in Hong.
* '''Kreidler Hall''', built in 1957, was originally named West Hall. In 1966 the hall was renamed Kreidler Hall after Lora Bradford Kreidler, the Dean of Women and teacher of arts from 1921 to 1943. All rooms in Kreidler are single rooms and students must be 20 years of age or junior standing to reside in Kreidler. Approximately 65 students reside in Kreidler.
* '''Stuen Hall''', built in 1966, is named after Ole J. Stuen, faculty member and administrator from 1913 to 1952. Approximately 100 residents reside in Stuen.
* '''Ordal Hall''', built in 1967, is named in honor of Ola J. Ordal, president of Pacific Lutheran College from 1921 to 1928. The Hall was originally built to house 187 female students but has since become co-ed.
* '''Pflueger Hall''', built in 1962, was the first residence hall built on lower campus. The building is named after Jesse P. Pflueger, professor of religion and philosophy from 1930 to 1958. It was designed to be a three story hall to house 212 men, but since then has been converted to house both men and women.
* '''Foss Hall''', built in 1965, is named after Rev. Halfdan L. Foss, chairman of the Pacific Lutheran Board of Trustees from 1942 to 1964. The hall originally housed 188 men but has since become co-ed. It was taken offline after Spring 2015.
* '''Tingelstad Hall''', built in 1967, was originally designed to house 396 men but has since then become co-ed. The hall was named to honor Oscar A. Tingelstad, president of Pacific Lutheran College from 1928-1943. Standing nine stories tall Tingelstad is the tallest building in [[Parkland, Washington|Parkland]]. The hall is divided into four houses, Alpine, Cascade, Evergreen and Ivy with every two floors sharing a common lounge.
* '''South Hall''', built in 2000, is an apartment-style complex located on the south edge of campus. Students must be 20-years of age or junior standing to reside in South.

===Commitment to sustainability===
PLU has a long history of being committed to a sustainable campus and leading the way as an example for institutions around the world. A certification program in environmental studies was developed in the 1970s, and a major was established in the 1990s. On April 22, 2004 PLU President Loren Anderson signed the [[Talloires Declaration]], making PLU the first Pacific Northwest University to sign the declaration. Leading the nation as a charter signatory to the [[Campus carbon neutrality#American College and University Presidents.27 Climate Commitment|American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment]] in 2007, PLU accepted the challenge, showing commitment to achieving carbon neutrality. The agreement called for universities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but PLU has taken the initiative to set their goal of becoming carbon neutral by December 31, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Action Plan &amp; Sustainability Guide|url=http://www.plu.edu/sustainability/How-is-PLU-involved/PLU%20CAP%20and%20Sustainability%20Guide.pdf|publisher=McKinstry &amp; PLU|accessdate=February 9, 2012|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 edition of The Princeton Review’s Guide to 353 Green Colleges recognized PLU as a green college leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PLU recognized as Green College in Princeton Review |url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/green-guide |publisher=Princeton Review |accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights of the review include PLU dining services using 25 percent of its food budget to buy
local and/or organic food and 95 percent of the products used by the cleaning services crew being [[Green Seal]]
Certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Princeton Review’s Guide to 322 Green Colleges |url=http://www.princetonreview.com/uploadedFiles/Sitemap/Home_Page/Green_Guide_and_Green_OA/Green_Guide/Guide%20to%20Green%20Colleges.pdf |publisher=The Princeton Review |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |page=107 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:University Architecture (8064880153).jpg|thumb|Morken Center at night]]
PLU is currently in the process of remodeling and reconstructing multiple buildings throughout campus. The goal is for each building to obtain a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) rating of Gold. Currently two buildings have been awarded a Gold rating by LEED. In 2006 the Morken Center for Learning and Technology became the first building to earn the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morken Center earns LEED gold|url=http://news.plu.edu/node/1010|work=Campus Voice|publisher=PLU|accessdate=February 9, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714131500/http://news.plu.edu/node/1010|archivedate=July 14, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Morken Building is home to the School of Business and the Computer Science department. This 55,000 square foot (5,100 m²), $21 million building requires no fossil fuel to operate and is heated and cooled by using a geothermal heat-pump system that regulates its temperature with water stored in 85 wells located 300 feet (100 m) underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yudelson|first=Jerry|title=The Green Building Revolution|year=2008|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington DC|isbn=978-1-59726-179-1|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 a second building would earn the LEED Gold rating when the Martin J. Neeb Center was completed. This building was home to the radio station [[KNKX|88.5 KPLU]] and at the time of the award being presented it was the only radio facility in the nation with a LEED Gold ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEED Gold for Neeb|url=http://www.plu.edu/news/2009/12/leed-gold-neeb/home|publisher=PLU|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University Center was the third building to receive a LEED rating. Following the completion of the 2006-2007 academic year, the University Center underwent $14 million in construction renovations and as a result earned a LEED Silver rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Center Earns LEED Silver|url=http://www.plu.edu/news/2008/05/uc--leed-silver/home|publisher=PLU|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, PLU diverted more than 70% of its waste.&lt;ref&gt;http://recyclemaniacs.org/school-stories/pacific-lutheran-university&lt;/ref&gt; For its record on sustainability, the university was recognized with a Gold Award from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE).&lt;ref&gt;https://stars.aashe.org/institutions/pacific-lutheran-university-wa/report/2013-03-12/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a student-led initiative brought awareness about saving money by consuming tap water instead of buying bottled water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.plu.edu/sustainability/Take-Action/home.php&lt;/ref&gt; Bottled water is not sold in any of our campus restaurants as a result of the student-run initiative in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plu.edu/diningandculinary/culinary-team/sustainability.php&lt;/ref&gt; All of the programs in the PLU Sustainability Office are student-led i.e. Bike Coop,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plu.edu/sustainability/Campus-Groups/Bike-Co-Op.php&lt;/ref&gt; Community Garden,&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/a/plu.edu/community_garden/&lt;/ref&gt; surPLUs store,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plu.edu/facilities-management/misc/SurPLUs.php&lt;/ref&gt; and habitat restoration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Discerning Vocation===

A central tenet of Lutheran higher education – and core to PLU’s mission – is the emphasis on education for lives of service, and finding one’s calling, or vocation.  To support students and faculty as they explore life's big questions and engage in fulfilling and meaningful work, the university established the Wild Hope Center for Vocation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plu.edu/vocation/&lt;/ref&gt; originally through a grant from the [[Lilly Endowment]].

==Student activities==

===Music===
PLU's instrumental groups include the University Symphony Orchestra, Wind Ensemble, Concert Band, Jazz Ensemble, Jazz Combo, and Chamber Music. Along with these groups the university has a variety of vocal groups which include the Choir of the West, University Chorale, University Singers, University Men's Chorus, Choral Union, and Chapel Choir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music Ensembles|url=http://www.plu.edu/music/ensembles/home.php|publisher=PLU Dept. of Music|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1925, the Choir of the West has toured in America, Europe, and Asia. In 1964 the choir performed the world premier of [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] composer [[Miklós Rózsa|Miklós Rózsa’s]] major vocal piece, “The Vanities of Life.”{{cn|date=March 2018}} A decade later the choir performed the west coast premier of [[Poles|Polish]] composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Krzysztof Penderecki’s]] [[St Luke Passion (Penderecki)|Passion According to St. Luke]]. In 1987, the choir gave the first performance in the northwest of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s [[War Requiem]]. The choir has been chosen to perform at several [[American Choral Directors Association]] conventions, performing most recently in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACDA 2013 National Conference Schedule|url=https://acda.org/Editor/assets/2013%20National%20Conference%20Schedule.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Choir of the West won the Anton Bruckner Choir grand prize in an international competition in Linz, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5th International Anton Bruckner Choir Competition and Festival|url=https://www.interkultur.com/fileadmin/INTERKULTUR/Events/Results/linz_2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choir recorded a professional album in April 2018 with composer [[Eriks Esenvalds]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Spring residencies -- Eriks Esenvalds|url=https://www.eriksesenvalds.com/news/us-spring-residencies}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording artist Adrian Peacock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adrian Peacock Tweet about Choir of the West Rehearsal|url=https://twitter.com/PeacockAdrian/status/983194620044726273}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is expected to be released in fall 2018. Since its founding in 1925 the Choir of the West has had six conductors. They are Joseph Edwards (1927–1935), Gunnar Malmin (1937–1964), Maurice Skones (1964–1983), Richard Sparks (1983–2001), Kathryn Lehmann (2001–2006) and Richard Nance (2006–present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choir of the West Conductors|url=http://www.plu.edu/choir/conductor.html|publisher=PLU|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pacific Lutheran University Chorale is a mixed choir composed primarily of freshmen and sophomore singers. The choir tours regionally and appears on PLU Christmas compact discs. The Chorale performed for conferences of the Washington Music Educators Association (2010) and American Choral Directors Association (2006). In March 2012, the ensemble performed for the ACDA Northwest Division Conference. University Chorale is conducted by Brian Galante.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galantemusic.com/chorale/home.html University Chorale Website&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Mast''===
''The Mast'' is PLU's student-run newspaper. It was first printed in 1924 in the basement of the university chapel. It is now a converged media group which includes Mast TV and Lute Air Student Radio.  
It was originally named "The Mooring Mast," but was changed in Fall 2015 to simply "The Mast." The unusual, original name "The Mooring Mast" came from the [[USS Shenandoah (ZR-1)|USS ''Shenandoah'']], a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[airship]]. In nearby Fort Lewis there was a large mooring structure for the airship and the students derived the name from this in honor of the famed ship.&lt;ref name="1920-1924" /&gt;

===Army ROTC===
PLU has a US Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) detachment that each year commissions officers into the active Army, Army National Guard and Army Reserve.  In addition to Army scholarships, PLU provides a room and board scholarship. The Lute Battalion of Army ROTC won the McArthur Award—the highest award available—in 2010, 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PLU's Army ROTC Wins 3rd MacArthur Award in Four Years|url=http://www.plu.edu/news/2014/02/rotc/home.php|publisher=PLU|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==KPLU-FM==
{{Main|KNKX}}
KPLU-FM (88.5&amp;nbsp;MHz) is a news &amp; jazz format [[National Public Radio]] member station that was owned by Pacific Lutheran University. While PLU held the license for the radio station and all KPLU staff members were also university employees, the university took a hands-off approach to on-air content. PLU supported the station with infrastructure amounting to more than $1.5 million annually.&lt;ref name=KPLU&gt;{{cite web|last=Hedland|first=Katherine|title=Behind the mike at KPLU|url=http://www.plu.edu/scene/issue/best-of-scene/kplu.html|work=Scene|publisher=PLU|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

'''Participatory planning''' is an [[urban planning]] [[paradigm]] that emphasizes involving the entire community in the strategic and management processes of urban planning; or, community-level planning processes, urban or rural. It is often considered as part of [[community development]].&lt;ref name="REFALPHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifad.org/pub/bsf/cppe/cppe.pdf|title= Comprehensive Participatory Planning and Evaluation|publisher=IFAD|accessdate=2008-10-21| format=PDF| date=December 2000| last=Lefevre | first=Pierre|last2=Kolsteren|first2=Patrick| last3=De Wael| first3=Marie-Paule | last4=Byekwaso| first4=Francis | last5= Beghin|first5=Ivan|location=Antwerp, Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory planning aims to harmonize views among all of its participants as well as prevent conflict between opposing parties. In addition, [[marginalized]] groups have an opportunity to participate in the planning process.&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"&gt;[McTague, C. &amp; Jakubowski, S. Marching to the beat of a silent drum: Wasted consensus-building and failed neighborhood participatory planning. Applied Geography 44, 182–191 (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==

===Arnstein's Ladder of Citizen Participation===
Responding to the gap between the desires of local communities, and government programs such as [[urban renewal]], Sherry Arnstein wrote ''A Ladder of Citizen Participation'' to "encourage a more enlightened dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnstein|first1=Sherry R.|title=A Ladder Of Citizen Participation|journal=Journal of the American Institute of Planners|date=July 1969|volume=35|issue=4|page=216|doi=10.1080/01944366908977225}}&lt;/ref&gt; She developed the ladder as a typology, with eight rungs ranging from various degrees of nonparticipation, to degrees of tokenism, and ultimately, citizen power. Her critical assault on planning methods of the time has informed policies affecting the growth and change in participatory methods, broadening access to planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffin|first1=Greg P.|title=Geographic specificity and positionality of public input in transportation: a rural transportation planning case from Central Texas|journal=Urban, Planning and Transport Research|date=16 October 2014|volume=2|issue=1|pages=407–422|doi=10.1080/21650020.2014.969442|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21650020.2014.969442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971 U.S. Department of Transportation seminar===
A 1971 [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] publication summarized seminars where professional planners, public administrators, and citizens debated the idea of participatory planning.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"&gt;[Metropolitan transportation planning seminars. (Washington :, 1971). at http://hdl.handle.net/2027/ien.35556021061726]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Transportation recognized that citizens felt excluded from the current planning processes.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt; In the seminar the following questions were asked: "Why do you want citizens to participate? What kind of citizens should be included? When should citizen participation enter the planning process? How do you organize citizen participation? How much power should be invested in citizen participation groups? Where do local elected officials fit in the citizen participation element? What are the responsibilities of the planner regarding citizen participation?".&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt; The consensus was that citizen participation is valuable for better planning as well as for minimizing confrontation; however, not everyone agreed on how to effectively involve citizens.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt;

===Structure===
Planning needed a structure to allow natural and meaningful input from citizens.&lt;ref name="Smith, R. W 1973"&gt;[Smith, R. W. A theoretical basis for participatory planning. Policy Sci 4, 275–295 (1973)]&lt;/ref&gt; In order for this to happen, planning needed to move away from its [[Hierarchy#Methods using the hierarchical model|hierarchical model]] and move toward a reticular model.&lt;ref name="Smith, R. W 1973"/&gt; The reticular model would allow for more citizen participation.&lt;ref name="Smith, R. W 1973"/&gt; While there is some demand for a [[wikt:top-down|top-down approach]] with [[centralized]] decision-making from experts, participatory planning uses a bottom-up approach. Participatory planning aims to add more participation in decision-making, increase the legitimacy of politicians and officials, and provide for more criticism of experts' plans.&lt;ref&gt;[Murray, M. Participatory Spatial Planning : Learning from Rural Ireland. (Ashgate Publishing Group, 2010). at &lt;http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10421617&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The standard approach to planning can be defined in the following quote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Town and country planning might be described as the art and science of ordering the use of land and the character of siting of buildings and communication routes so as to secure the maximum practicable degree of economy, convenience and beauty (Keeble,1952)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This approach does not withstand the addition of complex regional and local [[socio-economic]] aspects. The top down model lacked a way to approach planning. Taylor proposes an entirely different approach to Keeble:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It suggested the need for a new kind of planner altogether, one who was trained in analyzing and understanding how cities and regions functioned spatially in economic and social terms – a planner, that is trained in [[economic geography]] or the [[social science]]s rather than [[architecture]] or [[surveying]] (Taylor 1998)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Participatory planning demands that planners incorporate a variety of interest groups in their process.&lt;ref&gt;[Davidoff, P. Advocacy and Pluralism in Planning. Journal of the American Institute of Planners 31, 331–338 (1965).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In the [[UN Habitat]] document ''Building Bridges Through Participatory Planning'', Fred Fisher, president of the International Development Institute for Organization and Management, identifies '''Participatory Reflection And Action''' (PRA) as the leading school of participatory planning.  He identifies [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Kurt Lewin]] as key pioneers, as well as claiming planning fathers [[Patrick Geddes]] and [[Lewis Mumford]] as participatory planners.  Freire's belief that poor and exploited people can, and should be, enabled to analyze their own reality was a fundamental inspiration for the participatory planning movement. Lewin's relevance lay in his integration of democratic leadership, [[group dynamics]], [[Experiential education|experiential learning]], [[action research]], and [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]]s theory, and his efforts to overcome racial and ethnic injustices.

In general, PRA has been supplanted by '''[[Participatory rural appraisal|Participatory Learning and Action]]''' (PLA), which emphasizes the links between the participatory process and action. Related work has been done on ''[[community-based participatory research]]'' (CBPR).&lt;ref name="REFBETA"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&amp;catid=533&amp;cid=4474&amp;activeid=4471|title=Building Bridges through Participatory Planning|last=Fisher|first=Fred|year=2001|publisher=UN-HABITAT|accessdate=2008-10-21|isbn=92-1-131623-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
[[Robert Chambers (development scholar)|Robert Chambers]], whom Fisher considered a leading icon of the movement, defines PRA according to the following principles;
;Handing over the stick (or pen or chalk)
:Facilitating investigation, analysis, presentation and learning by local people themselves, so they generate and own the outcomes and also learn.
;Self-critical awareness
:Facilitators continuously and critically examine their own behavior.
;Personal responsibility
:Taking responsibility for what is done, rather than, for instance, relying on the authority of manuals or on rigid rules.
;Sharing
:Involves the wide range of techniques now available, from chatting across the fence to photocopies and e-mail.

PRA and PLA methods and approaches include:
* Do-it-yourself: local people as experts and teachers, and outsiders as novices
* [[Local analysis]] of [[secondary source]]s
* Mapping and modeling
* Time lines and trend and change analysis
* Seasonal calendars
* Daily [[Time-use research|time-use analysis]]
* Institutional diagramming
* Matrix scoring and ranking
* Shared presentations and analysis, and
* Participatory planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring.

==Tools==

===E-Planning===
Participatory e-planning is relatively new way to engage citizens in urban planning. [[E-participation]] is defined as "technology-mediated interaction between the civil society sphere and the formal politics sphere"&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"&gt;[Saad-Sulonen, J. The Role of the Creation and Sharing of Digital Media Content in Participatory E-Planning: International Journal of E-Planning Research 1, 1–22 (2012).]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Horelli and Wallin (2010), "participatory e-planning, similarly to e-participation, can be an important instrument of e-democracy and e-governance".&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; Participatory e-planning is also related to engaging the general public to use tools traditionally used by urban planning experts, such as [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] and Planning Support Systems.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt;
Participatory e-planning research has focused on incorporating forms of participation with existing governance and urban planning processes. The e-planning research is also limited to needs of current participatory planning.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; The original investigations used tools like online questionnaires, surveys, and polls to consultant citizens.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; The feedback from participating citizens is then used or not used by experts and professionals. Before e-planning, citizens could provide only their opinion via direct confrontation, [[snail mail]], phone calls, or e-mails.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; The e-planning participation tools allow for more organized and substantive participation from the interested public.
The tools are:

{{quote|1."Plans-on-the-map", which is a website that allows citizens to get acquainted with existing plans

2. "Tell-it-on-the-map", which is a questionnaire-based online tool to collect citizens' comments on specific issues presented by planners.

3. The planning competitions website, where citizens can get acquainted with ongoing planning competitions and comment on them.
&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt;}}

These tools allow feedback, but still do not allow the public to spotlight issues they find important. Critiques challenge the e-planning tool to empower citizens to collaborate on the same level with experts. More and more citizens own devices that allow them to produce media. Participatory e-planning can not only use customary collaborative urban planning tools but must delve into sharing media content.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt;

==Managing forests with participatory planning==
[[Forest management]] involves a variety of stakeholders, including the owners of the forest, locals, tourism enterprises, recreational uses, private or official conservationists, or the forest industry. Each of these parties has a different goal in using forests, which complicates planning.&lt;ref&gt;[Kangas, A., Kangas, Jyrki, Kurttila, Mikko. Decision Support for Forest Management. (Springer Science + Business Media B.V, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory approaches and computerized tools like [[Decision support system|decision support systems (DSS)]] have opposing views in sustainable forest management. Researchers question whether these tools can work together and/or combine with other tools to allow for positive participation.&lt;ref name="Menzel, S. 2012"&gt;[Menzel, S. et al. Decision support systems in forest management: requirements from a participatory planning perspective. Eur J Forest Res 131, 1367–1379 (2012).]&lt;/ref&gt; The features of DSS that may help participatory processes are the following: "group decision support, possibilities to include other values than timber production, flexibility of system to include non-traditional forest data and management options, and multi-criteria decision analysis tools.&lt;ref name="Menzel, S. 2012"/&gt;"

==Examples==

===World Bank===
The community-driven development approach advocated by [[World Bank Group|the World Bank]] is an example of participatory planning.

A number of examples link participatory community plans with [[local government]] planning. One widely applied example is [[South Africa]]'s national policy of community-based planning methodology, and an adapted version, the ''Harmonised Participatory Planning Guide for Lower Level Local Governments'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khanya-aicdd.org/publications/CBP%20HPPG_for_Lower_Local%20Governments_0308.pdf/|publisher=Republic of Uganda Ministry of Local Government|title=Harmonized Participatory Planning Guide for Lower Local Governments|date=August 2003|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is national policy in Uganda. Community-Based Planning has been applied across the whole of [[Durban|eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]] in South Africa, including the City of Durban, and is being rolled out in [[Ekurhuleni Municipality|Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality]].{{When|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For further information on community-based economic development in Uganda, South Africa, Ghana and Zimbabwe, visit the [http://www.khanya-aicdd.org African Institute for Community-Driven Development's website].&lt;/ref&gt; Community-Based Planning is an example of the practical application of the [[sustainable living]].

===Case Study: Britain in the 1940s===
After the bombing of British cities during World War II, planning advocates wanted to use the reconstruction planning as a way to engage the public.&lt;ref name="escholarship.org"&gt;[Cowan, S. E. "Democracy, Technocracy and Publicity: Public Consultation and British Planning, 1939-1951. (2010). at &lt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2jb4j9cz&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The planners wanted more authority in the political system to play a more substantive role within their democracy. The planners created new techniques to, "communicate with laypeople, including mobilizing publicity, measuring public opinion, organizing exhibitions, and experimenting with new visual strategies"&lt;ref name="escholarship.org"/&gt; They also developed a forum to educate and ask the public about various plans and policies.&lt;ref name="escholarship.org"/&gt;

Cincinnati's [[Over-the-rhine|Over-The-Rhine's]] Comprehensive Plan was created in a participatory planning process, but its consistent monitoring of its implementation failed.&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"/&gt; Looking at Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, geographers saw potential logistical ways to obtain "necessary data, create a land-use GIS to analyze the data, update the data, and monitor the progress of the implementation of the Over-the Rhine Comprehensive Plan".&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"/&gt; In the case of Cincinnati, it is proven that plans that are not carried out fail to live up to the participatory planning theory. Failures like that of the Over-the-Rhine plan make it harder for further progress toward plan's goal and objectives as well as muting the participants.&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"/&gt;

==Challenges==
Ensuring that all sections of the community are able to participate is a challenge for participatory planning. Some approaches, such as Community-Based Planning, separate the community so that the livelihoods and preferred outcomes of different [[Group (sociology)|social groups]] can be identified.

Many experiences with ''participatory reflection and action'' and participatory planning suffer from a lack of follow-up. PRA has often not been part of a system, but an ''[[ad hoc]]'' process. Community-Based Planning has tried to overcome this by linking planning to the mainstream local government planning system.

Another challenge is caused by a lack of funds to actually implement the plans, which can lead to participation fatigue and frustration among communities. In the social-investment funds supported by the World Bank, participatory planning is often the first step, often leading to planning of infrastructure. In some cases, such as Community-Based Planning in South Africa, amounts of around{{Quantify|date=September 2010}} US$3,500 to $6,800 are provided to each ward to implement activities arising from the ward plan. This then stimulates more widespread community action.

==Organizations working in participatory planning==

===Center for Urban Pedagogy===
[[Center for Urban Pedagogy|The Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP)]] in [[New york city|New York City]] "is a nonprofit organization that uses design and art to improve [[civic engagement]]".&lt;ref name="welcometocup.org"&gt;[CUP: About. at http://welcometocup.org/About]&lt;/ref&gt; CUP projects aim to involve more individuals to work on policy and urban planning issues. CUP increases the public understanding of urban planning systems so that more of the community becomes involved. "CUP projects are collaborations of art and design professionals, community-based advocates and policymakers, and our staff"[9]. Together, these community members work on issues ranging from the [[Juvenile justice|juvenile justice system]] to [[Zoning law|zoning]] law to [[Food security#Access|food access]]. CUP takes these issues and simplifies them to accessible, visual interpretations.&lt;ref name="welcometocup.org"/&gt; The tools created by CUP are used by New York City organizers and educators to push for better communities.

{{Philosophy sidebar}}
A '''philosopher''' is someone who practices [[Philosophy|philosophy]], which involves [[reason|rational]] inquiry into areas that are outside either [[theology]] or [[science]].&lt;ref name="RussellHistory10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=10|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "philosopher" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|φιλόσοφος}} (''philosophos'') meaning "lover of wisdom". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker [[Pythagoras]] (6th century BC).&lt;ref name="tufts"&gt;{{LSJ|filo/sofos|φιλόσοφος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Classics|classical]] sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing on resolving [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]], and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''The Inner Citadel''. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these particular brands of philosophy are [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers. A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense, doesn’t know when to stop asking questions, and reexamines the old ways of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Perry |first= Prof. Ralph Barton |year= 1914 |chapter= Philosophy I: General Introduction: Philosophy and Common Sense |editors= William Allan Neilson, et al.  |title= Lectures on the Harvard Classics |url= https://archive.org/details/harvardclassics51eliouoft |website= Internet Archive |publisher= P. F. Collier &amp; Son Corporation |pages= 126-128 |format= PDF |access-date= 20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy, such as [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[social theory]], and [[political philosophy]]. A philosopher may also be one who worked in the [[humanities]] or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries, such as [[the arts]], [[history]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[theology]], and [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Shook|editor-first1=John R. |title=Dictionary of Modern American philosophers |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-miscMatter-0004 |date=2010 |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199754663 |page=Introduction |doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001 |oclc=686766412 |subscription=yes |quote=The label of "philosopher" has been broadly applied in this Dictionary to intellectuals who have made philosophical contributions regardless of an academic career or professional title. The wide scope of philosophical activity across the timespan of this dictionary would now be classed among the various humanities and social sciences which gradually separated from philosophy over the last one hundred and fifty years. Many figures included were not academic philosophers but did work at the philosophical foundations of such fields as pedagogy, rhetoric, the arts, history, politics, economics, sociology,turtles , psychology, linguistics, anthropology, religion, and theology. Philosophy proper is heavily represented, of course, encompassing the traditional areas of metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, logic, ethics, social/political theory, and aesthetics, along with the narrower fields of philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of law, applied ethics, philosophy of religion, and so forth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Hatnote|This section is about the history of philosophers as an occupation. For a history of philosophy in general, see [[History of philosophy]].}}

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
The separation of philosophy and science from theology began in Greece during the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="RussellHistory11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=11|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thales]], an astronomer and mathematician, was considered by Aristotle to be the first philosopher of the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Pythagoras]] coined the word, the first known elaboration on the topic was conducted by [[Plato]]. In his ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', he concludes that Love is that which lacks the object it seeks. Therefore, the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom; if he attains wisdom, he would be a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. Therefore, the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom, and living in accordance to that wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;That is to say philosophically – [[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 27: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements arose as to what living philosophically entailed. These disagreements gave rise to different [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic schools of philosophy]]. In consequence, the ancient philosopher thought in a tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 5: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Theologie, exegese, revelation' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; As the ancient world became schism by philosophical debate, the competition lay in living in manner that would transform his whole way of living in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 30: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, Dictionnaire des philosophes antiques, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the last of these philosophers was [[Marcus Aurelius]], who is widely regarded as a philosopher in the modern sense, but personally refused to call himself by such a title, since he had a duty to live as an [[List of Roman emperors|emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Meditations#THE EIGHTH BOOK]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transition====
According to the [[Classicist]] [[Pierre Hadot]], the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominately through three changes:

The first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind. Philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 31: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is the historical change through the Medieval era. With the rise of Christianity, the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology. Thus, philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual, logical, physical and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life. Philosophy was then the servant to theology.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 32: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third is the sociological need with the development of the university. The modern university requires professionals to teach. Maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty. Therefore, the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists, completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'/&gt;

===Medieval era===
In the fourth century, the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life. [[Gregory of Nyssa]], for example, describes how his sister [[Macrina the Younger|Macrina]] persuaded [[Emmelia of Caesarea|their mother]] to forsake "the distractions of material life" for a life of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Readings in World Christian History'' (2013), pp. 147, 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Later during the [[Middle Ages]], persons who engaged with [[alchemy]] was called a philosopher – thus, the [[Philosopher's Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=philosopher&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern era===
{{rquote|right|''Generally speaking, university philosophy is mere fencing in front of a mirror. In the last analysis, its goal is to give students opinions which are to the liking of the minister who hands out the Chairs... As a result, this state-financed philosophy makes a joke of philosophy. And yet, if there is one thing desirable in this world, it is to see a ray of light fall onto the darkness of our lives, shedding some kind of light on the mysterious enigma of our existence.''|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]}}

Many philosophers still emerged from the Classical tradition, as saw their philosophy as a way of life. Among the most notable are [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. With the rise of the university, the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent. Many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended, taught, and developed their works in university. Early examples include: [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 271: ''Philosophy as a Way of Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

After these individuals, the Classical conception had all but died with the exceptions of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The last considerable figure in philosophy to not have followed a strict and orthodox academic regime was [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]]. Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern academia===
In the modern era, those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system. According to a 1993 study by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (as reported by the [[American Philosophical Association]]), 77.1% of the 7,900 holders of a PhD in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions ([[academia]]). Outside academia, philosophers may employ their writing and reasoning skills in other careers, such as medicine{{vague|date=November 2015}}, [[bioethics]], business, publishing, [[free-lance writing]], media, and law.&lt;ref name=APA-nonacademic&gt;{{cite web|author=APA Committee on Non-Academic Careers|title=A non-academic career?|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?page=nonacademic|edition=3rd|date=June 1999|publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]]|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key thinkers===
====French social thought====
Some known [[French people|French]] social thinkers are [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri Saint-Simon]], Auguste Comte, and [[Émile Durkheim]].

====British social thought====
[[United Kingdom|British]] social thought, with thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], addressed questions and ideas relating to [[political economy]] and [[social evolution]]. The political ideals of [[John Ruskin]] were a precursor of [[social economy]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'' had a very important impact on [[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s philosophy).

====German social thought====
Important [[Germany|German]] philosophers and social thinkers included [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Georg Simmel]], and [[Martin Heidegger]].

====Chinese social thought====
Important [[China|Chinese]] philosophers and social thinkers included [[Shang Yang]], [[Lao Zi]], [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], Wang Chong&lt;!-- Chinese name, Wang is the surname --&gt;, [[Wang Yangming]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Wang is the surname --&gt;, [[Li Zhi (philosopher)|Li Zhi]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Li is the surname --&gt;, [[Zhu Xi]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Zhu is the surname --&gt;, [[Gu Yanwu]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Gu is the surname --&gt;, [[Gong Zizhen]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Gong is the surname --&gt;, Wei Yuan&lt;!-- Chinese name, Wei is the surname --&gt;, [[Kang Youwei]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Kang is the surname --&gt;, Lu Xun, [[Mao Zedong]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Mao is the surname --&gt;, [[Xi Jinping]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Xi is the surname --&gt;.

==Prizes in philosophy==
{{Main|Category:Philosophy awards}}
Variozcv prizes in philosophy exist. Among the most prominent are:
*[[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]]
*[[Rolf Schock Prizes]]
*[[Avicenna Prize]]
*[[Berggruen Philosophy Prize]]

Certain esteemed philosophers, such as [[Henri Bergson]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Albert Camus]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], have also won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

The John W. [[Kluge Prize]] for the Study of Humanity, created by the [[Library of Congress]] to recognize work not covered by the Nobel Prizes, was given to philosophers [[Leszek Kołakowski]] in 2003, [[Paul Ricoeur]] in 2004, and [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuessler|first1=Jennifer|title=Philosophers to Share $1.5 Million Kluge Prize|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA425090082&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=lom_macombtgps&amp;it=r&amp;p=SPN.SP00&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=45e28c97a72942b9dbf9c3e8db3e298d|accessdate=6 April 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=11 August 2015|page=C3(L)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert needed|Agriculture|date=February 2009}}
'''Phytotoxicity''' is a toxic effect by a compound on [[plant]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/pesticides/e_10.htm | title=Phytotoxicity - Pesticides | year=2007 | publisher=Province of British Columbia | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901081226/http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/pesticides/e_10.htm | archivedate=2015-09-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such damage may be caused by a wide variety of compounds, including [[trace metal]]s, [[salinity]], [[pesticides]], [[phytotoxin]]s or [[allelopathy|allelochemicals]].

==Substances with phytotoxic potential==

===Inorganic compounds===
High concentrations of mineral salts in solution within the growing medium can have phytotoxic effects. Sources of excessive mineral salts include infiltration of seawater and excessive application of fertilizers. For example, [[Urea#Agriculture|urea]] is used in agriculture as a nitrogenous fertilizer, but if too much is applied, phytotoxic effects can result, either by urea toxicity or by the "[[ammonia]] produced through [[hydrolysis]] of urea by soil [[urease]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1073/pnas.86.21.8189| title=Phytotoxicity of foliar-applied urea| last1=Krogmeier| first1=Michael J.| last2=McCarty| first2=Gregory W.| last3=Bremner| first3=John M. | journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |date=1 November 1989| volume=86|issue=21|pages=8189–8191| pmid=16594077| pmc=298245}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soil pH#Acid affected soils|Acid soils]] may contain high concentrations of aluminium (as Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) and manganese (as Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) which can be phytotoxic.&lt;ref&gt;Krstic, D., Bjelic, D., Nikezic, D., &amp; Djalovic, I. (2012). Aluminium in Acid Soils: Chemistry, Toxicity and Impact on Maize Plants. INTECH Open Access Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herbicides===

Herbicides are designed to kill plants, and are used to control unwanted plants such as agricultural weeds. However herbicides can also cause phytotoxic effects in plants that are not within the area over which the herbicide is applied, for example as a result of wind-blown [[spray drift]] or from the use of herbicide-contaminated material (such as straw or manure) being applied to the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Stefan Buczacki, Keith Harris|publisher=Collins|year=1998|page=609|title=Pests, Diseases &amp; Disorders Of Garden Plants|section=Disorders|ISBN=0 00 220063 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phytotoxic effects of herbicides are an important subject of study in the field of [[ecotoxicology]].

{{Vajrayana}}
The '''pointing-out instruction''' (''ngo sprod'') is the direct introduction to the [[rigpa|nature of mind]] in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] lineages of  [[Mahamudra|Mahāmudrā]] and [[Dzogchen]]. In these traditions, a "root guru"{{refn|group=note|(S. ''mūlaguru'', {{bo|w=rtsa-ba'i bla-ma}} [[THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription]] ''tsawé lama''}} gives the "pointing-out instruction" in such a way that the disciple successfully recognizes the "nature of mind."

The tradition of conferring such instructions outside the context of formal [[empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] ({{lang-sa|abhiṣeka}}) is unique to the [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lineages. Whether or not such instructions are valid without the formal empowerment has historically been a point of contention with the more conservative [[Gelug]] and [[Sakya]] lineages.  The pointing-out instruction is often equated with the fourth formal vajrayana empowerment.

==Terminology==

In the Mahāmudrā tradition, pointing-out instruction ({{bo|w=ngo sprod kyi gdams pa}} ''ngotrö kyi dampa'') is also referred to as "pointing out the nature of mind" ({{bo|w=sems kyi ngo sprod}} ''sem kyi ngotrö''), "pointing out transmission", or "introduction to the nature of mind".&lt;ref name="hayward106"&gt;Hayward (2008) p.106&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dzogchen tradition, the pointing out instructions are often called the “introduction to awareness” (''rig pa'i ngo sprod'', pronounced "rigpay notro")&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Tradition of the Great Perfection by Jean-Luc Achard (CNRS, Paris) pg 4 [https://www.scribd.com/doc/24054221/Achard-Jean-Luc-The-Tibetan-Tradition-of-the-Great-Perfection]&lt;/ref&gt; or "sems khrid," pronounced "sem tri".&lt;ref&gt;Germano, David F. (1994). "Architecture and Absence in the Secret Tantric History of rDzogs Chen". In The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, vol. 17.2, p 228 {{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/27399589/Architecture-and-Abscence-in-the-Secret-Tantric-History-of-the-Great-Perfection |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007232626/https://www.scribd.com/doc/27399589/Architecture-and-Abscence-in-the-Secret-Tantric-History-of-the-Great-Perfection |archivedate=2014-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior [[Shambhala Buddhism|Shambhala Buddhist]] teacher Jeremy Hayward describes this as 
{{quote|[A] direct pointing out of the nature of mind, that is mind's simplicity and universality—all appearances arise within the mind and in that sense there is nothing ''other'' than mind, yet mind itself is emptiness, openness beyond concept."&lt;ref name="hayward106" /&gt;}}

In the Mahāmudrā tradition, the mind pointed out is called "ordinary mind" ({{bo|w=tha mal gyi shes pa}} ''tamel gyi shépa'', Sanskrit: *''prākṛita-jñana'').&lt;ref&gt;''Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism'' by Chögyam Trungpa. Shambhala Publications: 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-59030-639-0}} Page 68&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]] explains, 
{{quote|From the Mahamudra point of view, the nature of our mind is completely enlightened right from the beginning, and it is known as ordinary mind. In this context, 'ordinary' does not refer to mundane consciousness—a mind that  is totally caught up in this world of [[Saṃsāra|Samsara]]. Ordinary mind refers to Mind that is not fabricated in any way. It is the natural or fundamental state of our mind, totally free from all conceptual elaborations. It is the best part of Mind. When we experience this ordinary Mind, we experience buddha Mind. It does not matter how our mind is manifesting. Whether our thoughts and emotions are positive, negative, or neutral—that mind, in its essence, is totally free from all dualistic fixations.&lt;ref&gt;"Pointing Out Ordinary Mind" by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche. in ''Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly''. Fall 2009 [http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/web-archive/2009/9/1/pointing-out-ordinary-mind.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Dzogchen tradition, knowledge of the basis pointed out is called ''[[rigpa]]'' ({{bo|w=rig pa}}, Sanskrit: *''vidya'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpa.html Description of the word's meaning by Sogyal Rinpoche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501132909/http://www.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpa.html |date=2012-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the pointing-out instruction is referred to as "the empowerment of vajra wisdom,"&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Awakening: The Heart of Mahamudra and Dzogchen'' by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche Shambhala: 2003. {{ISBN|1-59030-096-3}} pg34&lt;/ref&gt; "vajrayana transmission" or "esoteric transmission," although these terms can also be applied to formal abhiṣeka as well.

==Mahāmudrā==
As scholar David Jackson describes, the particular Kagyu tradition of pointing-out instruction outside the tantras was popularized, if not originated, by [[Gampopa]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the special Great Seal (''phyag rgya chen po: mahāmudrā'') teachings for which sGam-po-pa was best known was his so-called "introduction to the [nature of] Mind" (''sems kyi ngo sprod''), by which the disciple was led to confront and directly recognize the nature of his or her mind. sGam-po-pa is said to have given such Great Seal instructions sometimes not as secret Vajrayana precepts in connection with initiation and special yogic practices, but rather as a Sūtra-based Great Seal instruction, or even as a doctrine going beyond both Sūtra and Tantra. Later critics such as Sa-skya Paṇḍita (or Sa-paṇ, as he was known for short) maintained, however, that all true Great Seal instructions were Mantrayana teachings that necessitated full, formal Tantric initiation into a maṇḍala. These masters denied in general the existence of any Sūtra-based or non-Tantric Great Seal, and in particular they considered the existence of any Mahāyāna doctrine outside the classes of Pāramitāyāna and Mantrayāna to be impossible.&lt;ref&gt;''Enlightenment By A Single: Means Tibetan Controversies on the "Self-Sufficient White Remedy" (dkar po chig thub)'' by David Jackson. VERLAG DER OSTERREICHISCHEN AKADEMIE DER WISSENSCHAFFEN. Vienna: 1994 {{ISBN|3-7001-2162-8}} pg &lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/23509786/Enlightenment-by-a-Single-Means-Tibetan-Controversies-on-the-Self-Sufficient-White-Remedy]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jackson reports that, according to a number of Kagyu historians, Gampopa put particular emphasis on pointing out the nature of Mind. Jackson writes 
{{quote|rJe sGam-po-pa had discovered within himself the treasure of innate wisdom, and for him it was also essential to try to convey it to others. And convey it he did, on a scale never before attempted within his lineage. To do so, he bent the traditional rules restricting how certain Vajrayana teachings could be transmitted. He did this out of compassion for his students, in order to establish them in what was most important: profound meditative practice and insight."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is evidence that this practice derived from (unacknowledged) [[Zen#Ch.C3.A1n in China|Chan]] influence, a controversial issue in Tibet. As scholar Matthew Kapstein writes, the 
{{quote|... much contested doctrine sometimes called the 'mahamudra of the sutra tradition' (mdo-lugs phyag-chen) [...] was said to bring about direct insight into the ultimate nature of Mind, owing to the impact of an 'introduction' (ngo-sprod; see chapter 10) conferred by one's teacher, without the disciple's having first traversed the entire sequence of tantric initiation and yogic practice [...] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Gampopa and other Kagyüpa teachers&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; certainly wished to avoid suggesting that what they were teaching was a rehashing of the Chinese Chan doctrine, which after all had been condemned in the Kadampa tradition of the eleventh-century teacher Potowa (1027 or 1031–1105), a tradition with which Gampopa was himself closely affiliated.&lt;br&gt;This ploy, however, was not fully successful. Sakya Paṇḍita (1182–1251), for one, recognized very clearly that the Kagyüpa teaching drew some of its inspiration from such sources, and so he castigated its 'sutra tradition of the mahamudra' as what he termed, with apparent derision, 'Chinese Great Perfection' (''Rgya-nag rdzogs-chen'')."&lt;ref&gt;"The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism: Conversion, Contestation, and Memory" by Matthew T. Kapstein. Oxford University Press, USA {{ISBN|0-19-513122-3}} pg 77&lt;/ref&gt;}}

How much of a departure this in fact represented from the Indian model has been a subject of ongoing research. As scholar Klaus-Dieter Mathes has found:
{{quote|Certain aspects of the Bka´ brgyud teachings on mahāmudrā, such as the possibility of a sudden liberating realization or the possibility that a beginner may attain mahāmudrā even without Tantric initiation, became a highly controversial issue in the 13th century. For Sa skya Paṇḍita (1182–1251), such teachings represented a new development stemming from a Sino-Tibetan influence on Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen (1079–1153). Later Bka´ brgyud pas defended their not specifically Tantric or sūtra mahāmudrā tradition by adducing Indian sources such as the Tattvadaśakaṭīkā or the Tattvāvatāra. These belong to a genre of literature which the Seventh Karmapa Chos grags rgya mtsho (1454–1506) called “Indian mahāmudrā-Works” (phyag chen rgya gzhung) [...] Dr. Mathes investigated the practice described in these mahāmudrā works and found that it is not necessarily Tantric. In Saraha´s dohās it is simply the realization of Mind´s co-emergent nature with the help of a genuine guru. [[Maitripa|Maitrīpa]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Maitripa&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 1007– ca. 1085) uses the term mahāmudrā for precisely such an approach, thus employing an originally Tantric term for something that is not a specifically Tantric practice. It is thus legitimate for later Bka´ brgyud pas to speak of Saraha´s mahāmudrā tradition as being originally independent of the Sūtras and the Tantras. For Maitrīpa, the direct realization of emptiness (or the co-emergent) is the bridging link between the Sūtras and the Tantras, and it is thanks to this bridge that Mahāmudrā can be linked to the Sūtras and the Tantras. In the Sūtras it takes the form of the practice of non-abiding and becoming mentally disengaged, while in the Tantras it occupies a special position among the four mudrās.&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Mahāmudrā-Works” in the Early Bka’ brgyud pa." Centre for Tantric Studies website. {{cite web |url=http://www.tantric-studies.org/projects/indian-mahamudra-in-early-kagyu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820095822/http://www.tantric-studies.org/projects/indian-mahamudra-in-early-kagyu/ |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to scholar Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche Sherpa, introduction (''ngo sprod'') 
{{quote|... is explained by Gampopa as being of five types:&lt;br&gt;1) introduction of appearance as mind through the analogy of sleep and dream,&lt;br&gt;2) introduction of the inseparability of appearance and emptiness through the analogy of water and ice,&lt;br&gt;3) introduction of mind-as-such as empty through the analogy of empty sky,&lt;br&gt;4) introduction of multiplicity as being one taste through the analogy of the taste of a cake of raw sugar."&lt;ref&gt;"Gampopa, the Monk and the Yogi: His Life and Teachings." by Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche Sherpa. PhD dissertation, Harvard:2004 pg 175&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Trungram notes that Gampopa uses 
{{quote|"terms we find in the Mahāmudrā instruction of Saraha, Maitrīpa, and sometimes Tillipa. But his actual instruction is marked by one major difference: Gampopa ignores the methodical mantric path we find in his predecessors" and "taught openly in public, without testing the spiritual capacity of his students [...] the permissibility of teaching Gampopa's Mahāmudrā to the masses . . . lead us to view his publicly taught Mahāmudrā as a sutra teaching."&lt;ref&gt;Trungram pg 176&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mahāmudrā tradition also includes a "fourfold pointing-out instructions" (pointing out the nature of Mind on the basis of appearances) presented by Karmapa [[Wangchuk Dorje]] in his three texts on mahāmudrā.

==Dzogchen==
{{see also|Direct Introduction}}
In the Dzogchen tradition, the pointing out instructions are more often called the “introduction to awareness” (''rig pa'i ngo sprod'', pronounced "rigpay notro")&lt;ref&gt;"The Tibetan Tradition of the Great Perfection" by Jean-Luc Achard (CNRS, Paris) pg 4&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/24054221/Achard-Jean-Luc-The-Tibetan-Tradition-of-the-Great-Perfection]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or "direct introduction" (Tibetan: ངོ་སྤྲོད་སྤྲས་པ, Wylie: ''ngo sprod spras pa'', literally "directly encountering one's own state"). The "Empowerment of Awareness" ({{bo|w=rig pa'i rtsal dbang}}, pronounced "rigpay sall wahng") is a technical term employed within the Dzogchen lineages for a particular lineage of empowerment propagated by [[Jigme Lingpa]]. This empowerment consists of the direct introduction of the student to the intrinsic nature of their own mind-essence, [[rigpa]], by their empowering master.&lt;ref name="DharmaFellowship"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/pramodavajra.htm |title=Biographies: Pramodavajra, Regent of the Divine|accessdate=2007-11-15 |work=Dharma Fellowship of His Holiness the Gwayala Karmapa|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albion Moonlight Butters notes, 
{{quote|Students of ''rDzogs chen'' are repeatedly reminded of the inherent perfection of the beginningless beginning. The primary purpose of the guru's pointing out instructions--be they verbal or symbolic or telepathic--is to provide a taste of this, to introduce the student to his or her own natural awareness. From there, one needs only to sustain that way of being (''gnas lugs''), deepening the experience until all things have that unitary taste (''ro gcig'').&lt;ref&gt;The Doxographical Genius of Kunmkhyen kLong chen rab 'byams pa. by Albion Moonlight Butters. PhD dissertation, Columbia: 2006 pg 267&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sogyal Rinpoche]] describes the pointing out instructions given by Patrul Rinpoche to Nyoshul Lungtok:
:Nyoshul Lungtok, who later became one of the greatest Dzogchen masters of recent times, followed his teacher Patrul Rinpoche for about eighteen years. During all that time, they were almost inseparable. Nyoshul Lungtok studied and practiced extremely diligently, and accumulated a wealth of purification, merit, and practice; he was ready to recognize the Rigpa, but had not yet had the final introduction. Then, one famous evening, Patrul Rinpoche gave him the introduction. It happened when they were staying together in one of the hermitages high up in the mountains above Dzogchen Monastery. It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: "Did you say you do not know the essence of Mind?" Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly.

:"There's nothing to it really," Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, "My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father." Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side. Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, "Do you see the stars up there in the sky?"
:"Yes."
:"Do you hear the dogs barking in Dzogchen Monastery?"
:"Yes."
:"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?"
:"Yes."
:"Well, the nature of Dzogchen is this: simply this."
:Nyoshul Lungtok tells us what happened then: "At that instant, I arrived at a certainty of realization from within. I had been liberated from the fetters of 'it is' and 'it is not.' I had realized the primordial wisdom, the naked union of emptiness and intrinsic awareness. I was introduced to this realization by his blessing, as the great Indian master Saraha said: He in whose heart the words of the master have entered, Sees the truth like a treasure in his own palm."&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying: Revised and Updated Edition. by Sogyal Rinpoche (Author), Patrick D. Gaffney (Editor), Andrew Harvey (Editor) HarperOne: 1994. {{ISBN|0-06-250834-2}} pg. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Effectivity==
According to Dzogchen master [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], 
{{quote|Once one has received the pointing-out instruction there is the chance of either recognizing it or not."&lt;ref&gt;Interview for ''Vajradhatu Sun'', 1985&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.rangjung.com/authors/tulku_urgyen_rinpoche-interview.htm]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bruce Newman, a long-time student of Tulku Urgyen's son, [[Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche]], describes the possible responses of the student to the pointing out instruction:

:So at this point one of two things may have happened: You've had some experience that you think or hope is the experience, or you haven't. If you haven't, you can report, "Rinpoche, I've been trying to meditate on what you said when you said, 'Mind is empty.' But nothing has happened. I don't understand{{mdash}}I have no idea what you're talking about! Can you give me one word of advice on how to proceed?" Then you take that advice and start all over. A word of caution: he may not answer you straight away. He might say that you have to do some other practice, such as the preliminary practices, to clear away obstacles to your understanding. Complete these practices to his satisfaction then report back for further clarification and instruction, for however long it takes. At this point you'll know that your practice is proceeding in the right direction.

:If you had some experience, report back for confirmation. Don't assume you've understood. There are countless ways to get it wrong, and if you do, it will make the rest of your practice wobbly, since it will based on a wrong view. It would be like building a house on a rotten foundation.

:When you report back, you can say, "Rinpoche, in your teaching you said that Mind was empty. Since then I've been trying to meditate on your words and I've had the following experience..." It's very difficult to put these kinds of experiences into words, but please try; it's really worth the effort. Study helps here{{mdash}}it provides you with the vocabulary to explain yourself. So you might ask, "Is this really it?" He might ask you several questions, often to discern whether you're talking about a real experience or mostly mixing it up with what you've read or heard. If he says "no," "not quite," etc., then you go back to the beginning. If it's a definite "yes," then ask for further clarification, some instruction on how to proceed. Even if you have recognized and your teacher has unequivocally confirmed your recognition, there's still much more to learn. First are the techniques for repeating and stabilizing the recognition. (This is, of course, many lifetimes of work!) Second, there will be doubts, and you'll have experiences you're not sure how to categorize. "Was that last experience really rigpa? Perhaps it wasn't empty enough." This can go on for a long time. The doubting and questioning can start to become problematic after a while, but it's very necessary in the beginning to make sure you have it right.&lt;ref&gt;''A Beginner's Guide To Tibetan Buddhism'' by Bruce Newman. Snow Lion Publications. 1559392118&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N66_5.html]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche, few contemporary disciples are capable of recognition, even when receiving pointing out instructions from superior masters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once I witnessed Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche give the pointing out instruction to a gathering of more than one thousand people in Taiwan. He still gave the real thing nakedly and directly, leaving nothing out. This must exemplify what they call the 'expression of compassionate capacity,' for he rose to the occasion out of the power of his realization. He said, 'The oral instruction is like a candle: you can see while you hold it, and when you give it away you have no more light. But since all of you have taken the trouble to come here, expecting to hear me speak, I feel that I cannot refuse giving you the pointing-out instruction.' Then he gave the instruction in coming face to face with your own nature. Even if the great Khyentse, Kongtrül or Longchenpa were doing so, it wouldn't surpass his instruction. Yet I later met only a few there who truly recognized their own nature. Even among Rinpoche's Western students there were some very close disciples who definitely should have recognized their buddha nature. They probably had some vague glimpse of recognition; yet they use empty words, and ignore the consequences of their actions. I have yet to meet one who has fully realized his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Kyabje Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche: Essays and interviews by ten lamas surrounding the passing of a great master&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.gomde.dk/pages/interviews/turgyen/9-lamas.htm#8 Spoken by Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche characterizes recognition as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Receiving pointing-out instructions is similar to watching a movie preview. Unless we see the preview, we have no idea what the movie will be about. So a preview is an excellent way to be introduced to what a particular movie might be like. We might see the preview and then decide to skip the film{{mdash}}that is up to us. No one is going to force us to sit through the whole movie.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Similarly, we get a preview of the Mahamudra experience when we receive the pointing-out instructions from our guru. They give us a glimpse or flash experience of Mahamudra. They give us a sense of direction and motivate us to go further; however, it is up to us to extend our exploration so that we eventually come to a genuine realization of Mahamudra. Without this flash experience, we would have no way to be exposed to the nature of Mind so directly, so nakedly. That flash is a transmission of the lineage, a wonderful blessing through which we are introduced to the deeper experience and realization of the Mahamudra path. This shows how necessary it is to rely on the lineage transmission and to be connected to a genuine lineage master. Without the pure and genuine lineage, without a qualified lineage master, we would have no way to experience such a preview, such a flash experience.&lt;ref&gt;"Pointing Out Ordinary Mind" by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche. in ''Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly''. Fall 2009&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2009/fall/ordinary.php]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Secrecy==
This conspicuous aspect of Vajrayana Buddhism is [[esoteric]].  In this context esoteric means that the transmission of certain accelerating factors only occurs directly from teacher to student during an initiation and cannot be simply learned from a book. The term [[adhisthana]] (literally "blessing") refers to the spiritual energy that is received in the [[mindstream]] of the aspirant when successful transmission takes place.

Many techniques are also commonly said to be secret, but some Vajrayana teachers have responded that the secrecy itself is not important but only a side-effect of the reality that the techniques have no validity outside the teacher-student lineage.  As these techniques are said to be highly effective, when not practiced properly, the practitioner can be harmed physically and mentally. In order to avoid these kind of dangers, the practice is kept secret.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

According to the Dalai Lama in the "Tradition of Mahamudra":&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/published_books/gelug_kagyu_mahamudra/pt4/mm_15.html Gelug-Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kagyu system refers to those who manifest clear light mind by relying on the methods for penetrating vital points of the external and internal body as those who progress through graded stages of methods. Such practitioners manifest clear light mind by progressing through stages. Those with sharp faculties, however, may be practitioners for whom everything happens at once. The Nyingma tradition of dzogchen also distinguishes between these two types of practitioners. Those who manifest rigpa, pure awareness, by training through stages involving various practices with the energy-winds, tummo, and so forth are those who progress through graded stages, while those for whom everything happens at once achieve the same by relying solely on meditation on a nonconceptual state of mental consciousness without the practices of the energy channels and energy-winds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to one Kagyu text, the method of practice of those for whom everything happens at once is powerful medicine. But it is deadly poison for those who progress through graded stages. In other words, the method of practice of meditating solely on the nonconceptual state of the mind is suited only for those of sharpest faculties. For those who are not of their level, such practice brings only harm, no benefit. For them the medicine acts like a poison.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kaydrub Norzang-gyatso, in ''A Lamp for Clarifying Mahamudra to Establish the Single Intention of the Kagyu and Gelug Traditions'', has explained that those for whom everything happens at once are persons who have trained extensively through stages either in previous lives or earlier in this life. As a result, meditation on the nonconceptual state of the mind, without need to rely on any further meditation on penetrating vital points of the vajra-body, alone causes clear light mind to manifest so that everything happens at once. Such meditation does this by acting as a circumstance for triggering the ripening of potentials built up from previous practice with energy-winds and so forth, so that they automatically enter, abide and dissolve in the central energy-channel. If a practitioner has not built up these potentials, then no matter how intensively he or she may focus in a nonconceptual state of mind, this person is unable to manifest clear light mind or pure awareness. They lack sufficient causes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists of religion have performed multiple studies to measure the positive and negative effects of this coping style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trevino | first1 = K.

Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.

The effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles of religious coping==
[[Kenneth Pargament]] is the author of the book ''[[Psychology of Religion and Coping]]'' and a leading researcher in religious coping. Along with developing the "RCOPE" questionnaire to measure religious coping strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = Kenneth I. | last2 = Koenig | first2 = Harold G. | last3 = Perez | first3 = Lisa M. | year = 2000 | title = The many methods of religious coping: Development and initial validation of the RCOPE | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 519–543 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4&lt;519::AID-JCLP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1 | pmid = 10775045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pargament and his colleagues designated three basic styles of coping with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament, Joseph Kennell, William Hathaway, Nancy Grevengoed, Jon Newman &amp; Wendy Jones (1988). Religion and the problem-solving process: Three styles of coping. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, v27 n1, pp90-104. ISSN 0021-8294&lt;/ref&gt; In Pargament's article "Religion and the Problem-Solving Process: Three Styles of Coping", he identifies the collaborative, self-directed, and deferring coping styles. The collaborative style of religious coping involves an active and internalized personal exchange with God. The deferring coping style is when individuals rely heavily on God and delegate their stress without taking personal responsibility for the situation. The self-directed style of religious coping emphasizes the free will given by God that allows for the individual to solve the problem on their own. The collaborative style of coping has been found to produce the most advantages in clinical settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = III | last2 = Lynn | first2 = Q.

In a meta-analysis of 49 studies reviewing religion as a coping method, several mechanisms of positive coping were identified. Several are listed below.
* religious purification/forgiveness
* religious direction/conversion
* seeking support from clergy members
* spiritual connection
In the same study, negative coping strategies were also pinpointed. Some of them are listed below.
* spiritual discontent
* punishing God reappraisal
* reappraisal of God's powers
* pleading for direct intercession
The study then identified forms of positive psychological adjustment, like those listed below.
* acceptance
* happiness
* optimism
* purpose in life
A similar list of negative psychological adjustments was compiled.
* anxiety
* burden
* negative mood
* callousness
Positive religious coping methods correlated more strongly with positive psychological adjustment than negative psychological adjustment. Similarly, negative religious coping methods correlated with negative psychological adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–80|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific traumatic events==

===September 11 attacks===
The [[September 11 attacks]] have been widely studied among psychologists. Research has shown that 90% of Americans coped with the stress of September 11 (2001) by "turning to religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Harold G|title=Research on Religion, Spirituality, and Mental Health: A Review|journal=The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|volume=54|issue=5|pages=283–291|doi=10.1177/070674370905400502|pmid=19497160|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-two percent of a sample of undergraduate and graduate students reported praying to cope with the stress that followed the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stein | first1 = BD | last2 = Elliott | first2 = MN | last3 = Jaycox | first3 = LH | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = A national longitudinal study of the psychological consequences of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks: reactions, impairment, and help-seeking | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 105–117 | doi=10.1521/psyc.67.2.105.35964| pmid = 15262576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis showed that searching for spiritual meaning was associated with less anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Cascio | first2 = T | last3 = Santangelo | first3 = LK | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Hope, meaning, and growth following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks | url = | journal = J Interpers Violence | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 523–548 | doi=10.1177/0886260504272896| pmid = 15788553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists also examined the types of coping used and how they affected mental health outcomes. Research shows that people who used positive religious coping displayed greater optimism, less anxiety, and higher levels of positive emotion three months after the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Tice | first2 = TN | last3 = Peterson | first3 = C | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Prayers, spiritual support, and positive attitudes in coping with the September 11 national crisis | url = | journal = J Pers | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 763–791 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00328.x| pmid = 15854013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who used positive religious coping were found to have significantly more positive outcomes (closeness with God, relationships with family and friends) than those who used negative religious coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = KI | last2 = Ishler | first2 = K | last3 = Dubow | first3 = EF | display-authors = etal | year = 1994 | title = Methods of religious coping with the Gulf War: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses | url = | journal = J Sci Study Relig | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 347–361 | doi=10.2307/1386494| jstor = 1386494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American Muslims were another highly studied group after the attacks. Results in this area align with previous research, showing that positive religious coping is associated with posttraumatic growth, while negative religious coping predicted higher levels of depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abu-Raiya | first1 = H. | last2 = Pargament | first2 = K. I. | last3 = Mahoney | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Examining coping methods with stressful interpersonal events experienced by Muslims living in the United States following the 9/11 attacks | url = | journal = Psychology of Religion and Spirituality | volume = 3| issue = | pages = 1–14| doi = 10.1037/a0020034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of a loved one===

Individuals deal with the death of significant people in their lives in a variety of ways. One of the most common ways that Americans deal with the death of a loved one is by turning to religion. Although most psychologists would argue that religious coping leads to positive outcomes, some research identifies that coping using religious can lead to greater amounts of distress, especially in dealing with the loss of a family member due to homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Vardaman | first2 = P. J. | year = 1997 | title = The role of religion in coping with the loss of a family member to homicide | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 44–51 | doi = 10.2307/1387881 | jstor = 1387881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research recognized that the role of attachment to God is very important in determining how successful religious coping will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ungureanu | first1 = I. | last2 = Sandberg | first2 = J. G. | year = 2010 | title = Broken together": Spirituality and religion as coping strategies for couples dealing with the death of a child: A literature review with clinical implications | url = | journal = Contemporary Family Therapy: An International Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 302–319 | doi = 10.1007/s10591-010-9120-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that secure attachment to God and a positive religious coping style is positively correlated with stress related growth, positive religious outcomes, and a developed sense of meaning. Anxious and avoidant attachments to God and negative religious coping styles were positively correlated with depression, traumatic distress, and separation distress. Furthermore, attachment to God was strongly more correlated to positive outcomes than attachment to others.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, M. M. (2003, April). Bereavement and grief related to a significant death: A psychological and theological study of attachment styles and religious coping. Dissertation Abstracts International Section A, 63,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near-death experiences===

[[Near-death experiences]] (NDEs) provide a unique opportunity for psychologists to study the way in which people cope with their own death. NDEs generally trigger an out-of-body experience into a realm populated with spiritual beings and have the potential to shape American attitudes toward death in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kwilecki | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Religion and Coping: A Contribution from Religious Studies | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 477–489 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00250.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys show that five percent of Americans have a NDE, which presents a limited field to study.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L. W. and J. Yates. (1996.) Introduction. In the near-death experience: A reader, edited by L. W. Bailey and J. Yates, pp. 1–23. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, people who have NDEs report positive outcomes including reduced anxiety, increased capacity to love, and a higher sense of meaning and purpose in life.&lt;ref&gt;Atwater, P. M. H. (1994). Beyond the light: The mysteries and revelations of near-death experiences. New York: Avon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have NDEs often fall into Pargament's category of transformative coping. In these cases, the person is transformed into a whole new way of life and way of thinking by one supernatural experience.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using religious coping in school and work ==

=== MindUP Initiative ===
Twelve years ago Goldie Hawn founded MindUP: a mindfulness based initiative to help students in schools deal with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, E. (2015, Feb 17). Can 'mindfulness' help students do better in school? advocates say the meditation technique raises focus and lowers stress. critics see religion in disguise. Wall Street Journal (Online)&lt;/ref&gt; The program has since been implemented in schools in 28 states, and has locations in Canada, China, Serbia, Australia, and Venezuela. The program invites students to participate in 15 lessons based on neuroscience. Kimberly Schonert-Reichl an employee of MindsUP and of the University of British Columbia evaluated the effectiveness of MindUP on students grades 4 through 5. Her findings are shown below:

* 82% of children reported having a more positive outlook
* 81% of children learned to make themselves happy
* 58% of children tried to help others more often

Even though MindUP has had very positive effects skeptics call it religion in disguise. They claim that the mindfulness exercises such as "belly breaths" are [[Buddhist]] practices as a different name. In some states MindUP has been removed from schools because schools are supposed to be secular and non-religious.

===Religion as buffer in the workplace===
A study was conducted by Dr Roxane Gervais, a senior psychologist at the Health and Safety Laboratory in Stockport.&lt;ref&gt;Religion forms buffer against work stress. (2014, Jan 09). Telegraph.Co.Uk&lt;/ref&gt; She found that people who were more actively religious were more likely to report low levels of anxiety, depression and fatigue and also felt a higher presence of meaning in life. These people also took less sick days. She concluded that employers should accommodate time for employees to engage in religious beliefs while at work in order to improve performance.

==Religious coping in clinical settings==
Despite the problems encountered when studying religion as a coping mechanism, much research suggests that using it in intervention settings when applicable may be beneficial. For example, according to a study be Wachholtz and Pargament, when identified religious people suffering from splitting migraines were exposed to meditations with religious or non-religious content, they reported less pain after the religious meditations. Such "psychospiritual" methods have been utilized for a while, although their applications are limited and specific from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|pages=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion vs. spirituality==
Research in the psychology of religion often reveals different outcomes between [[religion]] and [[spirituality]]. A person's religion is a collection of belief systems and moral values, often established by a governing institution. Religion is generally more traditional, organized, and sociological. Religion is considered to be more formal and upheld than spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirituality, on the other hand, is a measure of one's intrinsic relationship with their God. Spirituality is viewed and studied as being more free-formed and psychological. Also, spirituality is considered to be a private experience that promotes a process of growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the psychology of coping with trauma, religion and spirituality can play very different roles. Some research shows that religion, but not spirituality can help with coping,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Tomas. (2012). Religion, but not spirituality, helps protect against post-earthquake trauma. Epiphenom.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other shows that intrinsic spirituality can be a very effective style of coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vespa | first1 = A. | last2 = Jacobsen | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Spazzafumo | first3 = L. | last4 = Balducci | first4 = L. | year = 2011 | title = Evaluation of intrapsychic factors, coping styles, and spirituality of patients affected by tumors | url = | journal = Psycho-Oncology | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 5–11 | doi = 10.1002/pon.1719 | pmid = 20336646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences found between religious and spiritual coping may be further evidence of the role of attachment styles and types of coping used. Through religious and spiritual coping, individuals can derive support from a divine being, from other members of a religious congregation, and from making meaning of distressing events, which can lead to the promotion of resilience, healing, and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with studying religious coping==
Studying religion as a coping mechanism has proved a difficult task for psychologists. Religion seems to be an integral part of some people's lives but not of others, so specialists cannot be certain whether religion is the variable to study or if there is something about religious people that makes them religious that is worth studying. Many studies only measure the frequency of certain "religious" activities including prayer or religious service attendance; however, just because a person exhibits religious behavior does not mean that he or she uses his or her religion to cope or even adheres to the set of beliefs that constitutes a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–480|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the research done on religion and coping has been isolated to Christianity. Studies are being conducted to accommodate for the diversity of religions and their differences among cultures.

Many studies on the subject show contrary results. For example, some psychologists conclude that religiosity has no positive or negative outcomes at all and others cite that any form of religious coping has ultimately negative effects. These results may be a product of the inconsistencies in the ways that religion is studied as a coping mechanism or could reflect biases of researchers toward a certain religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Samikshavad.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Politicians of Today'' by Ram Chandra Shukla]] --&gt;'''Samikshavad''' is the first indigenous [[art movement]] in modern [[India]], which started in [[North India]] in 1974. It has a different identity from the western movements of art. It is neither affected nor inspired by western art.

Its main source of inspiration is the present social, political, cultural and economic conditions. Its aim is to make the art free from personalized obligations and to socialize it, to change the art from mystery to something having special aim. By this style, the artist tends to expose the corruption prevalent in society and politics, with a language that is symbolic and satirical. This movement has changed the scenario of modern Indian painting in India in the late '70s. A few of the artists who were inspired by this movement were Ravindra Nath Mishra, Hridya Narayan Mishra, Santosh Kumar Singh, Virendra Prasad Singh, Ram Shabd Singh, Raghuvir Sen Dhir, Ved Prakash Mishra, Gopal Madhukar Chaturvedi, Bala Dutt Pandey etc. Prof. [[Ram Chandra Shukla]], Professor and Head of the Department of Painting at [[Banaras Hindu University]], [[Varanasi]], at that time, was the initiator and the main source of inspiration for this movement.

==The theme of Samikshavad==

Samikshavad is an Indian movement of Modern Art which is opposed to the tendency of Indian artists following the Western trends of Modern Art. Its basic purpose is to help create such an art in the country which has its roots in Indian soil. "Samiksha" is a Sanskrit word which means criticism of life and society in which they live. It is also against any type of imitation of the past styles or the present styles of art. A manifesto of the movement was published at the first exhibition of such paintings at the [[AIFACS]] Gallery in 1979 at Delhi. The exhibition presented in all, 26 paintings in oil medium. The artists whose works were included in the first exhibition were S/s R.C. Shukla, R.S. Dhir, Santosh Kumar Singh and Ved Prakash Mishra from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi; Dr. Gopal Madhukar Chaturvedi from Aligarh and Bala Dutt Pandey from Allahabad. The exhibition was inaugurated by the well-known "young Turk" Shri Chandra Shekhar, then President of the [[Janata Party]]. Since then lots of comments, reviews and articles have come from several of the leading newspapers, weeklies and art journals referring to this movement. Invitations have been received from several parts of India to hold exhibitions there. There is a silent but meaningful whisper in the air about "Samikshavad" in Indian art circles. Several illustrated lecture programs on Samikshavad have been sponsored by university art departments at different places. The movement has gained ground in the country and has created a new atmosphere in the field of art for an indigenous development of Indian Modern Art. The only hurdle in the way of Indian art is prejudice, ''purvagrah'' (bias) and misconception. Samikshavad is a modern movement of Indian contemporary art.

The exhibition at Delhi was visited by thousands of people{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} including well-known artists, art critics, art connoisseurs, journalists and the common people.

Modern Western art is either an expression of the artists' inner turmoil and tensions or mere feats of colour and form. Mostly it is aimless or personal fad. Can such art ever become popular and useful to society at large? But capitalist society has accepted it as a form of business transactions. They collect art and sell art just to make capital out of it. In a poor country like India art cannot fulfill that aim. Art can have no other aim but to serve the people, to inspire and educate them, to prepare them for a better life and society. And "Samikshavad" aims at that.

"Samikshavadi" artists are not at all interested in merely showing feats of colour and form. Colour and form or their composition, in itself that of abstract art, may produce a musical or magical effect, but art cannot survive or thrive on that alone. Such music or magic, if they just remain to be a form of entertainment and do not serve a higher purpose of social uplift, cannot claim to be great art. They may remain in the category of crafts. But those crafts which are not useful like "witch-craft" have no place in modern society. Today the so-called Modern Artists who are better than such craftsmen, when called upon to explain the purpose of their art, prattle, "We create 'Form', 'Colour composition' or 'Symbol'". They go no further and expect the visitor to appreciate and explain their jargon themselves. Line, form, colour, texture or tones are just elements of the language of art. They cannot be an end in themselves. They have to be used skilfully to serve the purpose of communication or expression. If they fail in this they are just like heaps of useless bricks, sand and cement gathered together. They cannot claim to be purposeful if they do not help in creating a building suitable for human living. "Samikshavadi" painters are not interested in showing their excellence of skill or painterly qualities as an end in itself.

They believe in using simple, direct and powerful language of art to express their ideas and feelings forcefully as witnessed in the folk arts. Painterly qualities or the fineries of art are the fads of a capitalist or feudalistic society; they are not at all needed in the socialistic society.
Samikshavadi painters use a symbolic language. They express their ideas and feelings through common and powerful symbols. It is because of this that sometimes they are mistaken for Surrealists, which they certainly are not. Surrealists are also supposed to use dream symbols influenced by Freud's dream psychology, and they claimed it to be "pure psychic automatism through which it is intended to express the true functioning of thought. Thought dictated in the absence of all control exerted by reason", whereas Samikshavadis use common symbols consciously and rationally to express their desired idea. Surrealist works are mystic and fantastic in nature but a Samikshavadi artist is socially motivated; a Surrealist attitude is highly personal and individual whereas a Samikshavadi attitude is generally impersonal. Surrealism is basically an anti-art movement but Samikshavadi is an art movement suited to the present atmosphere in the country.

It is generally satirical in nature. The element of satire is its specialty. Up till now the element of satire was generally considered to be a feature of cartoons or caricatures.  Never before in the history of Indian art was satire used as an important medium of art expression in the form of painting, as seen in Samikshavadi art. Perhaps satire was not considered to be necessary or advisable in painting because ancient and medieval art was mostly religious, mythological and idealistic. Under the present circumstances and social change art cannot remain only religious. It has tended towards secularism. The Samikshavadi painters are motivated by day-to-day happenings and are sensitive to the political and social conditions in which they live today. The social, political and economic problems of India are depressing. Life is becoming insecure and helpless. Poverty has multiplied. Exploitation is at its height. Under such circumstances artists and writers have to play an important role. They cannot just remain in a dreamland. They have to educate their people and awaken them to be prepared to fight the evils of the society. Satire is a powerful media to bring to bring people back to senses. Satire can give a shock treatment to generate a new energy in the people to face the real problems, to transform the society. Samikshavad aims at that and that is why it has taken a new course which was not commonly used in the field of painting up till now. Their path may appear to the prejudiced person aesthetically unsound but it is socially very promising.

It is true that Samikshavadi painters are against imagination of any of the past styles or isms of art of the East or the West, but sometimes their work may indicate some influences. This may either be consciously done or just due to past habit, and may disappear after some time. But whatever influences are seen they are generally of a technical nature. Samikshavadi painters are free to choose any technique that serves them in expressing their ideas and feelings powerfully. Some of the Samikshavadis are interested in using techniques of the past Indian Art to become more meaningful and effective. This does not mean that they are tied to any traditional style. Technique and style or "isms" are not the same thing.

The themes of Samikshavadi paintings are taken from social life of the common people. It is not something new. Many artists have done so in the past and are still doing so. In India [[Amrita Shergil]] was the first important and powerful painter of social life. Satish Gujral in his early phase also painted social life powerfully. Others have also done it. But there is a difference of approach between them and Samikshavadi painters. Most of the artists have been interested in their day-to-day social life. That also is no doubt important and useful in bringing about social change but Samikshavadi painters are not contented with that only. They have gone a step further. They may show the plight of the people also but they are much more interested in attacking those who are responsible for it. If the causes are exposed the people will be more alert to eradicate them. Their description of the malady suggests lines of treatment. Moreover, Samikshavadi painters are generally interested in conscious symbolic sarcasm which is definitely a new phenomenon in the field of painting. This attitude has been witnessed casually in some form or the other in some of the artists' work in India and abroad, but never before it has come out as a combined movement with this particular purpose. Mostly other painters have been just satisfied in mocking the contemporary life pattern as did the pop artist of the west, which has been nothing but an anti-art attitude, or the Surrealists' like that of Chagall and Richard Hamilton. Bhupen Khokhor of India has followed the same attitude of the pop artist of the West.

'''Sociology of food''' is the study of [[food]] as it relates to the history, progression, and future development of [[society]]. This includes production, consumption, distribution, conflict, medical application, ritual, spiritual, ethical, and cultural applications, environmental and labor issues.

The aspect of food distribution in our society can be examined through the analysis of the changes in the food supply chain. Globalization in particular, has significant effects on the food supply chain by enabling scale effect in the food distribution industry.

== Food Distribution ==

=== Impact from scale effects ===
[[Scale effects]] resulting from centralized acquisition purchase centres in the food supply chain favor large players such as big retailers or distributors in the food distribution market. This is due to the fact that they can utilize their strong market power and financial advantage over smaller players. Having both strong market power and greater access to the financial credit market meant that they can impose barriers to entry and cement their position in the food distribution market. This would result in a food distribution chain that is characterized by large players on one end and small players choosing niche markets to operate in on the other end. The existence of smaller players in specialized food distribution markets could be attributed to their shrinking market share and their inability to compete with the larger players due to the scale effects. Through this mechanism, globalization has displaced smaller role players.&lt;ref&gt;MANUEL BELO MOREIRA, Changes in Food Chains in the Context of Globalization, Int. Jrnl. of Soc. of Agr. &amp; Food, Vol. 18, No. 2, pp. 134–148&lt;/ref&gt;
Another mechanism troubling the specialized food distribution markets is the ability of distribution chains to possess their own brand. Stores with their own brand are able to combat price wars between competitors by lowering the price of their own brand, thus making consumers more likely to purchase goods from them.&lt;ref&gt;Vizard, Sarah. "Supermarkets' new price war risks damaging relations with food brands and consumers." Marketing Week Online 24 Apr. 2014. General OneFile. Web. 5 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early History and Culture===
Since the beginning of mankind, food was important simply for the purpose of nourishment. As primates walked the Earth, they solely consumed food for a source of energy as they had to hunt and forage because food was not easily on hand. By early humans fending for themselves, they had figured out that they needed a high energy diet to keep going on a daily basis to survive.

These developments eventually lead to agriculture, which also goes into the labor for food and the economic part of the sociology of food. As the years went on, food become more and more of a way to bring cultures and people together. In many cultures, food is what brings people together. This carried for centuries. From the homo-sapiens hunting and gathering, to the colonists to the New World sharing a feast with the Native Americans (that carried on as a tradition named Thanksgiving), to the popularization of restaurants/eating out in the last several decades and the togetherness that comes with eating, shows how the communication and connectivity that comes from it. According to sociologists there are different groups of food that are divided up due to their purpose and meaning. There are cultural super foods, which are the stables for a culture. There are prestige foods, which often reflects economic status, body image food which is mainly consumed for the good of the body. Another would be sympathetic foods that are eaten for their desirable properties, like a superstitious property.  Lastly, there is physiologic group, which are consumed for a specific category (like what a pregnant woman eats for a healthy pregnancy). These different categories help researchers and sociologists study culture in the perspective of food. It often shows how food grows, molds and changes with society. For example, if someone believes in homeopathy, that would fall under the sympathetic foods or physiologic foods. This is because they are consumed for their properties and beliefs of what it could do. Another example of one of these categories of foods would be caviar or oysters for the prestige foods, because they are often more expensive and those who consume it and purchase it do so to show their socioeconomic status, or [[Socioeconomic status|SES]].

=== Sociological Perspectives ===
Through the lens of a symbolic interactionist, there are many symbols that have to do with the sociology of food. Food, in many cultures, brings people together and connects them on multiple different levels. For example, the tradition of eating with the family around the table. It represents togetherness with one and another and communication. Food itself could symbolize something greater than what it is. In America, fast food could represent the busy family that needs a quick dinner to some. To others, however, it could display the “McDonaldization Theory” which centers around the idea of, specifically American, consumption. Another example of how the sociology of food can be symbolized would be making the food from scratch. This definitely goes along with the family. With other theories of sociology, conflict theory also pertains to the sociology of food. As mentioned before, food was first and foremost used for nourishment and means of survival. Due to this, that can fall under conflict theory. The roles of the hunter and gather meant that early humans had to fight and forage to survive. The conflict could also display the survival of the fittest, because there was a conflict for getting food and nourishment, the only the ones who were to best for prevail and provide nourishment for themselves and their families. This evolved to what it is today, with people having jobs to make a living for themselves, which goes into food and nourishment.

=== Psychology and Disorders ===
Eating disorders are also symbolic with the sociology of food. They represent how control (or lack thereof) someone can have over themselves about one of the things they need to live. Eating disorders do not limit themselves to anorexia. These disorders include bulimia and binge eating as well. Some people often use food a comfort, or even a reward. Or in other cases they see food as a negative thing to avoid, even though they need it for survival. The relationships with food that people carry is a very large subject that is very complex. From a sociological standpoint, media has a lot to do with this. Not only does this have to with the sociology of food, but it has to do with how the media represents society as a whole. Both men and women, but majority women, see the representation on the media, leading them to wanting to feel attractive. A lot of the time, this comes down the person’s relationship with food. When someone has a disorder like [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia nervousa]] or [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], they have an intense fear of gaining weight, or just the “fatness” they feel they would get by consuming food. With bulimia, the fear is there, with the overcoming urge to binge. These disorders display the psychological relationships that people could have with food, and view it as a negative thing. They focus on the material look of themselves as opposed to needing food for energy and nourishment. This has a lot to do with overwhelming sexuality in the media. Girls, young women, and even men see how they “should” look according to the media, making them turn to desperate measures with these eating disorders.

=== Dieting ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}The fad of diets have been around for centuries, but the obsession with being thin and slim is only recently became a hot topic, within the last century. Dating back to even before the renaissance, it was considered beautiful to be “plump” and curvy. Society during that time in history believed that if a woman was larger and more plump, then she was being taken care of. It showed her wealth because she could afford to eat, as opposed to a peasant who did not have the luxury to readily available meals. The desired woman was not stick thin. The notable change began in the 1920s era were the “boyish” figure became the most desired for a woman. Later, going into the 1960s, models like Twiggy made headlines about how thin she was, and many women strived to be like her body type. This carried on to the 1980s where dieting (like the South Beach Diet and Weight Watchers) grew in popularity, along with the popularization of working out and work out videos. This was the start of mainstream dieting fads. Among these, others like the [[Atkins diet]], Jenny Craig, and [[Paleolithic diet|paleo]] began to take popularity. As of early-mid-2010s, other diets became mainstream. This included vegetarianism, dairy-free, [[veganism]], raw diets, and gluten-free. There are many reasons why someone would choose a certain type of diet: moral reasons, digestive issues, outside influence, or religious influence.

=== Obesity===
The obesity epidemic that has spread across America also is a great example on how food shapes society and they way people live, along with the evolution of  the type of food Americans consume. Due to the busy manic lives that many Americans have, fast food and prepackaged foods with higher calories have gained popularity and have become mainstream in American consumption. The environment in which people with certain socioeconomic backgrounds live also heavily affect the type of food they consume. High calorie and low nutritional food tend to be less expensive and are easier to access. Thus, when shopping for food many lean towards the cheaper options. Lack of physical fitness is also a crucial aspect that is adding to the obesity epidemic. Studies have found that there is a direct correlation between walkability in neighborhoods and exercise. Also, if one's neighborhood does not have ready access to recreation activities they are at risk of becoming over weight and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SALLIS|first=JAMES F.|last2=GLANZ|first2=KAREN|date=2009-03|title=Physical Activity and Food Environments: Solutions to the Obesity Epidemic|journal=Milbank Quarterly|language=en|volume=87|issue=1|pages=123–154|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00550.x|issn=0887-378X|pmc=2879180|pmid=19298418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going along with the subject of eating disorders, obesity could have to do with the feeling of lack of control that comes with over eating. There has been progress on combating America's obesity problem, with programs being put in place to help promote healthy eating and fitness. More and more restaurants are putting the amount of calories that are in the meals.  Also, many food companies such as Coca-Cola are promoting making healthy choices with their drinks and products, also putting the calories on them and making the nutrition facts readily available.

* "Social Catholicism" or the application of the [[Catholic social teaching]] as outlined in the papal social [[encyclical]]s and promoted by Heinrich Pesch (1854-1926) in his Teaching Guide to Economics.&lt;ref&gt; Pesch, Heinrich, ''Teaching Guide to Economics'' (10 volumes), translated by Rupert Ederler, Edwin Mellen Press (2003); and, Storck, Thomas, "A Giant Among Catholic Economists", ''New Oxford Review'' (February 2005) &lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Sweden|Swedish]] system of labor arrangement in which labor unions and capitalists jointly set wages below market clearing levels. From this arrangement, labor receives [[full employment]] and wage leveling, while capitalists pay less for labor, and do not have to worry about their employees being "poached" by firms who can offer more. This arrangement is traditionally enforced through employer organizations. The arrangement is destabilized during economic booms, when firms cheat on the system and surreptitiously raise "compensation", rather than pay, in the form of increased benefits, safety, or other forms of indirect payment.
* Among the [[History of far-right movements in France|French far-right]], solidarism refers to a tendency which was headed by [[Jean-Pierre Stirbois]] and [[Michel Collinot]] ([[French Solidarist Movement]]). Solidarists support a non-capitalist, non-communist "[[Third Position|third way]]", and are generally opponents of the influence of both the Soviet Union and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Jonathan (1995). The National Front and French Politics. New York: New York University Press. pp.36&lt;/ref&gt; It was recently an influence of the [[Radical Network]]. [[National Front (France)|National Front]] member [[Roger Holeindre]] claims to follow this tendency.
*An element within the [[White movement]] in Russia opposed to Communism and seeking a Christian alternative to collectivism was called the [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists]].

The '''Systemic Risk Centre''' ('''SRC''') is a research centre in [[London]],  hosted at the [[London School of Economics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/website-archive/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2013/01/SystemicRiskCentreLaunch.aspx Research centre to study risks to financial system launched at LSE ]&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated to the study of [[systemic risk]]  and the development of policies for addressing the effects of financial crises.

The SRC is funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) and was founded in 2012. Its funding was renewed for another five years in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrc.ac.uk/research/our-research/systemic-risk-centre/ Systemic Risk Centre at the ESRC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The SRC  finds that the underlying driver of financial crisis is [[endogenous risk]], described in the SRC Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/11751601/Regulators-could-be-responsible-for-next-financial-crash.html Regulators could be responsible for next financial crash]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://voxeu.org/article/systemic-risk-research-and-policy-agenda A proposed research and policy agenda for systemic risk]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization  ==

The SRC  has two directors,  [[Jon Danielsson]] and  Jean-Pierre Zigrand,   staff of eight researchers and faculty from the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) and the [[University College London]] (UCL).

==  Research  ==

The Centre's main research activities are divided into four different areas:
# Endogenous Risk 
# Amplification Mechanisms 
# Policy Responses 
# Identifying Risk 

SRC Research is disseminated through events, workshops, seminars and published materials – in particular, through a discussion paper series,  an events  programme and System Risk's youtube channel. The SRC organized a joint event with the [[International Monetary Fund]] on Macroprudential Stress Test and Policies: A Framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/en/News/Events/2016-IMF-LSE-symposium-macroprudential-stress-test-and-policies Macroprudential Stress Test and Policies: A Framework]&lt;/ref&gt; SRC director Jean-Pierre Zigrand was  appointed in April 2017 as the UK head of global financial research project to analyse high frequency financial data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://diggingintodata.org/awards/2016/project/digging-high-frequency-data-present-and-future-risks-and-opportunities-atlantis Digging into High Frequency Data: Present and Future Risks and Opportunities (Atlantis)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Total Carbon Column Observing Network''' (TCCON) is a global network of instruments that measure the amount of [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrous oxide]] and other [[trace gas]]es in the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. The TCCON ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|iː|k|ɒ|n}} {{respell|TEE|kon}}) began in 2004 with the installation of the first instrument in [[Park Falls, Wisconsin]], USA, and has since grown to 23 operational instruments worldwide, with 7 former sites.&lt;ref name="TCCON_GGG2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wunch|first1=D.|last2=Toon|first2=G.

This is achieved by measuring the atmospheric mass of carbon (the [[airborne fraction]]). The TCCON measurements have improved the scientific community's understanding of the [[carbon cycle]],&lt;ref name="NH Flux"&gt;Yang, Z., R. A. Washenfelder, G. Keppel-Aleks, N. Y. Krakauer, J. T.

(2009), The Need for Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Measurements from Space : Contributions from a Rapid Reflight of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/363474main_OCO_Reflight.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The TCCON provides the primary measurement validation dataset for the [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2|Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2)]] mission,&lt;ref name="OCO webpage"&gt;http://oco.jpl.nasa.gov/science/validation/&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used to validate other [[Space-based Measurements of Carbon Dioxide|space-based measurements of carbon dioxide]].

==History==
Part of the reason the TCCON was established was because of modeling errors between mixing efficiency between the [[planetary boundary layer|PBL]] and the free [[troposphere]].&lt;ref name="NH Flux"/&gt; Because TCCON measurements are of the entire column of atmosphere above a site (PBL and free troposphere are simultaneously measured) the measurements are an improvement over the traditional [[in situ]] near surface measurements in this regard. TCCON has improved the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mass gradient measurements between the northern and southern hemispheres.

The first annual TCCON meeting was in [[San Francisco, California]] in 2005. Every year a meeting is held in a location that rotates between North America, the Western Pacific, and Europe hosted by a participating institution. In 2015 the meeting was held at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="TCCON_sites"&gt;TCCON Webpage, https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Sites, accessed February 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement technique==
The main instrument at each TCCON site is a [[Bruker]] IFS 125HR (HR for high resolution, ~0.02&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) or occasionally 120HR [[Fourier transform spectrometer]]. Sunlight is directed into the spectrometer by solar tracking mirrors and other optics. The spectrometers measure the absorption of direct sunlight by atmospheric [[trace gases]] primarily in the near [[infrared]] region. This [[remote sensing]] technique produces a precise and accurate measurement of the [[total column]] abundance of the [[trace gas]]. The main limitation to this technique is that measurements can not be recorded when it is not sunny (i.e. there are no measurements available at nighttime or when there is heavy cloud cover).&lt;ref name="TCCON_paper"&gt;Wunch, D., G. C. Toon, J.-F. L. Blavier, R. A. Washenfelder, J. Notholt, B. J. Connor, D. W. T. Griffith, V. Sherlock, and P. O. Wennberg (2011), The total carbon column observing network, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society - Series A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 369(1943), 2087-2112, {{doi|10.1098/rsta.2010.0240}}.

==Participating sites and Institutions==
Current TCCON sites are located in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Korea]], [[Réunion]], and [[Ascension Island]].&lt;ref name="TCCON_GGG2014"/&gt; A former site was in [[Brazil]]. Sites can change when an instrument needs to be moved to a new location.

TCCON members collaborate from a variety of different institutions. In North America some of these include [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]], and the [[University of Toronto]].  In Europe some of these include [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], [[Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry]], [[University of Bremen]], [[Agencia Estatal de Meteorología]], [[Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy]], [[Finnish Meteorological Institute]], and [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]]. In the western Pacific some of these include [[University of Wollongong]], [[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research]], [[National Institute for Environmental Studies]], [[JAXA]], and National Institute of Meteorological Research of the Republic of Korea.

New sites are admitted into the network when site investigators demonstrate required hardware, and data processing ability. Uniformity is maintained across the network by using the same FTS model and the same retrieval software. GGG is the software of the TCCON.&lt;ref name="TCCON_GGG2014"/&gt; It includes the I2S (interferogram to spectrum) [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]], and GFIT spectral fitting subroutines. GFIT is also the fitting algorithm that was used for ATMOS which flew on the [[Space Shuttle]],&lt;ref&gt;JPL NASA ATMOS webpage, http://remus.jpl.nasa.gov/atmos/onshuttle.html, accessed February 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and is used for spectral fitting of spectra obtained by a [[High-altitude balloon|balloon borne]] spectrometer.&lt;ref&gt;NASA JPL MkIV interferometer webpage https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/instrument/MkIV, accessed February 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highlights of Data Use==
Data from each site is processed by the investigators that head that particular site. Atmospheric abundances of gases are uploaded and saved in uniform formats and data are hosted at [[Caltech]] with the Caltech Library and are available from http://tccondata.org. Data are made publicly available provided the data license is followed.&lt;ref&gt;TCCON data use policy webpage https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Network_Policy/Data_Use_Policy, accessed February 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation ==

=== Formulas ===
The TCRE is calculated based on a formula for the ratio of temperature change to cumulative carbon emissions (measured as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is the net carbon remaining in the atmosphere after accounting for relevant sources and sinks.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;  As a measure of atmospheric carbon change, the TCRE parameterizes [[climate sensitivity]] and carbon sensitivity to formulate a value that is the temperature change (°C) per trillion tonnes of carbon emitted (Tt C).&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen et al, 2009" /&gt; This is represented via the following formula from Matthews et al., 2009:

&lt;math&gt;TCRE = \bigtriangleup T/E_T = (\bigtriangleup T/\bigtriangleup C_A)\times(\bigtriangleup C_A/E_T)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;

where,
* ΔT = average global temperature change (°C)
* E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = cumulative carbon dioxide emissions (Tt C)
* ΔC&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = change in atmospheric carbon (Tt C)
and, 1Tt C = 3.7 Tt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

TCRE can also be defined not in terms of temperature response to emitted carbon, but in terms of temperature response to the change in [[radiative forcing]] as in Myhre et al., 2015:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myhre|first=Gunnar|last2=Boucher|first2=Olivier|last3=Bréon|first3=François-Marie|last4=Forster|first4=Piers|last5=Shindell|first5=Drew|date=March 2015|title=Declining uncertainty in transient climate response as CO2 forcing dominates future climate change|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2371|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=8|issue=3|pages=181–185|doi=10.1038/ngeo2371|issn=1752-0908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;TCRE = \bigtriangleup T/ RF&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

where, 
* RF = radiative forcing (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) taken at the top of the atmosphere (TOA)
Here TCRE is used to assess the assumed linear effect radiative forcing has on temperature change in an historical analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modeling ===
TCRE is modeled using [[climate model]]s that simulate carbon emissions by increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 1% per year from pre-industrial levels until the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere is doubled (2 x CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or quadrupled (4 x CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Richard G.|last2=Goodwin|first2=Philip|last3=Roussenov|first3=Vassil M.|last4=Bopp|first4=Laurent|date=2016|title=A framework to understand the transient climate response to emissions|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/11/i=1/a=015003|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=11|issue=1|pages=015003|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/1/015003|issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since these experiments all start from the same initial atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (around 285 ppm&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;), the doubling and quadrupling occur at 70 and 140 years respectively. Different modelling parameterizations of TCRE include: holding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions constant after quadrupling;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; modelling net negative emissions after doubling or quadrupling;&lt;ref name="Zickfeld et al, 2016" /&gt; stopping emissions after doubling and continuing the model for up to 10,000 years;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frölicher|first=Thomas L.|last2=Paynter|first2=David J.|date=2015|title=Extending the relationship between global warming and cumulative carbon emissions to multi-millennial timescales|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/10/i=7/a=075002|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=10|issue=7|pages=075002|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/10/7/075002|issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt; or running extended [[Representative Concentration Pathways|RCP]] scenarios and assessing temperature change per cumulative emissions at high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations.&lt;ref name="Tokarska et al, 2016" /&gt;

== Temperature Response ==

=== Global response ===
Global temperature change is approximately linearly proportional to cumulative carbon emissions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2018" /&gt; This means that for a given amount of carbon emissions, a related amount of [[global warming]] can reasonably be expected.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frame|first=David J.|last2=Macey|first2=Adrian H.|last3=Allen|first3=Myles R.|date=2014-09-21|title=Cumulative emissions and climate policy|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ngeo2254|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=7|issue=10|pages=692–693|doi=10.1038/ngeo2254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model data synthesized by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] from available studies suggests a ''likely'' TCRE of 0.8° to 2.5&amp;nbsp;°C per Tt C (or 1000 Pg C).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a TCRE focus review, Matthews et al. (2018) estimate TCRE as 0.8° to 2.4&amp;nbsp;°C per Tt C and suggest an observationally-constrained best estimate of 1.35&amp;nbsp;°C per Tt C.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2018" /&gt;

=== Regional response ===
Though the global average temperature response to cumulative emissions is approximately linear, this response is not uniform throughout the globe.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leduc et al, 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Partanen|first=Antti-Ilari|last2=Leduc|first2=Martin|last3=Matthews|first3=H. Damon|date=2017|title=Seasonal climate change patterns due to cumulative CO 2 emissions|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/12/i=7/a=075002|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=12|issue=7|pages=075002|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/aa6eb0|issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculations by Leduc et al., (2016) of the geographical pattern of temperature response (the regional TCRE, or RTCRE) show values of low temperature change over equatorial and tropical ocean regions and high values of temperature change exceeding 4&amp;nbsp;°C/Tt C in the Arctic.&lt;ref name="Leduc et al, 2016" /&gt; Likewise, they show a pronounced temperature response difference between the land and ocean, which is largely the result of ocean heat cycling.&lt;ref name="Leduc et al, 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryan|first=K.|last2=Komro|first2=F.G.|last3=Manabe|first3=S.|last4=Spelman|first4=M.J.|date=January 1, 1982|title=Transient climate response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide|url=|journal=Science|volume=215|pages=56–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional precipitation response ====
Unlike the positive regional temperature response, regional precipitation change to cumulative emissions are positive or negative, depending on location.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Partanen et al., (2017) show a strong positive precipitation response in the Arctic with negative responses (meaning reduced precipitation) in parts of Southern Africa, Australia, North and South America.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Carbon Budget ==
{{main|Emissions budget}}

The observed and calculated linear TCRE and RTCRE leads to the notion of a carbon budget.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millar|first=Richard|last2=Allen|first2=Myles|last3=Rogelj|first3=Joeri|last4=Friedlingstein|first4=Pierre|date=2016-01-01|title=The cumulative carbon budget and its implications|url=https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article/32/2/323/2433178|journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy|volume=32|issue=2|pages=323–342|doi=10.1093/oxrep/grw009|issn=0266-903X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carbon budget is the cumulative amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, emitted anthropologically as a globe, that leads to a set limit of global warming.&lt;ref name="Matthews et al, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The IPCC estimates the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-only carbon budget (with a 50% chance) for staying below 2&amp;nbsp;°C at 1210 PgC (or 1.21 Tt C).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Accounting for the 515 PgC of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted between 1870 and 2011, this leaves a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-only carbon budget of 695 PgC, for a 50% chance of staying below a global average temperature change of 2&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5539">The title '''''Trecheng Breth Féne''''' "A Triad of Judgments of the Irish", more widely known as "'''The Triads of Ireland'''", refers to a miscellaneous collection of about 214 [[Old Irish]] triads (and some numerical variants) on a variety of topics, such as nature, geography, [[Early Irish Law|law]], custom and behaviour. Its compilation is usually dated to the ninth century.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=2}}

==Form==
The following example is Triad 91:

{|
| style="padding: 1pt 10pt;" |
:''Trí gena ata messu brón:''
:''gen snechta oc legad,''
:''gen do mná frit íar mbith fhir aili lé,''
:''gen chon fhoilmnich.''
| style="padding: 1pt 10pt;" |
:Three smiles that are worse than sorrow:
:the smile of the snow as it melts,
:the smile of your wife on you after another man has been with her,
:the grin of a hound ready to leap at you.{{sfn|Meyer|1906|loc = pp. 12-3, with changed lineation}}
|}

The use of the triad form (arrangement into threes) to encapsulate certain ideas is neither distinctively Irish nor Celtic, but can be widely attested in many societies over the world, in part owing to its usefulness as a [[mnemonic device]]. It does appear to be particularly popular in the literatures of Celtic-speaking areas, one notable other example being the later Welsh collection ''[[Welsh Triads|Trioedd Ynys Prydein]]'' ("Triads of the Isle of Britain"). Beyond the particular form, however, there is nothing to suggest a shared literary tradition. Although triads can be pointed out in both Irish and (again later) Welsh law texts, they are the rule in neither as other numerical forms are usually preferred. [[Kuno Meyer]] proposed that the practice was inspired from the Old Testament, which however, offers very few examples. [[Fergus Kelly]] concludes that "[t]he case for a special Celtic cult of threeness is unproven, as is the attempt by Meyer and other scholars to establish a biblical origin."{{sfn|Kelly|2004|pp=1-3}}

==Manuscript sources==

The only edition is still that of Kuno Meyer published in 1906. He based his text on six manuscripts (YBL, BB, Uí Maine, Great Book of Lecan, 23 N 10 and H 1.15) and was aware of another three (23 N 27, Rylands copy and Kilbride).{{sfn|Meyer|1906|loc = introduction}} Fergus Kelly reports that four other versions have since been discovered and that the text is therefore in need of a new critical edition.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|loc= p.1 &amp; p.1 note 2}}

==Date==
On the basis of the language used in the triads Meyer considered that had not been written after 900 AD; and on the basis of certain [[declension]]s used in the text thought that they were not older than c.850 AD.{{sfn|Meyer|1906|p=x}}

An '''urban planner''' is a professional who practices in the field of [[urban planning]]. 

An urban planner may focus on a specific area of practice and have a title such as city planner, town planner, regional planner, long-range planner, transportation planner, infrastructure planner, environmental planner, parks planner, physical planner, health planner, planning analyst, urban designer, community development director, economic development specialist or other similar combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning Specializations|url=https://www.planning.org/choosingplanning/specializations/|website=Choosing the Planning Profession|publisher=American Planning Association|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Job Titles - Urban and land use planners (NOC 2153-A)|url=https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/job_titles-eng.do;jsessionid=755C0BE610A7CF0F664ADE37A76DE867.imnav4?area=9219&amp;lang=eng&amp;noc=2153&amp;backurl=%2Freport-eng.do%3Farea%3D9219%26lang%3Deng%26noc%3D2153|website=National Occupational Classification 2011 -ESDC|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An international association of planning professionals - ISOCARP - was established in 1965 in the Netherlands and currently has about 700 members in more than 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home - ISOCARP|url = http://isocarp.org/|website = ISOCARP|access-date = 2018-10-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home - Wikipedia/ISOCARP|url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISOCARP|website = Wikipedia|access-date = 2018-10-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities==
{{see also|Planning permission}}
The responsibilities of an urban planner vary between [[jurisdictions]], and sometimes within jurisdictions. The following is therefore a general description of the responsibilities of an urban planner, of which an urban planner may well typically practice two or more of. An urban planner may also specialize in one responsibility only.
 
===Land use planning===

Urban planners specializing in [[land use planning]] are predominantly concerned with the regulation of [[land use]], [[Land development|development]] and [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]], with the intent of achieving the desired urban planning outcome.

Regulation of land use and development is achieved via the drafting and adoption of planning instruments designed to influence the land use and built form goals of the jurisdiction. The planning instruments take the form of legislation and policy, and have a wide variety of terms across jurisdictions including [[Primary and secondary legislation|acts and regulations]], rules, [[Code of law|codes]], schemes, plans, policies, and manuals; and often a combination of some of these. The planning instruments often spatially zone land or reserve the land for certain purposes, presented in the form of a [[Zoning|zoning map or plan]]. The urban planner is tasked with preparing planning instruments and zoning plans. Further, given urban development is rarely static and the goals of urban planning change from time to time, the urban planner will be responsible for continuously maintaining planning instruments and zoning plans to ensure they are kept up-to-date.

Consultation with the community and other stakeholders is generally desired by urban planners in most jurisdictions when planning instruments are prepared and updated. The level of consultation will vary depending on the project.

The urban planner will also be responsible for implementing the planning instruments. This is achieved through a permit process, where the proponent of a proposed development, a change in land use, or the proposed subdivision of an allotment will be required to obtain a permit, approval, licence, or consent for the proposed development or change of use. An urban planner will be tasked with considering the proposal and determining whether it complies with the intent and the specific provisions of the applicable planning instruments and zoning plans. Depending on the jurisdiction, the urban planner may have authority to determine the proposal; otherwise the planner will present a recommendation to the decision-maker, often a panel of non-planners (for example, the elected council of a local government).

While concerned with future development, an urban planner will occasionally be responsible for investigating development or land use which had been undertaken without authorization. In many jurisdictions urban planners can require that unauthorized land use cease and unauthorized development is returned to its predevelopment condition; or alternatively retrospectively approve the unauthorized development or land use.

===Strategic urban planning===

In order to plan effectively for long term development and growth, an urban planner will be responsible for the preparation of a strategic plan (also known in different jurisdictions by names such as [[development plan]], [[Core strategy document|core strategy]], [[Comprehensive planning|comprehensive plan]], planning strategy, [[structure plan]], etc.). Strategic urban planning sets the high-level goals and growth principles for a jurisdiction, which will in turn inform the preparation and amendment of the legal planning instruments within that jurisdiction.

===Regional planning===
{{main|Regional planning}}
Regional planning deals with the planning of land use, infrastructure and settlement growth over a geographical area which extends to a whole city or beyond. In this sense, the urban planner's role is to consider urban planning at a macro scale. Regional planning is not concerned with planning at the local (neighborhood) level.

===Heritage and conservation===

An urban planner may be responsible for identifying, protecting and [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conserving / restoring]] buildings and places which are identified by a community as having [[cultural heritage]] significance. This may include the task of compiling and maintaining a [[heritage register]], finding and making available incentives for encouraging conservation works, and the consideration of proposals to redevelop or use a heritage-listed place.

===Urban renewal===

As urban areas decline, an urban planner may be tasked with preparing a plan for the redevelopment of an urban area. Such plans are not limited to an individual development site, but rather encompass a locality or district over which an urban renewal (or redevelopment) plan is prepared.

Urban renewal often relies on obtaining funding from government sources to assist in the regeneration of an area; the funding may be used for a variety of purposes such as improvement of public roads, parks and other public spaces, development of infrastructure, and acquisition of land. The urban planner will be responsible for costing an urban renewal plan and obtaining funding for infrastructure works necessary to implement the urban renewal plan.

The urban planner for an urban renewal project will need to liaise closely with stakeholders during the preparation and implementation of the plan, including government agencies, landowners and community groups.

===Master planning===

A master plan will be prepared for many [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] development projects. The purpose of a master plan is to plan for the ultimate spatial layout of the land uses for a future development area. A master plan will consider the required infrastructure to service the development and determine the need and location of urban amenities including commercial and industrial land, community facilities, schools, parks, public transport, major roads, and land uses, both within and outside the master plan area, and consider the staging of development of a master planned area.

The urban planner will be responsible for coordinating the various professional consultant inputs, and to lay out the master plan infrastructure and land uses. It will often be necessary for the urban planner to consult with landowners and government agencies affected by the master plan.

===Transportation planning===

An urban planner may be responsible for planning for [[transport]] facilities and infrastructure in urban and inter-regional areas.

===Economic development===

An urban planner's responsibility may extend to economic development. In this sense, an urban planner may be responsible for identifying opportunities for [[economic growth]], and encourage [[investment]] in an area.

===Environmental planning===

An urban planner may be concerned with the impact of land use, development and subdivision on the [[Natural resource|natural environment]] including land, water, flora, and fauna, to achieve [[sustainable]] outcomes.

===Urban design===

An urban planner will develop the design of public spaces (streets, squares, parks, etc.) and the relationship between built form and public spaces. Depending on the country and planner's training they may work with other design professionals such as civil engineers, architects or landscape architects to complete and construct the design.

===Infrastructure planning===

An urban planner may be required to plan for the future provision of [[public works]] [[infrastructure]] such as [[water supply]], [[sewerage]], [[electricity]], [[telecommunications]], and [[transport]] infrastructure, and community infrastructure including [[schools]], [[hospitals]] and [[parks]].

==Education and training==

''See [[Urban planning education]] for a discussion of this topic.''

Urban Planning as a profession is a relatively young discipline. Few government agencies restrict or license the profession. As a result, a number of other related disciplines actively claim to have the training, expertise and professional scope to practice urban planning. While organizations such as the [[American Planning Association]], the [[Canadian Institute of Planners]] and the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] certify professional planners, others in related fields like [[Landscape Architecture]] also claim to have professional autonomy in urban planning. Efforts internationally have attempted to define the role of urban planners through licensure acts. The State of [[New Jersey]] licenses Professional Planners. The Canadian Provinces of Ontario and Alberta protect the title of [[Registered Professional Planner]] to only those who have an accredited CIP education and experience or equivalent.

==Urban planners by nation==

===Canada===

Urban planners in Canada usually hold bachelor's degrees in planning or a master's degree, typically accredited as an M.Pl, MUP (Master of Urban Planning) MCP (Master of City Planning), MScPl, MES (Master of Environmental Studies) or simply an MA.

===Greece===

Urban planners in [[Greece]] typically graduate from  [[Engineering]] faculties. [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] and [[University of Thessaly]] are the two universities that provide undergraduate studies in [[urban planning]] in [[Greece]].

===India===

Though planning is not a recognized profession under Indian law, the profession began in 1941 with the [[School of Planning and Architecture]] as a Department of Architecture of Delhi College of Engineering now the [[Delhi Technological University]]. It was later integrated with the School of Town and Country Planning which was established in 1955 by the [[Government of India]] to provide facilities for rural, urban and regional planning. On integration, the school was renamed as School of Planning and Architecture in 1959. Today, it is one of the premier schools of pursuing planning studies at bachelor, masters and post doctorate levels.

The [http://itpi.org.in/content/default.aspx Institute of Town Planners, India] (ITPI), set up on the lines of the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] in [[London]] is the body representing planning professionals in India. A small group formed itself into an Indian Board of Town Planners which after three years of continuous work formed the ITPI. The institute, which was established in July 1951, today, has a membership of over 2800, apart from a sizable number of student members, many of whom have qualified Associateship Examination (AITP) conducted by ITPI. As of 2012, the institute has 21 regional chapters across India.
School of Planning and Architecture(SPA),Delhi is one of the premier institute in dissemination knowledge of Architecture and Planning in India. It was established in 1941.In 1979, the Government of India, through the then Ministry of Education and Culture, conferred on the School of Planning and Architecture the status of "Deemed to be a University"(http://spa.ac.in/Home.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f)
[[School of Planning and Architecture-Bhopal]] (M.P.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spabhopal.ac.in/&lt;/ref&gt; and School of Planning and Architecture-Vijayawada established in year 2008 by Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.
Centre for Environment Planning and Technology (CEPT) University [http://cept.ac.in] in Ahmedabad and Malaviya National Institute of Technology (NIT) Jaipur, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (N.I.T) in Bhopal along with NIT Patna are one of the pioneering Institutes in India where urban planning is taught.

===Israel===

The [[Israel Planners Association]] was founded in 1965. Urban planning is taught by the [[Technion]] [http://architecture.technion.ac.il/en/ Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning] in [[Haifa]] and the [http://curs.net.technion.ac.il/ Center for Urban and Regional Studies].

===Mexico===

Urban planners in Mexico typically graduate from an Architecture background provided by major universities in the country. Most of such degrees can be awarded at Masters' graduate studies, although there are also bachelor's degrees available.

===New Zealand===

A planner brings professional expertise and knowledge to the development and implementation of policy in the interests of productive, liveable and sustainable environments. Planners support communities and provide leadership in making informed choices about the consequences of human actions and in bridging the gap between the present and the future. Planners must consider and balance a range of strategic, policy, technical, legal, administrative, community and environmental factors in their contributions to informed decision-making.

Planners are employed in diverse public and private roles. They use their knowledge and experience in various institutional and community settings to provide leadership, undertake research, solve problems, evaluate alternatives and outcomes, manage change, and envision, advise on and enact desirable future directions.

In applying their expertise, planners must be aware of and responsive to cultural, social, economic, environmental, ethical and political values. In New Zealand, these include the bicultural mandate for planning, including the partnership relationships established by the Treaty of Waitangi/te Tiriti o Waitangi, and New Zealand’s increasingly multicultural society.

A key attribute of a planner is the ability to work across disciplinary and institutional boundaries and to integrate knowledge from a range of disciplines within the distinctive framework of the discipline of planning.

A professional planner is someone who has gained a professional qualification through tertiary study, continues to learn post qualification, undertakes continuing professional development, is a member or is working towards becoming a member of the [http://www.planning.org.nz/ New Zealand Planning Institute (NZPI)], contributes to the planning profession, and is committed to upholding the principles and ethical practices of the planning profession.

For a list of NZPI recognized degrees, [http://www.planning.org.nz/Category?Action=View&amp;Category_id=647 click here]. 

===Nigeria===

In [[Nigeria]], the [[Nigerian Institute of Town Planners]] (NITP) and the [[Town Planners Registration Council]] (TOPREC) are the leading bodies tasked with the responsibility of improving the training, education and professional practice of planning in Nigeria.

To be a town planner in Nigeria, first must complete a degree in Urban and regional planning or a relevant discipline and then complete a final year in the form of a masters in Urban and regional planning  which must be accredited by the [[Town Planners Registration Council]] (TOPREC ), or a four-year degree encapsulating all aspects. they can then become eligible to be a member of the [[Nigerian Institute of Town Planners]] (NITP), but must first complete two years work based training, to be a full member, and subsequently register and sit for the TOPREC professional examination, to become a registered town planner.

===South Africa===

The [[South African Council for Planners]] ([http://www.sacplan.org.za SACPLAN]) is the statutory Council of nominated members appointed in terms of the Planning Profession Act, 2002 (Act 36 of 2002) by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform (Department of Rural Development and Land Reform) to regulate the Planning Profession(Planning is both the organizational process of creating and maintaining a plan) in terms of the Act. The Planning Profession Principles applies to all registered planners. The SACPLAN through the Act assures quality in the planning profession through the identification of planning profession work that only registered planners can undertake. The functions of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 7 of the Act. The powers and duties of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 8 of the Act. The Act further prescribes a Professional Code of Conduct for registered planners &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacplan.org.za|title=SACPLAN - SACPLAN|author=Administrator|work=sacplan.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

Those wishing to be a town or country planner, in the [[United Kingdom]], first must complete a degree in a relevant discipline and then complete a final year in the form of a masters in town and country planning   which must be accredited by the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] (RTPI), or a four-year degree encapsulating all aspects. they can then become eligible to be a member of the RTPI, but must first complete two years work based training, to be a full member.

Town planners in the UK are responsible for all aspects of the built environment, wherever you are within the UK a town and country planner will have at sometime planned the built aspects of the environment. They (Local Planning Authorities) grant planning permission (consent) to individuals, private builders and corporations and also aid local government with their decisions.

===United States===
Planners in the U.S. typically complete an undergraduate or graduate degree from a university offering the program of study.  Professional certification is only offered through the [[American Institute of Certified Planners]] (AICP), a branch of the [[American Planning Association]].  To gain AICP certification, a planner must meet specific educational and experience requirements, as well as pass an exam covering the nature and practice of the discipline.  Although AICP certification is not required to be a practicing planner, it does serve as a means in which a planner can verify his or her professional expertise.

===Palestine===
Planners in Palestine took responsibility after the Palestinian Authority took governance in the West Bank and Gaza- Palestine. Planners have been trained by a Norwegian consultants As Plan Viak at the very beginning as part of the institutional capacity training project funded by the Norwegian Government. Both Birzeit and Alanjah Universities run bachelor and master degree in planning and planners could specialized in different fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1397">In [[architecture]], '''visibility graph analysis''' ('''VGA''') is a method of analysing the inter-visibility connections within buildings or urban networks.  Visibility graph analysis was developed from the architectural theory of [[space syntax]] by Turner et al. (2001), and is applied through construction of a [[visibility graph]] within the open space of a plan.

Visibility graph analysis uses various measures from the theory of [[small-world network]]s and [[centrality]] in [[network theory]] in order to assess perceptual qualities of space and the possible usage of it.

Visibility graph analysis was firstly implemented in Turner's Depthmap software and is now widely used by both academics and practitioners through the [[open source]] and [[multi-platform]] [https://github.com/varoudis/depthmapX depthmapX] developed by Tasos Varoudis.

The '''Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials''' is the department of [[nanoscience]] and [[materials science]] of the [[University of Groningen]] in the [[Netherlands]].

The institute is named after the Dutch [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Frits Zernike]], famous for his development of [[phase contrast microscopy]]. The research of the Zernike Institute is focused on curiosity-driven studies of [[functional materials]]. The research involve researchers from the fields of physics, chemistry and biology. The aim is to understand how functional materials work at the atomic and molecular level. The Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials is involved in the whole string of research starting from design, through synthesis, device building, characterisation, investigation of the theoretical foundation and feedback to the design process.

The institute is responsible for the education of numerous master and PhD students among others through the top master nanoscience programme.
