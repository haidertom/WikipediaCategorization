      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6470">The '''AMD Platform Security Processor''' ('''PSP'''), officially known as '''AMD Secure Technology''', is a [[trusted execution environment]] subsystem incorporated since about 2013 into [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] microprocessors.&lt;ref name="Williams_2017"/&gt; According to an AMD developer's guide, the subsystem is "responsible for creating, monitoring and maintaining the security environment" and "its functions include managing the boot process, initializing various security related mechanisms, and monitoring the system for any suspicious activity or events and implementing an appropriate response."&lt;ref name="AMD_2016"/&gt; Critics worry it can be used as a backdoor and is a security concern.&lt;ref name="Martin_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Claburn_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larabel_2017"/&gt; AMD has denied requests to open source the code that runs on the PSP.&lt;ref name="Williams_2017"/&gt;

The PSP is similar to the [[Intel Management Engine]] for Intel processors.&lt;ref name="Williams_2017"/&gt;

==Details==
The PSP itself is an [[ARM core]] inserted on the main CPU die.&lt;ref name="Libreboot"/&gt;

==Security history==
In September 2017, Google security researcher Cfir Cohen reported a vulnerability to AMD of a PSP subsystem that could allow an attacker access to passwords, certificates, and other sensitive information; a patch was rumored to become available to vendors in December 2017.&lt;ref name="Millman_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cimpanu_2018"/&gt;

In March 2018, a handful of alleged serious flaws were announced in AMD's [[Zen (microarchitecture)|Zen]] architecture CPUs ([[EPYC]], [[Ryzen]], Ryzen Pro, and Ryzen Mobile) by an Israeli [[IT security]] company related to the PSP that could allow malware to run and gain access to sensitive information.&lt;ref name="Goodin_2018"/&gt; AMD has announced firmware updates to handle these flaws.&lt;ref name="Bright_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Papermaster_2018"/&gt; While there were claims that the flaws were published for the purpose of [[Market manipulation|stock manipulation]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gamersnexus.net/industry/3260-assassination-attempt-on-amd-by-viceroy-research-cts-labs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4157242-amd-cts-labs-story-failed-stock-manipulation?page=2&lt;/ref&gt; their validity from a technical standpoint was upheld by independent security experts who reviewed the disclosures.&lt;ref name="trailofbits"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2327">The '''amplitude modulation signalling system''' ('''AMSS''' or the '''AM signalling system''') is a [[Digital data|digital]] system for adding low [[bit rate]] information to an [[analog signal|analogue]] [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] [[broadcasting|broadcast]] signal in the same manner as the [[Radio Data System]] (RDS) for [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] (FM) broadcast signals.

This system has been standardized in March 2006 by [[ETSI]] (TS 102 386) as an extension to the [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) system.

== Broadcasting ==
{{Outdated as of|year=2016|month=October|day=16|June 2011}}
AMSS data are broadcast from the following transmitters:

* [[longwave|LW]]
** RTL France: 234&amp;nbsp;kHz
* [[shortwave|SW]]
** [[BBC World Service]]: 15.575&amp;nbsp;MHz

Formerly it was also used by:

* [[medium wave|MW]]
** [[:de:Truckradio|Truckradio]] 531&amp;nbsp;kHz
** [[BBC World Service]]: 648&amp;nbsp;kHz
** [[Deutschlandradio Kultur]]: 990&amp;nbsp;kHz

[[File:Barometer Goethe 04.jpg|thumb|right|A ''storm glass'' or ''Goethe's device'', an early practical type of barometer. Calandra's essay does not name the ''type'' of the device, although the answers provided by the student suggest the use of a portable [[Barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid barometer]].]]

The '''barometer question''' is an example of an incorrectly designed examination question demonstrating [[functional fixedness]] that causes a moral [[dilemma]] for the examiner. In its classic form, popularized by American [[Test (assessment)#Test preparations|test designer]] professor [[Alexander Calandra]] (1911–2006), the question asked the student to "show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a [[barometer]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1968dec21-00060?View=PDF&lt;/ref&gt; The examiner was confident that there was one, and only one, correct answer, which is by calculating the difference in pressure at the top and bottom of the building. Contrary to the examiner's expectations, the student responded with a series of completely different answers. These answers were also correct, yet none of them proved the student's competence in the specific academic field being tested.

The barometer question achieved the status of an [[urban legend]]; according to an [[internet meme]], the question was asked at the [[University of Copenhagen]] and the student was [[Niels Bohr]].&lt;ref&gt;http://naturelovesmath-en.blogspot.in/2011/06/niels-bohr-barometer-question-myth.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kaplan, Inc.]] [[ACT (test)|ACT]] preparation textbook describes it as an "[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] legend",&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and an early form is found in a 1958 American humor book.&lt;ref&gt;''Reader's Digest Treasury of Wit &amp;amp; Humor,'' [https://books.google.com/books?ei=CSY9UuTHH8rwkQXboYCgDg&amp;id=P7cNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=aneroid+barometer p. 303]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Calandra presented the incident as a real-life, [[First-person narrative|first-person]] experience that occurred during the [[Sputnik crisis]].&lt;ref name=C229&gt;Calandra, Alexander, "Angels on a Pin". Reproduced in Barnes et al., pp. 228-229. p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Calandra's essay, "Angels on a Pin", was published in 1959 in ''Pride'', a magazine of the [[Council for Advancement and Support of Education|American College Public Relations Association]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DNWgAAAAMAAJ Pride, volumes 3-4]'' (1959).

== Calandra's account ==
A colleague of Calandra posed the barometer question to a student, expecting the correct answer: "the height of the building can be estimated in proportion to the difference between the barometer readings at the bottom and at the top of the building".&lt;ref&gt;A classic in-depth discussion of the subject was presented in 1823 by [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Rev. Baden Powell]] in ''Measurement of Heights by the Barometer'', published in [https://books.google.com/books?id=gTkwAAAAYAAJ volume 22, numbers I through V], of the ''[[Annals of Philosophy]]''. For a modern presentation of the same subject, see Silverman, pp. 40-48. The particular formula sought by Calandra's examiner is marked with index 2.12 on page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The student provided a different, and also correct answer: "Take the barometer to the top of the building. Attach a long rope to it, lower the barometer to the street, then bring it up, measuring the length of the rope. The length of the rope is the height of the building."&lt;ref name=C228&gt;Calandra, Alexander, "Angels on a Pin". Reproduced in Barnes et al., pp. 228-229. p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The examiner and Calandra, who was called to advise on the case, faced a moral [[dilemma]]. According to the format of the exam, a correct answer deserved a full credit. But issuing a full credit would have violated [[academic standards]] by rewarding a student who had not demonstrated competence in the academic field that had been tested ([[physics]]). Neither of two available options (pass or fail) was morally acceptable.&lt;ref name=C228/&gt;

Calandra asked the student the same question, and received a wealth of different answers including dropping the barometer from the top of the building and timing its fall with a stopwatch; trading the barometer to the building's superintendent in return for the information wanted; creating two small [[pendulum]]s and measuring the variation of g from the ground to the top of the building; creating a pendulum as high as the building and measuring its period; and comparing the length of the shadows of the building and the barometer. The student admitted that he knew the expected "correct" answer, but was fed up with the professor's "teaching him how to think ... rather than teaching him the structure of the subject."&lt;ref name=C229/&gt;

== Internet meme ==
According to [[Snopes.com]], more recent (1999 and 1988) versions identify the problem as a question in "a physics degree exam at the [[University of Copenhagen]]" and the student as [[Niels Bohr]], and includes the following answers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/college/exam/barometer.asp snopes.com: The Barometer Problem]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tying a piece of string to the barometer, lowering the barometer from the roof to the ground, and measuring the length of the string and barometer.
* Dropping the barometer off the roof, measuring the time it takes to hit the ground, and calculating the building's height assuming [[Equations of motion#Constant linear acceleration|constant acceleration under gravity]].
* When the sun is shining, standing the barometer up, measuring the height of the barometer and the lengths of the shadows of both barometer and building, and finding the building's height using [[similar triangles]].
* Tying a piece of string to the barometer, and swinging it like a pendulum both on the ground and on the roof, and from the known pendulum length and swing period, calculate the [[gravitational field]] for the two cases.  Use [[Newton's law of gravitation]] to calculate the radial altitude of both the ground and the roof.  The difference will be the height of the building.
* Tying a piece of string to the barometer, which is as long as the height of the building, and swinging it like a pendulum, and from the swing period, calculate the pendulum length.
* Marking off the number of barometer lengths vertically along the emergency staircase, and multiplying this with the length of the barometer.
* Trading the barometer for the correct information with the building's janitor or superintendent.
* Measuring the pressure difference between ground and roof and calculating the height difference (the expected answer).

== Interpretations ==
Professor of physics Mark Silverman used what he called "The Barometer-Story formula" precisely for explaining the subject of [[pressure]] and recommended it to physics teachers. Silverman called Calandra's story "a delightful essay that I habitually read to my class whenever we study fluids ... the essay is short, hilarious and satisfying (at least to me and my class)."&lt;ref name=S40&gt;Silverman, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial advisor [[Robert G. Allen (author)|Robert G. Allen]] presented Calandra's essay to illustrate the process and role of [[creativity]] in finance. "Creativity is born when you have a problem to solve. And as you can see from this story ["Angels on a Pin"] there are many ways of solving a problem. Creativity is the art of looking for solutions that are out of the ordinary, different, unorthodox."&lt;ref&gt;Allen, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Meara used the barometer question to illustrate the art of steering students' activities to a desired outcome: "if the question is not aligned [with the desired learning outcome] then the problem becomes an exercise of problem solving for its own value."&lt;ref name=M108&gt;O'Meara, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher can steer the students either through careful design of the questions (this rules out ''barometer questions''), or through guiding the students to the desired choices. In case of the original barometer question, the examiner may explicitly say that the problem has more than one solution, insist on applying the laws of physics, or give them the "ending point" of the solution: "How did I discover that the building was 410 feet in height with only a barometer?"&lt;ref name=M108/&gt;

Herson used the Calandra account as an illustration of the difference between academic tests and assessment in education. Tests, even the ones designed for reliability and validity, are useful, but they are not sufficient in real-world education.&lt;ref&gt;Herson, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanders interpreted Calandra's story as a conflict between perfection and optimal solutions: "We struggle to determine a 'best' answer, when a simple call to a building superintendent (the resource man) would quickly provide adequate information."&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basal area''' is the area of a given section of land that is occupied by the cross-section of [[tree]] trunks and stems at the base. The term is used in [[forest management]] and [[forest ecology]].


== Relationship to mass==
leaf mass (mL)  can be estimated from Basal area (BA) (following Whittaker and Marks (1975), based on measurements of eastern North American trees from various spp):
mL = 113 000 × BA&lt;sup&gt;0.855&lt;/sup&gt;
 
== Estimation from diameter at breast height==

In most countries, this is usually a measurement taken at the [[diameter at breast height]] (1.3m or 4.5&amp;nbsp;ft) of a tree above the ground and includes the complete diameter of every tree, including the bark.  Measurements are usually made for a [[Forest inventory#Types of sample plots|plot]] and this is then scaled up for 1 [[hectare]] of land for comparison purposes to examine a forest's productivity and growth rate.

To estimate a tree's basal area &lt;math&gt;BA&lt;/math&gt;, use the tree's diameter at breast height &lt;math&gt;DBH&lt;/math&gt; in inches with the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;BA = \frac{\pi \times (DBH/2)^2}{144}&lt;/math&gt;

(Note: The factor of 144 is there to convert from Sq Inches to Sq Feet)

This formula simplifies to:
&lt;math&gt; BA = 0.005454 \times DBH^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The result will be in ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For the DBH in cm use:
&lt;math&gt; BA = 0.00007854 \times DBH^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The result will be in m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The basal area of a forest stand can be found by adding the basal areas (as calculated above) of all of the trees in an area and dividing by the area of land in which the trees were measured. Basal area is generally expressed as ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/acre or m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ha.

A [[wedge prism]] can be used to quickly estimate the basal area per hectare. To find basal area using this method, simply multiply your BAF (Basal Area Factor) by the number of "in" trees in your variable radius plot. The BAF will vary based on the prism used, common BAFs include 5/8/10, and all "in" trees are those trees, when viewed through your prism from plot centre, that appear to be in-line with the standing tree on the outside of the prism.

== Worked example ==

Lets say you carried out a survey using a variable radius plot with angle count sampling (wedge prism) and you selected a Basal Area Factor (BAF) of 4. If your first tree had a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 14cm, then the standard way of calculating how much of 1ha was covered by tree area (scaling up from that tree to the hectare) would be:

(BAF/((DBH+0.5)² × π/4))) × 10,000

*BAF, in this case 4, is the BAF selected for the sampling technique.
*DBH, in this case 14 (this uses an assumed diameter, when actually used is the radius perpendicular to the tangent line)  
*The + 0.5 allows under and over measurement to be accounted for.
*The π/4 converts the rest to the area.

In this case this means in every Ha there is 242m² of tree area according to this sampled tree being taken as representative of all the unmeasured trees.

==Fixed area plot==

It would also be possible to survey the trees in a [[Forest inventory#Fixed area plot|Fixed Area Plot (FAP)]]. Also called a Fixed Radius Plot. In the case that this plot was 100m². Then the formula would be

(DBH+0.5)²X π/4

[[File:Mass-spring-damper-bond-graph.png|thumb|266x266px|A simple [[mass–spring–damper]] system, and its equivalent bond-graph form]]

A '''bond graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphical representation]] of a physical [[Dynamical system|dynamic system]]. It allows the conversion of the system into a [[state-space representation]]. It is similar to a [[block diagram]] or [[signal-flow graph]], with the major difference that the arcs in bond graphs represent [[Undirected graph|bi-directional]] exchange of physical [[energy]], while those in block diagrams and signal-flow graphs represent [[Directed graph|uni-directional]] flow of information. Bond graphs are multi-energy domain (e.g. mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, etc) and domain neutral. This means a bond graph can incorporate multiple domains seamlessly.

The bond graph is composed of the "bonds" which link together "single port", "double-port" and "multi-port" elements (see below for details). Each bond represents the instantaneous flow of energy (''dE''/''dt'') or [[Power (physics)|power]]. The flow in each bond is denoted by a pair of variables called power variables, whose product is the instantaneous power of the bond. The power variables are broken into two parts: flow and effort. For example, for the bond of an electrical system, the flow is the current, while the effort is the voltage. By multiplying current and voltage in this example you can get the instantaneous power of the bond.

A bond has two other features described briefly here, and discussed in more detail below. One is the "half-arrow" sign convention. This defines the assumed direction of positive energy flow. As with electrical circuit diagrams and free-body diagrams, the choice of positive direction is arbitrary, with the caveat that the analyst must be consistent throughout with the chosen definition. The other feature is the "causality". This is a vertical bar placed on only one end of the bond. It is not arbitrary. As described below, there are rules for assigning the proper causality to a given port, and rules for the precedence among ports. Causality explains the mathematical relationship between effort and flow. The positions of the causalities show which of the power variables are dependent and which are independent.

If the dynamics of the physical system to be modeled operate on widely varying time scales, fast continuous-time behaviors can be modeled as instantaneous phenomena by using a [[hybrid bond graph]]. Bond graphs were invented by [[Henry Paynter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Analysis and Design of Engineering Systems|date=1961|publisher=The M.I.T. Press|author=Paynter, Henry M.|ISBN=0-262-16004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tetrahedron of state ==
[[File:Tetrahedron-of-state.png|thumb|Tetrahedron of state]]
The tetrahedron of state is a tetrahedron that graphically shows the conversion between effort and flow. The adjacent image shows the tetrahedron in its generalized form. The tetrahedron can be modified depending on the energy domain. The table below shows the variables and constants of the tetrahedron of state in common energy domains.

Using the tetrahedron of state, one can find a mathematical relationship between any variables on the tetrahedron. This is done by following the arrows around the diagram and multiplying any constants along the way. For example, if you wanted to find the relationship between generalized flow and generalized displacement, you would start at the ''f(t)'' and then integrate it to get ''q(t)''. More examples of equations can be seen below.

Relationship between generalized displacement and generalized flow.

&lt;math&gt;q(t) = \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized effort.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac {1}{R} \cdot e(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized momentum.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{1}{I} \cdot p(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized momentum and generalized effort.

&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \int e(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized involving the constant C.

&lt;math&gt;e(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

All of the mathematical relationships remain the same when switching energy domains, only the symbols change. This can be seen with the following examples.

Relationship between displacement and velocity.

&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \int v(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between current and voltage, this is also known as [[Ohm's law]].

&lt;math&gt;i(t) = \frac {1}{R} \cdot V(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between force and displacement, also known as [[Hooke's law]]. It should be noted that the negative sign is dropped in this equation because the sign is factored into the way the arrow is pointing in the bond graph. 

&lt;math&gt;F(t) = k \cdot x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

== Components ==
If an engine is connected to a wheel through a shaft, the power is being transmitted in the rotational mechanical domain, meaning the effort and the flow are torque (τ) and angular velocity (ω) respectively. A word bond graph is a first step towards a bond graph, in which words define the components. As a word bond graph, this system would look like:
: &lt;math&gt;{\text{engine}}\;\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;
A half-arrow is used to provide a sign convention, so if the engine is doing work when τ and ω are positive, then the diagram would be drawn:
: &lt;math&gt;{\text{engine}}\;\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;
This system can also be represented in a more general method. This involves changing from using the words, to symbols representing the same items. These symbols are based on the generalized form, as explained above. As the engine is applying a torque to the wheel, it will be represented as a source of effort for the system. The wheel can be presented by an impedance on the system.  Further, the torque and angular velocity symbols are dropped and replaced with the generalized symbols for effort and flow. While not necessary in the example, it is common to number the bonds, to keep track of in equations. The simplified diagram can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;{S_e}\;\overset{\textstyle e_1}{\underset{\textstyle f_1}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Given that effort is always above the flow on the bond, it is also possible to drop the effort and flow symbols altogether, without losing any relevant information. However, the bond number should not be dropped. The example can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;{S_e}\;\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{I}&lt;/math&gt;

The bond number will be important later when converting from the bond graph to state-space equations.

=== Single-port elements ===
Single port elements are elements in a bond graph that can have only one port.

==== Sources and sinks ====
Sources are elements that represent the input for a system. They will either input effort or flow into a system. They are denoted by a capital "S" with either a lower case "e" or "f" for effort or flow respectively. Sources will always have the arrow pointing away from the element. An examples of sources include: motors (source of effort, torque), voltage sources (source of effort), and current sources (source of flow).

&lt;math&gt;S_e \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ J
\qquad\text{and}\qquad

\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ J&lt;/math&gt;

Sinks are elements that represent the output for a system. They are represented the same way as sources, but have the arrow pointing into the element instead of away from it.

==== Inertance ====
Inertance elements are denoted by a capital "I", and always have power flowing into them. Inertance elements are elements that store kinetic energy. Most commonly these are a mass for mechanical systems, and inductors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ I&lt;/math&gt;

==== Resistance ====
Resistance elements are denoted by a capital "R", and always have power flowing into them. Resistance elements are elements that dissipate energy. Most commonly these are a dampener, for mechanical systems, and resistors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ R&lt;/math&gt;

==== Capacitance ====
Capacitance elements are denoted by a capital "C", and always have power flowing into them. Capacitance elements are elements that store potential energy. Most commonly these are springs for mechanical systems, and capacitors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ C&lt;/math&gt;

=== Two-port elements ===
These elements have two ports. They are used to change the power between or within a system. When converting from one to the other, no power is lost during the transfer. The elements have a constant that will be given with it. The constant is called a transformer constant or gyrator constant depending on which element is being used. These constants will commonly be displayed as a ratio below the element.

====Transformer====
A transformer applies a relationship between flow in flow out, and effort in effort out. Examples include an ideal electrical [[transformer]] or a [[lever]].

Denoted

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 \overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup } }\ \ \ TR\ \   \overset{\textstyle _2}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\  \\
     ^{r:1}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''r'' denotes the modulus of the transformer. This means
: &lt;math&gt;f_1 \cdot r = f_2&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;e_2 \cdot r = e_1&lt;/math&gt;

====Gyrator====
A [[gyrator]] applies a relationship between flow in effort out, and effort in flow out. An example of a gyrator is a DC motor, which converts voltage (electrical effort) into Angular velocity (angular mechanical flow).

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 \overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup } }\ \ \ GY\ \   \overset{\textstyle _2}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\  \\
     ^{g:1}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

meaning that
: &lt;math&gt;e_2 = g \cdot f_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;e_1 = g \cdot f_2.\,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Multi-port elements ===
Junctions, unlike the other elements can have any number of ports either in or out. Junctions split power across their ports. There are two distant junctions, the 0-junction and the 1-junction which differ only in the how effort and flow are carried across. It should be noted that the same junction in series can be combined, but different junctions in series cannot.

==== 0-junctions ====
0-junctions behave such that all efforts values are equal across the bonds, but the sum of the flow values in equals the sum the flow values out.

&lt;math&gt;all\ e's\ are\ equal
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum f_{in} = \sum f_{out}
&lt;/math&gt;

An example is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;
\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
\stackrel{\textstyle\stackrel{\textstyle _2}{\upharpoonright}}{0}
\overset{\textstyle _3}{\underset{\textstyle }{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Resulting equations:

&lt;math&gt;e_1 = e_2 = e_3
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f_1 = f_2 + f_3
&lt;/math&gt;

==== 1-junctions ====
1-junctions behave opposite of 0-junctions. 1-junctions behave such that all flow values are equal across the bonds, but the sum of the effort values in equals the sum the effort values out.

&lt;math&gt;all\ f's\ are\ equal
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum e_{in} = \sum e_{out}
&lt;/math&gt;

An example is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
\stackrel{\textstyle\stackrel{\textstyle _2}{\upharpoonright}}{1}
\overset{\textstyle _3}{\underset{\textstyle }{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Resulting equations:

&lt;math&gt;f_1 = f_2 = f_3
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e_1 = e_2 + e_3
&lt;/math&gt;

==Causality==
Bond graphs have a notion of causality, indicating which side of a bond determines the instantaneous effort and which determines the instantaneous flow. In formulating the dynamic equations that describe the system, causality defines, for each modeling element, which variable is dependent and which is independent.  By propagating the causation graphically from one modeling element to the other, analysis of large-scale models becomes easier.  Completing causal assignment in a bond graph model will allow the detection of modeling situation where an algebraic loop exists; that is the situation when a variable is defined recursively as a function of itself.

As an example of causality, consider a capacitor in series with a battery. It is not physically possible to charge a capacitor instantly, so anything connected in parallel with a capacitor will necessarily have the same voltage (effort variable) as the capacitor. Similarly, an inductor cannot change flux instantly and so any component in series with an inductor will necessarily have the same flow as the inductor. Because capacitors and inductors are passive devices, they cannot maintain their respective voltage and flow indefinitely&amp;#x2014;the components to which they are attached will affect their respective voltage and flow, but only indirectly by affecting their current and voltage respectively.

Note: Causality is a symmetric relationship. When one side "causes" effort, the other side "causes" flow.

In bond graph notation, a causal stroke may be added to one end of the power bond to indicate that the opposite end is defining the effort. Consider a constant-torque motor driving a wheel, i.e. a source of effort (''SE''). That would be drawn as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}[b]{r}\text{motor}\\SE\end{array}\;
\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--

   motor      τ    \|
      SE  ----------| wheel
              ω     |
--&gt;

Symmetrically, the side with the causal stroke (in this case the wheel) defines the flow for the bond.

Causality results in compatibility constraints. Clearly only one end of a power bond can define the effort and so only one end of a bond can have a causal stroke. In addition, the two passive components with time-dependent behavior, ''I'' and ''C'', can only have one sort of causation: an ''I'' component determines flow; a ''C'' component defines effort. So from a junction, ''J'', the preferred causal orientation is as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;I
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\;C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
          \|
  J -------| I
           |

    |      \
  J |------- C
    |
--&gt;

The reason that this is the preferred method for these elements can be further analyzed if you consider the equations they would give shown by the tetrahedron of state.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{1}{I} \int e(t) \operatorname{d}\!t
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
e(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting equations involve the integral of the independent power variable. This is preferred over the result of having the causality the other way, which results in derivative. The equations can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;e(t) = I \cdot \dot{f}(t)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
f(t) = C \cdot \dot{e}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible for a bond graph to have a casual bar on one of these elements in the non-preferred manner. In such a case a "casual conflict" is said to have occurred at that bond. The results of a causal conflict are only seen when writing the [[state-space]] equations for the graph. It is explained in more details in that section.

A resistor has no time-dependent behavior: apply a voltage and get a flow instantly, or apply a flow and get a voltage instantly, thus a resistor can be at either end of a causal bond:
: &lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;R
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\;R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
         \|               |       \
 J -------| R           J |-------- R
          |               |
--&gt;

Sources of flow (''SF'') define flow, sources of effort (''SE'') define effort. Transformers are passive, neither dissipating nor storing energy, so causality passes through them:
: &lt;math&gt;\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
TF
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
TF
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
         | ..      |          |       .. |
   ------| TF -----|    or    |------ TF |------
         |         |          |          |
--&gt;

A gyrator transforms flow to effort and effort to flow, so if flow is caused on one side, effort is caused on the other side and vice versa:
: &lt;math&gt;\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
GY
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
GY
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
   |       ..      |                | .. |     
   |------ GY -----|    or    ------| GY |------
   |               |                |    |
--&gt;
; Junctions
In a 0-junction, efforts are equal; in a 1-junction, flows are equal. Thus, with causal bonds, only one bond can cause the effort in a 0-junction and only one can cause the flow in a 1-junction. Thus, if the causality of one bond of a junction is known, the causality of the others is also known. That one bond is called the 'strong bond'
: &lt;math&gt;\text{strong bond}\rightarrow\;\dashv\!\overset{\textstyle \top}{\underset{\textstyle\bot}{0}}\!\dashv
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\text{strong bond}\rightarrow\;\vdash\!\overset{\textstyle \bot}{\underset{\textstyle\top}{1}}\!\vdash&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
                 ___

=== Determining causality ===
In order to determine the causality of a bond graph certain steps must be followed. Those steps are:
# Draw Source Causal Bars
# Draw Preferred causality for C and I bonds
# Draw causal bars for 0 and 1 junctions, transformers and gyrators
# Draw R bond causal bars
# If a causal conflict occurs, change C or I bond to differentiation
A walk-through of the steps is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first step is to draw causality for the sources, over which there is only one. This results in the graph below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to draw the preferred causality for the C bonds.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \bar{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1}&amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Next apply the causality for the 0 and 1 junctions, transformers, and gyrators.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \bar{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

However, it should be noted that there is an issue with 0-junction on the left. The 0-junction has two causal bars at the junction, but the 0-junction wants one and only one at the junction. This was caused by having &lt;math display="inline"&gt;C_2
&lt;/math&gt; be in the preferred causality. The only way to fix this is to flip that causal bar. This results in a causal conflict, the corrected version of the graph is below, with the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\star
&lt;/math&gt; representing the causal conflict.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft} \star    &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Converting from other systems ==
One of the main advantages of using bond graphs is that once you have a bond graph it doesn't matter the original energy domain. Below are some of the steps to apply when converting from the energy domain to a bond graph.

=== Electromagnetic ===
The steps for solving an Electromagnetic problem as a bond graph are as follows:
# Place an 0-junction at each node
# Insert Sources, R, I, C, TR, and GY bonds with 1 junctions
# Ground (both sides if a transformer or gyrator is present)
# Assign power flow direction
# Simplify
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Linear mechanical ===
The steps for solving an Linear Mechanical problem as a bond graph are as follows:
# Place 1-junctions for each distinct velocity (usually at a mass)
# Insert R and C bonds at their own 0-junctions between the 1 junctions where they act
# Insert Sources and I bonds on the 1 junctions where they act
# Assign power flow direction
# Simplify
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Simplifying ===
The simplifying step is the same regardless if the system was electromagnetic or linear mechanical. The steps are:
# Remove Bond of zero power (due to ground or zero velocity)
# Remove 0 and 1 junctions with less than three bonds
# Simplify parallel power
# Combine 0 junctions in series
# Combine 1 junctions in series
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Parallel power ===
Parallel power is when power runs in parallel in a bond graph. An example of parallel power is shown below.

[[File:Bond-graph-parallel-power-example.png|frameless]]

Parallel power can be simplified, by recalling the relationship between effort and flow for 0 and 1-junctions. To solve parallel power you will first want to write down all of the equations for the junctions. For the example provided, the equations can be seen below. (Please make note of the number bond the effort/flow variable represents).

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
f_1=f_2=f_3 &amp;  &amp; e_2=e_4=e_7 \\
e_1=e_2+e_3 &amp;  &amp; f_2=f_4+f_7 \\
            &amp;  &amp;             \\
e_3=e_5=e_6 &amp;  &amp; f_7=f_6=f_8 \\
f_3=f_5+f_6 &amp;  &amp; e_7+e_6=e_8
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

By manipulating these equations you can arrange them such that you can find an equivalent set of 0 and 1-junctions to describe the parallel power.

For example because &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_3=e_6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_2=e_7&lt;/math&gt; you can replace the variables in the equation &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1=e_2+e_3&lt;/math&gt; resulting in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1=e_6+e_7&lt;/math&gt; and since

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_6+e_7=e_8&lt;/math&gt;, we now know that &lt;math&gt;e_1=e_8&lt;/math&gt;. This relationship of two effort variables equaling can explained by an 0-junction. Manipulating other equations you can find that &lt;math&gt;f_4=f_5&lt;/math&gt; which describes the relationship of a 1-junction. Once you have determined the relationships that you need you can redraw the parallel power section with the new junctions. The result for the example show is seen below.

[[File:Bond-graph-parallel-power-solved.png|frameless]]

=== Examples ===

==== Simple electrical system ====
A simple electrical circuit consisting of a voltage source, resistor, and capacitor in series.

[[File:Simple-RC-circuit.png|frameless]]

The first step is to draw 0-junctions at all of the node. The result is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 &amp; 0 &amp;  &amp; 0 &amp; \\ 
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ 
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ 
 &amp; 0 &amp;  &amp; 0 &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to add all of the elements acting at their own 1-junction. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
    &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; R &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   \\ 
    &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; - &amp; 1 &amp; - &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   \\
S_e &amp; - &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp; - &amp; C  \\
    &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp; \underline{0} &amp; - &amp; - &amp; - &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to pick a ground. The ground is simply an 0-junction that is going to be assumed to have no voltage. For this case, the ground will be chosen to be the lower left 0-junction, that is underlined above. The next step is to draw all of the arrows for the bond graph. The arrows on junctions should point towards ground (following a similar path to current). For resistance, inertance, and compliance elements, the arrows always point towards the elements. The result of drawing the arrows can be seen below, with the 0-junction marked with a star as the ground.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-1.png|frameless]]

Now that we have the Bond graph, we can start the process of simplifying it. The first step is to remove all the ground nodes. Both of the bottom 0-junctions can be removed, because they are both grounded. The result is shown below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|199x199px]]

Next, the junctions with less than three bonds can be removed. This is because flow and effort pass through these junctions without be modified, so they can be removed to allow us to draw less. The result can be seen below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|140x140px]]

The final step is to apply causality to the bond graph. Applying causality was explained above. The final bond graph is shown below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-4.png|frameless|140x140px]]

==== Advanced electrical system ====
A more advanced electrical system with a current source, resistors, capacitors, and a transformer

[[File:Transformer-rc-circuit.png|frameless|464x464px]]

Following the steps with this circuit will result in the bond graph below, before it is simplified. The nodes marked with the star denote the ground.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|463x463px]]

Simplifying the bond graph will result in the image below.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|355x355px]]

Lastly, applying causality will result in the bond graph below. It should be noted that the bond with star denotes a causal conflict.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|348x348px]]

==== Simple linear mechanical ====
A simple linear mechanical system, consisting of a mass on a spring that is attached to a wall. The mass has some force being applied to it. An image of the system is shown below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-corrected.png|frameless|291x291px]]

For a mechanical system, the first step is to place a 1-junction at each distant velocity, in this case there are two distant velocities, the mass and the wall. It is usually helpful to label the 1-junctions for reference. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
1_{mass} &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
1_{wall} &amp;  &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to draw the R and C bonds at their own 0-junctions between the 1-junctions where they act. For this example there is only one of these bonds, the C bond for the spring. It acts between the 1-junction representing the mass and the 1-junction representing the wall. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
         &amp;   &amp;               \\
         &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{mass} &amp;   &amp;               \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
0        &amp; - &amp; C:\frac{1}{k} \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{wall} &amp;   &amp;   
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Next you want to add the sources and I bonds on the 1-junction where they act. There is one source, the source of effort (force) and one I bond, the mass of the mass both of which act on the 1-junction of the mass. The result is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_e:F(t)      &amp;   &amp;               \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{mass} &amp; - &amp; I:m           \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
0        &amp; - &amp; C:\frac{1}{k} \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{wall} &amp;   &amp;  
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Next you want to assign power flow. Like the electrical examples, power should flow towards ground, in this case the 1-junction of the wall. Exceptions to this are R,C, or I bond, which always point towards the element. The resulting bond graph is below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-bond-graph-1.png|frameless]]

Now that the bond graph has been generated, it can be simplified. Because the wall is grounded (has zero velocity), you can remove that junction. As such the 0-junction the C bond is on, can also be removed because it will then have less than three bonds. The simplified bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-bond-graph-2.png|frameless]]

The last step is to apply causality, the final bond graph can be seen below.

==== Advanced linear mechanical ====
A more advanced linear mechanical system can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech.png|frameless]]

Just like the above example, the first step is to make 1-junctions at each of the distant velocities. In this example there are three distant velocity, Mass 1, Mass 2, and the wall. Then you connect all of the bonds and assign power flow. The bond can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|318x318px]]

Next you start the process of simplifying the bond graph, by removing the 1-junction of the wall, and removing junctions with less than three bonds. The bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mechanical-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|375x375px]]

It should be noted that there is parallel power in the bond graph. Solving parallel power was explained above. The result of solving it can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|370x370px]]

Lastly, apply causality, the final bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-4.png|frameless|348x348px]]

== State equations ==
Once a bond graph is complete, it can be utilized to generate the [[state-space representation]] equations of the system. State-space representation is especially powerful as it allows complex multi-order [[Differential equation|differential]] system to be solved as a system of first-order equations instead. The general form of the state equation can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}} (t) = \textbf{A}\cdot \textbf{x}(t) + \textbf{B}\cdot \textbf{u}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{x} (t)&lt;/math&gt; is a column matrix of the [[state variable]]s, or the unknowns of the system. &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[time derivative]] of the state variables. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;is a column matrix of the inputs of the system. And &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are matrices of constants based on the system. The state variables of a system are &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; values for each C and I bond without a causal conflict. Each I bond gets a &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; while each C bond gets a &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if you have the bond graph shown below.

[[File:State-equation-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|422x422px]]

Would have the following &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{x} (t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt; matrices.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{ x} }(t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
\dot{p}_3(t) \\
\dot{q}_6(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\textbf{x}(t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
p_3(t) \\
q_6(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\textbf{ u} (t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
e_1(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

The matrices of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are solved by determining the relationship of the state variables and their respective elements, as was described in the tetrahedron of state. The first step to solve the state equations, is to list all of the governing equations for the bond graph. The table below, shows the relationship between bonds and their governing equations.

For the example provided,

[[File:State-equation-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|422x422px]]

The governing equations are the following.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
input=e_1                                                                   &amp; eq. 1  \\
e_1=e_2+e_3+e_4                                                             &amp; eq. 2  \\
f_1=f_2=f_3=f_4                                                             &amp; eq. 3  \\
e_2=R_2 \cdot f_2                                                           &amp; eq. 4  \\
f_3 = \frac{1}{I_3} \int e_3 \operatorname{d}\!t = \frac{1}{I_3} \cdot p_3  &amp; eq. 5  \\
f_4 \cdot r = f_5                                                           &amp; eq. 6  \\
e_5 \cdot r = e_4                                                           &amp; eq. 7  \\
e_5 = e_6= e_7                                                              &amp; eq. 8  \\
f_5=f_6+f_7                                                                 &amp; eq. 9  \\
e_6 = \frac{1}{C_5} \int f_6 \operatorname{d}\!t = \frac {1}{C_6} \cdot q_6 &amp; eq. 10 \\
f_7 = \frac{1}{R_7} \cdot e_7                                               &amp; eq. 11
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be manipulated to yield the state equations. For this example, you are trying to find equations that relate &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{p}_3(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{q}_6(t)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_3(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

To start you should recall from the tetrahedron of state that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{p}_3(t) = e_3(t)&lt;/math&gt;starting with equation 2, you can rearrange it so that &lt;math&gt;e_3 = e_1 - e_2 - e_4&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; can be substituted for equation 4, while in equation 4, &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;f_3&lt;/math&gt;due to equation 3, which can then be replaced by equation 5. &lt;math&gt;e_4&lt;/math&gt; can likewise be replaced using equation 7, in which &lt;math&gt;e_5&lt;/math&gt;can be replaced with &lt;math&gt;e_6&lt;/math&gt; which can then be replaced with equation 10. Following these substituted yields the first state equation which is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{p}_3(t) = e_3(t) = e_1(t) - \frac {R_2}{I_3} \cdot p_3(t) - \frac{r}{C_6} \cdot q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The second state equation can likewise be solved, by recalling that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{q}_6(t) = f_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The second state equation is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_6(t)=f_6(t)=\frac{r}{I_3}\cdot p_3(t) - \frac{1}{R_7 \cdot C_6} \cdot q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Both equations can further be rearranged into matrix form. The result of which is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{p}_3(t)\\ 
\dot{q}_6(t)
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
- \frac{R_2}{I_3} &amp; - \frac{r}{C_6}\\ 
 \frac{r}{I_3} &amp; -\frac{1}{R_7 \cdot C_6}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p_3(t)\\ 
q_6(t)
\end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\ 
0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1(t)
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

At this point the equations can be treated as any other [[state-space representation]] problem.

== Notes ==
Note that the ''bystander effect'' is not the same as the ''abscopal effect''. The [[abscopal effect]] is a phenomenon where the response to radiation is seen in an organ/site distant to the irradiated organ/area, that is, the responding cells are not juxtaposed with the irradiated cells. T-cells and dendritic cells have been implicated to be part of the mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14967443 | doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.09.012 | volume=58 | issue=3 | title=Ionizing radiation inhibition of distant untreated tumors (abscopal effect) is immune mediated |date=March 2004 |vauthors=Demaria S, Ng B, Devitt ML | pages=862–70|journal=International Journal of Radiation OncologyBiologyPhysics|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Suicide gene|suicide gene therapy]], the "bystander effect" is the ability of the transfected cells to transfer death signals to neighboring tumor cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Progress and problems with the use of suicide genes for targeted cancer therapy|last = Karjoo|first = Z.|date = 2015|journal = Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|doi = 10.1016/j.addr.2015.05.009|pmid = 26004498|last2 = Chen|first2 = X.|first3 = A.|last3 = Hatefi|volume=99|pmc=4758904|pages=113–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catastrophic interference''', also known as catastrophic forgetting, is the tendency of an [[artificial neural network]] to completely and abruptly forget previously learned information upon learning new information.&lt;ref name="McCloskey1989"&gt;McCloskey, M. &amp; Cohen, N. (1989) [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079742108605368 Catastrophic interference in connectionist networks: The sequential learning problem]. In G. H. Bower (ed.)

''Psychological Review'',''97'', 285-308&lt;/ref&gt; Neural networks are an important part of the [[Connectionism|network approach and connectionist approach]] to [[cognitive science]]. These networks use computer simulations to try to model human behaviours, such as memory and learning. Catastrophic interference is an important issue to consider when creating connectionist models of memory. It was originally brought to the attention of the scientific community by research from McCloskey and Cohen (1989),&lt;ref name="McCloskey1989" /&gt; and Ractcliff (1990).&lt;ref name="Ratcliff1990" /&gt; It is a radical manifestation of the 'sensitivity-stability' dilemma&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, D.O.

[[Lookup table]]s and connectionist networks lie on the opposite sides of the stability plasticity spectrum.&lt;ref name ="French1997"&gt;French, R. M. (1997) Pseudo-recurrent connectionist networks: an approach to the 'sensitivity-stability' dilemma. ''Connection Science'', ''9''(4), 353–379.&lt;/ref&gt; The former remains completely stable in the presence of new information but lacks the ability to [[machine learning#Generalization|generalize]], i.e. infer general principles, from new inputs. On the other hand, connectionist networks like the [[backpropagation|standard backpropagation network]] are very sensitive to new information and can generalize on new inputs. Backpropagation models can be considered good models of [[human memory]] insofar as they mirror the human ability to generalize but these networks often exhibit less stability than human memory. Notably, these backpropagation networks are susceptible to catastrophic interference. This is considered an issue when attempting to model human memory because, unlike these networks, humans typically do not show catastrophic forgetting. Thus, the issue of catastrophic interference must be eradicated from these backpropagation models in order to enhance the plausibility as models of human memory.

==History of catastrophic interference==

The term catastrophic interference was originally coined by McCloskey and Cohen (1989) but was also brought to the attention of the scientific community by research from Ratcliff (1990).&lt;ref name="Ratcliff1990" /&gt;

=== ''The Sequential Learning Problem'': McCloskey and Cohen (1989)===

McCloskey and Cohen (1989) noted the problem of catastrophic interference during two different experiments with backpropagation neural network modelling.

* Experiment 1: ''Learning the ones and twos addition facts''
In their first experiment they trained a standard backpropagation neural network on a single training set consisting of 17 single-digit ones problems (i.e., 1 + 1 through 9 + 1, and 1 + 2 through 1 + 9) until the network could represent and respond properly to all of them. The error between the actual output and the desired output steadily declined across training sessions, which reflected that the network learned to represent the target outputs better across trials.  Next they trained the network on a single training set consisting of 17 single-digit twos problems (i.e., 2 + 1 through 2 + 9, and 1 + 2 through 9 + 2) until the network could represent, respond properly to all of them. They noted that their procedure was similar to how a child would learn their addition facts. Following each learning trial on the twos facts, the network was tested for its knowledge on both the ones and twos addition facts. Like the ones facts, the twos facts were readily learned by the network. However, McCloskey and Cohen noted the network was no longer able to properly answer the ones addition problems even after one learning trial of the twos addition problems. The output pattern produced in response to the ones facts often resembled an output pattern for an incorrect number more closely than the output pattern for an incorrect number.{{clarify|date=July 2016}} This is considered to be a drastic amount of error. Furthermore, the problems 2+1 and 2+1, which were included in both training sets, even showed dramatic disruption during the first learning trials of the twos facts.

* Experiment 2: ''Replication of Barnes and Underwood (1959) study''&lt;ref name="Barnes1959"&gt;Barnes, J. M., &amp; Underwood, B. J. (1959). Fate of first-list associations in transfer theory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'', ''58'', 97–105.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In their second connectionist model, McCloskey and Cohen attempted to replicate the study on retroactive interference in humans by Barnes and Underwood (1959). They trained the model on A-B and A-C lists and used a context pattern in the input vector (input pattern), to differentiate between the lists. Specifically the network was trained to responds with the right B response when shown the A stimulus and A-B context pattern and to respond with the correct C response when shown the A stimulus and the A-C context pattern. When the model was trained concurrently on the A-B and A-C items then the network readily learned all of the associations correctly. In sequential training the A-B list was trained first, followed by the A-C list. After each presentation of the A-C list, performance was measured for both the A-B and A-C lists. They found that the amount of training on the A-C list in Barnes and Underwood study that lead to 50% correct responses, lead to nearly 0% correct responses by the backpropagation network. Furthermore, they found that the network tended to show responses that looked like the C response pattern when the network was prompted to give the B response pattern. This indicated that the A-C list apparently had overwritten the A-B list. This could be likened to learning the word dog, followed by learning the word stool and then finding that you cannot recognize the word cat well but instead think of the word stool when presented with the word dog.

McCloskey and Cohen tried to reduce interference through a number of manipulations including changing the number of hidden units, changing the value of the learning rate parameter, overtraining on the A-B list, freezing certain connection weights, changing target values 0 and 1 instead 0.1 and 0.9. However none of these manipulations satisfactorily reduced the catastrophic interference exhibited by the networks.

Overall, McCloskey and Cohen (1989) concluded that: 
*at least some interference will occur whenever new learning alters the weights involved representing 
*the greater the amount of new learning, the greater the disruption in old knowledge 
*interference was catastrophic in the backpropagation networks when learning was sequential but not concurrent

===''Constraints Imposed by Learning and Forgetting Functions'': Ratcliff (1990)===

Ratcliff (1990) used multiple sets of backpropagation models applied to standard recognition memory procedures, in which the items were sequentially learned.&lt;ref name="Ratcliff1990" /&gt; After inspecting the recognition performance models he found two major problems:
* Well-learned information was catastrophically forgotten as new information was learned in both small and large backpropagation networks. 
Even one learning trial with new information resulted in a significant loss of the old information, paralleling the findings of McCloskey and Cohen (1989).&lt;ref name="McCloskey1989" /&gt; Ratcliff also found that the resulting outputs were often a blend of the previous input and the new input. In larger networks, items learned in groups (e.g. AB then CD) were more resistant to forgetting than were items learned singly (e.g. A then B then C…). However, the forgetting for items learned in groups was still large. Adding new hidden units to the network did not reduce interference. 
* Discrimination between the studied items and previously unseen items decreased as the network learned more. 
This finding contradicts with studies on human memory, which indicated that discrimination increases with learning. Ratcliff attempted to alleviate this problem by adding 'response nodes' that would selectively respond to old and new inputs. However, this method did not work as these response nodes would become active for all inputs. A model which used a context pattern also failed to increase discrimination between new and old items.

==Proposed solutions==

Many researchers have suggested that the main cause of catastrophic interference is overlap in the representations at the hidden layer of distributed neural networks.&lt;ref name="French1991"&gt;French, R. M. (1991). [http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/1993/SS-93-06/SS93-06-007.pdf Using Semi-Distributed Representations to Overcome Catastrophic Forgetting in Connectioniost Networks]. In:  ''Proceedings of the 13th Annual Cognitive Science Society Conference'' (pp. 173-178) New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McRae1993"&gt;McRae, K., &amp; Hetherington, P. (1993). [https://sites.google.com/site/kenmcraelab/publications/McRae_Heth_CogSci_93.pdf Catastrophic Interference is Eliminated in Pre-Trained Networks]. In: ''Proceedings of the 15th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society'' (pp. 723-728). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="French1999"&gt;French, R. M. (1999). Catastrophic forgetting in connectionist networks. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', ''3''(4), 128–135.&lt;/ref&gt; In a distributed representation any given input will tend to create changes in the weights to many of the nodes. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because when many of the weights where "knowledge is stored" are changed, it is impossible for prior knowledge to be kept intact. During sequential learning, the inputs become mixed with the new input being superimposed over top of the old input.&lt;ref name="McRae1993" /&gt; Another way to conceptualize this is through visualizing learning as movement through a weight space.&lt;ref name="Lewandowsky1991"&gt;Lewandowsky S. (1991). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LQh7AgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=%22Gradual+unlearning+and+catastrophic+interference:+a+comparison+of+distributed+architectures%22&amp;ots=WwiRSSEVfe&amp;sig=OJUPPpmD_VE795zJx88lHUIUxYk#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gradual%20unlearning%20and%20catastrophic%20interference%3A%20a%20comparison%20of%20distributed%20architectures%22&amp;f=false Gradual unlearning and catastrophic interference: a comparison of distributed architectures]. In: Hockley WE and Lewandowsky S (eds). ''Relating theory and data: essays on human memory in honor of Bennet B. Murdock'' (pp. 445–476). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; This weight space can be likened to a spatial representation of all of the possible combinations of weights that the network can possess. When a network first learns to represent a set of patterns, it has found a point in weight space which allows it to recognize all of the patterns that it has seen.&lt;ref name=French1999 /&gt; However, when the network learns a new set of patterns sequentially it will move to a place in the weight space that allows it to only recognize the new pattern.&lt;ref name=French1999 /&gt; To recognize both sets of patterns, the network must find a place in weight space that can represent both the new and the old output. One way to do this is by connecting a hidden unit to only a subset of the input units. This reduces the likelihood that two different inputs will be encoded by the same hidden units and weights, and so will decrease the chance of interference.&lt;ref name="McRae1993" /&gt;  Indeed, a number of the proposed solutions to catastrophic interference involve reducing the amount of overlap that occurs when storing information in these weights.

Many of the early techniques in reducing representational overlap involved making either the input vectors or the hidden unit activation patterns [[orthogonality#Definitions|orthogonal]] to one another. Lewandowsky and Li (1995)&lt;ref name="Lewandowsky1995"&gt;Lewandowsky, S., &amp; Li, S-C. (1995). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780122089305500118 Catastrophic interference in neural networks: causes, solutions, and data]. In: Dempster, F.N. &amp; Brainerd, C. (eds). ''Interference and Inhibition in Cognition'' (pp. 329–361). San Diego: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the interference between sequentially learned patterns is minimized if the input vectors are orthogonal to each other. Input vectors are said to be orthogonal to each other if the pairwise product of their elements across the two vectors sum to zero. For example, the patterns [0,0,1,0] and [0,1,0,0] are said to be orthogonal because (0&amp;times;0 + 0&amp;times;1 + 1&amp;times;0 + 0&amp;times;0) = 0. One of the techniques which can create orthogonal representations at the hidden layers involves bipolar feature coding (i.e., coding using -1 and 1 rather than 0 and 1).&lt;ref name="French1999" /&gt; Orthogonal patterns tend to produce less interference with each other. However, not all learning problems can be represented using these types of vectors and some studies report that the degree of interference is still problematic with orthogonal vectors.&lt;ref name="Ratcliff1990" /&gt; Simple techniques such as varying the learning rate parameters in the backpropagation equation were not successful in reducing interference. Varying the number of hidden nodes has also been used to try and reduce interference. However, the findings have been mixed, with some studies finding that more hidden units decrease interference&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi, M. (2004). [https://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Abstract/2004/10250/Reassessment_of_catastrophic_interference.24.aspx Reassessment of Catastrophic Interference]. ''Computational Neuroscience'', ''15''(15), 2423 – 2426&lt;/ref&gt; and other studies finding it does not.&lt;ref name="McCloskey1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ratcliff1990" /&gt;

Below are a number of techniques which have empirical support in successfully reducing catastrophic interference in backpropagation neural networks:

===Node sharpening technique===
French (1991)&lt;ref name="French1991" /&gt;  proposed that catastrophic interference arises in [[feedforward neural network|feedforward]] backpropagation networks due to the interaction of node activations, or activation overlap, that occur in distributed representations at the hidden layer. Specifically, he defined this activation overlap as the average shared activation over all units in the hidden layer, calculated by summing the lowest activation of the nodes at the hidden layer and averaging this sum. For example, if the activations at the hidden layer from one input are (0.3, 0.1, 0.9, 1.0) and the activations from the next input are (0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.9) the activation overlap would be (0.0 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.9 ) / 4 = 0.275. When using [binary number|binary] representation of input [row vector|vectors], activation values will be 0 through 1, where 0 indicates no activation overlap and 1 indicates full activation overlap. French noted that [[neural network]]s which employ very localized representations do not show catastrophic interference because of the lack of overlap at the hidden layer. That is to say, each input pattern will create a hidden layer representation that involves the activation of only one node, so differed inputs will have an activation overlap of 0. Thus, he suggested that reducing the value of activation overlap at the hidden layer would reduce catastrophic interference in distributed networks. Specifically he proposed that this could be done through changing the distributed representations at the hidden layer to 'semi-distributed' representations. A 'semi-distributed' representation has fewer hidden nodes that are active, and/or a lower activation value for these nodes, for each representation, which will make the representations of the different inputs overlap less at the hidden layer.  French recommended that this could be done through 'activation sharpening', a technique which slightly increases the activation of a certain number of the most active nodes in the hidden layer, slightly reduces the activation of all the other units and then changes the input-to-hidden layer weights to reflect these activation changes (similar to error backpropagation). Overall the guidelines for the process of 'activation sharpening' are as follows:

# Perform a forward activation pass by feeding an input from the input layer to the hidden layer and record the activations at the hidden layer
# '''''"Sharpen" the activation''''' of x number of most active nodes by a sharpening factor α:
#: ''A&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''A&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''α''(1- ''A&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'') 		For nodes to be sharpened, i.e. more activated
#: ''A&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''A&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''αA&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;''	           For all other nodes
#: French suggested the number of nodes to be sharpened should be log ''n'' nodes, where n is the number of hidden layer nodes
# 	Use the difference between the old activation (A&lt;sub&gt;''old''&lt;/sub&gt;) and the sharpened activation (''A&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'') as an error, backpropagate this error to the input layer, and modify the weights of input-to-output appropriately
# 	Do a full forward pass with the input through to the output layer
# 	Backpropagate as usual from the output to the input layer
# 	Repeat

In his tests of an 8-8-8 (input-hidden-output) node backpropagation network where one node was sharpened, French found that this sharpening paradigm did result in one node being much more active than the other seven. Moreover, when sharpened, this network took one fourth the time to relearn the initial inputs than a standard backpropagation without node sharpening. Relearning is a measure of memory savings and thus extent of forgetting, where more time to relearn suggests more forgetting ([[Herman Ebbinghaus|Ebbinghaus]] savings method). A two-node sharpened network performed even slightly better, however if more than two nodes were sharpened forgetting increased again.

According to French, the sharpened activations interfere less with weights in the network than unsharpened weights and this is due specifically to the way that backpropagation algorithm calculates weight changes. Activations near 0 will change the weights of links less than activations near 1. Consequently, when there are many nodes with low activations (due to sharpening), the weights to and from these nodes will be modified much less than the weights on very active nodes. As a result, when a new input is fed into the network, sharpening will reduce activation overlap by limiting the number of highly active hidden units and will reduce the likelihood of representational overlap by reducing the number of weights that are to be changed.  Thus, node sharpening will decrease the amount of disruption in the old weights, which store prior input patterns, thereby reducing the likelihood of catastrophic forgetting.

===Novelty rule===
Kortge (1990)&lt;ref name="Kortge1990"&gt;Kortge, C. A. (1990). Episodic memory in connectionist networks. In: ''The Twelfth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society'', (pp. 764-771). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a learning rule for training neural networks, called the 'novelty rule', to help alleviate catastrophic interference. As its name suggests, this rule helps the neural network to learn only the components of a new input that differ from an old input. Consequently, the novelty rule changes only the weights that were not previously dedicated to storing information, thereby reducing the overlap in representations at the hidden units. Thus, even when inputs are somewhat similar to another, dissimilar representations can be made at the hidden layer. In order to apply the novelty rule, during learning the input pattern is replaced by a novelty vector that represents the components that differ. The novelty vector for the first layer (input units to hidden units) is determined by taking the target pattern away from the current output of the network (the [[delta rule]]). For the second layer (hidden units to output units) the novelty vector is simply the activation of the hidden units that resulted from using the novelty vector as an input through the first layer. Weight changes in the network are computed by using a modified delta rule with the '''''novelty vector''''' replacing the activation value (sum of the inputs):

: Δ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''k''δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  
: 
: Δw&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = weight change between nodes ''i'' and ''j''  
: ''k'' = learning rate
: δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = error signal 
: ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;= novely vector

When the novelty rule is used in a standard backpropagation network there is no, or lessened, forgetting of old items when new items are presented sequentially.&lt;ref name="Kortge1990" /&gt; However, this rule can only apply to auto-encoder or auto-associative networks, in which the target response for the output layer is identical to the input pattern. This is because the novelty vector would be meaningless if the desired output was not identical to the input as it would be impossible to calculate how much a new input differed from the old input.

===Pre-training networks===

McRae and Hetherington (1993)&lt;ref name="McRae1993" /&gt; argued that humans, unlike most neural networks, do not take on new learning tasks with a random set of weights. Rather, people tend to bring a wealth of prior knowledge to a task and this helps to avoid the problem of interference. They proposed that when a network is pre-trained on a random sample of data prior to starting a sequential learning task that this prior knowledge will naturally constrain how the new information can be incorporated. This would occur because a random sample of data from a domain which has a high degree of internal structure, such as the English language, training would capture the regularities, or recurring patterns, found within that domain. Since the domain is based on regularities, a newly learned item will tend to be similar to the previously learned information, which will allow the network to incorporate new data with little interference with existing data. Specifically, an input vector which follows the same pattern of regularities as the previously trained data should not cause a drastically different pattern of activation at the hidden layer or drastically alter weights.

To test their hypothesis, McRae and Hetherington (1993) compared the performance of a naïve and pre-trained auto-encoder backpropagation network on three simulations of verbal learning tasks. The pre-trained network was trained using letter based representations of English monosyllabic words or English word pairs.  All three tasks involved the learning of some consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) strings or CVC pairs (list A), followed by training on a second list of these items (list B). Afterwards, the distributions of the hidden node activations were compared between the naïve and pre-trained network. In all three tasks, the representations of a CVC in the naïve network tended to be spread fairly evenly across all hidden nodes, whereas most hidden nodes were inactive in the pre-trained network. Furthermore, in the pre-trained network the representational overlap between CVCs was reduced compared to the naïve network. The pre-trained network also retained some similarity information as the representational overlap between similar CVCs, like "JEP" and "ZEP", was greater than for dissimilar CVCs, such as "JEP" and "YUG". This suggests that the pre-trained network had a better ability to generalize, i.e. notice the patterns, than the naïve network.  Most importantly, this reduction in hidden unit activation and representational overlap resulted in significantly less forgetting in the pre-trained network than the naïve network, essentially eliminating catastrophic interference. Essentially, the pre-training acted to create internal orthogonalization of the activations at the hidden layer, which reduced interference.&lt;ref name="French1999" /&gt; Thus, pre-training is a simple way to reduce catastrophic forgetting in standard backpropagation networks.

===Pseudo-recurrent networks===

French (1997) proposed the idea of a pseudo-recurrent backpropagation network in order to help reduce catastrophic interference (see Figure 2).&lt;ref name ="French1997" /&gt; In this model the network is separated into two functionally distinct but interacting sub-networks. This model is biologically inspired and is based on research from McClelland, McNaughton, and O'Reilly (1995).&lt;ref name="McClelland1995"&gt;McClelland, J., McNaughton, B. &amp; O'Reilly, R. (1995) Why there are complementary learning systems in the hippocampus and neocortex: Insights from the successes and failures of connectionist models of learning and memory. ''Psychological Review'', ''102'', 419-457.&lt;/ref&gt; In this research McClelland et al. (1995), suggested that the [[hippocampus]] and [[neocortex]] act as separable but complementary memory systems. Specifically, the hippocampus [[short term memory]] storage and acts gradually over time to transfer memories into the neocortex for [[long term memory]] storage. They suggest that the information that is stored can be "brought back" to the hippocampus during active rehearsal, reminiscence, and sleep and renewed activation is what acts to transfer the information to the neocortex over time. In the pseudo-recurrent network, one of the sub-networks acts as an early processing area, akin to the hippocampus, and functions to learn new input patters. The other sub-network acts as a final-storage area, akin to the neocortex. However, unlike in McClelland et al. (1995) model, the final-storage area sends internally generated representation back to the early processing area. This creates a recurrent network. French proposed that this interleaving of old representations with new representations is the only way to reduce radical forgetting. Since the brain would most likely not have access to the original input patterns, the patterns that would be fed back to the neocortex would be internally generated representations called ''pseudopatterns''.  These pseudopatterns are approximations of previous inputs&lt;ref name ="Robins1995"&gt;Robins, A. (1995). Catastrophic Forgetting, rehearsal and pseudorehearal. ''Connection Science'', ''7'', 123-146.&lt;/ref&gt; and they can be interleaved with the learning of new inputs. [[File:Pseudorecurrentnetwork.jpg|thumbnail|Figure 2: The architecture of a pseudo-recurrent network]]The use of these pseudopatterns could be biologically plausible as parallels between the consolidation of learning that occurs during sleep and the use of interleaved pseudopatterns. Specifically, they both serve to integrate new information with old information without disruption of the old information.&lt;ref name ="Robins1996"&gt;Robins, A. (1996). Consolidation in Neural Networks and in the Sleeping Brain. ''Connection Science'', ''8''(2), 259-276.&lt;/ref&gt; When given an input (and a teacher value) is fed into the pseudo-recurrent network would act as follows:

*When a pattern is fed from the environment (a real input), the information travels both to the early processing area and the final storage area, however the teacher nodes will inhibit the output from the final storage area
*The new pattern is learned by the early processing area by the standard backpropagation algorithm
*At the same time random input is also fed into the network and causes pseudopatterns to be generated by the final storage area
*Output from the final-storage area, in the form of pseudopatterns, will be used as a teacher for the early-processing area. In this way, the pseudopatterns are interleaved with the 'real inputs' from the environment 
*Once the new pattern and the pseudopattern are learned by the early processing area, its weights are copied to the corresponding weights in the final storage area.

When tested on sequential learning of real world patterns, categorization of edible and poisonous mushrooms, the pseudo-recurrent network was shown less interference than a standard backpropagation network. This improvement was with both memory savings and exact recognition of old patterns. When the activation patterns of the pseudo-recurrent network were investigated, it was shown that this network automatically formed semi-distributed representations. Since these types of representations involve fewer nodes being activated for each pattern, it is likely what helped to reduce interference.

Not only did the pseudo-recurrent model show reduced interference but also it models list-length and list-strength effects seen in humans. The list-length effect means that adding new items to a list harms the memory of earlier items. Like humans, the pseudo recurrent network showed a more gradual forgetting when to be trained list is lengthened. The list-strength effect means that when the strength of recognition for one item is increased, there is no effect on the recognition of the other list items. This is an important finding as other models often exhibit a decrease in the recognition of other list items when one list item is strengthened. Since the direct copying of weights from the early processing area to the final storage area does not seem highly biologically plausible, the transfer of information to the final storage area can be done through training the final storage area with pseudopatterns created by the early processing area. However, a disadvantage of the pseudo-recurrent model is that the number of hidden units in the early processing and final storage sub-networks must be identical.

=== Neural networks with self-refreshing memory ===
Following the same basic idea contributed by Robins,&lt;ref name ="Robins1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Robins1996" /&gt; Ans and Rousset (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Ans, B., &amp; Rousset, S. (1997). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0764446997824729 Avoiding catastrophic forgetting by coupling two reverberating neural networks]. ''CR Academie Science Paris, Life Sciences'', ''320'', 89-997.&lt;/ref&gt; have also proposed a two-network artificial neural architecture with ''memory self-refreshing'' that overcomes catastrophic interference when sequential learning tasks are carried out in distributed networks trained by backpropagation. The principle is to interleave, at the time when new external patterns are learned, those to-be-learned new external patterns with internally generated pseudopatterns, or 'pseudo-memories', that reflect the previously learned information. What mainly distinguishes this model from those that use classical pseudorehearsal in feedforward multilayer networks is a ''reverberating'' process that is used for generating pseudopatterns. This process which, after a number of activity re-injections from a single random seed, tends to go up to nonlinear network ''attractors'', is more suitable for optimally capturing the deep structure of previously learned knowledge than a single feedforward pass of random activation. Ans and Rousset (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Ans, B., &amp; Rousset, S. (2000). Neural networks with a self-refreshing memory: Knowledge transfer in sequential Learning tasks without catastrophic forgetting. ''Connection Science'', ''12'', 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the learning mechanism they proposed avoiding catastrophic forgetting, provides a more appropriate way to deal with knowledge transfer as measured by learning speed, ability to generalize and vulnerability to network damages. Musca, Rousset and Ans (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Musca, S. C., Rousset, S., &amp; Ans, B. (2009). Artificial neural network whispering to the brain: Nonlinear system attractors induce familiarity with never seen items. ''Connection Science'', ''21''(4), 359-377.&lt;/ref&gt; have also shown that pseudopatterns originating from an artificial reverberating neural network could induce familiarity in humans with never seen items in the way predicted by simulations conducted with a two-network artificial neural architecture. Furthermore, Ans (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Ans, B. (2004). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.98.2552&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Sequential learning in distributed neural networks without catastrophic forgetting: A single and realistic self-refreshing memory can do it]. ''Neural Information Processing-Letters and Reviews'', ''4'', 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt; has implemented a version of the self-refreshing mechanism using only one network trained by the Contrastive Hebbian Learning rule, a training rule considered as more realistic than the largely used backpropagation algorithm, but fortunately equivalent to the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Xie, X.,  &amp; Seung, H. S.  (2003). Equivalence of backpropagation and Contrastive Hebbian Learning in a layered network. ''Neural Computation'', ''15'', 441-454.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far, the different solutions to catastrophic interference that have been presented concern tasks of sequential learning involving only non-temporally ordered lists of items. But, to be credible, the self-refreshing mechanism for 'static' learning has to encompass our human ability to learn serially many temporal sequences of patterns without catastrophic interference (e.g. learning one song followed by learning a second song without forgetting the first one). This was done by Ans, Rousset, French and Musca (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Ans, B., Rousset, S., French, R. M., &amp; Musca, S. C. (2004). Self-refreshing memory in artificial neural networks: Learning temporal sequences without catastrophic forgetting. ''Connection Science'', ''16'', 71-99.&lt;/ref&gt; who have presented, in addition to simulation work, an experiment that evidences a close similarity between the behaviour of humans and the behaviour of the proposed neuromimetic architecture.

===Latent learning===

Latent Learning is a technique used by Gutstein &amp; Stump (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Gutstein and Stump (2015). [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7280416/ Reduction Of Catastrophic Forgetting With Transfer Learning And Ternary Output Codes]. In: Proceedings ''2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Nets'' (pp 1-8)&lt;/ref&gt; both to mitigate catastrophic interference and to take advantage of transfer learning. Rather than manipulating the representations for new classes used by the hidden nodes, this approach tries to train optimal representations for new classes into the output nodes. It chooses output encodings that are least likely to catastrophically interfere with existing responses.

Given a net that has learned to discriminate among one set of classes using Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC)&lt;ref&gt;Dietterich, T. G., &amp; Bakiri, G. (1995). [https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/download/10127/23985 Solving multiclass learning problems via error-correcting output codes]. ''Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research'', (pp. 263-286)&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to [[one-hot|1 hot codes]]), optimal encodings for new classes are chosen by observing the net's average responses to them. Since these average responses arose while learning the original set of classes ''without any exposure to the new classes'', they are referred to as 'Latently Learned Encodings'. This terminology borrows from the concept of [[Latent Learning]], as introduced by Tolman in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Tolman, E.C.; C.H. Honzik (1930). ""Insight" in Rats". University of California Publications in Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, this technique uses transfer learning to avoid catastrophic interference, by making a net's responses to new classes as consistent as possible with existing responses to classes already learned.

===Elastic weight consolidation===

Kirkpatrick et al. (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=James|title=Elastic Weight Consolidation|eprint=1612.00796|class=cs.LG|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated a method to train a single artificial neural network on multiple tasks using a technique called elastic weight consolidation.

===Anapoiesis===
[[Practopoietic theory]]&lt;ref name=Nikolic2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danko-nikolic.com/?smd_process_download=1&amp;download_id=724|title=Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. arXiv:1402.5332 [q-bio.NC].|author=Danko Nikolić|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that biological systems solve the problem of catastrophic interference by storing long-term memories only in a general form, not applicable to a given situation but instead loosely applicable to a class of different situations. In order to adjust the loosely applicable knowledge to the given current situation, the process of ''anapoiesis'' is applied. Anapoiesis stands for "reconstruction of knowledge"—transforming knowledge from a general form to a specific one. Practopoietic theory is founded in the [[Variety (cybernetics)|theorems]] of [[cybernetics]] and is concerned with the question of how cybernetic systems obtain their capabilities to control and act.

==Background==
The period after [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] occurred but before [[star]]s and [[galaxies]] formed is known as the "dark ages". During this time, the majority of [[matter]] in the universe is neutral hydrogen. This hydrogen has yet to be observed, but there are experiments underway to detect the [[hydrogen line]] produced during this era. The hydrogen line is produced when an [[electron]] in a neutral hydrogen [[atom]] is [[excited state|excited]] to a state where the electron and [[proton]] have aligned [[spin (physics)|spin]]s, or de-excited as the electron and proton spins go from being aligned to anti-aligned. The energy difference between these two [[hyperfine]] states is &lt;math&gt;5.9 \times 10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt; [[electron volts]], with a [[wavelength]] of 21 centimeters. At times when neutral hydrogen is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with the [[photons]] in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the neutral hydrogen and CMB are said to be "coupled", and the hydrogen line is not observable. It is only when the two temperatures differ, or decoupled, that the hydrogen line can be observed.&lt;ref name=Stiav&gt;

==Theoretical motivation==
The Big Bang produced a hot, dense, nearly [[homogeneous]] universe. As the universe expanded and cooled, [[particles]], then [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], and finally [[atoms]] formed. At a redshift of about 1100, equivalent to about 400,000 years after the [[Big Bang]], when the [[Primordial nucleosynthesis|primordial plasma]] filling the universe cooled sufficiently for [[protons]] and [[electrons]] to combine into neutral hydrogen atoms, the universe became optically thin whereby [[photons]] from this early era no longer interacted with [[matter]]. We detect these photons today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). The CMB shows that the universe was still remarkably smooth and uniform.&lt;ref name=burns/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;
 
After the protons and electrons combined to produce the first hydrogen atoms, the universe consisted of a nearly uniform, almost completely neutral, [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM) for which the dominant matter component was hydrogen gas. With no luminous sources present, these are known as the Dark Ages. Theoretical models predict that, over the next few hundred million years, gravity slowly condensed the gas into denser and denser regions, within which the first stars eventually appeared, marking Cosmic Dawn.&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;
 
As more stars formed, and the first galaxies assembled, they flooded the universe with [[Ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet photons]] capable of ionizing hydrogen gas. A few hundred million years after Cosmic Dawn, the first stars produced enough ultraviolet photons to reionize essentially all the universe’s hydrogen atoms. This Reionization era is the hallmark event of this early generation of galaxies, marking the phase transition of the IGM back to a nearly completely ionized state.&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;
 
The beginning of structural complexity in the universe constituted a remarkable transformation, but one that we have not yet investigated observationally. By pushing even farther back than the [[Hubble telescope]] can see, the truly first structures in the universe can be studied. [[Theoretical model]]s suggest that existing measurements are beginning to probe the tail end of [[Reionization]], but the first stars and galaxies, in the Dark Ages and the Cosmic Dawn, currently lie beyond our reach.&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;
 
DARE will make the first measurements of the birth of the first stars and black holes and will measure the properties of the otherwise invisible stellar populations. Such observations are essential for placing existing measurements in a proper context, and to understand how the first galaxies grew from earlier generations of structures.&lt;ref name=burns/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;

==Mission==
DARE’s approach is to measure the spectral shape of the sky-averaged, redshifted  21-cm signal over a radio bandpass of 40-120&amp;nbsp;MHz, observing the redshift range 11-35, which correlates to 80 - 420 million years after the Big Bang. DARE orbits the Moon for 3 years and takes data above the lunar farside, the only location in the inner Solar System proven to be free of human-generated radio frequency interference and any significant ionosphere.

The science instrument is mounted to a RF quiet spacecraft bus and is composed of a three-element radiometer, including electrically-short, tapered, [[Biconical antenna|biconical dipole antenna]]s, a receiver, and a digital spectrometer. The smooth frequency response of the antennas and the differential spectral calibration approach used for DARE are effective in removing the intense cosmic foregrounds so that the weak cosmic 21-cm signal can be detected.

==Similar projects==
Besides DARE, are other similar projects are proposed to also study this area such as the [[Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization]] (PAPER), [[LOFAR|Low Frequency Array]] (LOFAR), [[Murchison Widefield Array]] (MWA), [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT), and the [[Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages]] (LEDA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12186">'''Dark fermentation''' is the [[Fermentative hydrogen production|fermentative]] conversion of organic substrate to biohydrogen. It is a complex process manifested by diverse groups of [[bacteria]], involving a series of [[biochemical]] reactions using three steps similar to [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic conversion]]. Dark fermentation differs from [[photofermentation]] in that it proceeds without the presence of [[light]].

Fermentative/hydrolytic microorganisms hydrolyze complex organic polymers to monomers which are further converted to a mixture of lower-molecular-weight organic acids and alcohols by obligatory producing acidogenic bacteria.

Utilization of [[wastewater]] as a potential substrate for [[biohydrogen]] production has been drawing considerable interest in recent years especially in the dark fermentation process. Industrial wastewater as a fermentative [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production addresses most of the criteria required for substrate selection viz., availability, cost and [[biodegradability]] (Angenent, ''et al.'', 2004; Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Chemical wastewater (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'', 2007a,b), cattle wastewater (Tang, ''et al.'', 2008), dairy process wastewater (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'' 2007c, Rai et al. 2012), starch hydrolysate wastewater (Chen, ''et al.'', 2008) and designed synthetic wastewater (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'', 2007a, 2008b) have been reported to produce biohydrogen apart from [[wastewater treatment]] from dark fermentation processes using selectively enriched [[Growth medium|mixed culture]]s under acidophilic conditions. Various wastewaters viz., paper mill wastewater (Idania, ''et al.'', 2005), starch effluent (Zhang, ''et al.'', 2003), food processing wastewater (Shin ''et al.'', 2004, van Ginkel, ''et al.'', 2005), [[Home|domestic]] wastewater (Shin, ''et al.'', 2004, 2008e), rice winery wastewater (Yu ''et al.'', 2002), distillery and molasses based wastewater (Ren, ''et al.'', 2007,  Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'', 2008a), wheat straw wastes (Fan, ''et al.'', 2006) and palm oil mill wastewater (Vijayaraghavan and Ahmed, 2006) have been studied as fermentable substrates for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production along with wastewater treatment. Using wastewater as a fermentable substrate facilitates both wastewater treatment apart from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The efficiency of the dark fermentative H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production process was found to depend on pre-treatment of the mixed consortia used as a [[biocatalyst]], operating pH, and organic loading rate apart from wastewater characteristics (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'', 2007d, 2008c, d, Vijaya Bhaskar, ''et al.'', 2008d).

In spite of its advantages, the main challenge observed with fermentative H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production processes is the relatively low energy conversion efficiency from the organic source. Typical H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields range from 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;mol of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol of glucose, which results in 80-90% of the initial [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] remaining in the wastewater in the form of various volatile organic acids (VFAs) and solvents, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol. Even under optimal conditions about 60-70% of the original organic matter remains in solution. [[Bioaugmentation]] with selectively enriched [[Acidogenesis|acidogenic]] consortia to enhance H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production was also reported (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'', 2007b). Generation and accumulation of soluble acid metabolites causes a sharp drop in the system pH and inhibits the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production process. Usage of unutilized [[carbon]] sources present in acidogenic process for additional biogas production sustains the practical applicability of the process. One way to utilize/recover the remaining organic matter in a usable form is to produce additional H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by terminal integration of [[photo-fermentative]] processes of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'' 2008e, Rai et al. 2012) and methane by integrating acidogenic processes to terminal [[methanogenic]] processes.

==Chlorination disinfection byproducts ==
Chlorinated [[disinfectant|disinfection agents]] such as [[chlorine]] and [[chloramine]] are strong [[oxidizing agent]]s introduced into water in order to destroy [[pathogenic]] microbes, to oxidize taste/odor-forming compounds, and to form a [[disinfectant residual]] so water can reach the consumer tap safe from microbial contamination. These disinfectants may react with naturally present [[fulvic acid|fulvic]] and [[humic acid|humic]] acids, amino acids, and other natural organic matter, as well as iodide and bromide ions, to produce a range of DBPs such as the [[trihalomethanes]] (THMs), [[haloacetic acids]] (HAAs), [[bromate]], and [[chlorite]] (which are regulated in the US), and so-called "emerging" DBPs such as [[nitromethane|halonitromethanes]], [[acetonitrile|haloacetonitriles]], [[haloamide]]s, [[furanone|halofuranones]], [[iodo-acid]]s such as [[iodoacetic acid]], iodo-THMs ([[iodotrihalomethanes]]), [[nitrosamine]]s, and others.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;

Chloramine has become a popular disinfectant in the US, and it has been found to produce [[N-Nitrosodimethylamine|''N''-nitrosodimethylamine]] (NDMA), which is a possible human carcinogen, as well as highly [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] iodinated DBPs, such as [[iodoacetic acid]], when iodide is present in source waters.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson08&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/es801169k |title= Occurrence and Mammalian Cell Toxicity of Iodinated Disinfection Byproducts in Drinking Water |year=2008 |last1=Richardson |first1=Susan D. |last2=Fasano |first2=Francesca |last3=Ellington |first3=J.

Residual chlorine and other disinfectants may also react further within the distribution network — both by further reactions with dissolved natural organic matter and with biofilms present in the pipes. In addition to being highly influenced by the types of organic and inorganic matter in the source water, the different species and concentrations of DBPs vary according to the type of disinfectant used, the dose of disinfectant, the concentration of natural organic matter and bromide/iodide, the time since dosing (i.e. water age), temperature, and pH of the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=81–90 |doi=10.1515/REVEH.1997.12.2.81 |title=Drinking Water Chlorination By-Products And Cancer |year=1997 |last1=Koivusalo, |first1=Meri |last2=Vartiainen |first2=Terttu |journal=Reviews on Environmental Health |volume=12 |issue=2 |pmid=9273924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimming pools using chlorine have been found to contain trihalomethanes, although generally they are below current EU standard for drinking water (100 micrograms per litre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=586–99 |doi=10.1038/sj.jea.7500139 |title=Uptake of chlorination disinfection by-products; a review and a discussion of its implications for exposure assessment in epidemiological studies |year=2000 |last1=Nieuwenhuijsen |first1=Mark J. |last2=Toledano |first2=Mireille B. |last3=Elliott |first3=Paul |journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=10 |issue=6 |pmid=11140442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of trihalomethanes (mainly [[chloroform]]) of up to 0.43 ppm have been measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beech |first1=J.

Trichloramine is formed by the reaction of urea (from urine and sweat) with chlorine and gives the indoor swimming pool its distinctive odor.

==Byproducts from non-chlorinated disinfectants==
Several powerful oxidizing agents are used in disinfecting and treating drinking water, and many of these also cause the formation of DBPs. [[Ozone]], for example, produces ketones, carboxylic acids, and aldehydes, including formaldehyde.  Bromide in source waters can be converted by ozone into [[bromate]], a potent carcinogen that is regulated in the United States, as well as other brominated DBPs.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt; 

As regulations are tightened on established DBPs such as THMs and HAAs, drinking water treatment plants may switch to alternative disinfection methods. This change will alter the distribution of classes of DBP's.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;

==Occurrence==
DBPs are present in most drinking water supplies that have been subject to [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], [[chloramination]], ozonation, or treatment with chlorine dioxide. Many hundreds of DBPs exist in treated drinking water and at least 600 have been identified.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Richardson |first=Susan D. | editor-last =Nriagu | editor-first =J.O. |title=Disinfection By-Products: Formation and Occurrence of Drinking Water |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Environmental Health |volume=2 | pages=110–13| publisher=Burlington Elsevier | year=2011 |isbn=978-0-444-52273-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low levels of many of these DBPs, coupled with the analytical costs in testing water samples for them, means that in practice only a handful of DBPs are actually monitored. Increasingly it is recognized that the genotoxicities and cytotoxicities of many of the DBPs not subject to regulatory monitoring, (particularly iodinated, nitrogenous DBPs) are comparatively much higher than those DBPs commonly monitored in the developed world (THMs and HAAs).&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=955–61 |doi=10.1021/es071754h |title=Occurrence, Synthesis, and Mammalian Cell Cytotoxicity and Genotoxicity of Haloacetamides: An Emerging Class of Nitrogenous Drinking Water Disinfection Byproducts |year=2008 |last1=Plewa |first1=Michael J. |last2=Muellner |first2=Mark G. |last3=Richardson |first3=Susan D. |last4=Fasano |first4=Francesca |last5=Buettner |first5=Katherine M. |last6=Woo |first6=Yin-Tak |last7=McKague |first7=A.

The '''Eagleton Institute of Politics''' at [[Rutgers University]] was established in 1956 with an endowment from [[Florence Peshine Eagleton]] (1870–1953), and it focuses on state and national politics through education and public service.

The Institute is located at the Cook-Douglass Campus in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] and is housed at Wood Lawn, which listed is the [[New Jersey Register of Historic Places]] and [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=NJRHP&gt;{{cite web | title=New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places - Middlesex County | url= http://www.nj.gov/dep/hpo/1identify/nrsr_lists.htm | publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] - Historic Preservation Office | page= | date= | accessdate= 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Florence Peshine Eagleton was a suffragist and a founder of the New Jersey League of Women Voters who advocated women's higher education. She was one of the first women to serve as a Trustee of [[Rutgers University]]. She willed more than $1,000,000 to establish the Wells Phillips Eagleton and Florence Peshine Eagleton Foundation, which became the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. Eagleton directed that her support be applied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... for the advancement of learning in the field of practical political affairs and government [so] that a knowledge of the meaning of democracy may be increased through the education of young women and men in democratic government. ... It is my settled conviction that the cultivation of civic responsibility and leadership among the American people in the field of practical political affairs is of vital and increasing importance to our state and nation ... I make this gift especially for the development of and education for responsible leadership in civic and governmental affairs and the solution of their political problems.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Centers and program==
The Eagleton Institute of Politics has several centers and programs:
* The [[Center for American Women and Politics]] (CAWP) aims to promote greater knowledge and understanding about women's participation in politics and government and to enhance women's influence and leadership in public life.
* The Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, established in 1971, conducts several statewide public opinion surveys each year and contracts with government agencies and non-profit organizations for contract polling work.
* The Center on the American Governor seeks to promote research and discussion on the role of the governor in the United States. The Center is building an extensive virtual archive and sponsors a range of academic activities and public forums on topics and issues relating to the office of governor across the country as well as the administrations of selected holders of the office in New Jersey and other states.
* The Center for Youth Political Participation (CPPP), through research, public service, and educational programs, is dedicated to exploring civic education at the high school level and political participation among young adults. CPPP initiatives include RU Ready&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://yppp.rutgers.edu/ru-ready/about-ru-readytrade/# |title=About RU Ready |access-date=2016-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220153202/http://yppp.rutgers.edu/ru-ready/about-ru-readytrade/# |archive-date=2016-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  RU Voting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://yppp.rutgers.edu/ru-voting/about-ru-voting/# |title=About RU Voting |access-date=2016-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220151655/http://yppp.rutgers.edu/ru-voting/about-ru-voting/# |archive-date=2016-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; State House Express,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://yppp.rutgers.edu/for-teachers/state-house-express/about-state-house-express/# |title=About State House Express |access-date=2016-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220151837/http://yppp.rutgers.edu/for-teachers/state-house-express/about-state-house-express/# |archive-date=2016-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Young Elected Leaders Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://yppp.rutgers.edu/yelp/about-young-elected-leaders/# |title=About Young Elected Leaders |access-date=2016-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220153114/http://yppp.rutgers.edu/yelp/about-young-elected-leaders/# |archive-date=2016-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Darien Civic Engagement Project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://yppp.rutgers.edu/for-students/darien/# |title=Darien Civic Engagement Project |access-date=2016-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220150438/http://yppp.rutgers.edu/for-students/darien/# |archive-date=2016-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Eagleton programs and initiatives include:
* Clifford P. Case Professorship of Public Affairs — established by the university's board of governors in 1980 and named in honor of [[Clifford P. Case]], longtime U.S. senator from New Jersey. The holder of the professional typically visits one of Rutgers' three campuses for a few days each year. Past holders have included [[George J. Mitchell]], [[Olympia Snowe]], [[Lee H. Hamilton]], [[Chuck Hagel]], [[J. William Fulbright]], and [[Gerald R. Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eagleton.rutgers.edu/programs/case/ Centers/Programs: Clifford P. Case Professorship of Public Affairs], Eagleton Institute of Politics, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arthur J. Holland Program on Ethics in Government — established in 1989 and named after [[Arthur John Holland]], longtime [[mayor of Trenton]]. The program organizes an annual lecture at the university as well as workshop at the New Jersey League of Municipalities' [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] conference. The program also awards a stipend "to support a student undertaking a project designed to promote ethics in government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eagleton.rutgers.edu/programs/ethicsingovernmt/index.php Centers/Programs: Arthur J.

'''Edaphic''' is a nature related to [[soil]].  Edaphic qualities may characterize the soil itself, including drainage, [[soil texture|texture]], or [[soil chemistry|chemical properties]] such as [[soil pH]]. Edaphic may also characterize [[organism]]s, such as plant [[Community (ecology)|communities]], where it specifies their relationships with soil. '''Edaphic endemics''' are plants or animals [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to areas of a specific [[soil type]].

Edaphic [[plant communities]] include:
* Sandy soils: plant communities distinct to sandy, acidic, nutrient-poor soils include the tropical [[heath forest]]s and [[restingas]] and temperate [[pine barrens]].
* Ultramafic soils: plant communities distinct to soils derived from magnesium and iron-rich [[ultramafic rock]]s include ultramafic woodlands and ultramafic barrens of the [[Appalachian mountains]] and piedmont, the "wet maquis" of the [[New Caledonia rain forests]], the ultramafic forests of [[Mount Kinabalu]] and other peaks in [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[serpentine soil]] plant communities of [[California]].

[[Personalized medicine]] involves [[Medicine|medical treatments]] based on the characteristics of individual patients, including their [[medical history]], [[family history]], and [[genetics]]. Although personal genetic information is becoming increasingly important in healthcare, there is a lack of sufficient education in [[medical genetics]] among physicians and the general public.&lt;ref name="Lamb2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamb | first1 = N.

==Training==
As of 2009, the majority of primary care physicians did not have adequate training in genetics or [[genomics]].&lt;ref name="Salari2009"/&gt; Although medical school curricula typically include medical genetics, fewer than half offer a standalone course, and the emphasis on practical applications is weak.&lt;ref name="Lamb2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salari2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thurston2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thurston | first1 = V.

As described in the preceding section, in some courses on personalized medicine, students have been able to study their personal genetic information. For the Stanford course, which was designed for graduate and medical students, a review was conducted in 2009-2010 by a “joint genotyping task force” including research and clinical faculty, biomedical ethicists, genetic counselors, and legal counsel.&lt;ref name="Salari2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature2010"/&gt; The recommendations adopted included: making genetic testing optional (with instructors blinded to the choice of the students), strict data confidentiality (only aggregate data was made available during discussions), incorporation of lectures discussing issues related to personal genotyping, and availability of genetic counseling to students if necessary.&lt;ref name="Salari2011"/&gt;

Baron '''Ernst Friedrich von Liphart''' or '''Earnest Lipgart''' (1847–1932) was a painter, a noted art expert and art collector from what is now [[Tartu]] in Estonia. After living for a time in Florence, he moved to France and then to Russia, where he was a curator at the [[Hermitage Museum]].

==Life==
Liphart was born in [[Kambja Parish]] in [[Tartu County]] in 1847. His father, [[Karl Eduard von Liphart]], came from a [[Baltic nobility|noble]] [[Baltic German]] family that was based at [[Raadi Manor]] in what is now Estonia. His family were members of the national intelligentsia and owned a significant art collection.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://www.erm.ee/en/visit/raadi/history-of-manor History of Manor], Eesti. Rahva Muuseum, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Liphart von ernest friedrich-portrait of tsar nicholas ii.jpg|left|thumb|One of Liphart's portraits of Tsar Nicholas II]]

==Travels in Spain and Italy==
Liphart accompanied his father on his travels, starting in 1860.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; In 1862, they moved to Florence because of Liphart's weak health. His father continued his interest in art, which was financed and supported by Grand Duchess [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819–1876)|Maria Nikolaevna]], the daughter of [[Tsar Nicholas I]].&lt;ref name=reh/&gt; Ernst studied painting under [[Franz von Lenbach]] before travelling to Spain with him to study paintings from 1866 to 1868.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; This trip was funded by Lenbach's patron [[Adolf Friedrich von Schack|Count Schack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iment.com/maida/family/mother/vicars/ernstdeliphart.htm Ernst Friederich von Liphart], Master Paintings, retrieved 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris==
Liphart was disinherited by his father in 1873 after he converted to Roman Catholicism to marry Luisa Juan, a Florentine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/baron-ernst-friedrich-von-liphart Baron Ernst Friedrich von Liphart], RusArtNet.com, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; before they moved to Paris. He studied under [[Gustave Boulanger]] and [[Jules Joseph Lefebvre]] at the [[Académie Julian]] whilst illustrating the leading magazines ''La vie élégante'' and ''La vie moderne''.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt;

==Saint Petersburg==
[[File:Menu for Nicholas II coronation by Lipgart.jpg|thumb|Menu for Nicholas II's coronation by Lipgart]]
In 1886 Liphart moved to [[Saint Petersburg]], where he was a successful artist, painting a portrait of [[Tsar Nicholas II]], as well as decorating the curtain and ceiling of the theatre of the [[Moika Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intertimes.ru/?type=spec&amp;id=21 Yusupov Palace], intertimes.ru, retrieved 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and several imperial palaces.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; Liphart also took on more unusual requests, including the menu for the Tsar's coronation in 1896 and then painting 100 figures on a piano, telling the story of [[Orpheus]]. The piano was a present from the Tsar to Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nicholasandalexandra.com/piano.html Grand Piano], Liphart, 1898, nicholasandalexandra.com, retrieved 4 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernst's father died in [[Florence]] in 1904. After his death his art collection was moved back to Estonia, where it was combined with his family's collection at [[Raadi Manor]].&lt;ref name=reh&gt;[http://www.rehs.com/printimage.html?image_no=28 The Environs of Plymouth], rehs.com, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Liphart's home was still in Russia, where he taught at the Drawing School of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] in Saint Petersburg in the 1890s, where his students included [[Eugene Lanceray]].&lt;ref name=bown243&gt;Bown, Matthew Cullerne. "Art Under Stalin", page 243.

Liphart was appointed to several Russian learned societies and he became the curator of paintings at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=herm/&gt; He held the position until 1929. Liphart continued his father's interest in Leonardo da Vinci. Liphart arranged for the museum to purchase [[Madonna and Child with Flowers]]&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; which he had correctly attributed to da Vinci.&lt;ref name=herm/&gt; Liphart also notably identified the painting of [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul (El Greco)|Saint Peter and Saint Paul]] to be by [[El Greco]].&lt;ref name=herm&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_8.html Directors of the Imperial Hermitage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227012744/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_8.html |date=February 27, 2014 }}, Hermitage Museum, retrieved 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liphart art collection that had been at the family residence was moved after the [[Russian Revolution]]. The collection appeared first in a sale in [[Copenhagen]] in 1920. Raadi Manor was used by the [[Estonian National Museum]] in 1922&amp;ndash;4 after the manor came under the management of the [[University of Tartu]].&lt;ref name=reh/&gt; The graphic art collection created by the Liphart family came into the possession of [[Tartu University]] in the 1920s. The university's art museum still has the collection, which includes examples of Japanese woodcuts as well as noted prints by [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[William Hogarth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kunstimuuseum.ut.ee/eng/graphic.html Graphic Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101050527/http://kunstimuuseum.ut.ee/eng/graphic.html |date=2014-01-01 }}, University of Tartu Art Museum, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 he was evicted from his house and his daughter was executed for harbouring a [[White movement#Structure|White Army]] officer. Before he died, Liphart wrote a novel and a play.&lt;ref name=rus&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/baron-ernst-friedrich-von-liphart Baron Ernst Friedrich von Liphart], RusArtNet.com, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the three great '''evolutionary faunas''' of marine animals from the [[Cambrian]] to the present (that is, the entire [[Phanerozoic]]) was introduced by [[Jack Sepkoski]] in 1981 using [[factor analysis]] of the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. J. Sepkosi|title=A factor analysis description of the Phanerozoic marine fossil record|journal=Paleobiology|volume=7|year=1981|pages=3–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; An evolutionary fauna typically displays an increase in [[biodiversity]] following a [[Logistic function|logistic curve]] followed by extinctions (although the Modern Fauna has not yet exhibited the diminishing part of the curve).

==Cambrian fauna==
Fauna I, known as "Cambrian", described as a "[[Trilobite]]-rich assemblage", encompasses the bulk of the fossils which first appeared in the [[Cambrian explosion]], and largely became extinct in the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction event]]. This fauna comprises trilobites, [[small shelly fossil]]s (grouped by Sepkoski into "Polychaeta", but including [[cribricyathid]]s, [[coleolid]]s, and [[volborthellid]]s), [[Monoplacophora]], [[Inarticulata|inarticulate brachiopods]] and hyoliths.&lt;ref&gt;Sepkoski, J. J. (1981). A Factor Analytic Description of the Phanerozoic Marine Fossil Record. Paleobiology, 7(1), 36–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paleozoic fauna==
Fauna II, known as "Paleozoic", described as a "[[Brachiopod]]-rich assemblage", accounts for most of the fossils appearing in the [[Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event]], and largely became extinct in the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]]. This fauna is marked by fossils of the following classes: [[Articulata (Brachiopoda)|Articulata]], [[Crinoidea]], [[Ostracoda]], [[Cephalopoda]], [[Anthozoa]], [[Stenolaemata]], [[Stelleroidea]].

==Modern fauna==
Fauna III, known as "Modern", described as a [[Mollusc]]-rich assemblage", arose largely in the [[Mesozoic-Cenozoic Radiation]], still in progress.The following classes are included: [[Gastropoda]], [[Bivalvia]], [[Osteichthyes]], [[Malacostraca]], [[Echinoidea]], [[Gymnolaemata]], [[Demospongiae]], [[Chondrichthyes]].

==Kindred concepts==
In the mid-19th century, John Phillips suggested three great systems: Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Caenozoic. Writing after Sepkoski, Brenchley and Harper suggested that there were two early evolutionary faunas before the three of Sepkoski: Ediacaran and Tomottian. They also point out similarities with four "evolutionary terrestrial plant floras": Early Vascular, Pteridophytes, Gymnospores, Angiospores; and three "evolutionary terrestrial tetrapod faunas": "Megadynasty I (Carboniferous-early Permian)" "primitive amphibians and reptiles, most notably ... ''Dimetrodon''", "Megadynasty II (early Permian-mid-Triassic)" "mammal-like therapsids", and "Megadynasty III (late Triassic-Cretaceous)" "included the age of the dinosaurs".

The expression '''fortepiano''' (sometimes called '''forte piano''') is a sudden [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic]] change used in a [[Sheet music|musical score]], usually with the abbreviation {{serif|'''''fp'''''}}, to designate a section of music in which the music should be played loudly (''forte''), then immediately softly (''piano'').&lt;ref&gt;Collins Encyclopedia of Music {{ISBN|0-907486-50-9}} Page 217&lt;/ref&gt;  The word is of [[Italian language|Italian]] etymology literally translated as 'loudsoft'.

== Examples ==

Beethoven's [[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 8]] begins with a ''fortepiano'':

{{For|identities defined by to whom one is romantically or sexually attracted|sexual identity|sexual orientation}}

'''Gender identity''' is the personal sense of one's own [[gender]].&lt;ref name="MorrowMessinger"&gt;''Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression in Social Work Practice'', edited by Deana F. Morrow and Lori Messinger (2006, {{ISBN|0231501862}}), page 8: "Gender identity refers to an individual's personal sense of identity as masculine or feminine, or some combination thereof."&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity can correlate with [[assigned sex]] at birth, or can differ from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions|title=Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Definitions - Human Rights Campaign|first=Human Rights|last=Campaign|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's [[social identity]] in relation to other members of society.&lt;ref&gt;V. M. Moghadam, ''Patriarchy and the politics of gender in modernising societies'', in ''International Sociology'', 1992: "All societies have gender systems."&lt;/ref&gt; In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females,&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{citation| last1= Carlson| first1= Neil R.| last2= Heth| first2= C.

(G. O. MacKenzie, ''Transgender Nation'' (1994, {{ISBN|0879725966}}), page 43.) — "There are records of males and females crossing over throughout history and in virtually every culture. It is simply a naturally occurring part of all societies." (Charles Zastrow, ''Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People'' (2013, {{ISBN|128554580X}}), page 234, quoting the North Alabama Gender Center.)&lt;/ref&gt; some of those people are [[transgender]], [[Genderqueer|genderqueer or non-binary]]. There are some societies that have [[third gender]] categories.

Core gender identity is usually formed by age three.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender, power, and communication in human relationships|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1995|pages=366 pages|accessdate=June 3, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LyMo1RUJwj0C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=Gender,%20power,%20and%20communication%20in%20human%20relationships|isbn=978-0805814040|author1=Pamela J.

Kaufman }}&lt;/ref&gt; After age three, it is extremely difficult to change,&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt; and attempts to reassign it can result in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; Both biological and social factors have been suggested to influence its formation.

==Age of formation==
There are several theories about how and when gender identity forms, and studying the subject is difficult because children's [[Language acquisition|lack of language]] requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"&gt;Boles, 2013. Pages 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt; John Money suggested children might have awareness of, and attach some significance to gender, as early as 18 months to two years; Lawrence Kohlberg argues that gender identity does not form until age three.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age three.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A few authorities say it forms between ages 3-4 rather than precisely at age 3, e.g. George J. Bryjak and Michael P. Soraka, ''Sociology: Cultural Diversity in a Changing World'' (ed. Karen Hanson), Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1997; 209-245&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, children can make firm statements about their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; (such as dolls and painting for girls, and tools and rough-housing for boys),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bates Doob, ''Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society''&lt;/ref&gt; although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender.&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; After age three, core gender identity is extremely difficult to change,&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt; and attempts to reassign it can result in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Coleman, ''Developmental stages of the coming out process'', in ''Journal of homosexuality'', 1982: "Core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 (Money &amp; Ehrhardt, 1972). This is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria."&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity refinement extends into the fourth&lt;ref name="Kleeman"&gt;J. A. Kleeman, ''The establishment of core gender identity in normal girls. I.(a) Introduction;(b) Development of the ego capacity to differentiate'', in the ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 1971: "Though gender identity formation continues into young adulthood and core gender identity establishment extends into the fourth year and possibly longer, core gender identity is fairly firmly formed by age 3[.]"&lt;/ref&gt; to sixth years of age,&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein MT, Zucker KJ, Dixon SD.

Martin and Ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages: (1) as toddlers and preschoolers, children learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized aspects of gender; (2) around the ages of 5–7 years, identity is consolidated and becomes rigid; (3) after this "peak of rigidity," fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C. | last2 = Ruble | first2 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Children's Search for Gender Cues Cognitive Perspectives on Gender Development | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13| issue = 2|pages = 67–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Newmann breaks it down into four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning [[gender role]] standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming gender preference.&lt;ref name="Newmann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newmann|first=Barbara|title=Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781111344665|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTY_7osGmqUC|date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UN agencies, discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics, such as gender and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors influencing formation==

===Nature vs. nurture===
{{Main|Nature versus nurture}}

Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. In particular, the extent to which it is determined by socialization (environmental factors) versus innate (biological) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology, known as "nature versus nurture". Both factors are thought to play a role. Biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"&gt;''Effects of male sex hormones on gender identity, sexual behavior, and cognitive function'', ''Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao, Yi Xue Ban'' (''Journal of Central South University, Medical Sciences''), April 2006, 31(2):149-61&lt;/ref&gt; While genetic makeup also influences gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not inflexibly determine it.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Golombok, Robyn Fivush, ''Gender Development'' (1994, {{ISBN|0521408628}}), page 44: "When assigned and raised as boys, these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role, showing that a Y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction."&lt;/ref&gt;

Social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other influential people in a child's life.&lt;ref name="Henslin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of Sociology|first=James M.|last=Henslin|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|pages=65–67, 240|isbn=978-0-536-94185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles, they are more likely to behave in the same way, matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/factors-influencing-gender-identity/|title=Factors Influencing Gender Identity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Language also plays a role: children, while learning a language, learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Michael, "Cultural Identity, Language Identity, Gender Identity", "The English Academy of South Africa", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[social learning theory]] posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way,&lt;ref name=myers&gt;Myers, David G. (2008). ''Psychology''. New York: Worth.&lt;/ref&gt; thus being shaped by the people surrounding them through trying to imitate and follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C.

A well-known example in the nature versus nurture debate is the case of [[David Reimer]], otherwise known as "John/Joan". As a baby, Reimer went through a faulty circumcision, losing his male genitalia. Psychologist John Money convinced Reimer's parents to raise him as a girl. Reimer grew up as a girl, dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys, but did not feel like a girl. After he tried to commit suicide at age 13, he was told that he had been born with male genitalia, which he underwent surgery to reconstruct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781308211503|pages=368|edition=6}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This response went against Money's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Carol |author2=Diane Ruble |author3=Joel Szkrybalo |title=Cognitive Theories of Early Gender Development |journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2002 |volume=128|issue=6 |pages=903–913|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.128.6.903 |pmid=12405137|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.3216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological factors===
Several prenatal, biological factors, including genes and hormones, may affect gender identity.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Shuvo|title=Gender Identity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/917990-overview|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biochemical theory of gender identity suggests that people acquire gender identities through such factors rather than socialization.

Hormonal influences are also complex; [[Sexual differentiation in humans|sex-determining hormones]] are produced at an early stage of foetal development,&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke, ''In Pursuit Of Difference, scientific studies of women and men'', in ''The Gender and Science Reader'', page 310&lt;/ref&gt; and if prenatal hormone levels are altered, phenotype progression may be altered as well, and the natural predisposition of the brain toward one sex may not match the genetic make-up of the fetus or its external sexual organs.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hines|first=Melissa|date=2017-02-02|title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|volume=32|issue=2|pages=170–182|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006|issn=0091-3022| pmc=3296090 |pmid=21333673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hormones may affect differences between males' and females' verbal and spatial abilities, memory, and aggression; prenatal hormone exposure affects how the hypothalamus regulates hormone secretion later in life, with "women's sex hormones usually follow[ing] a monthly cycle [while] men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke suggests that during the early stage of fetal development, specific hormones will enter the brain and “permanently affect how the hypothalamus works. As before, high levels of hormones known as androgens will stop the hypothalamus from ever organizing hormone cycles. If there are low levels, then it will be cyclic.” This early influence on brain determines the different frequency of hormone secretion later in male or female’s life. “Obviously, women’s sex hormones usually follow a monthly cycle,” while “men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern.” {{cite book|last=Birke|first=Lynda|title=The Gender and Science Reader|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study on the gender identity outcomes of female-raised [[46,XY]] persons with [[penile agenesis]], [[cloacal exstrophy]] of the bladder, or penile [[ablation]], found that 78% of the study subjects were living as female, as opposed to 22% who decided to initiate a sex change to male in line with their genetic sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=423–38 |pmid=16010465 |doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4342-9 |title=Gender identity outcome in female-raised 46,XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile ablation |last=Meyer-Bahlburg |first=HF |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study concludes: "The findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood, but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens."

Research suggests that the same hormones that promote differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity.

In 1955, John Money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;J. Money, J. G. Hampson, and J. L. Hampson, ''An examination of some basic sexual concepts'', 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GDDSD"&gt;A. L. C. de Vries, et al., ''Gender Dysphoria and Disorders of Sex Development'' (2013, {{ISBN|1461474418}})&lt;/ref&gt; Money's hypothesis has since been discredited,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling, ''Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construct''&lt;/ref&gt; but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, factors such as the absence of a father, a mother's wish for a daughter, or parental reinforcement patterns were suggested as influences; more recent theories suggesting that parental psychopathology might partly influence gender identity formation have received only minimal empirical evidence,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; with a 2004 article noting that "solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Swaab, ''Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation'', in ''Gynecological Endocrinology'', 2004: "...direct effects of testosterone on the developing fetal brain are of major importance for the development of male gender identity and male heterosexual orientation. Solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. C. Wallien, ''Psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the attitudes of the child's parents may affect the child's gender identity, although evidence is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;M Weinraub, LP Clemens, A Sockloff, T Ethridge, ''The development of sex role stereotypes in the third year: relationships to gender labeling, gender identity, sex-types toy preference, and family characteristics'', in ''Child Development'', 1984: "Previous investigators have failed to observe a relationship between parental attitudes and children's early sex role acquisition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles.&lt;ref name="Oswalt"/&gt; Recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities, as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine, feminine, or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine.&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;{{cite book|last=Spade|first =Joan|title=The Kaleidoscope of Gender|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=978-1-4129-7906-1|pages= 177–184|date =2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Emily Kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items, activities, or attributes that were considered feminine, such as domestic skills, nurturance, and empathy.&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; Research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity,&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; with Kane stating that "the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options, separating boys from girls, devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls, and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity."&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt;

Many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born, after determining the child's sex through technology such as [[ultrasound]]. The child thus arrives to a gender-specific name, games, and even ambitions.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Once the child's sex is determined, most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman, fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents.

When considering the parents' social class, lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles, where the father works and the mother, who may only work out of financial necessity, still takes care of the household. However, middle-class "professional" couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology. These different views on gender from a child's parents can shape the child's understanding of gender as well as the child's development of gender.&lt;ref name="Halpern" /&gt;

Within a study conducted by Hillary Halpern&lt;ref name="Halpern"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Hillary Paul|title=Parents' Gender Ideology and Gendered Behavior as Predictors of Children's Gender-Role Attitudes: A Longitudinal Exploration|journal=Sex Roles|volume=74|issue=11–12|pages=527–542|doi=10.1007/s11199-015-0539-0|pmid=27445431|pmc=4945126|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was hypothesized, and proven, that parent behaviors, rather than parent beliefs, regarding gender are better predictors for a child's attitude on gender. It was concluded that a mother's behavior was especially influential on a child's assumptions of the child's own gender. For example, mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles. No correlation was found between a father's behavior and his children's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender. It was concluded, however, that fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children, especially sons, who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender.

In recent decades it has become possible to [[sex reassignment surgery|reassign sex surgically]]. Some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see [[transsexual]] for some of the possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity.

==History and definitions==

===Definitions===
The terms ''gender identity'' and ''core gender identity'' were first used with their current meaning — one's personal experience of one's own gender&lt;ref name="MorrowMessinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101"&gt;Boles, 2013. Page 101: "Gender identity is the individual's personal and private experience of his/her gender."&lt;/ref&gt; — sometime in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=GID&gt;"The term 'gender identity' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. ... gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness." {{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of the Psychology of Women and Gender'' (2004, {{ISBN|0471653578}}), page 102: "''Gender identity'' was introduced into the professional lexicon by Hooker and Stoller almost simultaneously in the early 1960s (see Money, 1985). For example, Stoller (1964) used the slightly different term ''core gender identity''..."&lt;/ref&gt; To this day they are usually used in that sense,&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the [[sexual orientation]] and [[sexual identity]] categories ''[[gay]]'', ''[[lesbian]]'' and ''[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brym, Roberts, Lie, Rytina. "Sociology". Nelson Education Ltd., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early medical literature===
In late-19th-century medical literature, women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called "inverts", and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning, and a "dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework". During the mid 1900s, doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children, which meant that gender behaviors that were not part of the norm would be punished and changed. The aim of this therapy was to push children back to their "correct" gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender.&lt;ref name = Padawer&gt;{{cite news|last=Padawer|first=Ruth|title=What's So Bad About a Boy Who Wants to Wear a Dress?| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/magazine/whats-so-bad-about-a-boy-who-wants-to-wear-a-dress.html | accessdate = October 29, 2012|work =[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freud and Jung's views===
In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] presented his theory of [[psychosexual development]] in ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the [[phallic stage]], at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an [[Oedipus complex]] where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses.&lt;ref name=myers/&gt; In 1913, [[Carl Jung]] proposed the [[Electra complex]] as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freud | first1 = Sigmund | year = 1931 | title = Female Sexuality | url = | journal = The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud | volume = 21 | issue = | page = 229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and 1960s===
During the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of [[homosexuality]] (which was viewed as a [[mental disorder]] at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] for the study of [[intersex]] and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst [[Robert Stoller]] generalized many of the findings of the project in his book ''Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity'' (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term ''gender identity'' to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] in 1963. Behavioral psychologist [[John Money]] was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins Medical School]]'s Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an [[interactionist]] theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book ''Man and Woman, Boy and Girl'' (1972) became widely used as a [[college textbook]], although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haraway |first=Donna |authorlink=Donna Haraway |year=1991 |title=Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature |page=133 |publisher=[[Free Association Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-90386-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fixing Sex|Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]] by Katrina Karkazis, Duke University Press, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butler's views===
In the late 1980s, [[Judith Butler]] began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity, and in 1990, she published ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity]]'', introducing the concept of [[gender performativity]] and arguing that both sex and gender are constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |year=1990 |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |pages=front/backmatter |publisher=[[Routledge Classic]] |location=London |isbn=978-0415389556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present views==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}&lt;!--also needs expansion--&gt;

===Medical field===
{{As of|2018}}, there is some changing of views and new discrepancies about the best way to deal with gender nonconformity. Medical practitioners, as well as an increasing number of parents, generally no longer support or believe in the idea of [[conversion therapy]],&lt;ref name="nymag-7feb2016"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=How the Fight Over Transgender Kids Got a Leading Sex Researcher Fired|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html|accessdate=April 25, 2017|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now widely discredited as unethical and ineffective.&lt;ref name="The Guardian - prayer and pain"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tom Dart |title=Prayer and pain: why gay conversion therapy is still legal despite dangers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/gay-conversion-therapy-republican-party-platform |accessdate=9 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=July 15, 2016 |ref=Prayer_and_pain |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stonewall - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Conversion Therapy |url=https://www.stonewall.org.uk/campaign-groups/conversion-therapy |website=Stonewall |publisher=Stonewall |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=stonewall_conversion|date=2015-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies, as well as the [[NHS]], have concluded that conversion therapy to 'cure' sexual orientation is dangerous and work is being done to extend this position to include gender identity.&lt;ref name="MOU - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK |url=https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Memorandum-of-understanding-on-conversion-therapy.pdf |website=www.pyschotherapy.org |publisher=UKCP - UK Council for Psychotherapy |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=MOU_CT |date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are still a number of clinicians who continue to believe that there should be interventions for gender nonconforming children. They believe that stereotypical gender-specific toys and games will encourage children to behave in their traditional gender roles.&lt;ref name="Padawer"/&gt;

[[Transsexual]] self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their [[primary sexual characteristics]], secondary characteristics, or both, because they feel they will be more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, [[sex reassignment surgery]] is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|title=Sex and Gender are Different: Sexual Identity and Gender Identity are Different|journal=Clinical Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=7|issue=3|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2002-sex-and-gender.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, it was decided under the Affordable Care Act that [[health insurance exchange]]s would have the ability to collect demographic information on gender identity and sexual identity through optional questions, to help policymakers better recognize the needs of the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Kellan|title=FAQ: Collecting Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Data|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2012/10/16/41620/faq-collecting-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-data/|publisher=Center for American Progress|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder===
[[Gender dysphoria]] (previously called "gender identity disorder" or GID in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant [[dysphoria]] (discontent) with the sex they were assigned at birth and/or the gender roles associated with that sex:&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Identity Disorder | Psychology Today." Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness Find a Therapist. Psychology Today, 24 Oct. 2005. Web. 17 Dec. 2010. http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/gender-identity-disorder.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100306075726/http://www.genderdysphoria.org/genderdysphoria_medical.html Gender Dysphoria Organization Research and Education - About Gender Dysphoria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine."&lt;ref name="GID" /&gt; The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder can be made, and the disorder is further subdivided into specific diagnoses based on age, for example [[gender identity disorder in children]] (for children who experience gender dysphoria).

The concept of gender identity appeared in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in its third edition, [[DSM-III]] (1980), in the form of two [[mental disorder|psychiatric diagnoses]] of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the [[DSM-III-R]], added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.&lt;ref name="Historical Note"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zucker | first1 = KJ | last2 = Spitzer | first2 = RL  |date=Jan–Feb 2005 | title = Was the gender identity disorder of childhood diagnosis introduced into DSM-III as a backdoor maneuver to replace homosexuality?

The authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a [[mental disorder]], speculating that certain DSM revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder. This remains controversial,&lt;ref name="Historical Note"/&gt; although the vast majority of today's mental health professionals follow and agree with the current DSM classifications.

===International human rights law===
[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on the application of [[international human rights law]], provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person's deeply felt internal and individual [[experience]] of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Principle 3 states that "Each person’s self-defined [...] gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity."&lt;ref&gt;[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], ''Principle 3. The Right to recognition before the law''&lt;/ref&gt; and Principle 18 states that "Notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary, a person's sexual orientation and gender identity are not, in and of themselves, medical conditions and are not to be treated, cured or suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;The Yogyakarta Principles, ''Principle 18. Protection from medical abuse''&lt;/ref&gt; Relating to this principle, the "Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles" observed that "Gender identity differing from that assigned at birth, or socially rejected [[gender expression]], have been treated as a form of [[mental illness]]. The pathologization of difference has led to gender-transgressive children and adolescents being confined in psychiatric institutions, and subjected to aversion techniques — including [[electroshock therapy]] — as a 'cure'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles, page 43] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf |date=November 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Yogyakarta Principles in Action" says "it is important to note that while 'sexual orientation' has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries, 'gender identity' or 'gender identity disorder' often remains in consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ypinaction.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Activists_Guide_English_nov_14_2010.pdf|title=Activist's Guide to the Yogyakarta Principles, p. 100|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Principles influenced the [[LGBT rights at the United Nations|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]]
In 2015, gender identity was part of a Supreme Court case in the United States called Obergefell v Hodges  in which marriage was no longer restricted between man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-binary gender identities==
{{See also|Gender binary|Genderqueer|Third gender}}
Some people, and some societies, do not construct gender as a [[gender binary|binary]] in which everyone is either a boy or a girl, or a man or a woman. Those who exist outside the binary fall under the umbrella terms ''non-binary'' or ''[[genderqueer]]''. Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from "man" and "woman." These are often referred to as ''[[third gender]]s''.

===Fa'afafine===
{{Main|Fa'afafine}}
In some [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] societies, [[fa'afafine]] are considered to be a third gender. They are anatomically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically feminine. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (''see references''), fa'afafine in [[Samoa]] at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;Sua'ali'i, Tamasailau, "[[Samoa]]ns and Gender: Some Reflections on Male, Female and Fa'afafine Gender Identities", in: ''Tangata O Te Moana Nui: The Evolving Identities of Pacific Peoples in [[Aotearoa]]/[[New Zealand]]'', Palmerston North (NZ): Dunmore Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-86469-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Johanna|title=Paradise Lost?

===Hijras===
{{Main|Hijra (South Asia)}}
In some cultures of [[Asia]], a [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically [[male]] or [[intersex]], but some are anatomically [[female]]. The hijra form a third gender role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes [[prostitute]]s, or long-term sexual partners with men. Hijras can be compared to [[transvestism|transvestites]] or [[drag queen]]s of contemporary western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khanith===
{{Main|Khanith}}
The [[khanith]] form an accepted third gender in [[Oman]]. The khanith are [[male]] [[homosexual]] [[prostitute]]s whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, and they often do at [[wedding]]s or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their [[society]], khaniths can marry women, proving their [[masculinity]] by consummating the [[marriage]]. Should a [[divorce]] or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-spirit identities===
{{Main|Two-Spirit}}
&lt;!--section needs slight expansion--&gt;
Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous North American Nations]] had more than two gender roles. Those who belong to the additional gender categories, beyond [[cisgender]] man and woman, are now often collectively termed "two-spirit" or "two-spirited." There are parts of the community that take "two-spirit" as a category over an identity itself, preferring to identify with culture or Nation-specific gender terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Sarah|year=2016|title=An Introduction to the Health of Two-Spirit People: Historical, contemporary and emergent issues|url=http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|journal=National Collaborative Centre Aboriginal Health|volume=|pages=|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202004508/http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martian geysers''' (or '''{{chem|CO|2}} jets''') are putative sites of small gas and dust eruptions that occur in the [[Planum Australe|south polar region]] of [[Mars]] during the spring thaw. "Dark dune spots" and "spiders" – or araneiforms &lt;ref name=Portyankina2014 &gt;{{cite journal|title=Araneiform|journal=Encyclopedia of Planetary Landforms |page=1 |date=2014|first=Ganna|last=Portyankina|doi= 10.1007/978-1-4614-9213-9_540-1|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-9213-9_540-1|isbn=978-1-4614-9213-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – are the two most visible types of features ascribed to these eruptions.

They are unlike any terrestrial geological phenomenon. The reflectance ([[albedo]]), shapes and unusual spider appearance of these features have stimulated a variety of hypotheses about their origin, ranging from differences in frosting reflectance, to explanations involving biological processes. However, all current geophysical models assume some sort of jet or [[geyser]]-like activity on Mars.&lt;ref name=Piqueux2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Manrubia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kieffer2000 &gt;{{Cite journal|first=H.

The name 'spiders' was coined by [[Malin Space Science Systems]] personnel, the developers of the camera. One of the first and most interesting spider photos was found by Greg Orme in October 2000.&lt;ref name=Orme&gt;{{cite journal|title=Marsbugs |journal=The Electronic Astrobiology Newsletter |date=9 June 2003 |first=Greg M. |last=Orme |author2=Peter K.

The first years' surveillance showed that during the following Martian years, 70% of the spots appear at exactly the same place, and a preliminary statistical study obtained between September 1999 and March 2005, indicated that dark dune spots and spiders are related phenomena as functions of the cycle of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) condensing as “[[dry ice]]” and sublimating.&lt;ref name=LPS2006 /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It was also initially suggested that the dark spots were simply warm patches of bare ground, but thermal imaging during 2006 revealed that these structures were as cold as the ice that covers the area,&lt;ref name=2006-100 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LPS2006 /&gt;  indicating they were a thin layer of dark material lying on top of the ice and kept chilled by it.&lt;ref name=2006-100 /&gt;  However, soon after their first detection, they were discovered to be negative topographical features – i.e. radial troughs or channels of what today are thought to be geyser-like vent systems.&lt;ref name=Piqueux2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Manrubia /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kieffer2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kieffer2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Portyankina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clathrate"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hugh2006 /&gt;

[[File:Darkdune spots emanating from Martian Spiders.jpg|thumb|200px|Dark sediment spots apparently emanating from 'spider' formations.]]
The geysers' two most prominent features (dark dune spots and spider channels) appear at the beginning of the Martian spring on dune fields covered with carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 'dry ice'), mainly at the ridges and slopes of the dunes; by the beginning of winter, they disappear. Dark spots' shape is generally round, on the slopes it is usually elongated, sometimes with streams—possibly of water—that accumulate in pools at the bottom of the dunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual change of Martian DDS-seepages|journal=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVI |date=2005|first=A.|last=Horváth|author2=Kereszturi, Á. |author3=Bérczi, Sz. |display-authors=etal|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1128.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=24 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andras &gt;{{cite journal|title=Probable Evidences of Recent Biological Activity on Mars: Appearance and Growing of Dark Dune Spots in the South Polar Region|journal=32nd Annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Houston, Texas, abstract no.1543|date=12–16 March 2001|first=Tibor|last=Gánti |author2=András Horváth |author3=Szaniszló Bérczi |author4=Albert Gesztesi |author5=Eörs Szathmáry|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2001/pdf/1543.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dark dune spots are typically 15 to 46 metres (50 to 150 feet) wide and spaced several hundred feet apart.&lt;ref name=2006-100 /&gt;  The size of spots varies, and some are as small as 20 m across,&lt;ref name=Malin1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Planetary &gt;{{Cite journal |title=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXIII - Morphological Analysis of the Dark Dune Spots on Mars: New Aspects in Biological Interpretation| editors=A.

Time-lapsed imagery performed by NASA confirms the apparent ejection of dark material following the radial growth of spider channels in the ice.&lt;ref name=2006-100 /&gt;  Time-lapsed imaging of a single area of interest also shows that small dark spots generally indicate the position of spider features not yet visible; it also shows that spots expand significantly, including dark fans emanating from some of the spots, which increase in prominence and develop clear directionality indicative of wind action.&lt;ref name=Piqueux2003 /&gt;

Some branching ravines modify, some destroy and others create crust in a dynamic near-surface process that extensively reworks the terrain creating and destroying surface layers. Thus, Mars seems to have a dynamic process of recycling of its near surface crust of carbon dioxide. Growth process is rapid, happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a growth rate rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars.&lt;ref name=Ness /&gt;  A number of [[Geophysics|geophysical]] models have been investigated to explain the various colors and shapes' development of these geysers on the southern polar ice cap of Mars.

===Atmospheric pressure===
The surface atmospheric pressure on Mars varies annually around: 6.7–8.8 mbar and 7.5–9.7 mbar; daily around 6.4–6.8 mbar. Because of the pressure changes subsurface gases expand and contract periodically, causing a downward gas flow during increase of and expulsion during decrease of atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name=clathrate /&gt;  This cycle was first quantified with measurements of the surface pressure, which varies annually with amplitude of 25%.&lt;ref name=Piqueux2003 /&gt;

;Clathrate hydrate model
This model proposes downward gas flow during increase of and upward flow during decrease of atmospheric pressure. In the defrosting process, ices (clathrate) may partly migrate into the soil and partly may evaporate.&lt;ref name=clathrate /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ness /&gt;  These locations can be in connection with the formation of dark dune spots and the arms of spiders as gas travel paths.&lt;ref name=clathrate /&gt;

===Dry venting===
[[File:PIA11858 Starburst Spider.jpg|thumb|200px|A large 'spider' feature apparently emanating sediment to give rise to dark dune spots. Image size: {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} across.]]
[[File:Martian CO2 gas venting.jpg|thumb|200px|According to Sylvain Piqueux, sun light causes sublimation from the bottom, leading to a buildup of pressurized CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas which eventually bursts out, entraining dust and leading to dark fan-shaped deposits with clear directionality indicative of wind action.&lt;ref name='Wind direction'/&gt;]]
Some teams propose dry venting of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas and sand, occurring between the ice and the underlying bedrock. It is known that a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ice slab is virtually transparent to solar radiation where 72% of solar energy incident at 60 degrees off vertical will reach the bottom of a 1&amp;nbsp;m thick layer.&lt;ref name=Kieffer2000 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mangold, N.  2011.

===Carbon dioxide and water cycling===
[[Image:Defrosting Sand.jpg|thumb|200px|Dark dune spots]]
[[Michael C. Malin]], a planetary scientist and designer of the cameras used by the Mars Global Surveyor that obtained the earliest images of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; geyser phenomenon, is studying the images acquired of specific areas and he tracks their changes over a period of a few years. In 2000, he modelled the fans and spots' dynamics as a complex process of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water sublimation and re-precipitation. The typical pattern of defrosting proceeds from the initiation of small, dark spots typically located at the margins of dunes; these spots individually enlarge and eventually all coalesce.&lt;ref name=Malin2000 &gt;{{Cite book| first=Michael C.| last=Malin |author2=K. S. Edgett| contribution=Frosting and Defrosting of Martian Polar Dunes| title=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI| publisher=Malin Space Science Systems| date=2000| url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2000/pdf/1056.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=3 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern the enlargement follows is distinct and characteristic: a dark nuclear spot enlarges slowly, often with a bright outer zone or 'halo'. As these are progressive, centripetal phenomena, each location of the light zone is overtaken by an expanding dark zone. Although initially developed along dune margins, spot formation quickly spreads onto and between dunes. As spring progresses, fan-shaped tails ('spiders') develop from the central spot. Defrosting occurs as the low albedo polar sand heats beneath an optically thin layer of frost, causing the frost to evaporate. This is the dark nucleus of the spots seen on dunes. As the vapor moves laterally, it encounters cold air and precipitates, forming the bright halo. This precipitated frost is again vaporized as the uncovered zone of sand expands; the cycle repeats many times.&lt;ref name=LPS2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Malin2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jeng /&gt;

While the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) has not yet formulated a theory or model, they have stated that the process of frost sublimation is not compatible with a few important features observed in the images, and that the location and shape of the spots is at odds with a physical explanation, specifically, because the channels appear to radiate downhill as much as they radiate uphill, defying gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Martian spots warrant a close look | date=13 March 2002 | publisher=European Space Agency | url =http://www.esa.int/esaCP/ASE4YZ9KOYC_FeatureWeek_1.html#subhead2 | accessdate =18 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/ASE4YZ9KOYC_FeatureWeek_0.html |title=Martian spots warrant a close look |accessdate=8 September 2009 |date=13 March 2002 |publisher=European Space Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothetical biological origin==
[[Image:DDS MSO.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DDS-MSO hypothesis.]]
A team of Hungarian scientists propose that the dark dune spots and channels may be colonies of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] Martian microorganisms, which over-winter beneath the ice cap, and as the [[sunlight]] returns to the pole during early spring, light penetrates the ice, the microorganisms photosynthesise and heat their immediate surroundings. A pocket of liquid water, which would normally evaporate instantly in the thin Martian atmosphere, is trapped around them by the overlying ice. As this ice layer thins, the microorganisms show through grey. When it has completely melted, they rapidly desiccate and turn black surrounded by a grey aureole.&lt;ref name=Andras /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Pócs, T. |author2=A. Horváth |author3=T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">'''Giorgio Diaz de Santillana''' (30 May 1902 – 1974) was an [[Italian-American]] philosopher and historian of science, and Professor of the History of Science at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).

==Life==
Son of the Tunisian-Italian jurist [[David Santillana]], expert of [[Islamic Law]], Giorgio was born and mostly educated in Rome, Santillana moved to the United States in 1936 and became a naturalized US citizen in 1945.  In 1941 he commenced his academic career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, becoming an Assistant Professor the following year. From 1943 to 1945 he served in the United States Army as a war correspondent.  Following the war, in 1945 he returned to MIT and was made an Associate Professor in 1948, the year he was married. He became a full Professor of the History of Science in the School of Humanities in 1954. In 1969, he published a book entitled: ''[[Hamlet's Mill|Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time]]'' with Dr. Hertha von Dechend. This book focused upon  the understanding of the connection between the mythological stories of Pharaonic [[Egypt]], [[Babylon]], [[Greece]], [[Christianity]], etc. and the ancient observations pertaining to the stars, planets and, most notably, the 26,000 year [[precession of the equinoxes]]. He died at [[Beverly, Massachusetts]], in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;http://platonism347.tripod.com/de_santillana.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the Philippines}}
{{Vajrayana}}
The '''Golden Tara''' is a 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat [[Majapahit]] period gold image of a Hindu goddess discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan]] in 1918. When it was purchased by the Field Museum of Chicago, they renamed it as '''Agusan Gold Image''', though this name is rejected by scholars in the Philippines.

[[H. Otley Beyer]] believed that the image was that of a [[Hindu]] [[Shaivism|Sivaite goddess]], but with the religiously important hand signals improperly copied by local workmen.  Thus it suggests that Hinduism was already in the Philippines before [[Ferdinand Magellan]] arrived, but also suggests that the early Filipinos had an imperfect version of Hinduism which they got from the Majapahit.

{{Quote|A study of this image was made by Dr. F. D. K. Bosch, of Batavia, in 1920, who came to the conclusion that it was made by local workmen in Mindanao, copying a [[Nganjuk Regency|Nganjuk]] images of the early Majapahit period - except that the local artist overlooked the distinguishing attributes held in the hand. It probably had some connection with the Javanese miners who are known to have been mining gold in the Agusan-Surigao area in the middle or late 14th century. The image is apparently that of a Sivaite goddess, and fits in well with the name "Butuan" (signifying "phallus").|[[H. Otley Beyer]]|1947&lt;ref name=ob&gt;H. Otley Beyer, "Outline Review of Philippine Archaeology by Islands and Provinces," Philippine Journal of Science, Vol.77,Nos.34 (July–August 1947),pp. 205-374&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After its discovery in 1918 by a [[Manobo]] woman named Bilay Campos, it was stolen while being safeguarded inside a hidden chest inside her traditional Manobo house. Before being stolen, the tribe of Manobos, where Campos belonged to, viewed the Golden Tara as a ''diwata'', a nature spirit deemed to protect the vastness of their ancestral domain's rainforests and waterways. Later on, the artifact would land in the possession of the area's governor for unknown links. The artifact would later be sold in a multinational company, where the governor was indebted to with a large sum of money. For unknown reasons, the artifact eventually landed for auction, prompting H. Otley Beyer to demand the Philippine government to buy the artifact for the sake of the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] and the Philippine nation. However, during that time, the country was in deep financial constraint, and was unable to buy the artifact. The Golden Tara was purchased by the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] of Chicago, Illinois in 1922 for a sum of approximately 4,000 pesos. According to the Field Museum, the artifact was purchased to save it from being melted at the time because the Philippines was having a hard time with its finances, which may have led to the minting of the artifact to aid in the country's financial losses. The purchase was funded through a campaign in Chicago to buy the artifact, with the aid of the American government, which at the time was also the colonial government in the Philippines. By 2010, the artifact's price has risen to approximately 1.5 million Philippine pesos.

[[File:Golden Tara - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|left|A statue of the Golden Tara in [[Butuan]]]]
The artifact has been a source of conflict between Filipinos and Americans for many years as many Filipino scholars have demanded for the return of the Golden Tara, as it is a national treasure of the country, unreported during the time of discovery, and sold to Americans during a great financial loss to the country - the very reason why the Philippine government at the time was not able to buy the artifact when it was auctioned. Scholars have argued that if the reason why the Field Museum took the artifact was because they fear that it may have been melted down, why has the Field Museum not returned or at least let the Philippines buy the artifact back since no group in the Philippines advocates for its melting anymore. On top of the argument is the cunning way the artifact was bought by an American museum during a time when the Philippines was in financial constraint under the colonial government of America. One of the major protesters for the return of the Golden Tara to Philippine possession is former senator [[Aquilino Pimentel Jr.]], who made his last privilege speech in the Senate specifically for the purpose of returning the Golden Tara to the Philippines. The Field Museum in Chicago has said that it may return the Golden Tara if it is 'strongly requested' by the Philippine government. In April 2018, a documentary from GMA Network featured the Golden Tara again, this time showing the people of [[Agusan del Sur]] supporting the return of the Golden Tara into the Philippines. Scholars have also found the document proving the right to claim of the Philippines on the Golden Tara. The scholars, in partnership with the government, have been tasked to pursue the Philippine claim on the Golden Tara, housed in the Field Museum in Chicago, United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philippines.fieldmuseum.org/heritage/narrative/4820|title=Agusan Gold Vajralasya|work=Philippine Heritage Collection|publisher=[[Field Museum of Natural History]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Joseph Muller''' (December 21, 1890 – April 5, 1967) was an American [[geneticist]], educator, and [[Nobel laureate]] best known for his work on the physiological and genetic effects of [[radiation]] ([[mutagenesis]]), as well as his outspoken political beliefs.&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Elof Axel Carlson|Carlson, Elof Axel]] |title=Genes, radiation, and society: the life and work of H. J. Muller |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=1981 |pages= |isbn=0-8014-1304-4 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muller frequently warned of long-term dangers of [[radioactive fallout]] from [[nuclear war]] and [[nuclear testing]], which resulted in greater public scrutiny of these practices.

==Early life==
Muller was born in [[New York City]], the son of Frances (Lyons) and Hermann Joseph Muller, Sr., an artisan who worked with metals. Muller was a third-generation American whose
father's ancestors were originally Catholic and came to the United States from [[Koblenz]].&lt;ref name="nas biography"/&gt; His mother's family was of mixed Jewish (descended from Spanish and Portuguese Jews) and Anglican background, and had come from Britain.&lt;ref name="nas biography"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1946/muller-bio.html?print=1 |title=Hermann J. Muller - Biographical |work=NobelPrice.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his first cousins are [[Herbert J. Muller]] and [[Alfred Kroeber]] whose daughter is [[Ursula Le Guin]].&lt;ref name="nas biography"/&gt; As an adolescent, he attended a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church and considered himself a [[pantheist]]; in high school, he became an [[atheist]]. He excelled in the public schools. At 16, he entered [[Columbia University|Columbia College]]. From his first semester, he was interested in biology; he became an early convert of the [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]]-[[chromosome]] theory of heredity — and the concept of genetic [[mutation]]s and [[natural selection]] as the basis for [[evolution]]. He formed a biology club and also became a proponent of [[eugenics]]; the connections between biology and society would be his perennial concern. Muller earned a [[bachelor of arts]] degree in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 17-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller remained at Columbia (the pre-eminent American zoology program at the time, due to [[Edmund Beecher Wilson|E. B. Wilson]] and his students) for graduate school. He became interested in the ''[[Drosophila]]'' genetics work of [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]'s fly lab after undergraduate bottle washers [[Alfred Sturtevant]] and [[Calvin Bridges]] joined his biology club. In 1911-1912, he studied metabolism at [[Cornell University]], but remained involved with Columbia. He followed the [[drosophilist]]s as the first genetic maps emerged from Morgan's experiments, and joined Morgan's group in 1912 (after two years of informal participation).&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 37-69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fly group, Muller's contributions were primarily theoretical - explanations for experimental results and ideas and predictions for new experiments. In the emerging collaborative culture of the drosophilists, however, credit was assigned based on results rather than ideas; Muller felt cheated when he was left out of major publications.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 70-90; for more on the culture and norms of the fly lab, see {{cite book |author=Kohler, Robert E. |title=Lords of the fly: Drosophila genetics and the experimental life |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-226-45063-5 |oclc= |doi= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1914, [[Julian Huxley]] offered Muller a position at the recently founded William Marsh Rice Institute, now [[Rice University]]; he hurried to complete his [[Doctor of philosophy]] degree and moved to Houston for the beginning of the 1915-1916 academic year (his degree was issued in 1916). At Rice, Muller taught biology and continued ''Drosophila'' lab work. In 1918, he proposed an explanation for the dramatic discontinuous alterations in ''[[Oenothera larmarckiana]]'' that were the basis of [[Hugo de Vries]]'s
theory of [[mutationism]]: "balanced lethals" allowed the accumulation of recessive mutations, and rare [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]] events resulted in the sudden expression of these hidden traits. In other words, de Vries's experiments were explainable by the Mendelian-chromosome theory. Muller's work was increasingly focused on [[mutation rate]] and [[lethal mutation]]s. In 1918, Morgan, short-handed because many of his students and assistants were drafted for the U.S. entry into [[World War I]], convinced Muller to return to Columbia to teach and to expand his experimental program.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 91-108&lt;/ref&gt;

At Columbia, Muller and his collaborator and longtime friend [[Edgar Altenburg]] continued the investigation of lethal mutations. The primary method for detecting such mutations was to measure the sex ratios of the offspring of female flies. They predicted the ratio would vary from 1:1 due to recessive mutations on the X chromosome, which would be expressed only in males (which lacked the functional allele on a second X chromosome). Muller found a strong temperature dependence in mutation rate, leading him to believe that spontaneous mutation was the dominant mode (and to initially discount the role of external factors such as ionizing radiation or chemical agents). In 1920, Muller and Altenburg coauthored a seminal paper in ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'' on "modifier genes" that determine the size of mutant ''Drosophila'' wings. In 1919, Muller made the important discovery of a mutant (later found to be a [[chromosomal inversion]]) that appeared to suppress crossing over, which opened up new avenues in mutation-rate studies. However, his appointment at Columbia was not continued; he accepted an offer from the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] and left Columbia after the summer of 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 109-119&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller taught at the University of Texas from 1920 until 1932. Soon after returning to Texas, he married mathematics professor [[Jessie Marie Jacobs Muller Offermann|Jessie Marie Jacobs]], whom he had courted previously. In his early years at Texas, Muller's ''Drosophila'' work was slow going; the data from his mutation rate studies were difficult to interpret. In 1923, he began using [[radium]] and [[X-rays]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=Vivien|title=The Secrets of Life: Historian Luis Campos resurrects radium's role in early genetics research|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2 |pages=44–45 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-secrets-of-life|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the relationship between radiation and mutation was difficult to measure because such radiation also sterilized the flies. In this period, he also became involved with eugenics and human genetics. He carried out a study of twins separated at birth that seemed to indicate a strong hereditary component to [[I.Q.]] Muller was critical of the new directions of the eugenics movement (such as anti-immigration), but was hopeful about the prospects for positive eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 120-140&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932, at the [[International Eugenics Conference| Third International Eugenics Congress]], Muller gave a speech and stated, "eugenics might yet perfect the human race, but only in a society consciously organized for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/eugenics-crusade/#part01 |title=The Eugenics Crusade What's Wrong with Perfect? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=October 16, 2018 |website= |publisher=PBS |access-date=November 4, 2018 |quote=There is no scientific basis for the conclusion that the socially lower class have genetically inferior intellectual equipment. Certain slum districts of our cities are factories for criminality among those who happen to be born in them.  Under these circumstances, it is society, not the individual, which is the real criminal and which stands to be judged.  Eugenics might yet perfect the human race, but only in a society consciously organized for the common good.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of X-ray mutagenesis===
In 1926, a series of major breakthroughs began. In November, Muller carried out two experiments with varied doses of X-rays, the second of which used the crossing over suppressor stock ("ClB") he had found in 1919. A clear, quantitative connection between radiation and lethal mutations quickly emerged. Muller's discovery created a media sensation after he delivered a paper entitled "The Problem of Genetic Modification" at the Fifth International Congress of Genetics in [[Berlin]]; it would make him one of the better-known public intellectuals of the early 20th century. By 1928, others had replicated his dramatic results, expanding them to other [[model organism]]s, such as [[wasp]]s and [[maize]]. In the following years, he began publicizing the likely dangers of radiation exposure in humans (such as physicians who frequently operate X-ray equipment).&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 141-164&lt;/ref&gt;

His lab grew quickly, but it shrank again following the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. Especially after the stock market crash, Muller was increasingly pessimistic about the prospects of [[capitalism]]. Some of his visiting lab members were from the [[USSR]], and he helped edit and distribute an illegal leftist student newspaper, ''The Spark''. It was a difficult period for Muller both scientifically and personally; his marriage was falling apart, and he was increasingly dissatisfied with his life in Texas. Meanwhile, the waning of the eugenics movement, ironically hastened by his own work pointing to the previously ignored connections between environment and genetics, meant that his ideas on the future of human evolution had reduced impact in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 165-183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in Europe===
In September 1932, Muller moved to Berlin to work with the Russian expatriate geneticist [[Nikolay Timofeeff-Ressovsky]]; a trip intended as a limited sabbatical stretched into an eight-year, five-country journey. In Berlin, he met two physicists who would later be significant to the biology community: [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Max Delbrück]]. The [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] movement was precipitating the rapid emigration of scientific talent from Germany, and Muller was particularly opposed to the politics of National Socialism. The FBI was investigating Muller because of his involvement with ''The Spark'', so he chose instead to go to the Soviet Union (an environment better suited to his political beliefs). In 1933, Muller and his wife reconciled, and their son [[David E. Muller]] and she moved with Hermann to [[Leningrad]]. There, at the Institute of Genetics, he imported the basic equipment for a ''Drosophila'' lab—including the flies—and set up shop. The Institute was moved to [[Moscow]] in 1934, and Muller and his wife were divorced in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 184-203&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USSR, Muller supervised a large and productive lab, and organized work on medical genetics. Most of his work involved further explorations of genetics and radiation. There he completed his eugenics book, ''Out of the Night'', the main ideas of which dated to 1910.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Muller, ''Out of the Night: A Biologist's View of the Future'' (New York: Vangard, 1935), p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1936, however, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s repressive policies and the rise of [[Lysenkoism]] was making the USSR an increasingly problematic place to live and work. Muller and many of the Russian genetics community did what they could to oppose [[Trofim Lysenko]] and his [[Lamarckism|Larmarckian]] evolutionary theory, but Muller was soon forced to leave the Soviet Union after Stalin read a translation of his eugenics book and was "displeased by it, and...ordered an attack prepared against it."&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 204-234; quotation from p 233, correspondence from Muller to Julian Huxley, March 9, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller, with about 250 strains of ''Drosophila'', moved to [[Edinburgh]] in September 1937, after  brief stays in [[Madrid]] and [[Paris]]. In 1938, with war on the horizon, he began looking for a permanent position back in the United States. He also began courting Dorothea "Thea" Kantorowicz, a German refugee; they were married in May 1939. The Seventh International Congress on Genetics was held in Edinburgh later that year; Muller wrote a "Geneticists' Manifesto"&lt;ref&gt;"The 'Geneticists Manifesto'," originally published in ''Journal of Heredity'', 1939, 30:371-73; reprinted in H. J. Muller, ''Studies in Genetics: The Selected Papers of H. J. Muller'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1962), pp. 545-548.&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the question: "How could the world's population be improved most effectively genetically?" He also engaged in a debate with the perennial genetics gadfly [[Richard Goldschmidt]] over the existence of the gene, for which  little direct physical evidence remained.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 235-273&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
[[File:First Street 1001, Muller House, Vinegar Hill HD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Muller's house in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]]]

When Muller returned to the United States in 1940, he took an untenured research position at [[Amherst College]], in the department of [[Otto C. Glaser]]. After the U.S. entry into [[World War II]], his position was extended indefinitely and expanded to include teaching. His ''Drosophila'' work in this period focused on measuring the rate of spontaneous (as opposed to radiation-induced) mutations. Muller's publication rate decreased greatly in this period, from a combination of lack of lab workers and experimentally challenging projects. However, he also worked as an adviser in the [[Manhattan Project]] (though he did not know that was what it was), as well as a study of the mutational effects of [[radar]]. Muller's appointment was ended after the 1944–1945 academic year, and despite difficulties stemming from his socialist political activities, he found a position as professor of zoology at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 274–288&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, he lived in a [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial Revival]] house in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]'s [[Vinegar Hill Historic District|Vinegar Hill]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory. ''City of Bloomington Interim Report''. Bloomington: City of Bloomington, 2004-04, 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Muller was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], "for the discovery that mutations can be induced by X-rays". Genetics, and especially the physical and physiological nature of the gene, was becoming a central topic in biology, and X-ray mutagenesis was a key to many recent advances, among them [[George Beadle]] and [[Edward Tatum]]'s work on ''[[Neurospora]]'' that established in 1941 the [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Carlson, pp 304-318"&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 304–318&lt;/ref&gt; In Muller's Nobel Prize lecture, he argued that no threshold dose of radiation existed that did not produce [[mutagenesis]], which led to the adoption of the [[linear no-threshold model]] of radiation on cancer risks.&lt;ref name="calabrese 2"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Calabrese, E. J.| title = Muller’s Nobel lecture on dose–response for ionizing radiation:ideology or science?| publisher = Springer| date = 30 June 2011| url =http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/freshman_seminar/Radiation/Calabrese-Muller-1-1.pdf| accessdate =30 December 2011| doi = 10.1007/s00204-011-0728-8| journal = Archives of Toxicology| volume = 85| issue = 4| pages = 1495–1498| pmid=21717110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobel Prize, in the wake of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], focused public attention on a subject Muller had been publicizing for two decades - the dangers of radiation. In 1952, [[nuclear fallout]] became a public issue; since [[Operation Crossroads]], more and more evidence had been leaking out about [[radiation sickness]] and death caused by [[nuclear testing]]. Muller and many other scientists pursued an array of political activities to defuse the threat of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. With the [[Castle Bravo]] fallout controversy in 1954, the issue became even more urgent.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In 1955, Muller was one of 11 prominent intellectuals to sign the [[Russell-Einstein Manifesto]], the upshot of which was the first [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|1957 Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs]], which addressed the control of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="jf"&gt;John Bellamy Foster (2009). ''The Ecological Revolution: Making Peace with the Planet'', Monthly Review Press, New York, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp. 336–379.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a signatory (with many other scientists) of the 1958 petition to the United Nations, calling for an end to nuclear weapons testing, which was initiated by the Nobel Prize-winning chemist [[Linus Pauling]].&lt;ref name="jf"/&gt;

Muller's opinions on the effect of radiation on mutagenesis, however, had been criticized by some scientists; geneticist [[James F. Crow]] called Muller's view "alarmist" and wrote that it created in the public "an irrational fear of low-level radiation relative to other risks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Muller, Dobzhansky, and Overdominance|author=James F.

H. J. Muller and science-fiction writer [[Ursula Le Guin]] were [[second cousins]]; his father (Hermann J. Muller Sr.) and her father's mother (Johanna Muller Kroeber) were siblings, the children of Nicholas Müller, who immigrated to the United States in 1848, and at that time dropped the umlaut from his name. Another cousin was [[Herbert J. Muller]], whose grandfather Otto was another son of Nicholas and a sibling of Hermann Sr. and Johanna.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Muller is survived by his daughter, Helen J. Muller, now a professor emerita at the [[University of New Mexico]], who has a daughter, Mala Htun. His son, [[David E. Muller]], a professor emeritus of mathematics and computer science at the [[University of Illinois]] and at [[New Mexico State University]], died in 2008 in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. David's mother was Jessie Jacobs Muller Offermann, Hermann's first wife. Helen's mother was Dorothea Kantorowicz Muller, Hermann's second wife.&lt;ref name="nas biography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/muller-hermann.pdf |title= Hermann Joseph Muller 1890—1967 | author=Elof Axel Carlson |work=National Academy of Sciences |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of condoms''' goes back at least several centuries, and perhaps beyond.  For most of their history, [[condom]]s have been used both as a method of [[birth control]], and as a protective measure against [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.  Condoms have been made from a variety of materials; prior to the 19th century, chemically treated linen and animal tissue (intestine or bladder) are the best documented varieties.  Rubber condoms gained popularity in the mid-19th century, and in the early 20th century major advances were made in manufacturing techniques.  Prior to the introduction of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]], condoms were the most popular birth "control" method in the Western world.  In the second half of the 20th century, the low cost of condoms contributed to their importance in [[family planning]] programs throughout the developing world.  Condoms have also become increasingly important in efforts to fight the [[AIDS pandemic]]. The oldest condoms ever excavated were found in a cesspit located in the grounds of [[Dudley Castle]] and were made from animal membrane, the condoms dated back to as early as 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=James|title=Condoms Cathedrals and Caves - Europe for Visitors|url=http://goeurope.about.com/cs/sex/a/condom.htm|publisher=about.com|accessdate=21 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205201853/http://goeurope.about.com/cs/sex/a/condom.htm|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity to the Middle Ages for sex==
Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians.&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;{{cite book |author=Aine Collier |title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | url=https://books.google.com/?id=53EsAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=The+Humble+Little+Condom:+A+History&amp;dq=The+Humble+Little+Condom:+A+History | page=371 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Buffalo, N.Y |year=2007 |isbn=1-59102-556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|11}}  Societies in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome preferred small families and are known to have practiced a variety of birth control methods.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|12,16–17,22}}  However, these societies viewed [[birth control]] as a woman's responsibility, and the only well-documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices (both possibly effective, such as [[pessary|pessaries]], and ineffective, such as [[amulet]]s).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|17,23}} The writings of these societies contain "veiled references" to male-controlled contraceptive methods that might have been condoms, but most historians interpret them as referring to [[coitus interruptus]] or [[anal intercourse]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|21,24}}

The [[loincloth]]s worn by Egyptian and Greek laborers were very spare, sometimes consisting of little more than a covering for the glans of the penis. Records of these types of loincloths being worn by men in higher classes have made some historians speculate they were worn during intercourse;&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|13–15,18–20}} others, however, are doubtful of such interpretations.&lt;ref name="youssef"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Youssef | first = H | date=1 April 1993| title = The history of the condom | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 86 | pages = 226–228 | accessdate=| pmid = 7802734| issue = 4| pmc = 1293956}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians may also cite one legend of [[Minos]], related by [[Antoninus Liberalis]] in 150 AD, as suggestive of condom use in ancient societies. This legend describes a curse that caused Minos' semen to contain serpents and scorpions. To protect his sexual partner from these animals, Minos used a goat's bladder as a female condom.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|18}}&lt;ref name="youssef" /&gt;

Contraceptives fell out of use in Europe after the [[decline of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century; the use of contraceptive pessaries, for example, is not documented again until the 15th century. If condoms were used during the Roman Empire, knowledge of them may have been lost during its decline.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|33,42}} In the writings of Muslims and Jews during the Middle Ages, there are some references to attempts at male-controlled contraception, including suggestions to cover the penis in tar or soak it in onion juice. Some of these writings might describe condom use, but they are "oblique", "veiled", and "vague".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|38–41}}

==1500s to the 1800s==

===Renaissance===
[[Image:De Morbo Gallico.jpg|thumb|A page from ''De Morbo Gallico'' (The French Disease), Gabriele Falloppio's treatise on syphilis. Published in 1564, it describes what is possibly the first use of condoms.]]
Prior to the 15th century, some use of glans condoms (devices covering only the head of the penis) is recorded in Asia. Glans condoms seem to have been used for birth control, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of [[Condom#Lambskin|lamb intestines]]. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|60–1}}

The first well-documented outbreak of what is now known as [[syphilis]] occurred in 1494 among French troops.&lt;ref name="Scars_of_Venus"&gt;{{cite book | author=Oriel, J.D. | title=The Scars of Venus: A History of Venereology | location=London | publisher= Springer-Verlag | year=1994 |isbn=0-387-19844-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease then swept across Europe. As [[Jared Diamond]] describes it, "when syphilis was first definitely recorded in Europe in 1495, its [[pustule]]s often covered the body from the head to the knees, caused flesh to fall from people's faces, and led to death within a few months." (The disease is less frequently fatal today.&lt;ref name="Diamond1"&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, Jared | year=1997 | title=Guns, Germs and Steel | location=New York | publisher=W.W. Norton | page=210 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  By 1505, the disease had spread to Asia, and within a few decades had "decimated large areas of China".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|50,60}}

In 16th century Italy, [[Gabriele Falloppio]] authored the earliest uncontested description of condom use.  ''De Morbo Gallico'' ("The French Disease", referring to syphilis) was published in 1564, two years after Falloppio's death. In this tract, he recommended use of a device he claimed to have invented: linen sheaths soaked in a chemical solution and allowed to dry before use. The cloths he described were sized to cover the [[Glans penis|glans]] of the penis, and were held on with a ribbon.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|51,54–5}}&lt;ref name="pai"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Topic: History of Condom Use |publisher=Population Action International |year=2002 |url=http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714101959/http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |archivedate=2007-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fallopio claimed to have performed an experimental trial of the linen sheath on 1100 men, and reported that none of them had contracted the dreaded disease.&lt;ref name="youssef"/&gt;

After the publication of ''De Morbo Gallico'', use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout Europe. The first indication these devices were used for birth control, rather than disease prevention, is the 1605 theological publication ''De iustitia et iure'' (On justice and law) by Catholic theologian [[Leonardus Lessius]]: he condemned them as immoral.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|56}}  The first explicit description that ''un petit linge'' (a small cloth) was used to prevent pregnancy is from 1655: a French novel and play titled ''L'Escole des Filles'' (The Philosophy of Girls). In 1666, the English Birth Rate Commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of "condons", the first documented use of that word (or any similar spelling).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|66–8}}

In addition to linen, condoms during the [[Renaissance]] were made out of intestines and bladder. Cleaned and prepared intestine for use in glove making had been sold commercially since at least the 13th century.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|44–5}}  Condoms made from bladder and dating to the 1640s were discovered in an English privy; it is believed they were used by soldiers of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|68–9}}  Dutch traders introduced condoms made from "fine leather" to Japan. Unlike the horn condoms used previously, these leather condoms covered the entire penis.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|61}}

===18th century===
Written references to condom use became much more common during the 18th century. Not all of the attention was positive: in 1708, [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|John Campbell]] unsuccessfully asked Parliament to make the devices illegal.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|73}}  Noted English physician Daniel Turner condemned the condom, publishing his arguments against their use in 1717. He disliked condoms because they did not offer full protection against syphilis. He also seems to have argued that belief in the protection condoms offered encouraged men to engage in sex with unsafe partners - but then, because of the loss of sensation caused by condoms, these same men often neglected to actually use the devices. The French medical professor [[Jean Astruc]] wrote his own anti-condom treatise in 1736, citing Turner as the authority in this area. Physicians later in the 18th century also spoke against the condom, but not on medical grounds: rather, they expressed the belief that contraception was immoral.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|86–8,92}}

The condom market grew rapidly, however. 18th century condoms were available in a variety of qualities and sizes, made from either linen treated with chemicals, or "skin" (bladder or intestine softened by treatment with [[sulphur]] and [[lye]]).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|94–5}}  They were sold at pubs, barbershops, chemist shops, open-air markets, and at the theater throughout Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|90–2,97,104}}  The first recorded inspection of condom quality is found in the [[Histoire de ma vie|memoirs of Giacomo Casanova]] (which cover his life until 1774): to test for holes, he would often blow them up before use.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|108}}&lt;ref name="youssef" /&gt;

[[Image:Condom 1900.jpg|thumb|left|A condom made from animal intestine circa 1900.]]
Couples in colonial America relied on female-controlled methods of contraception, if they used contraceptives at all. The first known documents describing American condom use were written around 1800, two to three decades after the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|116–7}}  Also around 1800, linen condoms lost popularity in the market and their production ceased: they were more expensive and were viewed as less comfortable when compared to skin condoms.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|94–5}}

Up to the 19th century, condoms were generally used only by the middle and upper classes. One reason for the lack of condom use was that the working classes tended to lack education on the dangers of sexually transmitted infections. Perhaps more importantly, condoms were unaffordable for many: for a typical prostitute, a single condom might cost several months' pay.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|119–21}}

===Expanded marketing and introduction of rubber===
The early 19th century saw contraceptives promoted to the poorer classes for the first time: birth control advocates in England included [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Richard Carlile]], and noted American advocates included [[Robert Dale Owen]] and [[Charles Knowlton]]. Writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control, citing both the expense of condoms and their unreliability (they were often riddled with holes, and often fell off or broke), but they discussed condoms as a good option for some, and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|88,90,125,129–30}}  One group of British contraceptive advocates distributed condom literature in poor neighborhoods, with instructions on how to make the devices at home; in the 1840s, similar tracts were distributed in both cities and rural areas through the United States.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|126,136}}

From the 1820s through the 1870s, popular women and men lecturers traveled around America teaching about physiology and sexual matters. Many of them sold birth control devices, including condoms, after their lectures. They were condemned by many moralists and medical professionals, including America's first female doctor [[Elizabeth Blackwell]]. Blackwell accused the lecturers of spreading doctrines of "abortion and prostitution".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|130–2}}  In the 1840s, advertisements for condoms began to appear in British newspapers, and in 1861 a condom advertisement appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|127,138}}

The [[vulcanized rubber|rubber vulcanization]] process was invented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in 1839, and patented in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reprinted from ''India Rubber World'' | title = CHARLES GOODYEAR—The life and discoveries of the inventor of vulcanized India rubber | journal = Scientific American Supplement | issue = 787 | publisher = Munn &amp; Co.  | location = New York  | date = 1891-01-31 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14009 | accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;br /&gt;

 --&gt;&lt;ref name="billy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubbers haven't always been made of rubber |work=Billy Boy: The excitingly different condom |url=http://www.billy-boy.com/english/info/ |accessdate=2006-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721104435/http://www.billy-boy.com/english/info/ |archivedate=2006-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the late 1850s several major rubber companies were mass-producing, among other items, rubber condoms. A main advantage of rubber condoms was their reusability, making them a more economical choice in the long term. Compared to the 19th century rubber condoms, however, skin condoms were initially cheaper and offered better sensitivity. For these reasons, skin condoms remained more popular than the rubber variety. However, by the end of the 19th century "rubber" had become a euphemism for condoms in countries around the world.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|134–5,157,219}}  For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|148}}  The earliest rubber condoms covered only the glans of the penis; a doctor had to measure each man and order the correct size. Even with the medical fittings, however, glans condoms tended to fall off during use. Rubber manufacturers quickly discovered they could sell more devices by manufacturing full-length one-size-fits-all condoms to be sold in pharmacies.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|135}}

===Increased popularity despite legal impediments===
Distribution of condoms in the United States was limited by passage of the [[Comstock laws]], which included a federal act banning the mailing of contraceptive information (passed in 1873) as well as State laws that banned the manufacture and sale of condoms in thirty states.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|144,193}}  In [[Ireland]] the 1889 Indecent Advertisements Act made it illegal to advertise condoms, although their manufacture and sale remained legal.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|163–4,168}}  Contraceptives were illegal in 19th century Italy and Germany, but condoms were allowed for disease prevention.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|169–70}}  Despite legal obstacles, condoms continued to be readily available in both Europe and America, widely advertised under euphemisms such as ''male shield'' and ''rubber good''.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|146–7}}  In late 19th century England, condoms were known as "a little something for the weekend".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|165}}  Only in the [[Republic of Ireland]] were condoms effectively outlawed. In Ireland their sale and manufacture remained illegal until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|171}}

Opposition to condoms did not only come from moralists: by the late 19th century many feminists expressed distrust of the condom as a contraceptive, as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone. They advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women, such as diaphragms and spermicidal douches.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|152–3}}  Despite social and legal opposition, at the end of the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method. Two surveys conducted in New York in 1890 and 1900 found that 45% of the women surveyed were using condoms to prevent pregnancy.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|173–4}}  A survey in Boston just prior to [[World War I]] concluded that three million condoms were sold in that city every year.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|192–3}}

1870s England saw the founding of the first major condom manufacturing company, E. Lambert and Son of Dalston.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|165}} In 1882, German immigrant [[Julius Schmidt (condoms)|Julius Schmidt]] founded one of the largest and longest-lasting condom businesses, Julius Schmid, Inc. (he dropped the 't' from his name in an effort to appear less Jewish). This New York business initially manufactured only skin condoms (in 1890 he was arrested by [[Anthony Comstock]] for having almost seven hundred of the devices in his house).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|154–6}}  In 1912, a German named [[Julius Fromm]] developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution.&lt;ref name="billy" /&gt; Called ''cement dipping'', this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|200}}  In America, Schmid was the first company to use the new technique. Using the new dipping method, French condom manufacturers were the first to add textures to condoms.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|169–70}}  Fromm was the first company to sell a branded line of condoms, Fromm's Act, which remains popular in Germany today.&lt;ref name="billy" /&gt;  The condom lines manufactured by Schmid, Shieks and Ramses, were sold through the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|154–6}}  Youngs Rubber Company, founded by Merle Youngs in late 19th century America, introduced Trojans.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|191}}

Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, American rates of sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketed.

==1900 to present==

===World War I to the 1920s===
[[Image:Surgeon Sage Says.jpg|thumb|A World War I-era U.S. military poster promoting abstinence.]]
The German military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers, beginning in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|169,181}}  Early 20th century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|180–3}}  During [[World War I]], the United States and (at the beginning of the war only) Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|187–90}}  By the end of the war, the American military had diagnosed almost 400,000 cases of syphilis and [[gonorrhea]], a historic high.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|191}}

From just before 1900 to the beginning of World War I, almost all condoms used in Europe were imported from Germany. Germany not only exported condoms to other European countries, but was a major supplier to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. During the war, the American companies Schmid and Youngs became the main suppliers of condoms to the European [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|156,170,191}}  By the early 1920s, however, most of Europe's condoms were once again made in Germany.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|199}}

In 1918, just before the end of the war, an American court overturned a conviction against [[Margaret Sanger]]. In this case, the judge ruled that condoms could be legally advertised and sold for the prevention of disease.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="note"&gt;{{cite web | title = Biographical Note | work = The Margaret Sanger Papers | publisher = Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass. | year = 1995 | url = http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html | accessdate = 2006-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious|date=September 2016}}  There were still a few state laws against buying and selling contraceptives, and advertising condoms as birth control devices remained illegal in over thirty states.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|266}}  But condoms began to be publicly, legally sold to Americans for the first time in forty-five years.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|192–3}}  Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|197}}  Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure. Several American companies sold their rejects under cheaper brand names rather than discarding them.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|204,206,221–2}}  Consumers were advised to perform similar tests themselves before use, although few actually did so.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|223}}  Worldwide, condoms sales doubled in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|210}}

Still, there were many prominent opponents of condoms. Founder of psychoanalysis [[Sigmund Freud]] opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high. Freud was especially opposed to the condom because it cut down on sexual pleasure. Some feminists continued to oppose male-controlled contraceptives such as condoms. Many moralists and medical professionals opposed all methods of contraception. In 1920 the Church of England's [[Lambeth Conferences#Sixth Conference (1920)|Lambeth Conference]] condemned all "unnatural means of conception avoidance."  London's Bishop [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]] complained of the ''huge'' number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks, especially after weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|211–2}}

In the U.S., condom advertising was legally restricted to their use as disease preventatives. They could be openly marketed as birth control devices in Britain, but purchasing condoms in Britain was socially awkward compared to the U.S. They were generally requested with the euphemism "a little something for the weekend." [[Boots Group|Boots]], the largest pharmacy chain in Britain, stopped selling condoms altogether in the 1920s, a policy that was not reversed until the 1960s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|208–10}}  In post-World War I France, the government was concerned about falling birth rates. In response, it outlawed all contraceptives, including condoms. Contraception was also illegal in Spain. European militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection, even in countries where they were illegal for the general population.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|213–4}}

===Invention of latex and manufacturing automation===
[[Latex]], rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Youngs Rubber Company was the first to manufacture a latex condom, an improved version of their Trojan brand. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. Because it used water to suspend the rubber instead of gasoline and benzene, it eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber). Europe's first latex condom was an export from Youngs Rubber Company in 1929. In 1932 the London Rubber Company, which had previously served as a wholesaler for German-manufactured condoms, became Europe's first manufacturer of latex condoms, the Durex.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|199–200}}

Until the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semiskilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in automation of condom assembly line were made. Fred Killian patented the first fully automated line in 1930 and installed it in his manufacturing plant in Akron, Ohio. Killian charged $20,000 for his conveyor system - as much as $2 million in today's dollars. Automated lines dramatically lowered the price of condoms. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems, and small manufacturers were driven out of business.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|201–3}}  The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|220}}

===Great Depression===
In 1927, senior medical officers in the American military began promoting condom distribution and educational programs to members of the army and navy. By 1931, condoms were standard issue to all members of the U.S. military.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|213–4}}  This coincided with a steep decline in U.S. military cases of sexually transmitted disease.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|217–9}}  The U.S. military was not the only large organization that changed its moral stance on condoms: in 1930 the Anglican Church's [[Lambeth Conferences#Seventh: 1930|Lambeth Conference]] sanctioned the use of birth control by married couples. In 1931 the [[National Council of Churches|Federal Council of Churches]] in the U.S. issued a similar statement.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|227}}

The Roman Catholic Church responded by issuing the encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]'' affirming its opposition to all contraceptives, a stance it has never reversed.  [[Semen analysis]] was first performed in the 1930s. Samples were typically collected by masturbation, another action opposed by the Catholic Church. In 1930s Spain, the first use of [[collection condoms]] was documented; holes put in the condom allowed the user to collect a sample without violating the prohibitions on contraception and masturbation.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|228–9}}

In 1932, Margaret Sanger arranged for a shipment of [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]] to be mailed from Japan to a sympathetic doctor in New York City. When U.S. customs confiscated the package as illegal contraceptive devices, Sanger helped file a lawsuit. In 1936, a federal appeals court ruled in [[United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries]] that the federal government could not interfere with doctors providing contraception to their patients.&lt;ref name="note" /&gt;  In 1938, over three hundred birth control clinics opened in America, supplying reproductive care (including condoms) to poor women all over the country.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|216,226}}  Programs led by U.S. [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] Thoman Parran included heavy promotion of condoms. These programs are credited with a steep drop in the U.S. STD rate by 1940.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|234}}

Two of the few places where condoms became more restricted during this period were [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Because of government concern about low birth rates, contraceptives were made illegal in Italy in the late 1920s. Although limited and highly controlled sales as disease preventatives were still allowed, there was a brisk black market trade in condoms as birth control.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|254–5}}  In Germany, laws passed in 1933 mandated that condoms could only be sold in plain brown wrappers, and only at pharmacies. Despite these restrictions, when [[World War II]] began Germans were using 72 million condoms every year.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|252}}  The elimination of moral and legal barriers, and the introduction of condom programs by the U.S. government helped condom sales. However, these factors alone are not considered to explain the [[Great Depression]]'s booming condom industry. In the U.S. alone, more than 1.5 million condoms were used every day during the Depression, at a cost of over $33 million per year (not adjusted for inflation). One historian explains these statistics this way: "Condoms were cheaper than children."  During the Depression condom lines by Schmid gained in popularity: that company still used the cement-dipping method of manufacture. Unlike the latex variety, these condoms could be safely used with oil-based lubricants. And while less comfortable, older-style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical, a valued feature in hard times.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|217–9}}

More attention was brought to quality issues in the 1930s. In 1935, a biochemist tested 2000 condoms by filling each one with air and then water: he found that 60% of them leaked. The condom industry estimated that only 25% of condoms were tested for quality before packaging. The media attention led the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] to classify condoms as a drug in 1937 and mandate that every condom be tested before packaging. Youngs Rubber Company was the first to institute quality testing of every condom they made, installing automatic testing equipment designed by Arthur Youngs (the owner's brother) in 1938. The [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] authorized the FDA to seize defective products; the first month the Act took effect in 1940, the FDA seized 864,000 condoms. While these actions improved the quality of condoms in the United States, American condom manufacturers continued to export their rejects for sale in foreign markets.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|223–5}}

===World War II to 1980===
During [[World War II]] condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members, but enlisted men were also subject to significant contraception propaganda in the form of films, posters, and lectures.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|236–8,259}}  A number of slogans were coined by the military, with one film exhorting ''"Don't forget — put it on before you put it in."''&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;  African-American soldiers, who served in segregated units, were exposed to less of the condom promotion programs, had lower rates of condom usage, and much higher rates of STDs.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|246}} America's female military units, the [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)|WACs and WAACs]], were still engaged with abstinence programs.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|240}} European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war, even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in 1941.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|252–4,257–8}}  Despite the rubber shortages that occurred during this period, condom manufacturing was never restricted.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|231–3}}  In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of [[Condom#Other uses|non-sexual uses]] for the devices, many of which continue to be utilized to this day.

Post-war American troops in Germany continued to receive condoms and materials promoting their use. Nevertheless, rates of STDs in this population began to rise, reaching the highest levels since World War I. One explanation is that the success of newer penicillin treatments led soldiers to take syphilis and gonorrhea much less seriously. A similar casual attitude toward STDs appeared in the general American population; one historian states that condoms "were almost obsolete as prophylaxis by 1960".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|234,259–61}}  By 1947, the U.S. military was again promoting abstinence as the only method of disease control for its members, a policy that continued through the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|261–2,281–4}}

But condom sales continued to grow. From 1955 to 1965, 42% of Americans of reproductive age relied on condoms for birth control. In Britain from 1950 to 1960, 60% of married couples used condoms. For the more economical-minded, cement-dipped condoms continued to be available long after the war. In 1957, Durex introduced the world's first lubricated condom. Beginning in the 1960s, the Japanese used more condoms per capita than any other nation in the world. The [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] became the world's most popular method of birth control in the years after its 1960 debut, but condoms remained a strong second. A survey of British women between 1966 and 1970 found that the condom was the most popular birth control method with single women. New manufacturers appeared in the Soviet Union, which had never restricted condom sales. The U.S. [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] pushed condom use in developing countries to help solve the "world population crises": by 1970 hundreds of millions of condoms were being used each year in India alone.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|267–9,272–5}}

In the 1960s and 1970s quality regulations tightened,&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|267,285}} and legal barriers to condom use were removed. In 1965, the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' struck down one of the remaining [[Comstock laws]], the bans of contraception in Connecticut and Massachusetts. France repealed its anti-birth control laws in 1967. Similar laws in Italy were declared unconstitutional in 1971.  [[Beate Uhse-Rotermund|Captain Beate Uhse]] in Germany founded a birth control business, and fought a series of legal battles continue her sales.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|276–9}}  In Ireland, legal condom sales (only to people over 18, and only in clinics and pharmacies) were allowed for the first time in 1978.  (All restrictions on Irish condom sales were lifted in 1993.)&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|329–30}}

Advertising was one area that continued to have legal restrictions. In the late 1950s, the American [[National Association of Broadcasters]] banned condom advertisements from national television. This policy remained in place until 1979, when the U.S. Justice department had it overturned in court.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|273–4,285}}  In the U.S., advertisements for condoms were mostly limited to men's magazines such as ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|285–6}}  The first television ad, on the California station [[KNTV]], aired in 1975: it was quickly pulled after it attracted national attention.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|274}}  And in over 30 states, advertising condoms as birth control devices was still illegal.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|266}}

===After the discovery of AIDS===
The first ''[[New York Times]]'' story on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]) was published on July 3, 1981.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|294}}  In 1982 it was first suggested that the disease was sexually transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Cluster of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia among Homosexual Male Residents of Los Angeles and range Counties, California | journal = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume = 31 | issue = 23 | pages = 305–7 | publisher =  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 1982-06-18 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001114.htm | accessdate = 2008-06-15 | pmid = 6811844 | author1 = Centers for Disease Control (CDC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to these findings, and to fight the spread of AIDS, the U.S. Surgeon General Dr. [[C. Everett Koop]] supported condom promotion programs.  However, President [[Ronald Reagan]] preferred an approach of concentrating only on abstinence programs.  Some opponents of condom programs stated that AIDS was a disease of homosexuals and illicit drug users, who were just getting what they deserved.  In 1990, North Carolina senator [[Jesse Helms]] argued that the best way to fight AIDS would be to enforce state sodomy laws.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|296–7}}

Nevertheless, major advertising campaigns were put in print media, promoting condoms as a way to protect against AIDS.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|299,301}}  Youngs Rubber mailed educational pamphlets to American households, although the postal service forced them to go to court to do so, citing a section of Title 39 that "prohibits the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives."  In 1983 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the postal service's actions violated the free speech clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|303}}  Beginning in 1985 through 1987, national condom promotion campaigns occurred in U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|299,301,306–7,312–8}} Over the 10 years of the Swiss campaign, Swiss condom use increased by 80%.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|314–7}} The year after the British campaign began, condom sales in the UK increased by 20%.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|309}}  In 1988 Britain, condoms were the most popular birth control choice for married couples, for the first time since the introduction of the pill.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|311}}  The first [[condom]] commercial on U.S. television aired during an episode of ''[[Herman's Head]]'' on November 17, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20614F63C5D0C7A8DDDA80994D9494D81&amp;showabstract=1| title = The Sponsor Is the Surprise In Fox's First Condom Ad | first = Stuart | last = Elliott | date = November 19, 1991 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. in the 1990s, condoms ranked third in popularity among married couples, and were a strong second among single women.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|305}}

Condoms began to be sold in a wider variety of retail outlets, including in supermarkets and in discount department stores such as [[Wal-Mart]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|305}}  In this environment of more open sales, the British euphemism of "a little something for the weekend" fell out of use.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|322}}  In June 1991 America's first condom store, Condomania, opened on Bleecker Street in New York City.  Condomania was the first store of its kind in North America dedicated to the sale and promotion of condoms in an upbeat, upscale and fun atmosphere.  Condomania was also one of the very first retailers to offer condoms online when it launched its [https://www.condomania.com/ website] in December 1995.

Condom sales increased every year until 1994, when media attention to the AIDS pandemic began to decline.  In response, manufacturers have changed the tone of their advertisements from scary to humorous.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|303–4}}  New developments continue to occur in the condom market, with the first polyurethane condom—branded Avanti and produced by the manufacturer of Durex—introduced in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|324–5}}  Durex was also the first condom brand to have a website, launched in 1997.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|319}}  Worldwide condom use is expected to continue to grow: one study predicted that developing nations would need 18.6 billion condoms in 2015.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|342}}

==Etymology and other terms==
Etymological theories for the word "condom" abound. By the early 18th century, the invention and naming of the condom was attributed to an associate of England's [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], and this explanation persisted for several centuries. However, the "Dr. Condom" or "Earl of Condom" described in these stories has never been proved to exist, and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before King Charles II ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|54,68}}

==Major manufacturers==
One analyst described the size of the condom market as something that "boggles the mind". Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government-run manufacturing plants exist around the world.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|322,328}}  Within the condom market, there are several major contributors, among them both for-profit businesses and philanthropic organizations.

In 1882, German immigrant Julius Schmidt founded one of the largest and longest-lasting condom businesses, Julius Schmid, Inc., based in New York City (he dropped the 't' from his name in an effort to appear less Jewish). The condom lines manufactured by Schmid included Sheiks and Ramses.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|154–6}}  In 1932, the London Rubber Company (which had previously been a wholesale business importing German condoms) began to produce latex condoms, under the Durex brand.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|199,201,218}}  In 1962 Schmid was purchased by London Rubber. In 1987, London Rubber began acquiring other condom manufacturers, and within a few years became an important international company. In the late 1990s, London Rubber (by then London International Limited) merged all the Schmid brands into its European brand, Durex.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|324–6}}  Soon after, London International was purchased by Seton Scholl Healthcare (manufacturer of Dr. Scholl's footcare products), forming [[SSL International|Seton Scholl Limited]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|327}}

Youngs Rubber Company, founded by Merle Youngs in late 19th century America, introduced the [[Trojan (condoms)|Trojan]] line of condoms.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|191}}  In 1985, Youngs Rubber Company was sold to Carter-Wallace. The Trojan name switched hands yet again in 2000 when Carter-Wallace was sold to [[Church and Dwight]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|323–4}}

The Australian division of [[Dunlop Rubber]] began manufacturing condoms in the 1890s. In 1905, Dunlop sold its condom-making equipment to one of its employees, Eric Ansell, who founded [[Ansell Limited|Ansell Rubber]]. In 1969, Ansell was sold back to Dunlop.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|327}}  In 1987, English business magnate [[Richard Branson]] contracted with Ansell to help in a campaign against HIV and AIDS. Ansell agreed to manufacture the Mates brand of condom, to be sold at little or no profit in order to encourage condom use. Branson soon sold the Mates brand to Ansell, with royalty payments made annually to the charity [[Virgin Unite]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|309,311}}&lt;!-- The ref says "Healthcare Foundation"; the name was changed to "Virgin Unite" in 2004--&gt;  In addition to its Mates brand, Ansell currently manufactures Lifestyles and Lifesan for the U.S. market.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|333}}

In 1934 the Kokusia Rubber Company was founded in Japan. It is now known as the Okamoto Rubber Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|257}}

In 1970 Tim Black and [[Phil Harvey|Philip Harvey]] founded Population Planning Associates (now known as [[Adam &amp; Eve (business)|Adam &amp; Eve]]). Population Planning Associates was a mail-order business that marketed condoms to American college students, despite U.S. laws against sending contraceptives through the mail. Black and Harvey used the profits from their company to start a non-profit organization [[Population Services International]].

In 1987, Tufts University students Davin Wedel and Adam Glickman started Global Protection Corp. in response to C. Everett Koop's statement that "a condoms can save your life." Since that time, Global Protection Corp. has become known for its innovative approach to condom marketing and its support of more than 3500 non-profit organizations worldwide. The company has numerous patents and trademarks to its name, including the only FDA-approved glow-in-the-dark condom, the Pleasure Plus condom and the original condom keychain. In 2005 the company introduced its newest product, One Condoms. One represents a complete reinvention of retail condom brands, combining sleek metal packaging, innovative condom wrappers and innovative marketing programs. One is also the first condom brand to donate 5% of sales to the development of sexual health outreach and educational programs. In South Africa, some manufacturers have considered introducing an extra-large variety of condoms after several complaints from South African men claiming the condoms were too small and causing [[discomfort]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4155390.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="85624">[[Horizontal gene transfer|Horizontal or lateral gene transfer]] (HGT or LGT) is the transmission of portions of genomic [[DNA]] between organisms through a process decoupled from [[Vertical transfer|vertical inheritance]]. In the presence of HGT events, different fragments of the [[genome]] are the result of different [[evolution]]ary histories. This can therefore complicate the investigations of evolutionary relatedness of lineages and species. Also, as HGT can bring into genomes radically different [[genotype]]s from distant lineages, or even new [[gene]]s bearing new functions, it is a major source of [[phenotype|phenotypic]] innovation and a mechanism of [[niche adaptation]]. For example, of particular relevance to human health is the lateral transfer of [[antibiotic resistance]] and [[pathogenicity]] determinants, leading to the emergence of pathogenic lineages.&lt;ref name=Hiramatsu2001/&gt;

'''Inferring horizontal gene transfer''' through [[computational phylogenetics|computational]] identification of HGT events relies upon the investigation of sequence composition or evolutionary history of genes. Sequence composition-based ("parametric") methods search for deviations from the genomic average whereas evolutionary history-based ("[[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]]") approaches identify genes whose evolutionary history significantly differs from that of the host [[species]]. The evaluation and benchmarking of HGT inference methods typically rely upon simulated genomes, for which the true history is known. On real data, different methods tend to infer different HGT events, and as a result it can be difficult to ascertain all but simple and clear-cut HGT events.

==Overview==
Horizontal gene transfer was first observed in 1928, in [[Frederick Griffith]]'s [[Griffith's experiment|experiment]]: showing that virulence was able to pass from virulent to non-virulent strains of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', Griffith demonstrated that genetic information can be horizontally transferred between [[bacteria]] via a mechanism known as [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]].&lt;ref name="Griffith1928"/&gt; Similar observations in the 1940s&lt;ref name="Lederberg1946"/&gt; and 1950s&lt;ref name="Zinder1952"/&gt; showed evidence that [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] and [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] are additional mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer.&lt;ref name="Jones1970"&gt;{{Cite journal

To infer HGT events, which may not necessarily result in [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] changes, most contemporary methods are based on analyses of genomic sequence data. These methods can be broadly separated into two groups: parametric and phylogenetic methods (see [[#Fig-1|Figure 1]]). Parametric methods search for sections of a genome that significantly differ from the genomic average, such as [[GC-content|GC content]] or [[Codon usage bias|codon usage]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence2002" /&gt; Phylogenetic methods examine evolutionary histories of genes involved and identify conflicting phylogenies. Phylogenetic methods can be further divided into those that reconstruct and compare [[phylogenetic tree]]s explicitly, and those that use surrogate measures in place of the phylogenetic trees.&lt;ref name="Dessimoz2008" /&gt;

The main feature of parametric methods is that they only rely on the genome under study to infer HGT events that may have occurred on its lineage. It has been a considerable advantage at the early times of the sequencing era, when few closely related genomes were available for comparative methods. However, because they rely on the uniformity of the host's signature to infer HGT events, not accounting for the host's intra-genomic variability will result in overpredictions&amp;mdash;flagging native segments as possible HGT events.&lt;ref name="Guindon2001" /&gt; Similarly, the transferred segments need to exhibit the donor's signature and to be significantly different from the recipient's.&lt;ref name="Lawrence2002" /&gt; Furthermore, genomic segments of foreign origin are subject to the same [[mutation]]al processes as the rest of the host genome, and so the difference between the two tends to vanish over time, a process referred to as amelioration.&lt;ref name="Lawrence1997" /&gt; This limits the ability of parametric methods to detect ancient HGTs.

Phylogenetic methods benefit from the recent availability of [[List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes|many sequenced genomes]]. Indeed, as for all [[comparative biology|comparative]] methods, phylogenetic methods can integrate information from multiple genomes, and in particular integrate them using a model of evolution. This lends them the ability to better characterize the HGT events they infer—notably by designating the donor species and time of the transfer. However, models have limits and need to be used cautiously. For instance, the conflicting phylogenies can be the result of events not accounted for by the model, such as unrecognized [[Homology (biology)#Paralogy|paralogy]] due to [[Gene duplication|duplication]] followed by [[Human evolutionary genetics#Gene loss|gene losses]]. Also, many approaches rely on a reference species tree that is supposed to be known, when in many instances it can be difficult to obtain a reliable tree. Finally, the computational costs of reconstructing many gene/species trees can be prohibitively expensive. Phylogenetic methods tend to be applied to genes or [[protein sequence]]s as basic evolutionary units, which limits their ability to detect HGT in regions outside or across gene boundaries.

(1) Parametric methods infer HGT by computing a statistic, here GC content, for a sliding window and comparing it to the typical range over the entire genome, here indicated between the two red horizontal lines. Regions with atypical values are inferred as having been horizontally transferred. (2) Phylogenetic approaches rely on the differences between genes and species tree evolution that result from HGT. Explicit phylogenetic methods reconstruct gene trees and infer the HGT events likely to have resulted into that particular gene tree. Implicit phylogenetic methods bypass gene tree reconstruction, e.g., by looking at discrepancies between pairwise distances between genes and their corresponding species.]]

Because of their complementary approaches&amp;mdash;and often non-overlapping sets of HGT candidates&amp;mdash;combining [[Prediction#Prediction in science|predictions]] from parametric and phylogenetic methods can yield a more comprehensive set of HGT [[candidate gene]]s. Indeed, combining different parametric methods has been reported to significantly improve the quality of predictions.&lt;ref name="Azad2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Xiong2012" /&gt; Moreover, in the absence of a comprehensive set of true horizontally transferred genes, discrepancies between different methods&lt;ref name="Becq2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Poptsova2009" /&gt; might be resolved through combining parametric and phylogenetic methods. However, combining inferences from multiple methods also entails a risk of an increased [[Type I and type II errors|false-positive rate]].&lt;ref name="Poptsova2007" /&gt;

==Parametric methods==
Parametric methods to infer HGT use characteristics of the genome sequence specific to particular species or [[clade]]s, also called [[genomic signature]]s. If a fragment of the genome strongly deviates from the genomic signature, this is a sign of a potential horizontal transfer. For example, because bacterial GC content falls within a wide range (see [[#Fig-2|Figure 2]]), GC content of a genome segment is a simple genomic signature. Commonly used genomic signatures include [[nucleotide]] composition,&lt;ref name="Daubin2003" /&gt; [[oligonucleotide]] frequencies,&lt;ref name="Lawrence1998" /&gt; or structural features of the genome.&lt;ref name="Worning2000" /&gt;

To detect HGT using parametric methods, the host's genomic signature needs to be clearly recognizable. However, the host's genome is not always uniform with respect to the genome signature: for example, GC content of the third codon position is lower close to the [[DNA replication|replication]] terminus &lt;ref name="Deschavanne1995" /&gt; and GC content tends to be higher in highly [[gene expression|expressed]] genes.&lt;ref name="Wuitschick1999" /&gt; Not accounting for such intra-genomic variability in the host can result in over-predictions, flagging native segments as HGT candidates.&lt;ref name="Guindon2001" /&gt; Larger sliding windows can account for this variability at the cost of a reduced ability to detect smaller HGT regions.&lt;ref name="Becq2010" /&gt;

Just as importantly, horizontally transferred segments need to exhibit the donor's genomic signature. This might not be the case for ancient transfers where transferred sequences are subjected to the same mutational processes as the rest of the host genome, potentially causing their distinct signatures to "ameliorate"&lt;ref name="Lawrence1997" /&gt; and become undetectable through parametric methods. For example, ''[[Bdellovibrio|Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus]]'', a predatory [[Deltaproteobacteria|δ-Proteobacterium]], has homogeneous GC content, and it might be concluded that its genome is resistant to HGT.&lt;ref name="Rendulic2004" /&gt; However, subsequent analysis using phylogenetic methods identified a number of ancient HGT events in the genome of ''B. bacteriovorus''.&lt;ref name="Gophna2006" /&gt; Similarly, if the inserted segment was previously ameliorated to the host's genome, as is the case for [[prophage]] insertions,&lt;ref name="Vernikos2007" /&gt; parametric methods might miss predicting these HGT events. Also, the donor's composition must significantly differ from the recipient's to be identified as abnormal, a condition that might be missed in the case of short- to medium-distance HGT, which are the most prevalent. Furthermore, it has been reported that recently acquired genes tend to be [[GC-content|AT-richer]] than the recipient's average,&lt;ref name="Daubin2003" /&gt; which indicates that differences in GC-content signature may result from unknown post-acquisition mutational processes rather than from the donor's genome.

===Nucleotide composition===
{{anchor|Fig-2}}[[Image:Inferring horizontal gene transfer average GC content.svg|400px|thumb|right|Figure 2. Average GC content of coding regions compared to the genome size for selected bacteria. There is considerable variation in average GC content across species, which makes it relevant as a genomic signature.]]

Bacterial GC content falls within a wide range, with ''Ca. Zinderia insecticola'' having a GC content of 13.5%&lt;ref name="McCutcheon2010" /&gt; and ''[[Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans]]'' having a GC content of 75%&lt;ref name="Liu2008" /&gt; (see [[#Fig-2|Figure 2]]). Even within a closely related group of [[Alphaproteobacteria|α-Proteobacteria]], values range from approximately 30% to 65%.&lt;ref name="Bentley2004" /&gt; These differences can be exploited when detecting HGT events as a significantly different GC content for a genome segment can be an indication of foreign origin&lt;ref name="Daubin2003" /&gt; (see [[#Fig-2|Figure 2]]).

===Oligonucleotide spectrum===
The oligonucleotide spectrum (or [[k-mer]] frequencies) measures the frequency of all possible nucleotide sequences of a particular length in the genome. It tends to vary less within genomes than between genomes and therefore can also be used as a genomic signature.&lt;ref name="Karlin1995" /&gt; A deviation from this signature suggests that a genomic segment might have arrived through horizontal transfer.

The oligonucleotide spectrum owes much of its discriminatory power to the number of possible oligonucleotides: if n is the size of the vocabulary and w is oligonucleotide size, the [[Exponentiation#Combinatorial interpretation|number of possible distinct oligonucleotides]] is n&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;; for example, there are 4&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;=1024 possible pentanucleotides. Some methods can capture the signal recorded in motifs of variable size,&lt;ref name="Vernikos2006" /&gt; thus capturing both rare and discriminative motifs along with frequent, but more common ones.

[[Codon usage bias]], a measure related to [[DNA codon table|codon]] frequencies, was one of the first detection methods used in methodical assessments of HGT.&lt;ref name="Lawrence1998" /&gt; This approach requires a host genome which contains a bias towards certain synonymous codons (different codons which code for the same amino acid) which is clearly distinct from the bias found within the donor genome. The simplest oligonucleotide used as a genomic signature is the dinucleotide, for example the third nucleotide in a codon and the first nucleotide in the following codon represent the dinucleotide least restricted by [[amino acid]] preference and codon usage.&lt;ref name="Hooper2002" /&gt;

It is important to optimise the size of the sliding window in which to count the oligonucleotide frequency: a larger sliding window will better buffer variability in the host genome at the cost of being worse at detecting smaller HGT regions.&lt;ref name="Deschavanne1999" /&gt; A good compromise has been reported using tetranucleotide frequencies in a sliding window of 5&amp;nbsp;[[Base pair#Length measurements|kb]] with a step of 0.5kb.&lt;ref name="Dufraigne2005" /&gt;

A convenient method of modelling oligonucleotide genomic signatures is to use [[Markov chain]]s. The transition probability matrix can be derived for endogenous vs. acquired genes,&lt;ref name="Cortez2009" /&gt; from which Bayesian [[Posterior probability|posterior probabilities]] for particular stretches of DNA can be obtained.&lt;ref name=Nakamura2004 /&gt;

===Structural features===
Just as the nucleotide composition of a DNA molecule can be represented by a sequence of letters, its structural features can be encoded in a numerical sequence. The structural features include [[Interaction energy|interaction energies]] between neighbouring base pairs,&lt;ref name="Ornstein1978" /&gt; the angle of twist that makes two bases of a [[base pair|pair]] non-[[Coplanarity|coplanar]],&lt;ref name="elHassan1996" /&gt; or DNA deformability induced by the proteins shaping the chromatin.&lt;ref name="Olson1998" /&gt;

The [[autocorrelation]] analysis of some of these numerical sequences show characteristic periodicities in complete genomes.&lt;ref name="Herzel1999" /&gt; In fact, after detecting [[archaea]]-like regions in the [[Thermophile|thermophilic]] bacteria ''[[Thermotoga maritima]]'',&lt;ref name="Nelson1999" /&gt; periodicity spectra of these regions were compared to the periodicity spectra of the [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] regions in the archaea ''[[Pyrococcus horikoshii]]''.&lt;ref name="Worning2000" /&gt; The revealed similarities in the periodicity were strong supporting evidence for a case of massive HGT between the bacteria and the archaea [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]].&lt;ref name="Worning2000" /&gt;

===Genomic context===
The existence of [[genomic island]]s, short (typically 10–200kb long) regions of a genome which have been acquired horizontally, lends support to the ability to identify non-native genes by their [[Locus (genetics)|location]] in a genome.&lt;ref name="Langille2010" /&gt; For example, a gene of ambiguous origin which forms part of a non-native [[operon]] could be considered to be non-native. Alternatively, flanking [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repeat sequences]] or the presence of nearby [[integrase]]s or [[transposase]]s can indicate a non-native region.&lt;ref name="Hacker1997" /&gt; A [[machine learning|machine-learning]] approach combining oligonucleotide frequency scans with context information was reported to be effective at identifying genomic islands.&lt;ref name="Vernikos2008" /&gt; In another study, the context was used as a secondary indicator, after removal of genes which are strongly thought to be native or non-native through the use of other parametric methods.&lt;ref name="Azad2011" /&gt;

==Phylogenetic methods==
The use of phylogenetic analysis in the detection of HGT was advanced by the availability of many newly sequenced genomes. Phylogenetic methods detect inconsistencies in gene and species evolutionary history in two ways: explicitly, by reconstructing the gene tree and reconciling it with the reference species tree, or implicitly, by examining aspects that correlate with the evolutionary history of the genes in question, e.g., patterns of presence/absence across species, or unexpectedly short or distant pairwise evolutionary distances.

===Explicit phylogenetic methods===
The aim of explicit phylogenetic methods is to compare gene trees with their associated species trees. While weakly supported differences between gene and species trees can be due to inference uncertainty, statistically significant differences can be suggestive of HGT events (see [[#Fig-1a|Figure 1a]]). For example, if two genes from different species share the most recent ancestral connecting node in the gene tree, but the respective species are spaced apart in the species tree, an HGT event can be invoked. Such an approach can produce more detailed results than parametric approaches because the involved species, time and direction of transfer can potentially be identified.

As discussed in more detail below, phylogenetic methods range from simple methods merely identifying discordance between gene and species trees to mechanistic models inferring probable sequences of HGT events. An intermediate strategy entails deconstructing the gene tree into smaller parts until each matches the species tree (genome spectral approaches).

Explicit phylogenetic methods rely upon the accuracy of the input rooted gene and species trees, yet these can be challenging to build.&lt;ref name="Altenhoff2012" /&gt; Even when there is no doubt in the input trees, the conflicting phylogenies can be the result of evolutionary processes other than HGT, such as duplications and losses, causing these methods to erroneously infer HGT events when [[Homology (biology)#Paralogy|paralogy]] is the correct explanation. Similarly, in the presence of [[incomplete lineage sorting]], explicit phylogeny methods can erroneously infer HGT events.&lt;ref name="Than2007" /&gt; That is why some explicit model-based methods test multiple evolutionary scenarios involving different kinds of events, and compare their fit to the data given [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] or [[Probability theory|probabilistic]] criteria.

====Tests of topologies====
To detect sets of genes that fit poorly to the reference tree, one can use [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical tests]] of topology, such as the Kishino–Hasegawa (KH),&lt;ref name="Goldman2000" /&gt; Shimodaira–Hasegawa (SH),&lt;ref name="Shimodaira1999" /&gt; and Approximately Unbiased (AU)&lt;ref name="Shimodaira2002" /&gt; tests. These tests assess the likelihood of the gene [[sequence alignment]] when the reference topology is given as the null hypothesis.

The rejection of the reference [[topology]] is an indication that the evolutionary history for that [[gene family]] is inconsistent with the reference tree. When these inconsistencies cannot be explained using a small number of non-horizontal events, such as gene loss and duplication, an HGT event is inferred.

One such analysis checked for HGT in groups of homologs of the [[Gammaproteobacteria|γ-Proteobacterial]] lineage.&lt;ref name="Lerat2003" /&gt; Six reference trees were reconstructed using either the highly conserved small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences, a consensus of the available gene trees or concatenated alignments of [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthologs]]. The failure to reject the six evaluated topologies, and the rejection of seven alternative topologies, was interpreted as evidence for a small number of HGT events in the selected groups.

Tests of topology identify differences in tree topology taking into account the uncertainty in tree inference but they make no attempt at inferring ''how'' the differences came about. To infer the specifics of particular events, genome spectral or [[Tree rearrangement|subtree pruning and regraft]] methods are required.

====Genome spectral approaches====
In order to identify the location of HGT events, genome spectral approaches decompose a gene tree into substructures (such as [[Bipartite graph|bipartitions]] or quartets) and identify those that are consistent or inconsistent with the species tree.

'''Bipartitions'''
Removing one [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|edge]] from a reference tree produces two unconnected sub-trees, each a disjoint set of nodes&amp;mdash;a bipartition. If a bipartition is present in both the gene and the species trees, it is compatible; otherwise, it is conflicting. These conflicts can indicate an HGT event or may be the result of uncertainty in gene tree inference. To reduce uncertainty, bipartition analyses typically focus on strongly supported bipartitions such as those associated with branches with [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] values or posterior probabilities above certain thresholds. Any gene family found to have one or several conflicting, but strongly supported, bipartitions is considered as an HGT candidate.&lt;ref name="Zhaxybayeva2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beiko2005" /&gt;

'''Quartet decomposition'''
Quartets are trees consisting of four leaves. In bifurcating (fully resolved) trees, each internal branch induces a quartet whose leaves are either subtrees of the original tree or actual leaves of the original tree. If the topology of a quartet extracted from the reference species tree is embedded in the gene tree, the quartet is compatible with the gene tree. Conversely, incompatible strongly supported quartets indicate potential HGT events.&lt;ref name="Zhaxybayeva2006" /&gt; Quartet mapping methods are much more [[Algorithmic efficiency|computationally efficient]] and naturally handle heterogeneous representation of taxa among gene families, making them a good basis for developing large-scale scans for HGT, looking for highways of gene sharing in databases of hundreds of complete genomes.&lt;ref name="Bansal2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bansal2013" /&gt;

====Subtree pruning and regrafting====
A mechanistic way of modelling an HGT event on the reference tree is to first cut an internal branch—i.e., prune the tree—and then regraft it onto another edge, an operation referred to as [[Tree rearrangement|subtree pruning and regrafting]] (SPR).&lt;ref name="Hallett2001" /&gt; If the gene tree was topologically consistent with the original reference tree, the editing results in an inconsistency. Similarly, when the original gene tree is inconsistent with the reference tree, it is possible to obtain a consistent topology by a series of one or more prune and regraft operations applied to the reference tree. By interpreting the edit path of pruning and regrafting, HGT candidate nodes can be flagged and the host and donor genomes inferred.&lt;ref name="Beiko2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baroni2005"/&gt; To avoid reporting false positive HGT events due to uncertain gene tree topologies, the optimal "path" of SPR operations can be chosen among multiple possible combinations by considering the branch support in the gene tree. Weakly supported gene tree edges can be ignored a priori&lt;ref name="Beiko2006" /&gt; or the support can be used to compute an optimality criterion.&lt;ref name="Nakhleh2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abby2010" /&gt;

Because conversion of one tree to another by a minimum number of SPR operations is [[NP-hard|NP-Hard]],&lt;ref name="Hickey2008" /&gt; solving the problem becomes considerably more difficult as more nodes are considered. The computational challenge lies in finding the optimal edit path, i.e., the one that requires the fewest steps,&lt;ref name="Hein1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen2001" /&gt; and different strategies are used in solving the problem. For example, the HorizStory algorithm reduces the problem by first eliminating the consistent nodes;&lt;ref name="MacLeod2005" /&gt; recursive pruning and regrafting reconciles the reference tree with the gene tree and optimal edits are interpreted as HGT events. The SPR methods included in the supertree reconstruction package SPRSupertrees substantially decrease the time of the search for the optimal set of SPR operations by considering multiple localised sub-problems in large trees through a clustering approach.&lt;ref name="Whidden2014" /&gt;

====Model-based reconciliation methods====
Reconciliation of gene and species trees entails mapping evolutionary events onto gene trees in a way that makes them concordant with the species tree. Different reconciliation models exist, differing in the types of event they consider to explain the incongruences between gene and species tree topologies. Early methods exclusively modelled horizontal transfers (T).&lt;ref name="Hallett2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakhleh2005"/&gt; More recent ones also account for duplication (D), loss (L), [[incomplete lineage sorting]] (ILS) or [[homologous recombination]] (HR) events. The difficulty is that by allowing for multiple types of events, the number of possible reconciliations increases rapidly. For instance, a conflicting gene tree topologies might be explained in terms of a single HGT event or multiple duplication and loss events. Both alternatives can be considered plausible reconciliation depending on the frequency of these respective events along the species tree.

Reconciliation methods can rely on a [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimonious]] or a [[Computational phylogenetics#Maximum likelihood|probabilistic]] framework to infer the most likely scenario(s), where the relative cost/probability of D, T, L events can be fixed a priori or estimated from the data.&lt;ref name="Doyon2011"/&gt; The space of DTL reconciliations and their parsimony costs—which can be extremely vast for large multi-copy gene family trees—can be efficiently explored through [[dynamic programming]] algorithms.&lt;ref name="Doyon2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DavidAlm2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szollosi2012" /&gt; In some programs, the gene tree topology can be refined where it was uncertain to fit a better evolutionary scenario as well as the initial sequence alignment.&lt;ref name="DavidAlm2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nguyen2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szollosi2013b" /&gt; More refined models account for the biased frequency of HGT between closely related lineages,&lt;ref name="BansalAlm2012" /&gt; reflecting the loss of efficiency of [[Homologous recombination|HR]] with phylogenetic distance,&lt;ref name="Majewski2000" /&gt; for [[incomplete lineage sorting|ILS]],&lt;ref name="Sjostrand2014" /&gt; or for the fact that the actual donor of most HGT belong to extinct or unsampled lineages.&lt;ref name="Szollosi2013a" /&gt; Further extensions of DTL models are being developed towards an integrated description of the genome evolution processes. In particular, some of them consider horizontal at multiple scales&amp;mdash;modelling independent evolution of gene fragments&lt;ref name="Haggerty2014" /&gt; or recognising [[co-evolution]] of several genes (e.g., due to co-transfer) within and across genomes.&lt;ref name="Szollosi2014" /&gt;

===Implicit phylogenetic methods===
In contrast to explicit phylogenetic methods, which compare the agreement between gene and species trees, implicit phylogenetic methods compare evolutionary distances or sequence similarity. Here, an unexpectedly short or long distance from a given reference compared to the average can be suggestive of an HGT event (see [[#Fig-1|Figure 1]]). Because tree construction is not required, implicit approaches tend to be simpler and faster than explicit methods.

However, implicit methods can be limited by disparities between the underlying correct phylogeny and the evolutionary distances considered. For instance, the most similar sequence as obtained by the highest-scoring [[BLAST]] hit is not always the evolutionarily closest one.&lt;ref name="Koski2001" /&gt;

====Top sequence match in a distant species====
A simple way of identifying HGT events is by looking for high-scoring sequence matches in distantly related species. For example, an analysis of the top BLAST hits of protein sequences in the bacteria ''Thermotoga maritima'' revealed that most hits were in archaea rather than closely related bacteria, suggesting extensive HGT between the two;&lt;ref name="Nelson1999" /&gt; these predictions were later supported by an analysis of the structural features of the DNA molecule.&lt;ref name="Worning2000" /&gt;

However, this method is limited to detecting relatively recent HGT events. Indeed, if the HGT occurred in the [[Common descent|common ancestor]] of two or more species included in the database, the closest hit will reside within that clade and therefore the HGT will not be detected by the method. Thus, the threshold of the minimum number of foreign top BLAST hits to observe to decide a gene was transferred is highly dependent on the taxonomic coverage of sequence databases. Therefore, experimental settings may need to be defined in an ad-hoc way.&lt;ref name="WisniewskiDye2011" /&gt;

====Discrepancy between gene and species distances====
The [[molecular clock]] hypothesis posits that homologous genes evolve at an approximately constant rate across different species.&lt;ref name="Zuckerkandl1962" /&gt; If one only considers homologous genes related through [[Speciation|speciation events]] (referred to as “orthologous" genes), their underlying tree should by definition correspond to the species tree. Therefore, assuming a molecular clock, the evolutionary distance between orthologous genes should be approximately proportional to the evolutionary distances between their respective species. If a putative group of orthologs contains [[Xenolog#Xenology|xenologs]] (pairs of genes related through an HGT), the proportionality of evolutionary distances may only hold among the orthologs, not the xenologs.&lt;ref name="Novichkov2004" /&gt;

Simple approaches compare the distribution of similarity scores of particular sequences and their orthologous counterparts in other species; HGT are inferred from outliers.&lt;ref name="Lawrence1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke2002" /&gt; The more sophisticated DLIGHT ('Distance Likelihood-based Inference of Genes Horizontally Transferred') method considers simultaneously the effect of HGT on all sequences within groups of putative orthologs:&lt;ref name="Dessimoz2008" /&gt; if a [[likelihood-ratio test]] of the HGT hypothesis versus a hypothesis of no HGT is significant, a putative HGT event is inferred. In addition, the method allows inference of potential donor and recipient species and provides an estimation of the time since the HGT event.

====Phylogenetic profiles====
A group of orthologous or homologous genes can be analysed in terms of the presence or absence of group members in the reference genomes; such patterns are called [[Phylogenetic profiling|phylogenetic profiles]].&lt;ref name="Pellegrini1999" /&gt; To find HGT events, phylogenetic profiles are scanned for an unusual distribution of genes. Absence of a homolog in some members of a group of closely related species is an indication that the examined gene might have arrived via an HGT event. For example, the three facultatively symbiotic ''[[Frankia|Frankia sp.]]'' strains are of strikingly different sizes: 5.43 Mbp, 7.50 Mbp and 9.04 Mbp, depending on their range of hosts.&lt;ref name="Normand2007" /&gt; Marked portions of strain-specific genes were found to have no significant hit in the reference database, and were possibly acquired by HGT transfers from other bacteria. Similarly, the three phenotypically diverse ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strains ([[Uropathy|uropathogenic]], [[Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli|enterohemorrhagic]] and benign) share about 40% of the total combined [[gene pool]], with the other 60% being strain-specific genes and consequently HGT candidates.&lt;ref name="Welch2002" /&gt; Further evidence for these genes resulting from HGT was their strikingly different codon usage patterns from the core genes and a lack of [[Synteny|gene order conservation]] (order conservation is typical of vertically evolved genes).&lt;ref name="Welch2002" /&gt; The presence/absence of homologs (or their effective count) can thus be used by programs to reconstruct the most likely evolutionary scenario along the species tree. Just as with [[#Model-based reconciliation methods|reconciliation methods]], this can be achieved through parsimonious&lt;ref name="Csuros2008" /&gt; or probabilistic estimation of the number of gain and loss events.&lt;ref name="Pagel1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csuros2009" /&gt; Models can be complexified by adding processes, like the truncation of genes,&lt;ref name="HaoGolding2010" /&gt; but also by modelling the heterogeneity of rates of gain and loss across lineages&lt;ref name="HaoGolding2006" /&gt; and/or gene families.&lt;ref name="Csuros2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HaoGolding2008" /&gt;

====Clusters of polymorphic sites====
Genes are commonly regarded as the basic units transferred through an HGT event. However it is also possible for HGT to occur within genes. For example, it has been shown that horizontal transfer between closely related species results in more exchange of [[Open reading frame|ORF]] fragments,&lt;ref name="Ochman2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Papke2004" /&gt; a type a transfer called [[gene conversion]], mediated by homologous recombination. The analysis of a group of four ''Escherichia coli'' and two ''[[Shigella flexneri]]'' strains revealed that the sequence stretches common to all six strains contain [[Gene polymorphism|polymorphic sites]], consequences of homologous recombination.&lt;ref name="Mau2006" /&gt; Clusters of excess of polymorphic sites can thus be used to detect tracks of DNA recombined with a distant relative.&lt;ref name="Didelot2007" /&gt; This method of detection is, however, restricted to the sites in common to all analysed sequences, limiting the analysis to a group of closely related organisms.

==Evaluation==
The existence of the numerous and varied methods to infer HGT raises the question of how to validate individual inferences and of how to compare the different methods.

A main problem is that, as with other types of phylogenetic inferences, the actual evolutionary history cannot be established with certainty. As a result, it is difficult to obtain a representative [[test set]] of HGT events. Furthermore, HGT inference methods vary considerably in the information they consider and often identify inconsistent groups of HGT candidates:&lt;ref name="Lawrence2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ragan2001" /&gt; it is not clear to what extent taking the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]], the [[Union (set theory)|union]], or some other combination of the individual methods affects the [[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|false positive]] and [[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|false negative]] rates.&lt;ref name="Poptsova2007" /&gt;

Parametric and phylogenetic methods draw on different sources of information; it is therefore difficult to make general statements about their relative performance. Conceptual arguments can however be invoked. While parametric methods are limited to the analysis of single or pairs of genomes, phylogenetic methods provide a natural framework to take advantage of the information contained in multiple genomes. In many cases, segments of genomes inferred as HGT based on their anomalous composition can also be recognised as such on the basis of phylogenetic analyses or through their mere absence in genomes of related organisms. In addition, phylogenetic methods rely on explicit models of sequence evolution, which provide a well-understood framework for parameter inference, hypothesis testing, and model selection. This is reflected in the literature, which tends to favour phylogenetic methods as the standard of proof for HGT.&lt;ref name="Ragan2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kechris2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moran2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Danchin2010" /&gt; The use of phylogenetic methods thus appears to be the preferred standard, especially given that the [[Moore's law|increase in computational power]] coupled with algorithmic improvements has made them more tractable,&lt;ref name="Whidden2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szollosi2013a" /&gt; and that the ever denser sampling of genomes lends more power to these tests.

Considering phylogenetic methods, several approaches to validating individual HGT inferences and benchmarking methods have been adopted, typically relying on various forms of [[Computer simulation|simulation]]. Because the truth is known in simulation, the number of false positives and the number of false negatives are straightforward to compute. However, simulating data do not trivially resolve the problem because the true extent of HGT in nature remains largely unknown, and specifying rates of HGT in the simulated model is always hasardous. Nonetheless, studies involving the comparison of several phylogenetic methods in a simulation framework could provide quantitative assessment of their respective performances, and thus help the biologist in choosing objectively proper tools.&lt;ref name="Abby2010" /&gt;

Standard tools to simulate sequence evolution along trees such as INDELible&lt;ref name="Fletcher2009" /&gt; or PhyloSim&lt;ref name="Sipos2011" /&gt; can be adapted to simulate HGT. HGT events cause the relevant gene trees to conflict with the species tree. Such HGT events can be simulated through subtree pruning and regrafting rearrangements of the species tree.&lt;ref name="Beiko2006" /&gt; However, it is important to simulate data that are realistic enough to be representative of the challenge provided by real datasets, and simulation under complex models are thus preferable. A model was developed to simulate gene trees with heterogeneous substitution processes in addition to the occurrence of transfer, and accounting for the fact that transfer can come from now [[Extinction|extinct]] donor lineages.&lt;ref name="Galtier2007" /&gt; Alternatively, the genome evolution simulator ALF&lt;ref name="Dalquen2012" /&gt; directly generates gene families subject to HGT, by accounting for a whole range of evolutionary forces at the base level, but in the context of a complete genome. Given simulated sequences which have HGT, analysis of those sequences using the methods of interest and comparison of their results with the known truth permits study of their performance. Similarly, testing the methods on sequence known not to have HGT enables the study of false positive rates.

Simulation of HGT events can also be performed by manipulating the biological sequences themselves. Artificial [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric genomes]] can be obtained by inserting known foreign genes into random positions of a host genome.&lt;ref name="Becq2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortez2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsirigos2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Azad2005" /&gt; The donor sequences are inserted into the host unchanged or can be further evolved by simulation,&lt;ref name="Dessimoz2008" /&gt; e.g., using the tools described above.

One important caveat to simulation as a way to assess different methods is that simulation is based on strong simplifying assumptions which may favour particular methods.&lt;ref name="Iantorno2014" /&gt;

The '''Institute of Art and Ideas'''&lt;ref&gt;https://iai.tv/about-iai/introducing-iai&lt;/ref&gt; is an arts organisation founded in 2008 in London. Its programming includes the world's largest philosophy and music festival, [[HowTheLightGetsIn]]&lt;ref name="iai"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iai.tv/about-iai/introducing-iai |title=Introducting the IAI. |publisher=Institute of Art and Ideas |date= |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the online channel [https://iai.tv/player IAI TV], where talks and debates can be accessed for free, under the slogan "Philosophy for our times."&lt;ref name="iai"/&gt;

The IAI's main offering, [[HowTheLightGetsIn]], is held annually in [[Hay-on-Wye]] at the globe at Hay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeathay.org/about-us/ |title=About the globe. |publisher=The globe at Hay |date= |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAI is led by its founding director, the British post-realist philosopher and former broadcaster [[Hilary Lawson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iai.tv/home/host/hilary-lawson |title=Hilary Lawson: Profile. |publisher=Institute of Art and Ideas |date= |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IAI TV==

IAI TV is an online channel where the debates and talks curated by the IAI are released and made available online. Subjects include philosophy, science, politics and art.

In September 2016 the videos had received in excess of 670,000 views, reaching over 1,000,000 people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/interview-hilary-lawson-director-of-how-the-light-gets-in/ |title=Interview: Hilary Lawson, Director of How the Light Gets In. |publisher=Wales Art Review |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hilary Lawson in an interview in 2014: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One of the things we're up to is breaking down the idea of philosophy as being the sort of thing that is undertaken only by a specialist and is impenetrable. Not to say laughable, frankly. And I think when we started – I founded the Institute of Art and Ideas seven years ago, two years before the first HowTheLightGetsIn – that was indeed the only way people thought about philosophy. But every human being, in a way, is a philosopher. Because that's what it is to be human. You wonder about life. You wonder about what you're doing. You wonder about where you're going. You wonder: "What the hell's going on"'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/apr/27/howthelightgetsin-2014-philosophy-music-hay-on-wye |title=HowTheLightGetsIn 2014: philosophy, music and thought for all |publisher=The Guardian |date=27 April 2014 |accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===IAI Academy===
IAI Academy is an educational platform of free online courses in philosophy, politics, art and science.  Since September 2016, new courses have been published on a monthly basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8181">'''Johann Jakob Griesbach''' (4 January 1745 – 24 March 1812), German biblical [[textual critic]], was born at [[Butzbach]], a small town in the state of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], where his father, Konrad Kaspar (1705–1777), was pastor. Griesbach's fame rests upon his work in [[New Testament]] criticism, in which he inaugurated a new epoch. His solution to the [[synoptic problem]] bears his name, but the [[Griesbach hypothesis]] has been modernly referred to as the [[Two-Gospel hypothesis]].
[[File:Griesbach1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Johann Jakob Griesbach]]

==Education and career==
Griesbach was educated at [[Frankfurt]], and at the universities of [[university of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[university of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[university of Halle|Halle]], where he became one of [[Johann Salomo Semler|J. S. Semler]]'s most ardent disciples. It was Semler who induced him to turn his attention to the textual criticism of the New Testament. At the close of his undergraduate career he undertook a literary tour through Germany, the Netherlands, France and England. In England he may have met [[Henry Owen]] whose seminal work ''Observations on the Four Gospels'' (1764) is listed among the books of Griesbach's estate, although he does not seem to have acknowledged any indebtedness to Owen.

On his return to Halle, Griesbach acted for some time as ''Privatdozent'', but in 1773 was appointed to a professorial chair; in 1775 he went to the [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena|University of Jena]], where he spent the rest of his life (though he received calls to other universities).

==New Testament text critic==
[[File:Johann Jacob Griesbach.jpg|thumb]]
Griesbach's critical edition of the [[New Testament]] first appeared at Halle, in three volumes, in 1774-1775. The first volume contained the first three Gospels, synoptically arranged; the second, the [[Epistles]] and the [[book of Revelation]]. All the historical books were reprinted in one volume in 1777, the synoptical arrangement of the Gospels having been abandoned as inconvenient. Of the second edition, considerably enlarged and improved, the first volume appeared in 1796 and the second in 1806 (Halle and London). Of a third edition, edited by David Schulz, only the first volume, containing the four Gospels, appeared (1827).

For the construction of his critical text Griesbach took as his basis the [[House of Elzevir|''Elzevir'']] edition. Where he differed from it he placed the ''Elzevir'' reading on the inner margin along with other readings he thought worthy of special consideration (these last, however, being printed in smaller type). To all the readings on this margin he attached special marks indicating the precise degree of probability in his opinion attaching to each. In weighing these probabilities he proceeded upon a particular theory which in its leading features he had derived from [[Johann Albrecht Bengel|J. A. Bengel]] and J. S. Semler, dividing all the manuscripts into three main groups – the [[Alexandria]]n, the Western and the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]].

A reading supported by only one [[recension]] he considered as having only one witness in its favour; those readings which were supported by all the three recensions, or even by two of them, especially if these two were the Alexandrian and the Western, he unhesitatingly accepted as genuine. Only when each of the three recensions gives a different reading does he proceed to discuss the question on other grounds.

See his ''Symbolae criticae ad supplendas et corrigendas variarum N. T. lectionum collectiones'' (Halle, 1785, 1793), and his ''Commentarius criticus in textum Graecum N. T.'', which extends to the end of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and discusses the more important various readings with great care and thoroughness (Jena, 1794 if.).

Among the other works of Griesbach (which are comparatively unimportant) may be mentioned his university thesis ''De codicibus quatuor evangelislarum Origenianis'' (Halle, 1771) and a work upon [[systematic theology]] (''Anleitung zur Kenntniss der populären Dogmatik'', Jena, 1779). His ''Opuscula'', consisting chiefly of university "Programs" and addresses, were edited by [[Johann Philipp Gabler|Gabler]] (2 vols, Jena, 1824).

==Gospel Synopsis==
In 1776 Griesbach published his Greek Gospel synopsis of Matthew, Mark and Luke as a volume separate from his critical edition of the New Testament (cf. above), of which it had previously been a part, and thereby established the tool of a synopsis as an essential research aid in New Testament studies.

For Griesbach's hypothesis concerning the interrelation of the Gospel accounts of Matthew, Mark and Luke, and its modern variant, see [[Griesbach hypothesis]].

==Johann Jakob Griesbach Bicentenary Colloquium 1776-1976==
To mark the bicentenary of the publication of Griesbach's Gospel synopsis as a separate volume a group of distinguished international biblical scholars met in July 1976 at Münster/Westphalia for ''The Johann Jakob Griesbach Bicentenary Colloquium 1776-1976''.

A selection of the papers presented at the colloquium appraising Griesbach's life, work and influence, aimed "to indicate why an understanding of this scholar's contribution to New Testament criticism is important both for the history of New Testament scholarship and for contemporary research", together with the text in Latin and in English translation of ''The Dissertation of J. J. Griesbach, Doctor of Theology and Principal Professor in the University of Jena, in which he demonstrates that the entire Gospel of Mark has been extracted from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, written in the name of the University of Jena (1789–1790), now revised and furnished with many additions'', are to be found in [[Bernard Orchard]] and [[Thomas R. W. Longstaff]] (ed.), ''J. J. Griesbach: Synoptic and Text-Critical Studies 1776-1976'', Volume 34 in the SNTS Monograph Series (Cambridge University Press, hardback 1978, paperback 2005 {{ISBN|0-521-02055-7}}).

The '''Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory''' or KSO is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] affiliated with the Institute of Geophysics, Astrophysics and Meteorology out of the [[University of Graz]]. It is located near [[Villach]] on the southern border of [[Austria]].

Its Web page at http://www.kso.ac.at/ usually posts current images of the sun, especially in the hydrogen-alpha line that is the strongest visible-light line of hydrogen and that reveals the solar chromosphere.

==History==
Founded in 1941 by the German [[Luftwaffe]] to research the effects of the Sun on the Earth's [[ionosphere]], the KSO focuses on multispectral synoptic observations of the sun using several telescope on the same mount.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3282">The '''Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology''' (German: “Konrad-Lorenz-Institut für Vergleichende Verhaltensforschung“ or KLIVV) is a research institute in [[Vienna]], Austria, dedicated to studying behavioral biology and the links between animal behaviour and conservation. Founded by the animal photographer Otto Koenig and his wife, the illustrator Lilli Koenig as “Biologische Station Wilhelminenberg” (Biological Station Wilhelminenberg) in 1945, it was later named after the Nobel laureate [[Konrad Lorenz]] and incorporated into the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna]] in 2011.

==History and organisation==
The “Biologische Station Wilheminenberg” was founded by the biologist couple Otto and Lilli Koenig in response to the ground-breaking research in the field of comparative ethology, including the work by Konrad Lorenz. The research institute was established in abandoned army barracks&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencev2.orf.at/stories/1671239/&lt;/ref&gt; in the outskirts of Vienna’s 16th district [[Ottakring]] at the onset of the [[Vienna Woods]], and endowed with substantial space and facilities supported by private means.

The facility developed and was re-structured into the Institute of Ethology of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1967. Otto Koenig, who became a public figure through his role as a presenter of nature documentaries,&lt;ref&gt;https://idw-online.de/de/news609724&lt;/ref&gt; remained director also after this re-structuring until his retirement in 1984. He was succeeded by the ornithologist Hans Winkler. When Konrad Lorenz died in 1989, the institute was renamed after him.

Under the leadership of Hans Winkler, the Konrad Lorenz Institute was gradually modernised and both laboratories and staff were extended. This resulted in substantial refurbishments between 1985 and 2002, when Dustin J. Penn succeeded Winkler as director.

In 2011, the Konrad Lorenz Institute was merged with the Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology and both facilities became part of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. Both research institutes combined now provide a facility for approximately 80 scientists. Director of the new institute is Walter Arnold. Since spring 2015, the Konrad Lorenz Institute is also the headquarter of the Austrian Ornithological Centre (AOC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/konrad-lorenz-institute-of-ethology/austrian-ornithological-centre-aoc/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The scientific work at the Konrad Lorenz Institute traditionally focusses on ethology and evolutionary aspects of animal behaviour, in particular related to sexual selection and sexual conflicts. The restructuring of 2011 broadened the research objectives to include physiological and ecological aspects of wild animals in interaction with their environment.

'''Lesbian sexual practices''' are [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] involving [[women who have sex with women]], regardless of their [[sexual orientation]]. A woman who has sex with another woman may identify as a [[lesbian]] if she is exclusively sexually attracted to women, or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] if she is not exclusively sexually attracted to women, or dispense with [[sexual identification]] altogether. The term may also be applied to a [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[asexuality|asexual]] woman who is unsure of or is exploring her sexuality.

[[Romance (love)|Romantic]] or sexual [[interpersonal relationship]]s are often subject to [[sexual desire]] and [[sexual arousal|arousal]], which then leads to sexual activity for sexual release. A physical expression of intimacy between women depends on the context of the relationship along with social, cultural and other influences.&lt;ref name="Hite reports"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hite Reports: What do they say?|publisher=hite-research.com|date= |accessdate=November 19, 2011|url=http://www.hite-research.com/thehitereports.htm|archivedate=June 1, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601230726/http://www.hite-research.com/thehitereports.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviors==

===General===
[[File:Oral nipple stimulation.png|thumb|A woman [[stimulation of nipples|orally stimulating the nipples]] of her sexual partner]]
Commonly, women engage in displays of affection, such as kissing on the cheek or hugging. A kiss on the lips, a prolonged kiss or hug, or other forms of touching, may or may not be regarded as [[Human sexuality|sexual]]. [[Sex educator]] and [[feminist]] [[Shere Hite]] stated that one of her female research subjects had written, "Sex with a woman includes: touching, kissing, smiling, looking serious, embracing, talking, digital intercourse, caressing, looking, cunnilingus, undressing, remembering later, making sounds, sometimes gently biting, sometimes crying, and breathing and sighing together."&lt;ref name="Hite/lesbianism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesbianism: Women's Sexual Expression Together|publisher=hite-research.com|date=|accessdate=February 3, 2012|url=http://www.hite-research.com/artlesbianism.html|archivedate=October 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017143602/http://www.hite-research.com/artlesbianism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disrobing before a partner, removing the clothing of a partner or performing acts of [[physical intimacy]], such as the touching of a partner's [[erogenous zone]]s by the use of hands, tongue or rest of the mouth, may be regarded as indicators of the partner's desire for sexual activity and an [[erotic stimuli]] or turn-on (sexual arousal), which may generate erotic sensations in both partners. Allowing such acts of physical intimacy, especially the stimulation of a partner's breasts and nipples, is an indication of  reciprocal interest in sexual activity.

A woman's mouth, lips and tongue may be sensitive erogenous zones; they are commonly used by partners during the preliminary stages and throughout a sexual activity, whether for kissing, sucking, licking or specifically for [[oral sex]]. The stimulation of a partner's breasts, including [[Stimulation of nipples|oral or manual stimulation of the nipples]], is a form of [[foreplay]]. Breast and nipple stimulation of women is a common aspect of sexual activity.&lt;ref name=levin&gt;Levin, Roy J.

An [[orgasm]] includes involuntary actions, including muscular [[spasm]]s in multiple areas of the body, a general [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]] sensation and, frequently, body movements and [[Manner of articulation|vocalization]]s.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society| publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2012|pages=133–135| isbn = 0618755713|accessdate=May 12, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XiqoUOWGDcfcqQHFpIDIAw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period after orgasm, known as a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]], is often a relaxing experience, attributed to the release of the [[neurohormone]]s oxytocin and prolactin.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book| title =Psychology| publisher =[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|year= 2010|page=336|accessdate =May 12, 2014| isbn = 1429237198|url = https://books.google.com/?id=emAyzTNy1cUC&amp;pg=PA336&amp;dq=Women+do+experience+a+refractory+period#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author1=Daniel L.

=== Oral sex, manual stimulation and tribadism===
[[File:Wiki-cunnilingus.png|thumb|right|Woman performing [[cunnilingus]] on her sex partner]]
Oral stimulation of the [[clitoris]] or other parts of [[vulva]] or the [[vagina]] is commonly practiced between women and, like oral stimulation of the nipples, can include the use of teeth in addition to use of the lips or tongue.&lt;ref name="Carroll2"&gt;{{cite book|title =Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity|isbn = 0-495-60274-4|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2009|page=272|accessdate=2010-12-19|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | author =Janell L.

[[Fingering (sexual act)|Fingering]] (manual stimulation) involves the use of the fingers to massage a woman's clitoris or other parts of the vulva, the vagina, or anus.

===Dominance, submission and BDSM===

On occasion, for variety, or on a more regular or routine basis, a woman may assume a passive role during sexual activity and leave it to her partner to provide their sexual satisfaction, which can also be an aspect of [[dominance and submission]]. For example, a person in a doggy style position may be passive and open to a variety of sex acts, generally at the choice of the active partner, such as fingering from behind, massage or stimulation of erogenous zones, including the genitals, nipples, or buttocks, and receiving a [[erotic spanking|playful spank]] to the buttocks.&lt;ref name= Rogiere&gt;Rogiere, Jean, "The Little Book of Sex". Ulysses Press. 2001. {{ISBN|1-56975-305-9}}, 96 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; The active partner can also introduce a sex toy, such as a dildo or [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]], into the vagina or anus.

To ensure passivity and to enhance the feeling of or actual [[female submission]], a partner may also take part in [[sexual bondage|bondage]] (such as handcuffs) or in other [[BDSM]] activities.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimmel"/&gt; During sexual bondage, the restrained partner is generally open to a variety of sex acts and cannot interfere in the ensuing sexual activity. She is dependent for her sexual satisfaction on the actions of her partner, who can choose the type and pace of the sexual activity and can introduce sex toys. For example, a [[pecker gag]] can be used to [[gag (BDSM)|gag]] the restrained partner as well as to require her to suck during sexual activity in a similar manner to an [[adult pacifier]]. The active partner has the role of treating the restrained partner as a [[sex object]] to be used for her own sexual satisfaction. The active partner may herself derive sexual satisfaction from providing her sex partner with sexual satisfaction and bringing her to orgasm.

In 1953, [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'' documented that, over the previous five years of sexual activity, 78% of women had orgasms in 60% to 100% of sexual encounters with other women, compared with 55% for heterosexual sex.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, A.]]; [[Wardell Pomeroy|Pomeroy, W.]]; [[Clyde Martin|Martin, C.]], &amp; [[Paul Gebhard|Gebhard, P.]] ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', Philadelphia: Saunders (1953), {{ISBN|978-0-253-33411-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do.&lt;ref name="Weiten"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st Century|isbn =1-111-18663-4|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|page=386|accessdate=January 5, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&amp;pg=PT423|author1=Wayne Weiten |author2=Dana S. Dunn |author3=Elizabeth Yost Hammer }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, studies by several scholars, including [[Masters and Johnson]], concluded that lesbian sexual behaviors more often have qualities associated with sexual satisfaction than their heterosexual counterparts, or that female partners are more likely to emphasize the emotional aspects of lovemaking.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iasenza"&gt;Iasenza, S. [http://www.fridae.com/newsfeatures/2001/11/09/1173.the-big-lie-lesbian-bed-death ''The Big Lie: Lesbian Bed Death''], [[Fridae]] newsletter (November 9, 2001). Retrieved on June 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Masters and Johnson's 1979 study on lesbian sexual practices concluded that lesbian sexual encounters include more full-body sexual contact, rather than genital-focused contact, less preoccupation or anxiety about achieving orgasm, more sexual assertiveness and communication about sexual needs, [[Human sexual response cycle|longer lasting sexual encounters]] and greater satisfaction with the overall quality of one's sexual life.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iasenza"/&gt;

Studies by [[Pepper Schwartz]] and Philip Blumstein (1983) and Diane Holmberg and Karen L. Blair (2009) contradict research indicating that women in same-sex relationships are more sexually satisfied than their heterosexual counterparts. Schwartz concluded that lesbian couples in committed relationships have less sex than any other type of couple, and that they generally experience less sexual intimacy the longer the relationship lasts, though this study has been subject to debate (see [[Lesbian bed death]]).&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iasenza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCroy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Winnie|last=McCroy|title=The Myth of Lesbian Bed Death|date=June 22, 2010|accessdate=February 20, 2011|publisher=''[[The Village Voice]]''|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-22/news/myth-of-lesbian-bed-death/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowling"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nikki|last=Dowling|title=Girl On Girl: Lesbian Bed Death Is A Big, Fat Myth |date=February 25, 2010|accessdate=February 20, 2011|publisher=''[[The Frisky (website)|The Frisky]]''|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/post/246-girl-on-girl-i-think-lesbian-bed-death-is-a-big-fat-myth/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmberg and Blair's study, on the other hand, published in ''[[Journal of Sex Research|The Journal of Sex Research]]'', found that women in same-sex relationships enjoyed identical sexual desire, sexual communication, sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with orgasm as their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv |title=Sexual Desire, Communication, Satisfaction, and Preferences of Men and Women in Same-Sex Versus Mixed-Sex Relationships |first1=Diane |last1=Holmberg |first2=Karen Lyndsay |last2=Blair |pages=57–66 |doi=10.1080/00224490802645294 |issn=1559-8519 |journal=[[Journal of Sex Research|The Journal of Sex Research]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] |format=PDF |url=http://www.klbresearch.com/KLB_Research/Research_files/Holmberg%20&amp;%20Blair%20JSR%20Vol%2046%20Iss%201%202009.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021062010/http://www.klbresearch.com/KLB_Research/Research_files/Holmberg%20%26%20Blair%20JSR%20Vol%2046%20Iss%201%202009.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research by Blair &amp; Pukall (2014) reported similar findings, such that women in same-sex relationships reported similar levels of overall sexual satisfaction and lower levels of sexual frequency. However, this recent study also reported that women in same-sex relationships spent significantly longer amounts of time on individual sexual encounters - often spending upwards of two hours on an individual encounter. Consequently, what lesbians may lack in frequency, they may make up for with longer durations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|title=Can Less Be More?

With regard to the ease or difficulty of achieving orgasm, Hite's research (while subject to methodological limitations) showed that most women need clitoral (exterior) stimulation for orgasm, which can be "easy and strong, given the right stimulation" and that the need for clitoral stimulation in addition to knowing one's own body is the reason that most women reach orgasm more easily by masturbation.&lt;ref name="Hite reports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hite Report"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hite|first=Shere|authorlink=Shere Hite|title=The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|year=2004|location=New York, NY|pages=512 pages|isbn=1-58322-569-2|accessdate=March 2, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s3OZaVn2wfkC&amp;lpg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replicating Kinsey's findings, studies by scholars such as Peplau, Fingerhut and Beals (2004) and Diamond (2006) indicate that lesbians have orgasms more often and more easily in sexual interactions than heterosexual women do.&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;

Preferences for specific sexual practices among female same-sex relationships have also been studied. Masters and Johnson concluded that vaginal penetration with dildos is rare and lesbians tend to do more overall genital stimulation than direct clitoral stimulation, which is also often the case for heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; Concerning oral sex, the common belief that all women who have sex with women engage in cunnilingus contrasts research on the subject. Some lesbian or bisexual women dislike oral sex because they do not like the experience or due to psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean.&lt;ref name="Belge2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy|last=Belge|title=Do All Lesbians Like Oral Sex?|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=|accessdate=June 3, 2012|url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiansex/f/DoAllLesbiansLikeOral.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi B.

There are also lesbians who may or may not like [[anal sex]].&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kat Harding|title=The Lesbian Kama Sutra|isbn = 0-312-33585-7|publisher=Macmillan|year=2006 |page=31|accessdate=2011-02-03|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m5RkdiYYMBMC&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado. When asked what techniques they used in their last 10 sexual encounters, 100% reported kissing, sucking on breasts, and manual stimulation of the clitoris; more than 90% reported French kissing, oral sex, and fingers inserted into the vagina; and 80% reported tribadism. Lesbians in their 30s were twice as likely as other age groups to engage in anal stimulation (with a finger or dildo).&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; A 2014 study of partnered lesbian women in Canada and the U.S. found that 7% engaged in anal stimulation or penetration at least once a week; about 10% did so monthly and 70% did not at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Jacqueline N.|last2=Byers|first2=E.

In 2003, Julia V Bailey and her research team published data based on a sample from the [[United Kingdom]] of 803 lesbian and bisexual women attending two London lesbian sexual health clinics and 415 women who have sex with women (WSW) from a community sample; the study reported that the most commonly cited sexual practices between women "were oral sex, digital vaginal penetration, mutual masturbation, and tribadism (frottage with genital-to-genital contact or rubbing of the genitals against another part of the partner's body), each of which occurred in 85% of [women who have sex with women]". Like older studies, the data also showed that vaginal penetration with dildos, or with other sex toys, among women who have sex with women is rare.&lt;ref name="Zenilman &amp; Shahmanesh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual behaviour of lesbians and bisexual women|author1=J V Bailey |author2=C Farquhar |author3=C Owen |author4=D Whittaker |journal=[[Sexually Transmitted Infections (journal)|Sexually Transmitted Infections]]|volume=79|issue=2|date=April 2003|pmid=12690139|doi=10.1136/sti.79.2.147|pages=147–150|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1744617/pdf/v079p00147.pdf|pmc=1744617}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 online survey of 3,116 women who have sex with women, published in ''[[The BMJ]]'', found the majority of women reporting a history of genital rubbing (99.8%), vaginal fingering (99.2%), genital scissoring (90.8%), cunnilingus (98.8%) and vibrator use (74.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22563015 | doi=10.1136/sextrans-2011-050404 | volume=88 | title=Sexual behaviour and risk reduction strategies among a multinational sample of women who have sex with women | year=2012 | journal=Sex Transm Infect | pages=407–12 | last1 = Schick | first1 = V | last2 = Rosenberger | first2 = JG | last3 = Herbenick | first3 = D | last4 = Reece | first4 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==

Like most sexual activity, lesbian sexual activities can carry risks of [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs), such as [[Herpes genitalis|genital herpes]] or other [[pathogen]]ic infections. When lesbian sexual activity is of a non-penetrative nature, the risk of exchange of [[bodily fluid]]s is generally lower and therefore the incidence of transmission of sexually transmitted infections is also relatively low,&lt;ref name="Hales"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dianne Hales|title=An Invitation to Health Brief 2010-2011| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2008|accessdate=August 29, 2013|pages =269–271| isbn =0495391921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Alexander|author2= Helaine Bader|author3= Judith H.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) did not recognize female-to-female transmission as a possible method of HIV infection until 1995. The CDC reported there is little data available regarding the risk of spreading sexually transmitted infections between women.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; However, the CDC states that pathogens such as metronidazole-resistant [[trichomoniasis]], genotype-concordant HIV, [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV, which has been linked to nearly all cases of [[cervical cancer]]) and [[syphilis]] can be spread through sexual contact between women.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; While the rates of these pathologies are unknown, one study showed 30% of lesbians and bisexual women had medical histories with sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee R |title=Health care problems of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender patients |journal=West. J. Med. |volume=172 |issue=6 |pages=403–8 |date=Jun 2000 |pmid=10854396 |pmc=1070935 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.172.6.403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that sexually active lesbians are exposed to higher health risks than the general population. Health Canada noted "the prevalence of all types of HPV (cancer and non-cancer-causing) in different groups of Canadian women ranges from 20%–33%" and an American university study found 60% of sexually active females were infected with HPV at some time within a three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Genuis|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Genuis|first2=Shelagh K.|title=Managing the sexually transmitted disease pandemic: A time for reevaluation|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=191|issue=4|pages=1103–1112|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2004.03.019|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2004.03.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[American Family Physician]]'' suggests that lesbian and bisexual women "cover sex toys that penetrate more than one person's vagina or anus with a new condom for each person" and to "consider using different toys for each person", to use a [[Barrier contraception|protection barrier]] (for example, a latex sheet, [[dental dam]], cut-open condom or, plastic wrap) during oral sex and to "use latex or vinyl gloves and lubricant for any manual sex that might cause bleeding unprotected contact with a sexual partner's menstrual blood and with any visible genital lesions".&lt;ref name="Mravack"/&gt; However, there "is no good evidence" that using a dental dam reduces STI transmission risks between women who have sex with women; studies show that using a dental dam as a protection barrier is rarely practiced, and that, among women who have sex with women, this may be because the individuals have "limited knowledge about the possibilities of STI transmission or [feel] less vulnerable to STIs [such as HIV]".&lt;ref name=" Zenilman &amp; Shahmanesh"/&gt;

The '''Marsh Chapel Experiment''', also called the "'''Good Friday Experiment'''", was a 1962 experiment conducted on [[Good Friday]] at [[Boston University]]'s [[Marsh Chapel]]. [[Walter N. Pahnke]], a graduate student in theology at [[Harvard Divinity School]], designed the experiment under the supervision of [[Timothy Leary]] and the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]].&lt;ref name="Pahnke 1966"/&gt; Pahnke's experiment investigated whether [[psilocybin]] (the active principle in [[psilocybin mushroom]]s) would act as a reliable [[entheogen]] in religiously predisposed subjects.&lt;ref name="Pahnke PhD" /&gt;

==Experiment==
Prior to the Good Friday service, graduate degree divinity student volunteers from the [[Boston]] area were randomly divided into two groups. In a [[double-blind]] experiment, half of the students received psilocybin, while a [[control group]] received a large dose of [[niacin]]. Niacin produces clear physiological changes and thus was used as an [[active placebo]]. In at least some cases, those who received the niacin initially believed they had received the psychoactive drug.&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|5}} However, the feeling of face flushing (turning red, feeling hot and tingly) produced by niacin subsided after about an hour after receiving the dose. However, the effects of the psilocybin intensified over the first few hours. 

Almost all of the members of the experimental group reported experiencing profound religious experiences, providing empirical support for the notion that [[psychedelic drug]]s can facilitate religious experiences. One of the participants in the experiment was religious scholar [[Huston Smith]], who would become an author of several textbooks on [[comparative religion]]. He later described his experience as "the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced".&lt;ref name= "Smith 2000"/&gt;

==Doblin's follow-up==
In a 25-year follow-up to the experiment, all of the subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of "a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life".&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|13}} Psychedelic researcher [[Rick Doblin]] considered Pahnke's original study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the [[double-blind]] procedure, and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire. Nevertheless, Doblin said that Pahnke's study cast "a considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non-drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long-term effects".&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|24}} A similar sentiment was expressed by clinical psychologist William A. Richards, who in 2007 stated "[psychedelic] mushroom use may constitute one technology for evoking revelatory experiences that are similar, if not identical, to those that occur through so-called spontaneous alterations of brain chemistry."&lt;ref name="Richards 2008"/&gt;

==Griffiths' study==
In 2002 (published in 2006), a more rigorously controlled version of this experiment was conducted at [[Johns Hopkins University]] by [[Roland R. Griffiths]], yielding similar results.&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2006"/&gt; In a 14-month follow-up to this study, over half of the participants rated the experience among the top five most meaningful spiritual experiences in their lives, and considered the experience to have increased their personal well-being and life satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2008"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5753">'''Mismatch loss''' in [[transmission line]] theory is the amount of power expressed in [[decibels]] that will not be available on the output due to impedance mismatches and [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|signal reflections]].  A transmission line that is properly terminated, that is, terminated with the same impedance as that of the [[characteristic impedance]] of the transmission line, will have no reflections and therefore no mismatch loss.  Mismatch loss represents the amount of power wasted in the system.  It can also be thought of as the amount of power gained if the system was perfectly matched.  [[Impedance matching]] is an important part of RF system design; however, in practice there will likely be some degree of mismatch loss.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, David J. (2004). Ground penetrating radar (2nd Edition).  Institution of Engineering and Technology. {{ISBN|978-0-86341-360-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In real systems, relatively little loss is due to mismatch loss and is often on the order of 1dB.

== Calculation ==
Mismatch loss (ML) is the ratio of incident power to the difference between incident and reflected power:

[[File:T line img.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1. Simple circuit showing characteristic impedance Z&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and the load impedance Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. In a perfectly matched system Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;=Z&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, and there is no mismatch loss.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
ML_\mathrm{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \bigg(\frac{P_i}{P_i-P_r}\bigg) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
P_r=P_i - P_d\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; = incident power&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_r&lt;/math&gt; = reflected power&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_d&lt;/math&gt; = delivered power (also called the ''accepted power'')

The fraction of incident power delivered to the load is

[[File:T line img2.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 2. Simple circuit showing incident power, P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, on a load. The reflected power will be the difference between P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and the power delivered, P&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{P_d}{P_i}=1-\rho^2
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the [[reflection coefficient]].  Note that as the reflection coefficient approaches zero, power to the load is maximized.

If the reflection coefficient is known, mismatch can be calculated by&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
ML_\mathrm{dB} = - 10 \log_{10} \bigg(1-\rho^2\bigg) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
In terms of the voltage standing wave ratio ([[VSWR]]):

:&lt;math&gt;
ML_\mathrm{dB} = - 10 \log_{10} \bigg(1-\bigg(\frac{VSWR-1}{VSWR+1}\bigg)^2\bigg) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Lo YT and Lee SW 1988 Antenna handbook: Theory, Applications, and Design&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of mismatch loss==

Any component of the transmission line that has an input and output will contribute to the overall mismatch loss of the system.  For example, in mixers mismatch loss occurs when there is an impedance mismatch between the RF port and IF port of the mixer.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Joseph J. (2002). RF components and circuits.  Oxford: Newnes. {{ISBN|0-7506-4844-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the principal reasons for losses in mixers.  Likewise, a large amount of the loss in [[amplifiers]] comes from the mismatch between the input and output.  Consequently, not all of the available power generated by the amplifier gets transferred to the load.&lt;ref&gt;Skolnik, Merrill I. (2001). Introduction to radar systems (3rd Edition).  New York: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-288138-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is most important in antenna systems where mismatch loss in the transmitting and receiving antenna directly contributes to the losses the system—including the system [[noise figure]].  Other common RF system components such as [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]], [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]]s, [[power splitter|splitter]]s, and [[combiner]]s will generate some amount of mismatch loss.  While completely eliminating mismatch loss in these components is near impossible, mismatch loss contributions by each component can be minimized by selecting quality components for use in a well designed system.

==Mismatch error==
&lt;ref&gt;White, Joseph F. (2004). High frequency techniques: An introduction to RF and microwave engineering.  Hoboken: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-45591-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there are two or more components in cascade as is often the case, the resultant mismatch loss is not only due to the mismatches from the individual components, but also from how the reflections from each component combine with each other.  The overall mismatch loss cannot be calculated by just adding up the individual loss contributions from each component.  The difference between the sum of the mismatch loss in each component and total mismatch loss due to the interactions of the reflections is known as mismatch error.  Depending on how the multiple reflections combine, the overall system loss may be lower or higher than the sum of the mismatch loss from each component.  Mismatch error occurs in pairs as the signal reflects off of each mismatched component.  So for the example in Figure 3, there are mismatch errors generated by each pair of components.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, John N. (2004). Target detection by marine radar.  Institution of Engineering and Technology. {{ISBN|978-0-86341-359-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mismatch uncertainty increases as the frequency increases, and in wide-band applications.  The phasing of the reflections makes it particularly harder to model.

The general case for calculating mismatch error (ME) is:

[[File:T line img3.jpg|thumb|Figure 3. Simple circuit showing multiple reflections due to more than 1 mismatched device.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
ME_\mathrm{dB} = 20 \log_{10} \bigg(1-\rho_1\rho_2\,e^{-j2\theta}\bigg) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the complex phase change due to the second reflection

[[File:Postilion.png|thumb|300px|right|This English etching from 1793 shows a postillion mounted on the front left horse]]
"'''My [[postillion]] has been struck by lightning'''", "'''Our postillion has been struck by lightning'''", and other variations on the same pattern, are often given as examples of the ridiculous phrases supposed to have been found in [[phrase book]]s or language instruction in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The word ''postillion'' may occur in its alternative spelling ''[[postilion]]''.

Although various forms of the sentence are widely cited, the exact wording and the context in which it is said to have originally been used vary.  For example, a teaching manual attributes it to a Portuguese-English phrasebook:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|title=Teaching English as a Foreign Language

|isbn=0-415-05882-1
|page=41
|edition=2nd
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIancY-fnR0C
}}; emphasis added
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The phrase-book for Portuguese learners of English which included the often-quoted and bizarre sentence  'Pardon me, but '''your postillion has been struck by lightning'''' demonstrates a total lack of sense of context: who can have said this, to whom and in what circumstances?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By contrast a linguistics textbook mentions the supposedly "apocryphal" phrase during a description of foreign language teaching in "the schoolrooms of Europe at the close of the nineteenth century":&lt;ref&gt;

|pages=31–32
}}; emphasis added
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]entences—especially constructed to contain only the grammar and vocabulary which had already been covered—were laboriously translated, in writing, into and out of the student's first language. Such sentences, often bizarrely remote from any conceivable use, have been the occasion for jokes ever since.  We have probably all heard references to the apocryphal "'''My postilion has been struck by lightning'''" and the infamous ''[[La plume de ma tante (linguistics)|plume de ma tante]]''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin==
During the nineteenth century, publishers began producing multilingual phrase-books for businessmen and wealthy travellers. An early example is Georg Wolfrum's ''Handbuch für Jünglinge'' (1825), which gives English, German, French and Italian versions of "Are the postilions insolent?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]'s ''Handbook of Travel-Talk'' (1847) includes a section entitled "Accidents on a Journey".  It gives English, French, German and Italian translation suggestions for a variety of mishaps which might befall a traveller, such as one's postillion becoming injured, or finding oneself in stormy weather:&lt;ref&gt;

A theatre review in the September 14, 1889 issue of the London illustrated weekly ''The Graphic'' includes a phrase very similar to the one under discussion, attributing it to Murray's travel guide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=The Graphic |date=1889-09-14 |title=Theatres |page=335 |location=London |volume=xl |issue=1033 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Graphic_1889-09-14_335.png}}; emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The proprietor of the {{sc|Greenwich}} Theatre has hit on the notion of ornamenting his playbills with a picture of the house, on which every exit is marked in conspicuous fashion.  Somebody has objected that in the face of fire or panic no one would be likely to consult this guide to the methods of escape.  This reminds one of the criticism of a gentleman on Mr. Murray's "Travel Talk," when he found the exclamation, "'''Dear me, our postillion has been struck dead by lightning!'''" set forth for his convenience in four languages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The August 30, 1916 issue of the [[United Kingdom|British]] magazine [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] includes this item:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106019661831?urlappend=%3Bseq=170 ''Punch'', August 30, 1916; v. 151, p.162, col. 3]; emphasis added&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; An officer serving in the Balkans writes to say that he has just come across a Hungarian-English phrase-book which starts with the useful phrase, "'''My postilion has been struck by lightning'''."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another usage of the phrase occurs in a 1932 book entitled ''Little Missions'', written by "Septimus Despencer":&lt;ref&gt;Despencer (1932), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It was my fortune once to be marooned for twenty-four hours in a siding of a railway station in what is now [[Yugoslavia|Jugoslavia]] but was then South Hungary.   I wandered into the village, and in the village shop which sold everything I found a dozen of old second-hand books.  One of them was a Magyar-English Manual of Conversation containing useful phrases such as every traveller needs to know. The first section was headed  'On the road', and the first sentence in it (which I instantly mastered) was: ''''Dear me, our postilion has been struck by lightning'''.'  This is the sort of thing that only happens in Hungary; and, when it happens, this is the sort of remark that only Hungarians make.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to its introduction, the travels reported in the book occurred during "[t]he three years following the armistice of 1918":&lt;ref&gt;
Despencer (1932), [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/paultabaka/0/etc/despencer/septimus.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:19:34 p. 5]; emphasis added.
&lt;/ref&gt; thus Despencer's discovery of the phrase would be dated during the period 1919-1921.  In the April 2008 issue of the ''Quote ... Unquote'' newsletter, Nigel Rees speculates that the phrase "passed into general circulation" from Despencer's book.&lt;ref&gt;

==Notable sightings==
In [[James Thurber]]'s 1937 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article "There's No Place Like Home", a phrasebook from "the era of Imperial Russia" contains the "magnificent" line: "Oh, dear, our postillion has been struck by lightning!".  Thurber speculates that such a "fantastic piece of disaster" must have been rare, "even in the days of the Czars".&lt;ref name="thurber"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Thurber heard of the quote from "an writer in a London magazine".&lt;ref name="thurber"/&gt;

In [[James Michener]]'s 1954 novel [[Sayonara]], the heroine Hana-Ogi tries to learn a little English from a phrasebook to communicate with her American lover and based on its recommendation starts with this phrase, much to his bewilderment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, the author laments the death in a thunderstorm of "the best postilion I ever had".

In 1977 actor [[Dirk Bogarde]] titled the first volume of his autobiography ''A Postillion Struck By Lightning''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Bogarde, he heard of the sentence while on a childhood holiday in France.  It came from an old French phrase-book belonging to the nanny of another family.&lt;ref&gt;Bogarde, op. cit., pp. 102, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1995 paper, linguist [[David Crystal]] defined "postilion sentences" as "sentences introduced in teaching [that] seem to have little or no chance of ever being used in real life".&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  They are named after the phrase "The postilion has been struck by lightning", which Crystal describes as a famous example of such a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  He goes on to suggest that "an unexpectedly large number of sentences, used routinely with children with language impairment, are of this type",&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and gives as examples "That table's got four legs", and "Clap (your) hands!".&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  He concludes that, "if teaching and therapeutic time is to be truly efficacious", postilion sentences should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, professor [[Massimo Grattarola]] of the [[Biophysics]] and Electrical Engineering Department (DIBE) at the [[University of Genoa]], in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], created an undergraduate and graduate program named '''neurobioengineering''' (also referred to as '''neuroengineering''').&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Marco Bove, In Memoriam Website for Dr. M. Grattarola, University of Genova, Italy - https://web.archive.org/web/20020714024312/http://www.bio.dibe.unige.it/people/Grattarola/grattarola.htm
&lt;/ref&gt; The program was designed to amalgamate [[anthropomorphic robot]]ics, [[artificial intelligence]], [[bioelectronics]],&lt;ref name="MOSFETs 1998"&gt;Bioelectronics - MOSFETs, Biosensors and Neurons - M. Grattarola, McGraw-Hill; April 8, 1998.

Neurobioengineering deals with the study and application of bio-compatible neuro-prosthetic implants, neural sensors and interfaces with the nervous system.

The goal of that branch is to develop a bio-artificial brain of cultured neurons capable of replicating human behaviour in an artificial robotic system. The European Union F.E.T. funded the neurobioengineering department to pursue this ambitious project.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Physics, Journal of Neural Engineering Vol 5, Issue 4. http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1741-2552/2/4/E01/jne5_4_e01.pdf?request-id=6f3a87c4-a31f-486e-b2b0-3756a52e060c&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The neurobioengineering program spawned numerous journal publications by the departmental scientific pioneers (Dr. Marco Bove, Dr. Sergio Martinoia, Dr. Renato Zaccaria, and many others) and a university course textbook [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0070031746  Bioelectronics, MOSFETS, Biosensors and Neurons] &lt;ref name="MOSFETs 1998"/&gt; published by Massimo Grattarola. Members of the department were collaborating with researchers throughout the [[European Union]], [[Japan]] and [[North America]]. Students from throughout the [[European Union]] and [[Canada]] enrolled in the program.

==Comparable international efforts==
At the time (1995), a small number of universities offered specialized bioelectronics and/or implantable neuro-prostheses-related research (but no specialized undergraduate programs) internationally for example: [[University of Utah]], [[MIT]], [[UCSF]] ([[United States]]); [[McGill University]] ([[Canada]]), among others.

==First European School on Neuroengineering==
In 2003, following professor Grattarola's death, the University of Genova announced Europe's first neurobioengineering conference in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;Abstract Paper Neuroengineering School http://www.neuroinf.org/lists/comp-neuro/2003/0037.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The First European School on Neuroengineering 'Massimo Grattarola' was also founded in 2004, with the goal of establishing a long-term formal educational program to foster future pioneers in neurobioengineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unige.it&lt;/ref&gt;

In a state of transition, the neurobioengineering department renamed itself the neuroengineering and bio-nanotechnology group in 2005. By 2008, the core researchers of the original department had formalized the educational process into a formal long-term program at the University of Genova named School of Neuroengineering, fulfilling Massimo Grattarola's original ambitions, offering degrees in Humanoid Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;# ^ Neuroengineering School http://www.neuro-it.net/pipermail/general/2003-April/000018.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The current and former neurobioengineering (or neuroengineering) students continue his research interests throughout Europe and North America, some of whom have established related businesses, or hold positions of authority in neuroscience/biomedical institutions worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4301">{{About|optical depth in astrophysics|optical depth in general|optical depth}}

'''Optical depth''' in astrophysics refers to a specific level of transparency.  Optical depth and actual depth, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; respectively, can vary widely depending on the absorptivity of the astrophysical environment.  Indeed, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is able to show the relationship between these two quantities and can lead to a greater understanding of the structure inside a star.

Optical depth is a measure of the [[Mass attenuation coefficient|extinction coefficient]] or [[Absorbance|absorptivity]] up to a specific 'depth' of a star's makeup.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau \equiv \int_0^z \alpha  dz = \sigma N.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/OpticalDepth.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption here is that either the extinction coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; or the column number density &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is known.  These can generally be calculated from other equations if a fair amount of information is known about the chemical makeup of the star. From the definition, it is also clear that large optical depths correspond to higher rate of obscuration. Optical depth can therefore be thought of as the opacity of a medium. 

The extinction coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated using the [[Radiative transfer#Solutions to the equation of radiative transfer|transfer equation]].  In most astrophysical problems, this is exceptionally difficult to solve since solving the corresponding equations requires the incident radiation as well as the radiation leaving the star. These values are usually theoretical.

In some cases the [[Beer-Lambert Law]] can be useful in finding &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=e^\frac{4 \pi \kappa}{\lambda_0},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]], and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] of the incident light before being absorbed or scattered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.files.chem.vt.edu/chem-ed/spec/beerslaw.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note that the Beer-Lambert Law is only appropriate when the absorption occurs at a specific wavelength, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt;. For a gray atmosphere, for instance, it is most appropriate to use the Eddington Approximation.

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is simply a constant that depends on the physical distance from the outside of a star.  To find &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; at a particular depth &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt;, the above equation may be used with &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and integration from &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;z=z'&lt;/math&gt;.

== The Eddington approximation and the depth of the photosphere ==
Since it is difficult to define where the [[photosphere]] of a star ends and the [[chromosphere]] begins, astrophysicists usually rely on the [[Radiative transfer#The Eddington approximation|Eddington Approximation]] to derive the formal definition of &lt;math&gt;\tau=2/3&lt;/math&gt;

Devised by [[Sir Arthur Eddington]] the approximation takes into account the fact that &lt;math&gt;H^-&lt;/math&gt; produces a "gray" absorption in the atmosphere of a star, that is, it is independent of any specific wavelength and absorbs along the entire electromagnetic spectrum.  In that case,
:&lt;math&gt;T^4 = \frac{3}{4}T_e^4\left(\tau + \frac{2}{3}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[effective temperature]] at that depth and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the optical depth.

This illustrates not only that the observable temperature and actual temperature at a certain physical depth of a star vary, but that the optical depth plays a crucial role in understanding the stellar structure.  It also serves to demonstrate that the depth of the photosphere of a star is highly dependent upon the absorptivity of its environment.  The photosphere extends down to a point where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is about 2/3, which corresponds to a state where a photon would experience, in general, less than 1 scattering before leaving the star.

The above equation can be rewritten in terms of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:
:&lt;math&gt;T^4 = \frac{3}{4}T_e^4\left(\int_0^z (\alpha)  dz  + \frac{2}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Which is useful, for example, when &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is not known but &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2647">[[File:Mushrooms growed with PF Tek.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'' mushrooms grown using the PF Tek]]

'''PF Tek''' is a method of [[Fungiculture|mushroom cultivation]] pioneered by Robert McPherson, aka [http://www.fanaticus.com Psylocybe Fanaticus]. This technique (Tek) originally utilized [[Rye|organic rye berries]], but later included  [[brown rice]] flour and [[vermiculite]]. The substrate is [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] in half pint wide mouthed [[Mason jar|canning jars]] by boiling or [[pressure cooking]], with a layer of dry vermiculite as a filter agent to keep out competing [[bacteria]] and [[fungus]]. The sterilized "PF jar" is then injected with a solution containing [[spore]]s and water from a [[syringe]], creating a one step procedure for reliably growing mushrooms indoors.

Psylocybe Fanaticus was the business name of Robert McPherson, the creator of the PF Tek. The PF Tek can be used to grow a wide variety of mushrooms including the edible species [[Coprinus comatus|shaggy mane]], [[Hericium erinaceus|lion's mane]], the [[bioluminescent]] species ''[[Panellus stipticus]]'', and various species of [[psilocybin mushroom]]s.

== Strengths and weaknesses ==

===Strengths===

PF Tek is a popular method for home cultivation because it is easy, simple, inexpensive and reliable. The materials needed are cheap and widely available. Jars can be sterilized by boiling or with a [[pressure cooking|pressure cooker]]. Although [[Asepsis|sterile technique]] is required when [[Inoculation|inoculating]], risk of [[contamination]] from airborne [[spore]]s or [[bacteria]] is small because air exposure is minimal and the layer of vermiculite which acts as a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]].

===Weaknesses===

More experienced growers may not use PF Tek due to its low [[crop yield|yield]], and high labor input required when compared to other methods, like Monotubs. The use of a spore syringe also has its drawbacks. Because spores are a mix of [[genotype]]s, it is impossible to select [[mycelium]] that [[Colonization|colonizes]] fast and produces high yield.

'''Pornography addiction''' is an addiction model of [[compulsive]] sexual activity with concurrent use of [[pornographic]] material, despite negative consequences to one's physical, mental, social, or financial well-being. Although "viewing pornography online" is mentioned in the [[DSM-5]], it is not considered a [[mental disorder]], and it and pornography addiction are without classification in the [[ICD-11]].

'''Problematic Internet pornography viewing''' is viewing of [[Internet pornography]] that is problematic for an individual due to personal or social reasons, including excessive time spent viewing pornography instead of interacting with others. Individuals may report [[depression (mood)|depression]], social [[Solitude|isolation]], career loss, decreased productivity, or financial consequences as a result of their excessive internet pornography viewing impeding on their social life.&lt;ref name="twohig2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Twohig | first1 = M.

==Symptoms and diagnosis==
{{See also|Effects of pornography}}

Universally accepted [[diagnostic criteria]] do not exist for pornography addiction or problematic pornography viewing.&lt;ref name="twohig2010"/&gt; Pornography addiction is often defined operationally by the frequency of pornography viewing and negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=A|last2=Dawson|first2=DL|last3=das Nair|first3=R|title=Pornography Addiction in Adults: A Systematic Review of Definitions and Reported Impact.|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|date=May 2016|volume=13|issue=5|pages=760–77|doi=10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.03.002|pmid=27114191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only diagnostic criteria for a [[behavioral addiction]] in the current ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' are for [[pathological gambling]], and they are similar to those for [[substance abuse]] and [[substance dependence|dependence]], such as preoccupation with the behavior, diminished ability to control the behavior, [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], and adverse [[psychosocial]] consequences. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed for other behavioral addictions, and these are usually also based on established diagnoses for substance abuse and dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grant | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Potenza | first2 = M. N. | last3 = Weinstein | first3 = A. | last4 = Gorelick | first4 = D. A. | title = Introduction to Behavioral Addictions | doi = 10.3109/00952990.2010.491884 | journal = The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | pages = 233–241 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20560821| pmc =3164585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposed diagnosis for [[hypersexual disorder]] includes pornography as a subtype of this disorder. It included such criteria as time consumed by sexual activity interfering with obligations, repetitive engagement in sexual activity in response to stress, repeated failed attempts to reduce these behaviors, and distress or impairment of life functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kafka | first1 = M. P. | title = Hypersexual Disorder: A Proposed Diagnosis for DSM-V | doi = 10.1007/s10508-009-9574-7 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 377–400 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19937105| pmc = | url = http://dsm5.org/Research/Documents/Kafka_Hypersexual_ASB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study on problematic Internet pornography viewing used the criteria of viewing Internet pornography more than three times a week during some weeks, and viewing causing difficulty in general life functioning.&lt;ref name="twohig2010"/&gt;

According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, some psychological and behavioral changes characteristic of addiction brain changes include addictive cravings, impulsiveness, weakened executive function, desensitization, and dysphoria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asam.org/quality-practice/definition-of-addiction|title=ASAM Definition of Addiction|last=|first=|date=19 April 2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is evidence that such changes can occur in internet porn addicts.&lt;ref name="Kraus 385–386"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraus|first=Shane W|last2=Voon|first2=Valerie|last3=Potenza|first3=Marc N|date=2015-09-22|title=Neurobiology of Compulsive Sexual Behavior: Emerging Science|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282090679_Neurobiology_of_Compulsive_Sexual_Behavior_Emerging_Science|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=41|issue=1|pages=385–386|doi=10.1038/npp.2015.300|issn=0893-133X|pmc=4677151|pmid=26657963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chatzittofis|first=Andreas|last2=Arver|first2=Stefan|last3=Öberg|first3=Katarina|last4=Hallberg|first4=Jonas|last5=Nordström|first5=Peter|last6=Jokinen|first6=Jussi|date=2016-01-01|title=HPA axis dysregulation in men with hypersexual disorder|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=63|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.10.002|issn=1873-3360|pmid=26519779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diagnostic status===
The status of pornography addiction as an addictive disorder, rather than simply a [[compulsivity]], has been hotly contested.&lt;ref name=Steeleetal2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steele |first1=V. |last2=Prause |first2=N. |last3=Staley |first3=C. |last4=Fong |first4=G. W. |title= Sexual Desire, not Hypersexuality, is Related to Neurophysiological Responses Elicited by Sexual Images|journal=Socioaffective Neuroscience of Psychology |volume=3 |pages= 20770|year=2013 |doi= 10.3402/snp.v3i0.20770}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{medrs|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilton|first1=Donald L.|title=‘High desire’, or ‘merely’ an addiction? A response to Steele et al.|journal=Socioaffective Neuroscience &amp; Psychology|date=21 February 2014|volume=4|issue=1|pages=23833|doi=10.3402/snp.v4.23833}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{medrs|date=July 2014}}

In November 2016, the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) issued a position statement on sex/porn addiction which states that AASECT "does not find sufficient empirical evidence to support the classification of sex addiction or porn addiction as a mental health disorder, and does not find the sexual addiction training and treatment methods and educational pedagogies to be adequately informed by accurate human sexuality knowledge. Therefore, it is the position of AASECT that linking problems related to sexual urges, thoughts or behaviors to a porn/sexual addiction process cannot be advanced by AASECT as a standard of practice for sexuality education delivery, counseling or therapy."

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]) includes a new section for behavioral addictions, but includes only one disorder: [[pathological gambling]].&lt;ref name="dsm-5"&gt;{{Cite book|first=|last=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Arlington, VA|pages=481, 797–798|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|quote=In addition to the substance-related disorders, this chapter also includes gambling disorder, reflecting evidence that gambling behaviors activate reward systems similar to those activated by drugs of abuse and produce some behavioral symptoms that appear comparable to those produced by the substance use disorders. Other excessive behavioral patterns, such as Internet gaming, have also been described, but the research on these and other behavioral syndromes is less clear. Thus, groups of repetitive behaviors, which some term behavioral addictions, with such subcategories as "sex addiction," "exercise addiction," or "shopping addiction," are not included because at this time there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders. ... Excessive use of the Internet not involving playing of online games (e.g., excessive use of social media, such as Facebook; viewing pornography online) is not considered analogous to Internet gaming disorder, and future research on other excessive uses of the Internet would need to follow similar guidelines as suggested herein. Excessive gambling online may qualify for a separate diagnosis of gambling disorder.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One other behavioral addiction, internet gaming disorder, appears in the conditions proposed for further study in DSM-5.&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt; Psychiatrists cited a lack of research support for refusing to include other behavioral disorders at this time.&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt;

Porn addiction is not a diagnosis in DSM-5 (or any previous version).&lt;ref name=weir&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weir|first1=Kirsten|authorlink1= |title=Is pornography addictive? |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/04/pornography.aspx|deadurl=yes|format= |department= |journal=Monitor on Psychology|type= |series= |language= |edition= |location=Washington, D.C.|publisher= |publication-date=April 2014|volume=45|issue=4|page=46 |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |isbn= |issn=1529-4978|jfm= |jstor= |lccn=  |oclc=612512821 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405232028/http://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/04/pornography.aspx|archivedate=2014-04-05|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allez"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Glyn Hudson Allez|title=Sexual Diversity and Sexual Offending: Research, Assessment, and Clinical Treatment in Psychosexual Therapy|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MXnAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=pornography+addiction+%22dsm-5%22|date=4 June 2014|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=978-1-78181-368-3|page=161|chapter=Chapter Ten.

{{quote|When the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) was being drafted, experts considered a proposed diagnostic addiction called hypersexual disorder, which also included a pornography subtype. But in the end, reviewers determined that there wasn't enough evidence to include hypersexual disorder or its subtypes in the 2013 edition.&lt;ref name=weir/&gt;|Kirsten Weir|Is pornography addictive?}}

A number of studies have found neurological markers of addiction in internet porn users,&lt;ref name="Kraus 385–386"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Matthias|last2=Young|first2=Kimberly S.|last3=Laier|first3=Christian|last4=Wölfling|first4=Klaus|last5=Potenza|first5=Marc N.|date=2016-12-01|title=Integrating psychological and neurobiological considerations regarding the development and maintenance of specific Internet-use disorders: An Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763416302627|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=71|pages=252–266|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.08.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007477421630068X|title=International Review of Neurobiology|last=Kühn|first=S.|last2=Gallinat|first2=J.|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Academic Press|editor-last=Peterson|editor-first=Natalie M. Zahr and Eric T.|series=Imaging the Addicted Brain|volume=129|pages=67–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is consistent with a large body of research finding similar markers in other kinds of problematic internet users.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The International Classification of Disorders 11 (ICD-11) rejected "pornography addiction". Specifically, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) wrote: "Based on the limited current data, it would therefore seem premature to include [pornography viewing] in ICD-11."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=J.|year=2014|title=Impulse control disorders and "behavioural addictions" in the ICD‐11|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=13|pages=125–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
[[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] has been suggested as a possible effective treatment for pornography addiction based on its success with [[internet addict]]s, though no clinical trials have been performed to assess effectiveness among pornography addicts as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Laier, Christian.

Universität Duisburg-Essen, Fakultät für Ingenieurwissenschaften» Ingenieurwissenschaften-Campus Duisburg» Abteilung Informatik und Angewandte Kognitionswissenschaft, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acceptance and commitment therapy]] has also been shown to be a potentially effective treatment for problematic internet pornography viewing.&lt;ref name="twohig2010"/&gt;

Some clinicians and support organizations recommend voluntary use of Internet [[content-control software]], [[Internet surveillance|internet monitoring]], or both, to manage online pornography use.&lt;ref name="cooper1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10720169908400182 |title=Online sexual compulsivity: Getting tangled in the net |year=1999 |last1=Cooper |first1=Alvin |last2=Putnam |first2=Dana E. |last3=Planchon |first3=Lynn A. |last4=Boies |first4=Sylvain C. |journal=Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=79–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="delmonico1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10720169708400139 |title=Cybersex: High tech sex addiction |year=1997 |last1=Delmonico |first1=David L. |journal=Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=159–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="layden2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Layden, Mary Anne | date=September 2005 | title=Cyber Sex Addiction | journal=Advances in Cognitive Therapy | pages=1–2, 4–5 | url=http://www.academyofct.org/Library/InfoManage/Guide.asp?FolderID=295&amp;SessionID= | format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex researcher Alvin Cooper and colleagues suggested several reasons for using filters as a therapeutic measure, including curbing accessibility that facilitates problematic behavior and encouraging clients to develop coping and relapse prevention strategies.&lt;ref name=cooper1999/&gt; Cognitive therapist Mary Anne Layden suggested that filters may be useful in maintaining environmental control.&lt;ref name=layden2005/&gt; Internet behavior researcher David Delmonico stated that, despite their limitations, filters may serve as a "frontline of protection."&lt;ref name=delmonico1997/&gt;

Studies of those with non-paraphilic expressions of hypersexuality have hypothesized that various mood disorders, as defined in the DSM, may occur more frequently in sexually compulsive men.&lt;ref&gt;Kafka, M.P., &amp; Hennen, J. (2002).

==Epidemiology==
There is only one representative sample to date concerning distress about sex video use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rissel|first1= C |last2=Richters|first2=J.|last3=de Visser|first3=R.|last4= McKee|first4=A.|last5=Yeung|first5=A.|year=2017|title=A profile of pornography users in australia: Findings from the second australian study of health and relationships.|journal=he journal of sex research|volume=54|pages=227–240|doi=10.1080/00224499.2016.1191597}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that of 10,131 women surveyed, 0.5% of women agreed with the statement that they were "addicted" to pornography; 1.2% (of 4,218 who viewed) when limited to women who say they viewed sex films. The comparable figure limiting to men who view sex films was 4.4%. This was without any clinical screening that should eliminate primary disorders (e.g., depression) or religious-based concerns, so these should be considered high-end estimates for potential disorders, if any exist.

Most studies of rates use a [[convenience sample]]. One study of a convenience sample of 9,265 people found that 1% of Internet users have concerns about their Internet use and 17% of users meet criteria for problematic [[sexual compulsivity]], meaning they score above one [[standard deviation]] of the mean on the Kalichman [[Sexual Compulsivity Scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cooper A. |author2=Delmonico D.

According to E.T.M. Laan, a sexologist working for the [[Academic Medical Center]], it is usually the [[Christian right|religious right]] which claims the existence of pornography addiction and such claims are rare among sexologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Casper van der Veen|title = ‘Erectieproblemen bij jongeren door porno op internet’ - NRC|url = https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/08/17/erectieproblemen-bij-jongeren-door-porno-op-internet-3826489-a1516755|accessdate=20 September 2016|date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steatosis''', also called '''fatty change''', is the process describing the abnormal retention of [[lipid]]s within a cell. It reflects an impairment of the normal processes of [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] and elimination of [[triglyceride]] fat. Excess lipid accumulates in [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s that displace the [[cytoplasm]]. When the vesicles are large enough to distort the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], the condition is known as macrovesicular steatosis; otherwise, the condition is known as microvesicular steatosis. While not particularly detrimental to the cell in mild cases, large accumulations can disrupt cell constituents, and in severe cases the cell may even burst.

The risk factors associated with steatosis are varied, and include [[diabetes mellitus]],&lt;ref name="araya"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Araya Q AV, etal | title=Glucose tolerance alterations and frequency of metabolic syndrome among patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease| journal=Rev Med Chil.| year=2006| volume=134| issue=9| pages=1092–1098 | pmid=17167710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ali ES, Hua J, Wilson CH, Tallis GA, Zhou FH, Rychkov GY, Barritt GJ |title=The glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue exendin-4 reverses impaired intracellular Ca2+ signalling in steatotic hepatocytes |journal=BBA − Molecular Cell Research |doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2016.05.006 |pmid=27178543 |volume=1863 |year=2016 |pages=2135–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; protein malnutrition,&lt;ref name="conde"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Conde Martel A, etal | title=Liver changes in protein malnutrition.

== Pathogenesis ==
No single mechanism leading to steatosis exists; rather, a varied multitude of pathologies disrupt normal lipid movement through the cell and cause accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilson CH, Ali ES, Scrimgeour N, Martin AM, Hua J, Tallis GA, Rychkov GY, Barritt GJ |title=Steatosis inhibits liver cell store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry and reduces ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism |journal=The Biochemical Journal |volume=466 |issue=2 |pages=379–90 |year=2015 |pmid=25422863 |doi=10.1042/BJ20140881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms can be separated on whether they ultimately cause an oversupply of lipid which can not be removed quickly enough (i.e., too much in), or whether they cause a failure in lipid breakdown (i.e., not enough used).

Failure of lipid metabolism can also lead to the mechanisms which would normally utilise or remove lipids becoming impaired, resulting in the accumulation of unused lipids in the cell. Certain toxins, such as alcohols, [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[aspirin]], and [[diphtheria toxin]], interfere with cellular machinery involved in lipid metabolism. In those with [[Gaucher's disease]], the [[lysosome]]s fail to degrade lipids and steatosis arises from the accumulation of [[glycolipid]]s. Protein malnutrition, such as that seen in [[kwashiorkor]], results in a lack of precursor [[Apolipoprotein|apoproteins]] within the cell, therefore unused lipids which would normally participate in [[lipoprotein]] synthesis begin to accumulate.

=== Macrovesicular steatosis ===
Macrovesicular steatosis is the more common form of fatty degeneration and may be caused by oversupply of lipids due to obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2938852 | pmid=20857857 | volume=33 | title=Metabolic disease in sleep disordered breathing: puberty! puberty! | year=2010 | journal=Sleep | pages=1133–4 |vauthors=Bhattacharjee R, Gozal D }}&lt;/ref&gt; insulin resistance, or [[alcoholism]]. Nutrient malnutrition may also cause the mobilisation of fat from [[adipocyte]]s and create a local oversupply in the liver where lipid metabolism occurs. Excess alcohol over a long period of time can induce steatosis. The breakdown of large amounts of [[ethanol]] in alcoholic drinks produces large amounts of chemical energy [[NADH]], signalling to the cell to inhibit the breakdown of [[fatty acid]]s (which also produces energy) and simultaneously increase the synthesis of [[fatty acid]]s. This "false sense of energy" results in more lipid being created than is needed.

=== Microvesicular steatosis ===
Microvesicular steatosis is characterized by small intracytoplasmic fat vacuoles (liposomes) which accumulate in the cell. Common causes are [[tetracyclines]], acute fatty liver of pregnancy, [[Reye's syndrome]], and [[hepatitis C]].

== Histology ==
[[histology|Histologically]], steatosis is physically apparent as lipid within membrane bound [[liposome]]s of [[parenchyma]]l cells.&lt;ref name="robspath"/&gt; When this tissue is [[Staining|fixed and stained]] to be better viewed under a microscope, the lipid is usually dissolved by the solvents used to prepare the sample. As such, samples prepared this way will appear to have empty holes (or vacuoles) within the cells where the lipid has been cleared. Special lipid stains, such as [[Sudan stain]]s and [[Staining#Osmium tetroxide|osmium tetroxide]] are able to retain and show up lipid droplets, hence more conclusively indicating the presence of lipids. Other intracellular accumulations, such as water or [[glycogen]], can also appear as clear vacuoles, therefore it becomes necessary to use stains to better decide what is accumulating.

Grossly, steatosis causes organ enlargement and lightening in colour.&lt;ref name="robspath"/&gt; This is due to the high lipid content increasing the organ's volume and becoming visible to the unaided eye. In severe cases, the organ may become vastly enlarged, greasy, and yellow in appearance.

== Radiography ==
[[File:Liversteatosis.png|thumb|Liver steatosis (fatty liver disease) as seen on CT]]
On [[X-ray computed tomography]] (CT), the increased fat component will decrease the density of the liver tissue, making the image less bright. Typically the density of the spleen and liver are roughly equivalent. In steatosis, there is a difference between the density and brightness of the two organs, with the liver appearing darker.&lt;ref name="Helms 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Helms, Clyde A. |author2=Brant, William E. |title=Fundamentals of diagnostic radiology |publisher=Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Phila |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-6135-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On ultrasound, fat is more [[echogenicity|echogenic]] (capable of reflecting sound waves). The combination of liver steatosis being dark on CT and bright on ultrasound is sometimes known as the flip flop sign.
[[File:MRI Liversteatosis.jpg|thumb|Upright=4.0|Liver steatosis (fatty liver disease) as seen on MRI. Multiecho MR sequence in a healthy liver (top row) and a liver with severe steatosis (bottom row) are shown. In the healthy liver, the signal does not vary much in the different echoes. In 
the steatotic liver, the signal varies greatly between in and out phase echoes. Algebraic combination of these images can be used to accurately quantify liver steatosis.]]
On [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]], multiecho gradient echo images can be used to determine the percent fat fraction of the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21928307|title=Quantitative assessment of liver fat with magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy|year=2011 | doi=10.1002/jmri.22580|volume=34|author=Reeder SB, Cruite I, Hamilton G, Sirlin CB|journal=J Magn Reson Imaging|pages=729–49|pmc=3177109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different resonance frequencies between water and fat make this technique very sensitive and accurate. Acquisition of echoes in "in phase" and "out phase" conditions (pertaining to the relative phases of the fat and water proton contingents) enables to obtain a signal proportional to the water and fat contingent, or a signal proportional to the water minus the fat contingent. These signal intensities are then algebraically combined into a percent fat. More recent techniques take into account experimental noise, signal decay and spectroscopic properties of fat. Numerous validation studies have demonstrated excellent correlations between the steatosis level quantified at MRI and the steatosis levels semi-quantitavely and quantitatively determined on liver biopsies (reference methods). Several MRI vendors offer automated calculation of percent fat with acquisition sequences no longer than a single breath hold.

'''''The Case of Wagner''''' ({{lang-de|Der Fall Wagner}}) is a book by the [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], originally published in 1888. Subtitled "A Musician's Problem", it has also been known as ''The Wagner Case'' in English. 

==Contents==
The book is a critique of [[Richard Wagner]] and the announcement of Nietzsche's rupture with the German artist, who had involved himself too much, in Nietzsche's eyes, in the [[Völkisch movement|''Völkisch'' movement]] and [[antisemitism]]. His music is no longer represented as a possible "philosophical affect," and Wagner is [[irony|ironically]] compared to [[Georges Bizet]]. However, Nietzsche  presents Wagner as only a particular symptom of a broader "disease" that is affecting Europe: that is, [[nihilism]]. The book shows Nietzsche as a capable music-critic, and provides the setting for some of his further reflections on the nature of art and its relationship to the future health of humanity.

This work is in sharp contrast with the second part of Nietzsche's ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]],'' wherein he praised Wagner as fulfilling a need in music to go beyond the analytic and dispassionate understanding of music. Nietzsche also praised Wagner effusively in his essay "Wagner at Bayreuth" (part of the ''[[Untimely Meditations (Nietzsche)|Untimely Meditations]]''), but his disillusion with Wagner the composer and the man was first seen in his 1878 work ''[[Human, All Too Human]]''.  One of the last works that Nietzsche wrote returned to the critical theme of ''The Case of Wagner''.  In ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'', Nietzsche pulled together excerpts from his works to show that he consistently had the same thoughts about music, only that he had misapplied them to Wagner in the earliest works.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">"'''Viruses of the Mind'''" is an essay by British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], first published in the book ''Dennett and His Critics: Demystifying Mind'' (1993).  Dawkins originally wrote the essay in 1991 and delivered it as a [[Voltaire Lecture]] on 6 November 1992 at the [[Conway Hall Humanist Centre]].  The essay discusses how religion can be viewed as a [[meme]], an idea previously expressed by Dawkins in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976).  Dawkins analyzes the propagation of religious ideas and behaviors as a memetic virus, analogous to how  [[virus|biological]] and [[computer virus]]es spread.  The essay was later published in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and its ideas are further explored in the television programme, ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'' (2006).

==Content==
Dawkins defines the "symptoms" of being infected by the "virus of religion", providing examples for most of them, and tries to define a connection between the elements of religion and its survival value (invoking [[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi]]'s [[handicap principle]] of [[sexual selection]], applied to believers of a religion). Dawkins also describes religious beliefs as "mind-parasites", and as "gangs &lt;nowiki&gt;[that]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will come to constitute a package, which may be sufficiently stable to deserve a collective name such as Roman Catholicism ... or ... component parts to a single virus".

Dawkins suggests that religious belief in the "faith-sufferer" typically shows the following elements:
* It is impelled by some deep, inner conviction that something is true, or right, or virtuous: a conviction that doesn't seem to owe anything to [[evidence]] or reason, but which, nevertheless, the believer feels as totally compelling and convincing.
* The believer typically makes a positive virtue of faith's being strong and unshakable, despite it not being based upon evidence.
* There is a conviction that "mystery", ''per se'', is a good thing; the belief that it is not a virtue to solve mysteries but to enjoy them and revel in their insolubility.
* There may be intolerant behaviour towards perceived rival faiths, in extreme cases even the killing of opponents or advocating of their deaths. Believers  may be similarly violent in disposition towards [[Apostasy|apostates]] or [[Heresy|heretics]], even if those espouse only a slightly different version of the faith.
* The particular convictions that the believer holds, while having nothing to do with evidence, are likely to resemble those of the believer's parents.
* If the believer is one of the rare exceptions who follows a different religion from his parents, the explanation may be cultural transmission from a charismatic individual.
* The internal sensations of the 'faith-sufferer' may be reminiscent of those more ordinarily associated with sexual love.

Dawkins stresses his claim that religious beliefs do not spread as a result of evidence in their support, but typically by cultural transmission, in most cases from parents or from charismatic individuals. He refers to this as involving "[[epidemiology]], not evidence". Further Dawkins distinguishes this process from the spread of scientific ideas, which, he suggests, is constrained by the requirement to conform with certain virtues of standard methodology: "testability, evidential support, precision, quantifiability, consistency, intersubjectivity, repeatability, universality, progressiveness, independence of cultural milieu, and so on". He points out that faith "spreads despite a total lack of every single one of these virtues".

==Critical reactions==
[[Alister McGrath]], a Christian theologian, has also commented critically on Dawkins' analysis, suggesting that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' p. 125 quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] is support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p.  126&lt;/ref&gt; that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than Darwinian,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests there is no evidence that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' (pp. 137–138)&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also cites a metareview of 100 studies and argues that "If religion is reported as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the field, how can it conceivably be regarded as analogous to a virus?"&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 136 citing Koenig and Cohen ''The Link between Religion and Health'' OUP 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zero Punctuation''''' is a [[Web series|series]] of video game reviews created by English comedy writer and [[Video game journalism|video game journalist]] [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]]. Since the series began in 2007, over 500 episodes have been created, which have been published weekly by internet magazine ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''. Episodes typically range from 5 to 6 minutes in length. Videos provide [[caustic humour]], rapid-fire delivery, [[visual gag]]s and critical insight into recently released video games, with occasional reviews of older games.

== History ==
Prior to Zero Punctuation, Croshaw primarily authored content for his blog, ''Fully Ramblomatic'', and would occasionally review video games, often with an emphasis on humor and criticism.&lt;ref name="fullyramblomatic-reviews"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/reviews/ |title=Reviews on FullyRamblomatic |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |year=2008 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, Croshaw uploaded two game reviews in video format to [[YouTube]] in the same style that would eventually be used for Zero Punctuation: one of the [[Game demo|demo]] of ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]], and the other of ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable: The Lost Chapters]]'' for the [[Personal computer|PC]]. Both were well-received and ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' was one of several publishers to offer Croshaw a contract.&lt;ref name="gamespotinterview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6235040/pressspotting-ramblin-with-ben-yahtzee-croshaw |title=PressSpotting: Ramblin' with Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw |first=Kyle |last=Orland |date=March 22, 2008 |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Zero Punctuation" refers to the speed of Croshaw's narration. Since its creation, the series has become popular in the gaming community.&lt;ref name="gamespotinterview" /&gt; Video game developers and publishers have occasionally acknowledged Croshaw's reviews of their games, and at least one [[internet meme]] has resulted from Zero Punctuation.&lt;ref name="kotakumeme"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5307391/infamous-defeats-prototype-in-cross+dressing-playoff |title=inFamous Defeats Prototype in Cross-Dressing Playoff |first=Owen |last=Good |date=July 4, 2009 |work=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamerinterview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/08/05/community-heroes-yahtzee-of-zero-punctuation/ |title=Community heroes: Yahtzee, for Zero Punctuation |first=Tom |last=Francis |date=August 5, 2010 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of every year, Croshaw creates special episodes of Zero Punctuation discussing what he believes were the best and worst games of the year; a practice that started at the end of 2008. He has occasionally dedicated episodes to new technologies or milestones in video gaming rather than games, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] and the coming of the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation of consoles]].&lt;ref name="zpkinect"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/4863-Kinect |title=Zero Punctuation - Kinect |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=October 26, 2011 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/7417-Next-Gen-Buyers-Guide |title=Zero Punctuation - Next Gen Buyer's Guide |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=June 5, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014, Yahtzee has released a sub-series of Zero Punctuation, titled "Zero Punctuation’s occasional guide to &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through;"&gt;retarded&lt;/span&gt; special moments in gaming history", where he looks back upon events or periods in gaming that garnered widespread, often infamous, attention; these include the video game ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which helped contribute to the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game industry crash of 1983]], and the controversial ''[[Hot Coffee mod|Hot Coffee]]'' mod for ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E.T. - "The Worst Game Ever"|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/9625-E-T-The-Worst-Game-Ever|website=The Escapist|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Coffee|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/117180-Zero-Punctuation-hot-coffee|website=The Escapist|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2009, Croshaw has also been writing a column on The Escapist known as ''Extra Punctuation''. These articles were originally published every Tuesday and often supplement the previous week's review by discussing a certain topic or trend exhibited by that game. However, after several years writing the column on a weekly basis, Croshaw began to produce entries less frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation|title=Extra Punctuation|publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zero Punctuation, Croshaw usually reviews a game or games in a highly critical manner using rapid-fire speech delivery accompanied by minimalistic cartoon imagery and animation on a distinctive yellow background, which illustrates what is being said or provides an [[irony|ironic]] counterpoint to it. Subtle references or jokes may be inserted to the visuals for comic effect or to add additional context to the narration. His reviews are intended to be humorous with constant usage of puns, analogies, metaphors, and [[Black comedy|dark humour]] accompanied by liberal use of [[profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/interview-zero-punctuations-ben-yahtzee-croshaw-reveals-all/|title=Interview: Zero Punctuation's Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw reveals all|first=Nate|last=Lanxon|date=November 4, 2009|website=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/05/zero-punctuation-yahtzee-crys-about-dmc4/|title=Zero Punctuation: Yahtzee cries about DMC4|first=Terrence|last=StasseMarch 5, 2008|website=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|title=Zero Punctuation Review Terrorizes EA Game Development|magazine=[[GameAxis Unwired]]|date=April 2008|issue=55|issn=0219-872X|publisher=[[SPH Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croshaw usually substitutes the main character or himself with his own [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]], a cartoon man distinguished by a [[trilby]]. Another character used often is an [[imp]]-like creature (originally meant to resemble a "darkling" from ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'') which represents antagonists, animals, or less important characters from a video game. Video games, developers, countries, and other entities are often [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] as box arts, logos, or flags with arms and legs when they are being addressed directly, or when an action by that entity is being explained.

Zero Punctuation opens and closes with a [[Theme music|theme song]], a rock track composed and performed by Ian Dorsch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/content/music |title=The Escapist : Sound and Music |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ending credits usually feature humorous notes or other information relating to the review, as well as imagery of characters from the review engaging in [[slapstick]], however in 2014, the videos posted on YouTube omit the credit sequences. Prior to mid-2008, Zero Punctuation featured commercial songs at the beginning and end of each episode, which were usually related to the context of, or at odds with the game in question, such as [[Ramones|The Ramones]]' "[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]" and [[Eric Johnson]]'s "[[Cliffs of Dover (composition)|Cliffs of Dover]]" at the beginning and end, respectively, of his review of ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''.

The series' format has proved inspirational for several other web series, such as the critical and educational series [[Extra Credits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Floyd|first=Daniel|title=Video Games and Storytelling|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jdG2LHair0|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CGP Grey]].&lt;ref name="H.I. #13: Nobody Owns the Facts"&gt;{{cite podcast|last2=Grey|first2=CGP|last1=Haran|first1=Brady|title=Nobody Owns the Facts|url=http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/13|work=Hello Internet|number=13|publisher=Hellointernet.fm|accessdate=2014-06-17|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://www.relay.fm/cortex/10 |title=Cortex #10: Zero Artistic Skills |website=Cortex |publisher=Relay FM |host=Grey, C.

Croshaw, more often than not, provides highly critical reviews of games, usually pointing out the faults that he implies other professional reviewers ignore in high-profile releases.&lt;ref name="pcgamerinterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mailbag"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/37-Mailbag-Showdown |title=Zero Punctuation - Mailbag Showdown |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=May 7, 2008 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tends to disdain certain overused tropes and conventions in video games, such as [[quick time event]]s, highly common uses of [[Motion controller|motion controls]], [[cover system|cover-based shooting]] and unbalanced emphasis on [[Video game graphics|graphics]] over story or [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name="zpkinect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zpuncharted"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/27-Uncharted-Drakes-Fortune |title = ZeroPunctuation - Uncharted: Drake's Fortune |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=February 27, 2008 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zptlou"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/7638-The-Last-of-Us |title=Zero Punctuation - The Last of Us |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=July 3, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also disapproves of game franchises that release sequels in rapid succession, such as ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'', and ''[[Call of Duty]]''.&lt;ref name="zptop5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/8642-Top-5-Games-of-2013 |title=Zero Punctuation - Top 5 Games of 2013 |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 1, 2014 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croshaw generally does not review certain genres of games, and has openly admitted to not liking most [[Japanese role-playing game|JRPG]]s, [[real-time strategy]] games, [[fighting game]]s, or [[Simulation video game|simulation games]]. More recently{{When|date=August 2018}}, he has begun disliking military-themed [[first-person shooter]]s such as ''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[Medal of Honor (video game series)|Medal of Honor]]'', and ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'' for being what he believes to be extremely similar in gameplay, poor in ethics, and contrived in story, while using the moniker "spunkgargleweewee" to differentiate them from other styles of first-person shooter game.&lt;ref name="zp2012"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/6677-Top-5-of-2012 |title=Zero Punctuation - Top 5 of 2012 |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 2, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/2486-Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops |title=Zero Punctuation - Call of Duty: Black Ops |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=September 5, 2007 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Croshaw|first1=Ben|date=November 7, 2012|title=Zero Punctuation - Medal of Honor Warfighter &amp; Doom 3 BFG Edition|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/6492-Medal-of-Honor-Warfighter-Doom-3-BFG-Edition|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often criticizes publishers or developers with practices that he believes are in some way damaging to [[video games industry]] or otherwise unacceptable, such as [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="destructoid"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-interview-ben-yahtzee-croshaw-69631.phtml |title=Destructoid interview: Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw |date=February 11, 2008 |work=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Zero Punctuation episodes are usually intended to highlight Croshaw's criticisms of video games, his general opinions are not universally negative, and any positive feelings towards the aspects of a game will usually be explicitly stated.&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt; A number of video games have received favorable ''Zero Punctuation'' reviews, which include some of his all-time favorite games such as ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'', ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', and ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reddit AMAA |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/glt5k/iam_yahtzee_croshaw_off_of_the_escapists_zero/c1ojct7 |title=IAM Yahtzee Croshaw off of the Escapist's Zero Punctuation, AMAA |publisher=[[Reddit.com]] |date= |accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Silent Hill 2|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/878-Silent-Hill-2|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Prince of Persia Retrospective|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/183-Prince-of-Persia-Retrospective|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Shadow of the Colossus|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/1924-Shadow-of-the-Colossus|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croshaw had no criticisms for another favorite, the video game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Puncation - The Orange Box|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/10-The-Orange-Box|website=The Escapist|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although by the time ''[[Portal 2 (video game)|Portal 2]]'' was released approximately 4 years later, he stated that the only flaw of the first ''Portal'' was its fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Puncation - Portal 2|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/3153-Portal-2|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened his review of ''[[BioShock]]'' by saying "nobody likes it when I'm being nice to a game," referring to the negative reception of his favorable review of ''[[Psychonauts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/4-BioShock |title=Zero Punctuation - BioShock |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=November 24, 2010 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croshaw cites the work of British television critic and PC Zone journalist [[Charlie Brooker]] as the "main inspiration" for his own reviewing style, as well as the writings of [[Douglas Adams]], Sean "[[Seanbaby]]" Riley, [[Victor Lewis-Smith]], and [[Old Man Murray]]'s [[Chet Faliszek]] and [[Erik Wolpaw]].&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/games/interview-zero-punctuations-yahtzee-572875/ |title=Interview: Zero Punctuation’s Yahtzee |first=James |last=Schneider |date=February 14, 2008 |work=[[Geek.com]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/videos/zeropunctuation/2655-Yahtzee-Visits-Valve-a-Travelogue.2 |title=Yahtzee Visits Valve, a Travelogue |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=November 21, 2007 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed respect towards the late [[Roger Ebert]], noting that he "might one day aspire to being his videogaming equivalent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/7473-Videogames-as-Art |title=Extra Punctuation - Videogames as Art |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=April 27, 2010 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games of the Year==
At the end of each year since 2008, Croshaw has created episodes of Zero Punctuation showcasing his favorite and most disliked games reviewed in that year. These episodes systematically alternate between his selections for the five best and five worst of the year in ascending order. In 2008 and 2009, however, these were done in a mock awards format. In 2015, he added a new category concerning the blandest and least innovative games of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFGU79rX34 |title=Top 5 Games of 2015 (Zero Punctuation) |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 13, 2016 |work=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2013 lists, he also awarded the "Lifetime Achievement Award for Total Abhorrence" to ''[[Ride to Hell: Retribution]]'', expressing that it was so poor in quality that he hardly considered it a game but rather saw it as "congealed failure". He also stated that the game would indefinitely hold the award until a worse game came along, which he claims "should roughly be around the time [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|apes have retaken the earth.]]"&lt;ref name="zptop5" /&gt;

In 2015 he created a category where he gave his top five blandest games of 2015, which he felt had not added anything new or fresh to the franchise they were a part of. He rated [[Halo 5: Guardians]] as the year's blandest game. [[Undertale]] was awarded his Game of the Year but which had not been given its own Zero Punctuation episode beforehand. Having stated before the awards began that all games mentioned must have already been reviewed by him, he promptly gave his own last-minute opinion by merely stating "Undertale is a good game".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Zero Punctuation : Top 5 Games of 2015|url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/116617-Top-5-Best-and-Worst-Games-of-2015|website = The Escapist|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Zero Punctuation has received generally positive reviews, with much of the praise centered towards Yahtzee's sharp wit and style of comedic writing. As of October 2018, the series has an IMDB rating of 7.7 from 409 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation (2007-)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2793136/|website=IMDB|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boing Boing]] called the series "hilariously cutting ... first legitimate breakout hit from the gaming community in recent memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
