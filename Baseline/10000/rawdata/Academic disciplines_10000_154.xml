'''Abu al-Fadl Abdullah bin Muhammad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari''' (1910&amp;ndash;1993) was a Moroccan preacher, jurist and theologian.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Shah, ''The Hạdīth: Scholarship, perspectives, and criticism'', Routledge, 2010, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lineage==
The Ghumari family descends from [[Ahl al-Bayt]], the family of the Islamic [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Ghumari's bloodline is traced through his father Muhammad, son of Muhammad, son of Ahmad, son of Muhammad, son of Qasim, son of Muhammad, son of Muhammad, son of Abd al-Mu`min, son of Muhammad, son of Abd al-Mu`min, son of Ali, son of al-Hasan, son of Muhammad, son of Abdullah, son of Ahmad, son of Abdullah, son of Isa, son of Mas'ud, son of al-Fudayl, son of [[Ali ibn Umar]], son of Umar, son of al-Arabi Alal, son of Musa, son of Ahmad, son of Dawud, son of [[Idris II of Fes]], son of [[Idris I of Morocco]], son of Abdullah, son of al-Hasan al-Muthana, son of [[Hasan ibn Ali]], son of [[Ali]] and [[Fatimah]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Life==
Ghumari was born in the Moroccan city of [[Tangier]] in 1910, and died in the same city in 1993.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;The Biography of Abu al Fadl Abdullah bin as-Siddiq al-Ghumari who died in the year 1413AH, written and translated by Riad Nachef. Available at:&lt;br&gt;*[http://www.ayouby.com/biography/english-translations/623-sheikh-abdullah-bin-as-siddiq-al-ghumari-.html Ayouby.com]&lt;br&gt;*[http://www.riadnachef.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=113:the-biogaphy-of-abu-alfadl-abdullah-bin-as-siddiq-al-ghumari-&amp;catid=56:english-text&amp;Itemid=77 Riad Nachef, Islamic Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he was primarily educated by his father Muhammad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari, also an Islamic scholar. The younger Ghumari [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized]] the entirety of the [[Qur'an]] at an early age, in addition to the [[Hadith]] book [[Bulugh al-Maram]] along with [[Alfiya]] and [[Ajārūmīya]] in [[Arabic grammar]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Ghumari later travelled to [[Fes|Fas]] for his higher education, but then enrolled in the [[University of al-Karaouine]]. While there, he also studied [[Mosque of Uqba]],&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] and important seat of Muslim religious learning.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pc_item.php?id=monument%3BISL%3Btn%3BMon01%3B2%3Ben Great Mosque of Kairouan (discoverislamicart.org)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407201059/http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pc_item.php?id=monument%3BISL%3Btn%3BMon01%3B2%3Ben |date=2013-04-07 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; During his study, Ghumari's teachers covered a number of books considered canonical in Sunni Islam, [[Al-Qastallani]]'s explanation of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and the works of [[Khalil ibn Ishaq al-Jundi]] being two examples.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Eventually, Ghumari switched from Karaouine to [[Al-Azhar University]] in 1930 and graduating the next year. During his education, Ghumari was a student of [[Al-Kawthari]], of whom Ghumari would later hold extremely negative views.&lt;ref name=haddad&gt;[[Gibril Haddad]], [http://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/f/The%20Ghumari%20School.htm The Ghumari School]. 6 December 2002: Living Islam. Last updated 2 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to fears in the wider [[Arab world]] regarding the influence of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in the mid-twentieth century, Ghumari was accused of having ties to a foreign group.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} In 1961, he was sentenced to ten years in prison, likely due to his time spent in Egypt where the Brotherhood had formed. Hi{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}s older brother, [[Ahmad al-Ghumari]], fell ill upon hearing of his younger brother's long sentence and died eight months later.

==Career==
Like most of the Ghumari family, Abdullah al-Ghumari was a prolific writer. 

Ghumari was famous not only for the number of teachers which he had, but also the number of students. [[Salâh Ud Dîn At Tijânî]] and [[Muhammad bin Yahya al-Ninowy]] is counted as one of Ghumari's more prominent students,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alburujpress.com/teachers/teacher/50/ Shaykh Muhammad Bin Yahya An-Ninowy]. 2009: Al Buruj Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130216221958/http://www.thedeeninstitute.com/about-us/our-team/item/75-shaykh-muhammad-al-ninowy-senior-instructor Shaykh Muhammad al-Ninowy: Senior Instructor].

An '''anacoluthon''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ə|k|ə|ˈ|lj|uː|θ|ɒ|n}} {{respell|AN|ə|kə|LEW|thon}}; from the Greek ''anakolouthon'', from ''an-'': "not" and ἀκόλουθος ''akólouthos'': "following") is an unexpected discontinuity in the expression of ideas within a sentence, leading to a form of words in which there is logical incoherence of thought. Anacolutha are often sentences interrupted midway, where there is a change in the syntactical structure of the sentence and of intended meaning following the interruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anacoluthon |title=Anacoluthon - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425165000/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anacoluthon |archivedate=April 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the Italian proverb "The good stuff – think about it."&lt;ref&gt;''Alla buona derrata, pensaci su'', from {{cite book | last1 = Mawr | first = E.B. | year = 1885 | title = Analogous Proverbs in Ten Languages | page = 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proverb urges people to make the best choice. When anacoluthon occurs unintentionally it is considered to be an error in sentence structure, and results in incoherent nonsense. However, it can be used as a rhetorical technique to challenge the reader to think more deeply, or in "[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]" literature to represent the disjointed nature of associative thought. Anacoluthon is very common in informal speech, where a speaker might start to say one thing, then break off and abruptly and incoherently continue, expressing a completely different line of thought. When such speech is reported in writing, a dash (—) is often included at the point of discontinuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gowers | first = E. | year = 1973 | title = The Complete Plain Words | page = 182}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The listener is expected to ignore the first part of the sentence, although in some cases it might contribute to the overall meaning in an impressionistic sense.

==Examples==
*"Had ye been there – for what could that have done?" ([[John Milton]] in ''Lycidas'')

In [[Paradise Lost]], [[John Milton]] uses an anacoluthon with Satan's first words to illustrate his initial confusion:
*"If thou beest he; but O how fallen! How changed" (I.83)

[[William Shakespeare]] uses anacoluthon in his history plays such as in this (''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' IV iii 34-6):
*"Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
*:That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
*:Let him depart."

Additionally, [[Conrad Aiken]]'s ''Rimbaud and Verlaine'' has an extended anacoluthon as it discusses anacoluthon:
*"Discussing, between moves, [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]] and [[spondee]]
*:Anacoluthon and the open vowel
*:God the great peacock with his [[angel]] peacocks
*:And his dependent peacocks the bright stars..."

[[Franz Kafka]] uses perhaps the most famed example of anacoluthon as the first line of [[The Metamorphosis]]:
"When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin."

==Etymology==
The word ''anacoluthon'' is a [[transliteration]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνακόλουθον}} (''anakólouthon''), which derives from the [[privative]] prefix {{lang|el|ἀν-}} (''an-'') and the root adjective {{lang|el|ἀκόλουθος}} (''akólouthos''), "following". This, incidentally, is precisely the meaning of the Latin phrase ''[[Non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]]'' in [[logic]].  However, in Classical rhetoric anacoluthon was used ''both'' for the logical error of ''non sequitur'' and for the syntactic effect or error of changing an expected following or completion to a new or improper one.

==Use of the term==

The term "anacoluthon" is used primarily within an academic context.  It is most likely to appear in a study of rhetoric or poetry.  For example ''[[The King's English]]'', an English [[style guide]] written by [[H. W. Fowler]] and [[F. G. Fowler]], mentions it as a major grammatical mistake.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We can hardly conclude even so desultory a survey of grammatical misdemeanours as this has been without mentioning the most notorious of all. The anacoluthon is a failure to follow on, an unconscious departure from the grammatical scheme with which a sentence was started, the getting switched off, imperceptibly to the writer, very noticeably to his readers, from one syntax track to another."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term does occasionally appear in popular media as well.  The word, though not the underlying meaning (see [[malapropism]]), has been popularized, due to its use as an [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] by [[Captain Haddock]] in the English translations of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series of books.

The '''Array Operations Center''' (AOC) in [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]], [[New Mexico]], is the control and monitor center for the [[Very Long Baseline Array]]. From the AOC, [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] operators are able to remotely control and monitor the ten VLBA telescope stations over the [[internet]]. The operators aim the antennas, select [[radio frequencies]] for observation, control the hard drives, and monitor the weather and 'health' of the equipment at every site. A real-time display of the array's status is available for observers to also monitor their observations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vlba.nrao.edu/whatis/aoc.html NRAO's AOC information page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The VLBA's digital correlator is also housed in the AOC. When the hard drives from the telescopes' last observation are brought to the AOC, the supercalculator combines them into a merged dataset, creating the mathematical equivalent of a single, giant telescope's observation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrao.edu/explorer/vla/TheVLAExplorer.php?map=OperationsSite&amp;id=AOC09&lt;/ref&gt;

The AOC is a component of the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] and is located inside the NRAO's Pete V. Domenici Science Operations Center on the campus of the [[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology]].

An '''assault course''' (also called '''trim trail''') is a special sort of [[trail]] that combines [[running]] and [[Physical exercise|exercising]]. It was more popular in the 1970s than it is now.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} It is heavily used in [[military training]]. The prime use is to evaluate progress and weaknesses within the team involved.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

==Military training==
Assault courses are used in military training to increase fitness, to demonstrate techniques that can be used for crossing very rough terrain, and to increase teamwork and self-confidence.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

Often military assault courses will be standardised, and will have, for example (in the UK), a six-foot and a ten-foot wall, a climbing net, some type of bar to climb over, and a high rope or net that must be crossed (these being or representing the most likely difficult terrain that a soldier will come across). The standardisation means that every course will be to the same quality, though it also means that there will be certain parts that may be familiar if practised.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

However, they have different purposes. For example, they can be short (less than a minute) with a range on the end (e.g. Junior Leaders, Folkestone), or long (five minutes) as at Thetford.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} This is partially because of space restraints and training objectives. The short one can be run as an individual course and a warmup for the range. The long Thetford course is more of an exercise in endurance and teamwork.

The term "trim trail" has more recently been applied to a series of wooden exercise stations, scattered in parkland or other locations beside a jogging or walking trail, which can be used to develop balance, strength and coordination.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} They are suitable for both adults and children, and the individual stations have been scientifically designed to provide a range of exercise.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} Most have simple instructions attached to them, and the stations include balance beams, sit-up bars, chin-up bars, parallel bars, and more challenging stations such as pole climbs and ladder walks.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} Bristol City Council have now installed trim trails in six parks, ranging in complexity from Withywood Park, which has a single station, to Victoria Park, which has nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loughgallcountrypark.co.uk/?page=cycling&amp;sub=17 |title=Welcome to Loughall Country Park |publisher=Loughall Country Park |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/node/6645 |title=Trim trail exercise stations |publisher=Bristol City Council |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the trim trail at [[Hollingworth Lake]], in [[Greater Manchester]], which was the idea of the Friends of Hollingworth Lake and opened in August 2010, was provided by the [[Big Lottery Fund|Big Lottery]] Community Spaces fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwest.groundwork.org.uk/oldham--rochdale/news--events/news/2010/woodland-wonder-opens-for-all.aspx |title=Woodland Wonder opens for all |publisher=Groundwork Oldham and Rochdale |date=17 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212114711/http://www.northwest.groundwork.org.uk/oldham--rochdale/news--events/news/2010/woodland-wonder-opens-for-all.aspx |archivedate=12 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23003">The '''Bachelor of Engineering''',  abbreviated as '''B.E.''', '''B.Eng.''' or '''B.A.I.''' (in Latin form) is a first professional [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] [[academic degree]] awarded to a student after four to five years of studying [[engineering]] at an accredited university. In the UK, a B.Eng. degree will be accredited by one of the Engineering Council's professional engineering institutions as suitable for registration as a [[incorporated engineer]] or [[chartered engineer]] with further study to masters level. In Canada the degree from a Canadian university can be accredited by the CEAB. Alternatively, it might be accredited directly by another professional engineering institution, such as the US-based [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE). The B.Eng. contributes to the route to [[chartered engineer (UK)]], registered engineer or licensed [[professional engineer]] and has been approved by representatives of the profession.

A B.E. has a greater emphasis on math and science, to allow the engineers to move from one discipline to another. Multi-discipline is required in certain fields, like Marine Engineering. The marine engineer is required to know mechanical, chemical and electric engineering. If an engineer is strictly staying in a single discipline he would probably be better served with a B.Sc. A typical B.Sc. is 128 credits. SUNY Maritime B.E. is 172 credits.

Most universities in the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Europe]] award the Bachelor of Science Engineering (B.Sc.Eng.), Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.), Bachelor of Engineering Science (B.Eng.Sc.), Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.) or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (B.A.Sc.) degree to undergraduate students of engineering study. For example, [[Canada]] is the only country that awards the B.A.Sc. degree for graduating engineers. Other institutions award engineering degrees specific to the area of study, such as B.S.E.E. ([[Bachelor of Science]] in Electrical Engineering) and BSME (Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/programs/ |title=Example Degrees  |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A less common and possibly the oldest variety of the degree in the English-speaking world, is ''Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria'' (B.A.I.), a [[Latin]] name meaning ''Bachelor in the Art of Engineering''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Engineering/welcome/index.php|title=School of Engineering - Trinity College Dublin|author=|date=|website=www.tcd.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here ''Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria'' implies an excellence in carrying out the 'art' or 'function' of an engineer. The degree is awarded by the [[University of Dublin]] (its [[Trinity College Dublin]] has had a School of Engineering since 1841) and also by the constituent universities of the [[National University of Ireland]] (N.U.I.){{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, but in everyday speech it is more commonly referred to as ''Bachelor of Engineering'' and the N.U.I. graduates also use the post-nomials translated into English, B.E., even though the actual degree and its parchment is in Latin{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

Some South African Universities refer to their engineering degrees as B.Ing. (''Baccalaureus Ingenieurswese'' - Afrikaans).

==International variations==

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], the ''Bachelor of Engineering'' (BEng) is a four-year undergraduate degree course and a professional qualification. It is also available as a six-year sandwich course (where students are required to undertake a period of professional placement as part of the degree) or an eight-year part-time course through some universities. The Institution of Engineers, Australia ([[Engineers Australia]]) accredits degree courses and graduates of accredited courses are eligible for membership of the Institution. Bachelor of Engineering graduates may commence work as a graduate professional engineer upon graduation, although some may elect to undertake further study such as a [[Master's]] or [[Doctoral]] degree. Chartered Professional Engineer (CPEng) status or the various State registration requirements are usually obtained in later years. Graduates with formal engineering qualifications in Australia are often referred to as Professional Engineers to distinguish them from other professions where the term "Engineer" is used loosely.

=== Bangladesh ===
In [[Bangladesh]], ''Bachelor of Science in Engineering'' B.Sc. (Engineering) is a four year under-graduate university degree. Eligibility for entry is 12 years of school education under science background. Generally the first year (first two semesters) is common to all branches and has the same subjects of study. Courses divert after first year. The medium of instruction and examination is English. Generally, universities in Bangladesh offer engineering degree in the following branches: [[Computer Science and Engineering]], [[Civil Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Electrical and Electronics Engineering]], [[Industrial and Production Engineering]], Information and Communication Engineering, [[Material Science and Engineering]], [[Nuclear Engineering]], [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Textile Engineering]], [[Aeronautical Engineering]], [[Electronics and Communication Engineering]], [[Biomedical Engineering]], [[Food engineering]] and [[Agricultural Engineering]]. The [[Ministry of Education (Bangladesh)]], [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|UGC]] and [[Government of Bangladesh]] are responsible for approving engineering colleges and branches/courses. Only those universities which have been approved by these bodies can award degrees which are legally valid and are accepted as qualifiers for jobs in the government and private sector.

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], degrees awarded for undergraduate engineering studies include: the ''Bachelor of Engineering'' (B.Eng. or B.E., depending on the institution); the ''Bachelor of Applied Science'' (B.A.Sc.); and the ''Bachelor of Science in Engineering'' (B.Sc.Eng.).

The [[Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board]] (CEAB), a division of the [[Canadian Council of Professional Engineers|Engineers Canada]], sets out and maintains the standards of accreditation among Canadian undergraduate engineering programs. Graduates of those programs are deemed by the profession to have the required academic qualifications to be licensed as professional engineers in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pr_accreditation.cfm|title=About accreditation - Engineers Canada|author=|date=8 April 2014|website=engineerscanada.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is intended to maintain standards of education and allow mobility of engineers in different provinces of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/canadian-engineering-accreditation-board|title=Accreditation Board - Engineers Canada|author=|date=8 August 2013|website=engineerscanada.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CEAB-accredited degree is the minimum academic requirement for registration as a professional engineer anywhere in the country and the standard against which all other engineering academic qualifications are measured.&lt;ref name="apegm1"&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board
  |url=http://www.apegm.mb.ca/CEAB.html
  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202014748/http://www.apegm.mb.ca/CEAB.html
  |archivedate=2014-02-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduation from an accredited program, which normally involves four years of study, is a required first step to becoming a [[Professional Engineer]]. Regulation and accreditation are accomplished through a self-governing body (the name of which varies from province to province), which is given the power by statute to register and discipline engineers, as well as regulate the field of engineering in the individual provinces.

Graduates of non-CEAB-accredited programs must demonstrate that their education is at least equivalent to that of a graduate of a CEAB-accredited program.&lt;ref name="apegm1"/&gt;

=== Germany ===
In [[Germany]], the ''Bachelor of Engineering'' was introduced as part of implementation of the [[Bologna process]]. However, this degree is in fact mostly offered by German [[Fachhochschule]]-institutions [[Universities of Applied Sciences]]{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. German technical universities award a [[Bachelor of Science]] in engineering rather than the BEng degree.

=== Finland ===
The situation is similar in [[Finland]] as in Germany. Universities of applied sciences ([[ammattikorkeakoulu]]) grant professional bachelor's degrees (''insinööri (amk)''). The degree does not traditionally prepare for further study, but due to the Bologna process, a completely new degree of ''ylempi insinööri (yamk)'' has been introduced for engineers who wish to continue studying after some work experience. Before 2005, academic universities (see [[Education in Finland]]) did not make an administrative distinction between studies on the Bachelor's and Master's level and the Master's level [[diplomi-insinööri]] was the first degree to be received. Due to the [[Bologna process]] an intermediate "Bachelor of Science in Engineering" (''tekniikan kandidaatti'') has been introduced.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, Bachelor of Engineering (BE) or Bachelor of science in Engineering (BS/BSc Engineering) is a four years undergraduate professional university degree. The prerequisite for this program is a two years FSc pre-engineering or a three years Diploma of Associate Engineer (DAE) in specific fields e.g. Chemical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering etc. [[Pakistan Engineering Council]] (PEC) is the responsible government body for accreditation of undergraduate engineering degrees, registration of engineers and regulation of engineering profession in Pakistan. PEC is a full signatory of [[Washington Accord]] and International Professional Engineer (IntPE) Agreement (IPEA).

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, the Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) is a four-year undergraduate course. The pre-requisite for this course is either Higher Secondary Level(10+2 Science) with Physics Major or Proficiency Certificate Level (PCL) in Engineering or Science. Institute of Engineering under the umbrella of Tribhuvan University offers B.E. degree in several disciplines such as Electronics and Communication Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Automobile Engineering, Geomatics Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Agricultural Engineering etc. Likewise other universities in Nepal such as Kathmandu University, Pokhara University and Purbanchal University, Mid Western University offers B.E. degree in most of aforementioned engineering disciplines. The normal duration for the completion of the course is 4 years. However, the maximum time to complete the course is 8 years from the time of registration or 4 years after the normal duration.
Graduates of B.E. degrees can apply for the Engineer title (Er.) or certification as registered engineer to a governing body called Nepal Engineering Council (NEC). After the scrutiny examination of the application/applicants, Nepal Engineering Council provides the Certificate of Registration as a General Engineer which is a must for practicing engineering profession in Nepal. For example: If a student called XYZ graduate with B.E. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from one of the accredited universities, he/she is registered as a General Electronics and Communication Engineer with Er. title written in front of name as Er. XYZ

=== Netherlands ===
In the [[Netherlands]] the ''Bachelor of Engineering'' was also introduced as part of implementation of the [[Bologna Process]], the same as in Germany. The degree is only offered by Dutch [[Hogeschool]]-institutions and is equivalent to the Dutch engineer's degree "ingenieur" (ing.). A Dutch BEng involves a rigorous study of four years and is only awarded in the field of [[aeronautical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[industrial engineering]] or [[electrical engineering]]. Completion of a Dutch engineer's study in the field [[biochemical engineering]], [[biomedical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], [[material engineering]] is however awarded with a [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] degree. Dutch technical universities award a [[Bachelor of Science]] in engineering (BSc) instead of the BEng degree.

=== India ===
In India, Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree is a professional undergraduate degree awarded after completion of four years of engineering study. [[Institute of national importance]], like [[Indian Institute of Technology]] (IIT) and [[National Institute of Technology]] (NIT) offer [[Bachelor of Technology]] (B.Tech) degree instead of BE in engineering disciplines. Some Indian universities offer engineering degree under the name of Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and some universities offer engineering degree under the name of [[B.Tech]] but whichever name is used, the degree course follows the standard curriculum laid down by the [[University Grants Commission of India]] (UGC), [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA). There is no difference in the program objectives and learning outcomes of BE and [[B.Tech.]] except nomenclature. Eligibility for entry is 12 years of school education. Generally the first year (first two semesters) is common to all branches and has the same subjects of study. Courses divert after first year. The medium of instruction and examination is English. Generally, universities in India offer engineering degree in the following branches: [[Civil Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Electrical and Electronics Engineering]], [[Electronics and Communications Engineering]], [[Instrumentation and Control Engineering]], [[Computer Science and Engineering]], [[Information Technology]], [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Metallurgical Engineering]], [[Aerospace Engineering]], [[Production Engineering]], [[Biochemical Engineering]], [[Biomedical Engineering]] and [[Agricultural Engineering]]. The [[University Grants Commission of India]] (UGC), [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA) are responsible government authorities for approving engineering colleges and branches/courses. Only those universities which have been approved by these bodies can award degrees which are legally valid and are accepted as qualifiers for jobs in the central/state government and private sector.

The '''Bachelor of Science in Agriculture''', usually abbreviated as either '''B.Sc.(Agr.)''' or '''B.S.A.''' or '''B.Sc.(Ag.)''' or  '''B.Sc. (Hons.) Ag.''' is the first [[undergraduate]] [[Academic degree|degree]] awarded by university faculty of [[agriculture]] and [[agricultural college]]s. The program is 4 years of study above Grade 12 [[High school (North America)|High School]] graduation.
{{farming}}
The B.Sc.(Agr.) degree differs from a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] degree in that the courses focus on agriculture: for example, the student will study [[agricultural economics]] rather than [[economics]]. Like [[engineering]] or [[forestry]], [[agricultural science]] courses are infused with practicality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsac.ns.ca/prospectivestudents/programs NSAC example of programs] Retrieved 8 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The B.Sc.(Agr.) degree is normally not a general degree but requires specialization: for example, majoring in [[animal science]], plant protection, [[soil science]] or [[agricultural engineering]].

There are also variations on the theme: for example, the Bachelor of Agricultural Economics (BAgrEc) degree

== History of the degree ==
In [[Canada]], the [[Ontario Agricultural College]] (founded 1873) began awarding a three-year B.S.A. degree through the [[University of Toronto]] in 1888: a fourth year to the program was added in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oac.uoguelph.ca/about/overview.cfm OAC history] Retrieved 8 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]] of 1862 (also known as the Land Grant Act) had a large influence on the rise of agricultural education and the spread of the B.Sc.(Agr.) degree. By the early part of the 20th century, all the agriculturally important states had at least one college or university awarding the B.Sc.(Agr.) degree.

== B.Sc.(Ag.) in India ==

=== Size of agricultural education in India ===
[[India]] has one of the world's largest agricultural education system with 42 State Agricultural Universities (SAUs),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.www.icar.org.in/sau.htm] Retrieved 23 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 3 Central Agricultural Universities (CAUs) viz. Imphal, Pusa(Bihar) and Jhansi, 5 Deemed Universities (DUs) and 4 general Central Universities with Agriculture faculty. These institutions enroll on annual basis about 15,000 students at UG level in as many as 11 disciplines and over 7,000 students at PG and 1700 at PhD level. At any point, there are over 75,000 students studying in SAUs. In addition to this, there are large number of private colleges both affiliated and non-affiliated to SAUs which also annually admit larger number of students. Many general universities also offer agricultural education either themselves or through affiliated colleges. Agricultural education is a broad term which includes disciplines of Agriculture (Agronomy), [[Veterinary Science]], Forestry, Fisheries, [[Horticulture]], [[Home Science]] etc.&lt;ref name="www.icar.org.in"&gt;[http://www.www.icar.org.in/miscel/report.pdf] Retrieved 23 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Features of the Indian B.Sc.(Ag.) degree ===
The B.Sc.(Ag.) degree in India is typically a 4-year course under credit based semester system. The minimum qualification for entry to B.Sc.(Ag.) is Intermediate (12 years of school education) in Science (with Physics, Chemistry, Biology and/or Mathematics) or Intermediate in Agriculture stream (limited states). The curriculum is very broad and inter-disciplinary consisting of courses in 
# [[Agronomy]], 
# Horticulture, 
# Plant Pathology, 
# Entomology, 
# Agricultural Economics,
# Extension education, 
# Genetics and Plant Breeding, 
# Soil Science, 
# Food technology, 
# Animal Husbandry &lt;br&gt; apart from supporting courses in Basic Sciences, Humanities and Agricultural Engineering. The program also includes a compulsory 1 semester Internship (Rural Agricultural Work Experience). Most of the courses are infused with practicality with emphasis on 'hands on' experience and 'learning by doing'.

Prior to 1998, the B.Sc.(Ag.) degree was known as B.Sc.(Ag. &amp; AH) ( AH= Animal Husbandry) and evaluation was on a 5-point scale. Since 1998, it has been designated as B.Sc.(Ag.) and the 'AH' part has been transferred to BVSc (Bachelor of Veterinary Sciences), which is now designated as BVSc &amp; AH. However, B.Sc.(Ag.) still retains courses in Animal husbandry and nutrition. Also, the 5 point evaluation system was replaced with a 10-point system. The provision of 'optionals' in 7th/8th semester was also done away with in 1998.

In 2006, ICAR has recommended to re-designate B.Sc.(Ag.) as B.Sc. (Hons.) Ag.) and return to 'optionals' system in 7th/8th semester.&lt;ref name="www.icar.org.in"/&gt;

Like, BE/BTech, MBBS or BVSc&amp;AH, B.Sc.(Ag.) is considered as a 'professional' degree by [[Government of India]]. However, in recognition to its 4-year duration, B.Sc.(Ag.) holders are given some benefits like- B.Sc.(Ag.) holders receive higher stipend than BSc holders in DBT supported post graduate courses in Biotechnology. The Gazetted post like Agricultural Officer(Agronomist) the Basic educational requirement is B.Sc in Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnu.ac.in/Admission/MScAgri09.htm] Retrieved 23 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the reverse effect is argued, where it is proposed that language comprehension influences movement and sensation. Proponents of the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action conduct and interpret [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Cognitive science|cognitive]], and [[Kinesiology|movement]] studies within the framework of [[embodied cognition]] and [[embodied language processing]]. '''Embodied language''' developed from embodied cognition, and proposes that sensorimotor systems are not only involved in the comprehension of language, but that they are necessary for understanding the [[Semantics|semantic]] meaning of words.

Action-oriented models of cognition propose that cognitive processes stem from action (bottom, red), thereby necessitating sensorimotor systems for higher cognitive processes like language comprehension. Adapted from Kilner et al. (2016).]]
The theory that sensory and motor processes are coupled to cognitive processes stems from action-oriented models of cognition.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://bernhard-hommel.eu/SFR18_10%20Kilner%20et%20al.pdf|title=The Pragmatic Turn: Toward Action-Oriented Views in Cognitive Science|last=Kilner|first=J.|last2=Hommel|first2=B.|last3=Bar|first3=M.|last4=Barsalou|first4=L.W.|last5=Friston|first5=K.J.|last6=Jost|first6=J.|last7=Maye|first7=A.|last8=Metzinger|first8=T.|last9=Pulvermuller|first9=F. et al.,|publisher=MIT Press|year=2016|isbn=|volume=18|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=159–173|chapter=Action-oriented models of cognitive processing: A little less cogitation, a little more action please}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories, such as the [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] and [[Situated cognition|situated]] cognitive theories, propose that cognitive processes are rooted in areas of the brain involved in [[Motor cortex|movement planning and execution]], as well as areas responsible for [[Primary sensory areas|processing]] [[Sensory cortex|sensory]] input, termed sensorimotor areas or areas of action and perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barsalou|first=L.W.|year=2008|title=Grounded Cognition|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=59|pages=617–645|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to action-oriented models, higher cognitive processes evolved from sensorimotor brain regions, thereby necessitating sensorimotor areas for cognition and language comprehension.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; With this organization, it was then hypothesized that action and cognitive processes exert influence on one another in a bi-directional manner: action and perception influence language comprehension, and language comprehension influences sensorimotor processes.

Although studied in a unidirectional manner for many years, the bi-directional hypothesis was first described and tested in detail by Aravena et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These authors utilized the [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]], a task commonly used to study the relationship between action and language, to test the effects of performing simultaneous language comprehension and motor tasks on neural and behavioral signatures of movement and language comprehension.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These authors proposed that these two tasks cooperate bi-directionally when compatible, and interfere bi-directionally when incompatible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, when the movement implied by the action language stimuli is compatible with the movement being performed by the subject, it was hypothesized that performance of both tasks would be enhanced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Neural evidence of the bi-directional hypothesis was demonstrated by this study,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the development of this hypothesis is ongoing.

== Effects of Language Comprehension on Systems of Action ==
Language comprehension tasks can exert influence over systems of action, both at the neural and behavioral level. This means that language stimuli influence both electrical activity in sensorimotor areas of the brain, as well as actual movement.

=== Neural activation ===
Language stimuli influence electrical activity in sensorimotor areas of the brain that are specific to the bodily-association of the words presented. This is referred to as [[Semantics|semantic]] [[Somatotopic arrangement|somatotopy]], which indicates activation of sensorimotor areas that are specific to the bodily association implied by the word. For example, when processing the meaning of the word “kick,” the regions in the motor and somatosensory cortices that represent the legs will become more active.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hauk|first=O.|last2=Johnsrude|first2=I.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2004|title=Somatotopic representation of action words in human motor and premotor cortex|url=|journal=Neuron|volume=41|pages=301–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boulenger|first=V.|last2=Hauk|first2=O.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2009|title=Grasping ideas with the motor system: Semantic somatotopy in idiom comprehension|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=19|pages=1905–1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulenger et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; demonstrated this effect by presenting subjects with action-related language while measuring neural activity using [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]]. Subjects were presented with action sentences that were either associated with the legs (e.g. “John kicked the object”) or with the arms (e.g. “Jane grasped the object”). The medial region of the [[motor cortex]], known to represent the legs, was more active when subjects were processing leg-related sentences, whereas the lateral region of the motor cortex, known to represent the arms, was more active with arm-related sentences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This body-part-specific increase in activation was exhibited about 3 seconds after presentation of the word, a time window that is thought to indicate [[semantic processing]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, C., Binder, J.R., Medler, D.A., Liebenthal, E. (2007). "Time-course of semantic processes during sentence comprehension: an fMRI study." ''Neuroimage''. '''36''': 924-932.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this activation was associated with subjects comprehending the meaning of the word. This effect held true, and was even intensified, when subjects were presented with [[idiom]]atic sentences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Abstract language that implied more figurative actions were used, either associated with the legs (e.g. “John kicked the habit”) or the arms (e.g. “Jane grasped the idea”).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Increased neural activation of leg motor regions were demonstrated with leg-related idiomatic sentences, whereas arm-related idiomatic sentences were associated with increased activation of arm motor regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This activation was larger than that demonstrated by more literal sentences (e.g. “John kicked the object”), and was also present in the time window associated with semantic processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Action language not only activates body-part-specific areas of the motor cortex, but also influences neural activity associated with movement. This has been demonstrated during an [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]] task, a common test used to study the relationship between language comprehension and motor behavior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glenberg|first=A. M.|last2=Kaschak|first2=M.P.|date=2002|title=Grounding language in action|url=|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=9|pages=558–565}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task requires the subject to perform movements to indicate understanding of a sentence, such as moving to press a button or pressing a button with a specific hand posture, that are either compatible or incompatible with movement implied by the sentence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, pressing a button with an open hand to indicate understanding of the sentence "Jane high-fived Jack" would be considered a compatible movement, as the sentence implies an open-handed posture. Motor potentials (MP) are an [[Event-related potential|Event Related Potentials]] (ERPs) stemming from the motor cortex, and are associated with execution of movement.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Enhanced amplitudes of MPs have been associated with precision and quickness of movements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hatta|first=A.|last2=Nishihira|first2=Y.|last3=Higashiura|first3=T.|last4=Kim|first4=S.R.|last5=Kaneda|first5=T.|date=2009|title=Long-term motor practice induces practice-dependent modulation of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) preceding self-paced non-dominant handgrip movement in kendo players|url=|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=459|pages=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobounov|first=S.|last2=Johnston|first2=J.|last3=Chiang|first3=H.|last4=Ray|first4=W.J.|date=2002|title=Motor-related cortical potentials accompanying enslaving effect in single versus combination of fingers force production tasks|url=|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=113|pages=1444–1453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-afferent potentials (RAPs) are another form of ERP, and are used as a marker of sensory feedback&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deecke|first=L.|date=1987|title=Bereitschaftspotential as an indicator of movement preparation in supplementary motor area and motor cortex|url=|journal=Ciba Foundation Symposium|volume=132|pages=231–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=A.L.|last2=Staines|first2=W.R.|date=2006|title=Cortical adaptions and motor performance improvement associated with short-term bimanual training|url=|journal=Brain Research|volume=1071|pages=165–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both MP and RAP have been demonstrated to be enhanced during compatible ACE conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These results indicate that language can have a facilitory effect on the excitability of neural sensorimotor systems. This has been referred to as [[Priming (psychology)#Semantic|semantic]] [[Priming (psychology)|priming]],&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grisoni|first=L.|last2=Dreyer|first2=F.R.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2016|title=Somatotopic Semantic Priming and Prediction in the Motor System|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=26|pages=2353–2366}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that language primes neural sensorimotor systems, altering excitability and movement.

=== Movement ===
The ability of language to influence neural activity of motor systems also manifests itself behaviorally by altering movement. Semantic priming has been implicated in these behavioral changes, and has been used as evidence for the involvement of the motor system in language comprehension. The [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]] is indicative of these semantic priming effects. Understanding language that implies action may invoke motor facilitation, or prime the motor system, when the action or posture being performed to indicate language comprehension is compatible with action or posture implied by the language. Compatible ACE tasks have been shown to lead to shorter reaction times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwaan|first=R.A.|last2=Taylor|first2=L.J.|date=2006|title=Seeing, acting, understanding: motor resonance in language comprehension|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=135|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has been demonstrated on various types of movements, including hand posture during button pressing,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; reaching,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and manual rotation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Language stimuli can also prime the motor system simply by describing objects that are commonly manipulated. In a study performed by Masson et al., subjects were presented with sentences that implied non-physical, abstract action with an object (e.g. "John thought about the calculator" or "Jane remembered the thumbtack").&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After presentation of language stimuli, subjects were cued to perform either functional gestures, gestures typically made when using the object described in the sentence (e.g. poking for calculator sentences), or a volumetric gesture, gestures that are more indicative of whole hand posture (e.g. horizontal grasp for calculator sentences).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Target gestures were either compatible or incompatible with the described object, and were cued at two different time points, early and late. Response latencies for performing compatible functional gestures significantly decreased at both time points, whereas latencies were significantly lower for compatible volumetric gestures in the late cue condition.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masson|first=M.E.|last2=Bub|first2=D.N.|last3=Newton-Taylor|first3=M.|date=2008|title=Language-based access to gestural components of conceptual knowledge|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=61|pages=869–882}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results indicate that descriptions of abstract interactions with objects automatically (early time point) generate motor representations of functional gestures, priming the motor system and increasing response speed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The specificity of enhanced motor responses to the gesture-object interaction also highlights the importance of the motor system in semantic processing, as this enhanced motor response was dependent on the meaning of the word.  
[[File:Olmstead et al. figure.png|left|thumb|Change in relative phase shift (RPS), indicating movement coordination, as a function of language stimuli. Subjects exhibited a significant change in RPS only when presented with performable sentences. Adapted from Olmstead et al. (2009).]]
A study performed by Dr. Olmstead et al.,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olmstead|first=A.J.|last2=Viswanathan|first2=N.|last3=Aicher|first3=K.A.|last4=Fowler|first4=C.A.|date=2009|title=Sentence comprehension affects the dynamics of bimanual coordination: Implications for embodied cognition|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=62|pages=2409–2417}}&lt;/ref&gt; described in detail [[Embodied cognition#Language comprehension|elsewhere]], demonstrates more concretely the influence that the semantics of action language can have on movement coordination. Briefly, this study investigated the effects of action language on the coordination of rhythmic bimanual hand movements. Subjects were instructed to move two [[pendulum]]s, one with each hand, either in-[[Phase (waves)|phase]] (pendulums are at the same point in their cycle, [[phase difference]] of roughly 0 degrees) or anti-phase (pendulums are at the opposite point in their cycle, phase difference of roughly 180 degrees).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Robust behavioral studies have revealed that these two phase states, with phase differences 180 and 0 degrees, are the two stable relative phase states, or the two coordination patterns that produce stable movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information, natural law, and the self-assembly of rhythmic movement|last=Kugler|first=P.|last2=Turvey|first2=M.|publisher=Routledge|year=1987|isbn=|location=Hillside, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This pendulum swinging task was performed as subjects judged sentences for their plausibility; subjects were asked to indicate whether or not each presented sentence made logical sense.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plausible sentences described actions that could be performed by a human using the arms, hands, and/or fingers ("He is swinging the bat"), or actions that could not be performed ("The barn is housing the goat").&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Implausible sentences also used similar action verbs ("He is swinging the hope"). Plausible, performable sentences lead to a significant change in the relative phase shift of the bimanual pendulum task.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The coordination of the movement was altered by action language stimuli, as the relative phase shift that produced stable movement was significantly different than in the non-performable sentence and no language stimuli conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This development of new stable states has been used to imply a reorganization of the motor system utilized to plan and execute this movement,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and supports the bi-directional hypothesis by demonstrating an effect of action language on movement.

== Effects of Systems of Action on Language Comprehension ==
The bi-directional hypothesis of action and language proposes that altering the activity of motor systems, either through altered neural activity or actual movement, influences language comprehension. Neural activity in specific areas of the brain can be altered using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), or by studying patients with [[Neuropathology|neuropathologies]] leading to specific sensory and/or motor deficits. Movement is also used to alter the activity of neural motor systems, increasing overall excitability of motor and pre-motor areas.

=== Neural activation ===
Altered neural activity of motor systems has been demonstrated to influence language comprehension. One such study that demonstrates this effect was performed by Dr. Pulvermüller et al.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulvermüller|first=F.|last2=Hauk|first2=O.|last3=Nikulin|first3=V.|last4=Ilmoneimi|first4=R.J.|date=2005|title=Functional links between motor and language systems|url=|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|volume=21|pages=793–797}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMS was used to increase the excitability of either the leg region or the arm region of the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Authors stimulated the left motor cortex, known to be more closely involved in language processing in right-handed individuals, the right motor cortex, as well as a sham stimulation where stimulation was prevented by a plastic block placed between the coil and the skull.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During the stimulation protocols, subjects were shown 50 arm, 50 leg, 50 distractor (no bodily relation), and 100 pseudo- (not real) words.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Subjects were asked to indicate recognition of a meaningful word by moving their lips, and response times were measured.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It was found that stimulation of the left leg region of the motor cortex significantly reduced response times for recognition of leg words as compared to arm words, whereas the reverse was true for stimulation of the arm region.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Stimulation site on the right motor cortex, as well as sham stimulation, did not exhibit these effects.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, somatotopically-specific stimulation of the left motor cortex facilitated word comprehension in a body-part-specific manner, where stimulation of the leg and arm regions lead to enhanced comprehension of leg and arm words, respectively.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This study has been used as evidence for the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action, as it showcases that manipulating motor cortex activity alters language comprehension in a semantically-specific manner.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A similar experiment has been performed on the articulatory motor cortex, or the mouth and lip regions of the motor cortex used in the production of words.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schomers|first=M.R.|last2=Kirilina|first2=E.|last3=Weigand|first3=A.|last4=Bajbouj|first4=M.|last5=Pulvermüller|first5=F.|date=2014|title=Causal influence of articulatory motor cortex on comprehending single spoken words: TMS evidence|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=25|pages=3894–3902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two categories of words were used as language stimuli: words that involved the lips for production (e.g. "pool") or the tongue (e.g. "tool).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Subjects listened to the words, were shown pairs of pictures, and were asked to indicate which picture matched the word they heard with a button press.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; TMS was used prior to presentation of the language stimuli to selectively facilitate either the lip or tongue regions of the left motor cortex; these two TMS conditions were compared to a control condition where TMS was not applied.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It was found that stimulation of the lip region of the motor cortex lead to a significantly decreased response time for lip words as compared to tongue words.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In addition, during recognition of tongue words, reduced reaction times were seen with tongue TMS as compared to lip TMS and no TMS.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although this same effect was not seen with lip words, authors attribute this to the complexity of tongue as opposed to lip movements, and the increase difficulty of tongue words as opposed to lip.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Overall, this study demonstrates that the activity in the articulatory motor cortex influences the comprehension of single spoken words, and highlights the importance of the motor cortex in speech comprehension&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Lesions of sensory and motor areas have also been studied to elucidate the effects of sensorimotor systems on language comprehension. One such example of this is the patient JR; this patient has a lesion in areas in the auditory association [[Auditory cortex|cortex]] implicated in processing [[Auditory system|auditory]] information.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trumpp|first=N.M.|last2=Kliese|first2=D.|last3=Hoenig|first3=K.|last4=Haarmeier|first4=T.|last5=Kiefer|first5=M.|date=2013|title=Losing the sound of concepts: Damage to auditory association cortex impairs the processing of sound-related concepts|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=49|pages=474–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; This patient showcases significant impairments in conceptual and perceptual processing of sound-related language and objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, processing the meaning of words describing sound-related objects (e.g., "bell') was significantly impaired in JR as compared to non-sound-related objects (e.g., "armchair").&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These data suggest that damage of sensory regions involved in processing auditory information specifically impair processing of sound-related conceptual information,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; highlighting the necessity of sensory systems for language comprehension.

=== Movement ===
Movement has been shown to influence language comprehension. This has been demonstrated by priming motor areas with movement, increasing the excitability of motor and pre-motor areas associated with the body part being moved.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mollo|first=G.|last2=Pulvermüller|first2=F.|last3=Hauk|first3=O.|date=2016|title=Movement priming of EEG/MEG brain responses for action-words characterizes the link between language and action|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=74|pages=262–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that motor engagement of a specific body part decreases neural activity in language processing areas when processing words related to that body part.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This decreased neural activity is a feature of semantic priming, and suggests that activation of specific motor areas through movement can facilitate language comprehension in a semantically-dependent manner.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; An interference effect has also been demonstrated. During incompatible ACE conditions, neural signatures of language comprehension have been shown to be inhibited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Combined, these pieces of evidence have been used to support a semantic role of the motor system.

Movement can also inhibit language comprehension tasks, particularly tasks of verbal working memory.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shebani|first=Z.|last2=Pulvermüller|first2=F.|date=2013|title=Moving the hands and feet specifically impairs working memory for arm-and leg-related action words|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=49|pages=222–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to memorize and verbally recall four-word sequences of either arm or leg action words, performing complex, rhythmic movements after presentation of the word sequences was demonstrated to interfere with memory performance.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This performance deficit was body-part specific, where movement of the legs impaired performance of recall of leg words, and movement of the arms impaired recall of arm words.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These data indicate that sensorimotor systems exhibit cortically specific "inhibitory casual effects" on memory of action words,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; as impairment was specific to motor engagement and bodily association of the words.

== Organization of Neural Substrates ==
Relating cognitive functions to brain structures is done in the field of [[cognitive neuroscience]]. This field attempts to map cognitive processes, such as language comprehension, onto neural activation of specific brain structures.The bi-directional hypothesis of language and action requires that action and language processes have overlapping brain structures, or shared [[neural substrate]]s, thereby necessitating motor areas for language comprehension. The neural substrates of embodied cognition are often studied using the cognitive tasks of [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|object recognition]], [[Activity recognition|action recognition]], [[Working memory|working memory tasks]], and [[Sentence processing|language comprehension]] tasks. These networks have been elucidated with behavioral, computational, and imaging studies, but the discovery of their exact organization is ongoing.

=== Circuit organization ===
[[File:Leg Neural Network.jpg|thumb|Proposed organization of motor-semantic neural circuits for action language comprehension. Gray dots represent areas of language comprehension, creating a network for comprehending all language. The semantic circuit of the motor system, particularly the motor representation of the legs (yellow dots), is incorporated when leg-related words are comprehended. Adapted from Shebani et al. (2013).]]
It has been proposed that the control of movement is organized hierarchically, where movement is not controlled by individually controlling single neurons, but that movements are represented at a gross, more functional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawato|first=M.|last2=Furukawa|first2=K.|last3=Suzuki|first3=R.|date=1987|title=A hierarchical neural-network model for control and learning of voluntary movement|url=|journal=Biological cybernetics|volume=57|pages=169–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept has been applied to the control of cognition, resulting in the theory of cognitive circuits.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulvermüller|first=F.|last2=Garagnani|first2=M.|last3=Wennekers|first3=T.|date=2014|title=Thinking in circuits: toward neurobiological explanation in cognitive neuroscience|url=|journal=Biological cybernetics|volume=108|pages=573–593}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory proposes that there are functional units of neurons in the brain that are strongly connected, and act coherently as a functional unit during cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; These functional units of neurons, or "thought circuits," have been referred to as the "building blocks of cognition".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thought circuits are believed to have been originally formed from basic anatomical connections, that were strengthened with correlated activity through [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian learning]] and plasticity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Formation of these neural networks has been demonstrated with computational models using known anatomical connections and Hebbian learning principles.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Pulvermüller, F., &amp; Garagnani, M. (2014). From sensorimotor learning to memory cells in prefrontal and temporal association cortex: a neurocomputational study of disembodiment. ''Cortex,'' '''57:''' 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sensory stimulation through interaction with an object activates a distributed network of neurons in the cortex. Repeated activation of these neurons, through Hebbian plasticity, may strengthen their connections and form a circuit.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doursat, R., &amp; Bienenstock, E. "Neocortical self-structuration as a basis for learning." ''5th International conference on development and learning (ICDL 2006)''. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This sensory circuit may then be activated during the perception of known objects.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This same concept has been applied to action and language, as understanding of the meaning of action words requires an understanding of the action itself. During language and motor skill development, one likely learns to associate an action word with an action or a sensation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This action or sensation, and the correlated sensorimotor areas involved, are then incorporated into the neural representation of that concept.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This leads to semantic topography, or the activation of motor areas related to the meaning and bodily-association of action language.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These networks may be organized into "kernels," areas highly activated by language comprehension tasks, and "halos," brain areas in the periphery of networks that experience slightly increased activation.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; It has been hypothesized that language comprehension is housed in the left-perisylvian neuronal circuit, forming the "kernel," and sensorimotor regions are peripherally activated during semantic processing of action language, forming the "halo".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Evidence for shared neural networks ===
Many studies that have demonstrated a role of the motor system in semantic processing of action language have been used as evidence for a shared neural network between action and language comprehension processes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; For example, facilitated activity in language comprehension areas, evidence of semantic priming, with movement of a body part that is associated with the action word has also been used as evidence for this shared neural network.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; A more specific method for identifying whether certain areas of the brain are necessary for a cognitive task is to demonstrate impaired performance of said task following a functional change to the brain area of interest.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Shallice, T. ''From neuropsychology to mental structure''. Cambridge University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  A functional change may involve a lesion, or altered excitability through stimulation, or utilization of the area for another task.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; According to this theory, there is only a finite amount of neural real-estate available for each task. If two tasks share a neural network, there will be competition for the associated neural substrates, and the performance of each task will be inhibited when performed simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Using this theory, proponents of the bi-directional hypothesis have postulated that performance of verbal working memory of action words would be impaired by movement of the concordant body part.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This has been demonstrated with the selective impairment of memorization of arm and leg words when coupled with arm and leg movements, respectively.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This implies that the neural network for verbal working memory is specifically tied to the motor systems associated with the body part implied with the word.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This semantic topography has been suggested to provide evidence that action language shares a neural network with sensorimotor systems, thereby supporting the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is a landscape depicting the [[Seine|River Seine]] at [[Argenteuil]] in France. It is owned by Englishman David Joel.

In 2011 ''Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil'' was featured on the British TV programme, ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'', in a failed attempt to establish it as an authentic Monet.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;

==Authenticity==
The painting was acquired by David Joel in 1992 for £40,000.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; Joel is an art historian who has published two art books, the first a [[catalogue raisonné]] of the marine paintings of [[Charles Brooking]], the second a history of Monet at Vétheuil and on the Norman Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Joel, David. ''Charles Brooking, 1723-1759, and the 18th Century British Marine Painters''. Antique Collectors Club, 2000 (published for the National Maritime Museum. It is the earliest Catalogue Raisonne for any English painter, for Hogarth died after Brooking.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monet&gt;Joel, David. ''Monet at Vétheuil and on the Norman Coast, 1878-1883''. Antique Collectors Club, 2002.(It covers all of Monet's lifetime, with an analysis of his pictures)&lt;/ref&gt; The painting had previously been offered for sale at auction, but failed to reach its £500,000 reserve.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2002680/I-Monet-After-20-year-fight-owner-close-proving-painting-genuine--worth-1-5-million.html |title=Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2011-06-12 |accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title ''{{Lang|fr|Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil}}'' along with the date, 1875, appears on the frame, and there is a painted signature of Claude Monet.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; In the years since he purchased it, Joel has attempted to establish it as an authentic Monet.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; The most widely accepted authority on Monet's work is the catalogue raisonné published by the [[Wildenstein Institute]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; The Wildenstein Institute has examined the painting once, after the death of [[Daniel Wildenstein]], and does not accept it as genuine.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; [[Fiona Bruce]] (a journalist) and [[Philip Mould]] (an art dealer and historian) investigated the painting in the TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' first aired on 19 June 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman |first=Len |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13785393 |title=BBC programme preview |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-06-19 |accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Access Research Centre scanned the picture using high resolution, [[infrared]] and [[X-ray]] photography.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; At the Lumiere Technology Centre the picture was scanned using a 240-megapixel camera and 13 light filters.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; The resulting image was examined by Iris Schaefer, the head of conservation at the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum in Cologne, who previously uncovered a fake Monet which had been accepted by the Wildenstein Institute. In her opinion, the Joel painting was genuine.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; The chemical analysis of paints used in the painting and signature were studied by Nicholas Eastaugh ([[Courtauld Institute of Art]]) and were found to conform precisely with Monet's palette and the mediums he used in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Joel, David. ''Monet at Vétheuil and on the Norman Coast, 1878-1883''. Antique Collectors Club, 2002, p.190 and p.195&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme had the brushwork and signature examined by experts who concluded that they were by Monet.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; The programme argued that the painting was genuine, an opinion shared by a number of experts,&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; including Monet scholars Professor John House (Courtauld Institute of Art),&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; Professor Paul Hayes Tucker, and others.&lt;ref&gt;The painting was included in "Monet: a Retrospective", curated by Tucker, Katsunori Fukaya, and Katsumi Miyazaki. Copyright by Bridgestone Museum of Art, Tokyo, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However the Wildenstein Institute did not accept their arguments, and maintains that the painting is a fake, based predominantly on the [[Connoisseur#Connoisseurship in Art|connoisseurship]]  of the late [[Daniel Wildenstein]].&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV and Radio |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8581959/Fake-or-Fortune-BBC-One-review.html |title=Telegraph programme review |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only photograph he would have had access to was a small 4&amp;nbsp;cm x 8&amp;nbsp;cm black and white copy in an obituary of Monet, written by René Chavange for ''{{Lang|fr|Le Figaro Artistique}}'' in 1926.&lt;ref name="Figaro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/805/pageone0201.jpg/ |title=Le Figaro Artistique, 16 December 1926, p.149 (Published eight days after Monet's death) |publisher=Imageshack.us |date= |accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting was sold by [[Georges Petit]] in 1918 to the Khalil Palace in Cairo, where it stayed until 1953.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; It is known that Khalil bought a second Monet from Petit at the same time.  This is W1520, ''{{Lang|fr|Le pont aux nymphéas}}'', signed but not dated, which remains in his collection in Cairo. Rodolphe Walter, of the Wildenstein Institute, confirms that all of Petit’s records were destroyed in World War II.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  As such, Daniel Wildenstein would have had no access to a photo of the painting other than the one in ''{{Lang|fr|Le Figaro}}''.

[[File:The reverse of the photograph sent by Petit to Khalil.jpg|thumb|The reverse of the photograph sent by Petit to [[Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil Museum|Khalil]]]]

The Institute has since been provided with further photographs. Daniel Wildenstein was sent a photograph in 1992 by [[Christie's]], which was rejected. After the curator of the Khalil Museum discovered an original photograph sent by Petit to [[Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil]] in 1918 (discussed further below) Guy Wildenstein was informed, but did not change the verdict, relying instead on "connoisseurship".&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;

==Provenance==
The stretcher has a label from the Paris art supplies dealer Latouche who is known to have had dealings with Monet and to have supplied canvases to a number of impressionist artists. The style of this label suggests the canvas was sold before 1884. On the back of the painting there is also a French railway sticker for transport from Paris to Argenteuil where Monet lived between 1871 and 1878.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;
The back of the painting has a further sticker from a London gallery, [[Arthur Tooth &amp; Sons]], which handled a number of Monet paintings. The sticker has the number 3322. Gallery records show that it was acquired from Mahmoud Khalil, an Egyptian art collector whose collection is now housed in the [[Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil Museum]] in Cairo.

The museum records show a large black and white photograph (16&amp;nbsp;cm by 30&amp;nbsp;cm) of the painting, sent by Paris art dealer Georges Petit, who owned the largest gallery in Paris in Rue de Seze.  In June 1889 he mounted the great Monet/Rodin exhibition having persuaded his friend Monet to raise his prices.  He showed 145 paintings, selling most of them.  He remained Monet's second dealer, after Durand Ruel until he died in 1920.  This photograph is the dealer's card, sent to Khalil in Cairo in 1918 and leading to his purchase of the painting. On the reverse of the photograph, in the top left corner, is written the number 5575, followed by "Claude Monet, Les Bords de la Seine a Argenteuil, 42.5x73cm". This number appears also on a label on the reverse of the painting itself (even the handwriting is identical). Stylistically, the label matches others which are known to be from the Georges Petit gallery, and the number implies that it was in Petit’s gallery in 1918, well before Monet’s death in 1926. The funeral was held at Giverny on 8 December, and the obituary was published by ''Le Figaro'' eight days later, illustrated by what appears to be the same photograph.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;

The evidence suggests the following provenance:&lt;ref name=Monet191&gt;Joel, David. ''Monet at Vétheuil and on the Norman Coast, 1878-1883''. p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}'''''Brave New World''''' is a [[dystopian]] [[novel]] written in 1931 by English author [[Aldous Huxley]], and published in 1932. Largely set in a futuristic [[World State in Brave New World|World State]] of [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] citizens and an intelligence-based [[social hierarchy]], the novel anticipates huge scientific developments in [[reproductive technology]], [[sleep-learning]], [[psychological manipulation]], and [[classical conditioning]] that are combined to make a [[utopian society]] that goes challenged only by a single outsider. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in an essay, ''[[#Brave New World Revisited|Brave New World Revisited]]'' (1958), and with ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), his final novel.

In 1999, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''Brave New World'' fifth on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].&lt;ref name="100 Best Novels"&gt;{{cite web |title=100 Best Novels |publisher=Random House |year=1999 |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html |accessdate=23 June 2007}} This ranking was by the [http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/about/board.html Modern Library Editorial Board] of authors.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Robert McCrum]] writing for ''[[The Observer]]'' included ''Brave New World'' chronologically at number 53 in "the top 100 greatest novels of all time",&lt;ref name="McCrum"&gt;{{Cite news |title=100 greatest novels of all time |publisher=Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/12/features.fiction |accessdate=10 October 2012 |location=London |first=Robert |last=McCrum |date=12 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the novel was listed at number 87 on the [[BBC]]'s survey [[The Big Read]].&lt;ref name="BBC – The Big Read"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100_2.shtml "BBC – The Big Read"].

Translations of the title often allude to similar expressions used in domestic works of literature: the French edition of the work is entitled ''Le Meilleur des mondes'' (''The Best of All Worlds''), an allusion to an expression used by the philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]]&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. 'Leibniz', by Nicholas Jolley (Routledge, 2005){{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and satirised in ''[[Candide|Candide, Ou l'Optimisme]]'' by [[Voltaire]] (1759).

==History==
Huxley wrote ''Brave New World'' while living in [[Sanary-sur-Mer]], France, in the four months from May to August 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Iltis, Université Nancy II, http://www.sanary.com/a-huxley-in-sanary-1-introduction.html&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Huxley had already established himself as a writer and social satirist. He was a contributor to ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913-1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazines, and had published a collection of his poetry (''The Burning Wheel'', 1916) and four successful satirical novels: ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921), ''[[Antic Hay]]'' (1923), ''[[Those Barren Leaves]]'' (1925), and ''[[Point Counter Point]]'' (1928). ''Brave New World'' was Huxley's fifth novel and first [[dystopia]]n work.

Huxley said that ''Brave New World'' was inspired by the [[utopia]]n novels of [[H. G. Wells]], including ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905), and ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley, ''Letters of Aldous Huxley'', ed. by Grover Smith (New York and Evanston: Harper &amp; Row, 1969), p. 348: "I am writing a novel about the future—on the horror of the Wellsian Utopia and a revolt against it. Very difficult. I have hardly enough imagination to deal with such a subject. But it is none the less interesting work" (letter to Mrs. Kethevan Roberts, 18 May 1931).&lt;/ref&gt; Wells's hopeful vision of the future's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novels, which became ''Brave New World''. He wrote in a letter to Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had "been having a little fun pulling the leg of H. G. Wells", but then he "got caught up in the excitement of [his] own ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heje |first=Johan |chapter=Aldous Huxley |editor-last=Harris-Fain |editor-first=Darren |title=British Fantasy and Science-Fiction Writers, 1918–1960 |location=Detroit |publisher=Gale Group |year=2002 |page=100 |isbn=0-7876-5249-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred to ''Brave New World'' as a "negative utopia", somewhat influenced by Wells's own ''[[The Sleeper Awakes]]'' (dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works of [[D. H. Lawrence]].

[[George Orwell]] believed that ''Brave New World'' must have been partly derived from the 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]].&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell: [http://www.orwelltoday.com/weorwellreview.shtml ''Review''], ''Tribune'', 4 January 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 1962 letter to Christopher Collins, Huxley says that he wrote ''Brave New World'' long before he had heard of ''We''.&lt;ref name="Russell, p. 13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Zamiatin's We|last=Russell|first=Robert|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-85399-393-0|location=Bristol|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''We'' translator Natasha Randall, Orwell believed that Huxley was lying.&lt;ref name="NR1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2006/aug/18/underappreciated-literature-yevgeny-zamyatin/|title=Leonard Lopate Show|date=18 August 2006|publisher=WNYC|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405075001/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2006/aug/18/underappreciated-literature-yevgeny-zamyatin/|archivedate=5 April 2011|df=dmy}} (radio interview with ''We'' translator Natasha Randall)&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific futurism in ''Brave New World'' is believed to be cribbed from ''[[Daedalus; or, Science and the Future|Daedalus]]'' by [[J. B. S. Haldane]].&lt;ref&gt;''Disturbing the Universe'', Chapter 15, Freeman Dyson, Basic Books, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The events of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in Britain in 1931, with its mass unemployment and the abandonment of the gold currency standard, persuaded Huxley to assert that stability was the "primal and ultimate need" if civilisation was to survive the present crisis.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"/&gt; The ''Brave New World'' character Mustapha Mond, Resident World Controller of Western Europe, is named after Sir [[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|Alfred Mond]]. Shortly before writing the novel, Huxley visited [[Billingham Manufacturing Plant|Mond's technologically advanced plant]] near [[Billingham]], north east England, and it made a great impression on him.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"&gt;Introduction by David Bradshaw. p. xxii. Huxley, Aldous. "Brave New World". Random House, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley used the setting and characters in his science fiction novel to express widely held opinions, particularly the fear of losing individual identity in the fast-paced world of the future. An early trip to the United States gave ''Brave New World'' much of its character. Not only was Huxley outraged by the culture of youth, commercial cheeriness and sexual promiscuity, and the inward-looking nature of many Americans,&lt;ref&gt;The Vintage Classics edition of ''Brave New World''.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had also found the book ''My Life and Work'' by [[Henry Ford]] on the boat to America, and he saw the book's principles applied in everything he encountered after leaving San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, David.

==Plot==
The novel opens in the [[World state in Brave New World|World State]] city of [[London]] in AF (After Ford) 632 (AD 2540 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]), where citizens are engineered through [[artificial uterus|artificial wombs]] and childhood indoctrination programmes into predetermined [[social class|classes]] (or castes) based on intelligence and labour. Lenina Crowne, a hatchery worker, is popular and sexually desirable, but Bernard Marx, a psychologist, is not. He is shorter in stature than the average member of his high caste, which gives him an [[inferiority complex]]. His work with [[hypnopaedia|sleep-learning]] allows him to understand, and disapprove of, his society's methods of keeping its citizens peaceful, which includes their constant consumption of a soothing, happiness-producing drug called ''soma''. Courting disaster, Bernard is vocal and arrogant about his criticisms, and his boss contemplates exiling him to [[Iceland]] because of his nonconformity. His only friend is Helmholtz Watson, a gifted writer who finds it difficult to use his talents creatively in their pain-free society.

Bernard takes a holiday with Lenina outside the World State to a Savage Reservation in [[New Mexico]], in which the two observe [[natural childbirth|natural-born]] people, disease, the aging process, other languages, and religious lifestyles for the first time. (The culture of the village folk resembles the contemporary Native American groups of the region, descendants of the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Anasazi]], including the [[Puebloan peoples]] of [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]], [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]] and [[Zuni people|Zuni]].) Bernard and Lenina witness a violent public ritual and then encounter Linda, a woman originally from the World State who is living on the reservation with her son John, now a young man. She, too, visited the reservation on a holiday many years ago, but became separated from her group and was left behind. She had meanwhile become pregnant by a fellow-holidaymaker (who is revealed to be Bernard's boss, the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning). She did not try to return to the World State, because of her shame at her pregnancy. Despite spending his whole life in the reservation, John has never been accepted by the villagers, and his and Linda's lives have been hard and unpleasant. Linda has taught John to read, although from the only two books in her possession&amp;nbsp;— a scientific manual and the complete works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Ostracised by the villagers, John is able to articulate his feelings only in terms of Shakespearean drama, especially the tragedies of ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''. Linda now wants to return to London, and John, too, wants to see this "brave new world". Bernard sees an opportunity to thwart plans to exile him, and gets permission to take Linda and John back. On their return to London, John meets the Director and calls him his "father", a vulgarity which causes a roar of laughter. The humiliated Director resigns in shame before he can follow through with exiling Bernard.

Bernard, as "custodian" of the "savage" John who is now treated as a celebrity, is fawned on by the highest members of society and revels in attention he once scorned. Bernard's popularity is fleeting, though, and he becomes envious that John only really bonds with the literary-minded Helmholtz. Considered hideous and friendless, Linda spends all her time using ''soma'', while John refuses to attend social events organised by Bernard, appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society. Lenina and John are physically attracted to each other, but John's view of courtship and romance, based on Shakespeare's writings, is utterly incompatible with Lenina's freewheeling attitude to sex. She tries to seduce him, but he attacks her, before suddenly being informed that his mother is on her deathbed. He rushes to Linda's bedside, causing a scandal, as this is not the "correct" attitude to death. Some children who enter the ward for "death-conditioning" come across as disrespectful to John until he attacks one physically. He then tries to break up a distribution of ''soma'' to a lower-caste group, telling them that he is freeing them. Helmholtz and Bernard rush in to stop the ensuing riot, which the police quell by spraying ''soma'' vapor into the crowd.

Bernard, Helmholtz, and John are all brought before Mustapha Mond, the "Resident World Controller for Western Europe", who tells Bernard and Helmholtz that they are to be exiled to islands for antisocial activity. Bernard pleads for a second chance, but Helmholtz welcomes the opportunity to be a true individual, and chooses the [[Falkland Islands]] as his destination, believing that [[Climate of the Falkland Islands|their bad weather]] will inspire his writing. Mond tells Bernard that exile is actually a reward. The islands are full of the most interesting people in the world, individuals who did not fit into the social model of the World State. Mond outlines for John the events that led to the present society and his arguments for a caste system and social control. John rejects Mond's arguments, and Mond sums up John's views by claiming that John demands "the right to be unhappy". John asks if he may go to the islands as well, but Mond refuses, saying he wishes to see what happens to John next.

Jaded with his new life, John moves to an abandoned hilltop tower, near the village of [[Puttenham, Surrey|Puttenham]], where he intends to adopt a solitary [[ascetic]] lifestyle in order to purify himself of civilization, practising [[self-flagellation]]. This soon draws reporters and eventually hundreds of amazed sightseers, [[Rubbernecking|hoping to witness]] his bizarre behaviour; one of them is implied to be Lenina. At the sight of the woman he both adores and loathes, John attacks her with [[Cat o' nine tails|his whip]]. The onlookers are wildly aroused by the display and John is caught up in the crowd's ''soma''-fueled frenzy. The next morning, he remembers the previous night's events and is stricken with remorse. Onlookers and journalists who arrive that evening discover John dead, having hanged himself.

==Characters==
'''Bernard Marx''' – a sleep-learning specialist at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. Although Bernard is an Alpha-Plus (the upper class of the society), he is a misfit. He is unusually short for an Alpha; an alleged accident with alcohol in Bernard's blood-surrogate before his decanting has left him slightly stunted. Bernard's independence of mind stems more from his inferiority complex and depressive nature than from any depth of philosophical conviction. Unlike his fellow utopians, Bernard is often angry, resentful, and jealous. At times, he is also cowardly and hypocritical. His conditioning is clearly incomplete. He doesn't enjoy communal sports, solidarity services, or promiscuous sex. He doesn't even get much joy out of ''soma''. Bernard is in love with Lenina but he doesn't like her sleeping with other men, even though "everyone belongs to everyone else". Bernard's triumphant return to utopian civilisation with John the Savage from the Reservation precipitates the downfall of the Director, who had been planning to exile him. Bernard's triumph is short-lived. Success goes to his head. Despite his tearful pleas, he is ultimately banished to an island&lt;!--NOTE: Although John asks if he could 'go to the islands' with Bernard and Watson, it is not necessarily true that Bernard and Watson are both going to the Falkland Islands. Only Watson is definitely going to the Falklands. Bernard's island is never explicitly stated.--&gt; for his non-conformist behaviour.

'''John''' – the illicit son of the Director and Linda, born and reared on the Savage Reservation ("Malpais") after Linda was unwittingly left behind by her errant lover. John ("the Savage", as he is often called) is an outsider both on the Reservation—where the natives still practice marriage, natural birth, family life and religion—and the ostensibly civilised World State, based on principles of stability and shallow happiness. He has read nothing but the complete works of [[William Shakespeare]], which he quotes extensively, and, for the most part, aptly, though his allusion to the "Brave New World" (Miranda's words in ''[[The Tempest]]'') takes on a darker and bitterly ironic resonance as the novel unfolds. John is intensely moral according to a code that he has been taught by Shakespeare and life in Malpais but is also naïve: his views are as imported into his own consciousness as are the [[hypnopedia|hypnopedic]] messages of World State citizens. The admonishments of the men of Malpais taught him to regard his mother as a whore; but he cannot grasp that these were the same men who continually sought her out despite their supposedly sacred pledges of monogamy. Because he is unwanted in Malpais, he accepts the invitation to travel back to London and is initially astonished by the comforts of the World State. However, he remains committed to values that exist only in his poetry. He first spurns Lenina for failing to live up to his Shakespearean ideal and then the entire utopian society: he asserts that its technological wonders and consumerism are poor substitutes for individual freedom, human dignity and personal integrity. After his mother's death, he becomes deeply distressed with grief, surprising onlookers in the hospital. He then ostracizes himself from society and attempts to purify himself of "sin" (desire), but is finally unable to do so and hangs himself in despair.

'''Helmholtz Watson''' – a handsome and successful Alpha-Plus lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering and a friend of Bernard. He feels unfulfilled writing endless propaganda doggerel, and the stifling conformism and philistinism of the World State make him restive. Helmholtz is ultimately exiled to the [[Falkland Islands]]—a cold asylum for disaffected Alpha-Plus non-conformists—after reading a heretical poem to his students on the virtues of solitude and helping John destroy some Deltas' rations of ''soma'' following Linda's death. Unlike Bernard, he takes his exile in his stride and comes to view it as an opportunity for inspiration in his writing.

'''Lenina Crowne''' – a young, beautiful fetus technician at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. She is  part of the 30% of the female population that are not freemartins (sterile women). Lenina is promiscuous and popular but somewhat quirky in her society: she had a four-month relation with Henry Foster, choosing not to have sex with anyone but him for a period of time. She is basically happy and well-conditioned, using ''soma'' to suppress unwelcome emotions, as is expected. Lenina has a date with Bernard, to whom she feels ambivalently attracted, and she goes to the Reservation with him. On returning to civilization, she tries and fails to seduce John the Savage. John loves and desires Lenina but he is repelled by her forwardness and the prospect of pre-marital sex, rejecting her as an "[[List of quotes from Shakespeare in Brave New World#Chapter 13|impudent strumpet]]". Lenina visits John at the lighthouse but he attacks her with a whip, unwittingly inciting onlookers to do the same. Her exact fate is left unspecified.

'''Mustapha Mond''' – Resident World Controller of Western Europe, "His Fordship" Mustapha Mond presides over one of the ten zones of the World State, the global government set up after the cataclysmic Nine Years' War and great Economic Collapse. Sophisticated and good-natured, Mond is an urbane and hyperintelligent advocate of the World State and its ethos of "Community, Identity, Stability". Among the novel's characters, he is uniquely aware of the precise nature of the society he oversees and what it has given up to accomplish its gains. Mond argues that art, literature, and scientific freedom must be sacrificed to secure the ultimate [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] goal of maximising societal happiness. He defends the genetic caste system, behavioural conditioning, and the lack of personal freedom in the World State: these, he says, are a price worth paying for achieving social stability, the highest social virtue because it leads to lasting happiness.

'''Fanny Crowne''' – Lenina Crowne's friend (they have the same last name because only ten thousand last names are in use in the World State). Fanny voices the conventional values of her caste and society, particularly the importance of promiscuity: she advises Lenina that she should have more than one man in her life because it is unseemly to concentrate on just one. Fanny then, however, warns Lenina away from a new lover whom she considers undeserving, yet she is ultimately supportive of the young woman's attraction to the savage John.

'''Henry Foster''' – One of Lenina's many lovers, he is a perfectly conventional Alpha male, casually discussing Lenina's body with his coworkers. His success with Lenina, and his casual attitude about it, infuriate the jealous Bernard. Henry ultimately proves himself every bit the ideal World State citizen, finding no courage to defend Lenina from John's assaults despite having maintained an uncommonly longstanding sexual relationship with her.

'''Benito Hoover''' – Another of Lenina's lovers. She remembers that he is particularly hairy when he takes his clothes off.

'''The Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning (DHC)''', also known as '''Thomas "Tomakin"''' – He is the administrator of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where he is a threatening figure who intends to exile Bernard to Iceland. His plans take an unexpected turn, however, when Bernard returns from the Reservation with Linda (see below) and John, a child they both realize is actually his. This fact, scandalous and obscene in the World State not because it was extramarital (which all sexual acts are) but because it was procreative, leads the Director to resign his post in shame.

'''Linda''' – John's mother, decanted as a Beta-Minus in the World State, originally worked in the DHC's Fertilizing Room, and subsequently lost during a storm while visiting the New Mexico Savage Reservation with the Director many years before the events of the novel. Despite following her usual precautions, Linda became pregnant with the Director's son during their time together and was therefore unable to return to the World State by the time that she found her way to Malpais. Having been conditioned to the promiscuous social norms of the World State, Linda finds herself at once popular with every man in the pueblo (because she is open to all sexual advances) and also reviled for the same reason, seen as a whore by the wives of the men who visit her and by the men themselves (who come to her nonetheless). Her only comforts there are ''mescal'' brought by Popé as well as ''[[peyote|peyotl]]''. Linda is desperate to return to the World State and to ''soma'', wanting nothing more from her remaining life than comfort until death.

'''The Arch-Community-Songster''' – The secular equivalent of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the World State society.

'''The Warden''' – An Alpha-Minus, the talkative chief administrator for the New Mexico Savage Reservation. He is blond, short, broad-shouldered, and has a booming voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New World|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|date=1932|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|isbn=978-0-06-085052-4|location=New York|page=101}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Darwin Bonaparte''' – a "big game photographer" (i.e. filmmaker) who films John flogging himself. Darwin Bonaparte is known for two other works: "feely of the gorillas' wedding",&lt;ref name="Brave New World"&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New World|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|date=1932|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|isbn=978-0-06-085052-4|location=New York|page=253}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and "Sperm Whale's Love-life".&lt;ref name="Brave New World"/&gt; He has already made a name for himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New World|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|date=1932|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|isbn=978-0-06-085052-4|location=New York|page=252}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but still seeks more.

===Others===
* [[Freemartin#Fictional use|Freemartins]]: These women have been deliberately made sterile by exposure to male hormones during fetal development but still physically normal except for "the slightest tendency to grow beards." In the book, government policy requires freemartins to form 70% of the female population.

===Of Malpais===
*'''Popé''', a native of Malpais. Although he reinforces the behaviour that causes hatred for Linda in Malpais by sleeping with her and bringing her ''[[mescal]]'', he still holds the traditional beliefs of his tribe. In his early years John also attempts to kill him. He gave Linda a copy of the Complete Works of Shakespeare.
*'''Mitsima''', an elder tribal [[shaman]] who also teaches John survival skills such as rudimentary ceramics (specifically [[coil pot]]s, which were traditional to Native American tribes) and bow-making.

===Background figures===
These are non-fictional and factual characters who lived before the events in this book, but are of note in the novel:
*'''[[Henry Ford]]''', who has become a [[messianism|messianic]] figure to the [[World state in Brave New World|World State]]. "Our Ford" is used in place of "Our Lord", as a credit to popularising the use of the [[assembly line]]. Huxley's description of Ford as a central figure in the emergence of the ''Brave New World'' might also be a reference to the utopian industrial city of ''[[Fordlândia]]'' commissioned by Ford in 1927.{{speculation inline|date=August 2014}}
*'''[[Sigmund Freud]]''', "Our Freud" is sometimes said in place of "Our Ford" because Freud's psychoanalytic method depends implicitly upon the rules of classical conditioning, and because Freud popularized the idea that sexual activity is essential to human happiness. (It is also strongly implied that citizens of the World State believe Freud and Ford to be the same person.)&lt;ref&gt;chapter 3, "Our Ford-or Our Freud, as, for some inscrutable reason, he chose to call himself whenever he spoke of psychological matters–Our Freud had been the first to reveal the appalling dangers of family life"&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[H. G. Wells]]''', "Dr Wells", British writer and [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]], whose book ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' was an incentive for ''Brave New World''. "All's well that ends Wells", wrote Huxley in his letters, criticising Wells for anthropological assumptions Huxley found unrealistic.
*'''[[Ivan Pavlov|Ivan Petrovich Pavlov]]''', whose conditioning techniques are used to train infants.
*'''[[William Shakespeare]]''', whose banned works are quoted throughout the novel by John, "the Savage". The plays quoted include ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. Mustapha Mond also knows them because as a World Controller he has access to a selection of books from throughout history, including the Bible.
*'''[[Thomas Robert Malthus]]''', 19th century British economist, believed the people of the Earth would eventually be threatened by their inability to raise enough food to feed the population. In the novel, the eponymous character devises the contraceptive techniques (Malthusian belt) that are practiced by women of the World State. 
*'''Reuben Rabinovitch''', the Russian-Jewish character on whom the effects of sleep-learning, [[Sleep-learning|hypnopædia]], are first observed.
*'''[[John Henry Newman]]''', 19th century Catholic theologian and educator, believed university education the critical element in advancing post-industrial Western civilization. Mustapha Mond and The Savage discuss a passage from one of Newman's books.
*[[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|'''Alfred Mond''']], British industrialist, financier and politician. He is the namesake of Mustapha Mond&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/22/aldous-huxley-prophet-dystopia-cs-lewis|title=Aldous Huxley: the prophet of our brave new digital dystopia {{!}} John Naughton|last=Naughton|first=John|date=2013-11-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources of names and references===
The limited number of names that the World State assigned to its bottle-grown citizens can be traced to political and cultural figures who contributed to the bureaucratic, economic, and technological systems of Huxley's age, and presumably those systems in ''Brave New World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jerome |last=Meckier |editor1-last=Firchow |editor1-first=Peter Edgerly |editor2-last=Nugel |editor2-first=Bernfried |chapter=Onomastic Satire: Names and Naming in ''Brave New World'' |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=D159Z5kJa_YC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1#PPA185,M1 |title=Aldous Huxley: modern satirical novelist of ideas |publisher=Lit Verlag |year=2006 |pages=187ff |isbn=3-8258-9668-4 |oclc=71165436 |accessdate=28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Upon publication, [[Rebecca West]] praised ''Brave New World'' as "The most accomplished novel Huxley has yet written",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 5 February 1932. Reprinted in Donald Watt, “Aldous Huxley: The Critical Heritage. London; Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1136209697}} (pp. 197–201).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Needham]] lauded it as "Mr. Huxley's remarkable book",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Scrutiny (journal)|Scrutiny]]'', May 1932 . Reprinted in Watt, (pp. 202–205).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] also praised it, stating, "Mr. Aldous Huxley has shown his usual masterly skill in ''Brave New World.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Leader]]'', 11 March 1932. Reprinted in Watt, (pp. 210–13).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''Brave New World'' also received negative responses from other contemporary critics, although his work was later embraced.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. ''Brave New World''. Harper Perennial Modern Classics; Reprint edition (17 October 2006), P.S. Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-06-085052-4}} &amp;nbsp;— "About the Book."&amp;nbsp;— "Too Far Ahead of Its Time? The Contemporary Response to ''Brave New World'' (1932)" p. 8-11&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in the 4 May 1935 issue of the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', [[G. K. Chesterton]] explained that Huxley was revolting against the "Age of Utopias". Much of the discourse on man's future before 1914 was based on the thesis that humanity would solve all economic and social issues. In the decade following the war the discourse shifted to an examination of the causes of the catastrophe. The works of [[H. G. Wells]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] on the promises of socialism and a World State were then viewed as the ideas of naive optimists. Chesterton wrote:

{{bquote|After the Age of Utopias came what we may call the American Age, lasting as long as the Boom. Men like Ford or Mond seemed to many to have solved the social riddle and made capitalism the common good. But it was not native to us; it went with a buoyant, not to say blatant optimism, which is not our negligent or negative optimism. Much more than Victorian righteousness, or even Victorian self-righteousness, that optimism has driven people into pessimism. For the Slump brought even more disillusionment than the War. A new bitterness, and a new bewilderment, ran through all social life, and was reflected in all literature and art. It was contemptuous, not only of the old Capitalism, but of the old Socialism. ''Brave New World'' is more of a revolution against Utopia than against Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;G.K. Chesterton, review in ''The Illustrated London News'', 4 May 1935&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, in 1944 economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] described ''Brave New World'' as a [[satire]] of utopian predictions of [[socialism]]: "Aldous Huxley was even courageous enough to make socialism's dreamed paradise the target of his sardonic irony."&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises (1944). [https://mises.org/system/tdf/Bureaucracy_3.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document Bureaucracy], New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''Brave New World'' fifth on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].&lt;ref name="100 Best Novels"/&gt; In 2003, [[Robert McCrum]] writing for ''[[The Observer]]'' included ''Brave New World'' chronologically at number 53 in "the top 100 greatest novels of all time",&lt;ref name="McCrum"/&gt; and the novel was listed at number 87 on the [[BBC]]'s survey [[The Big Read]].&lt;ref name="BBC – The Big Read"/&gt;

==Fordism and society==
{{Main|World State in Brave New World}}
The World State is built upon the principles of [[Henry Ford]]'s [[assembly line]]: mass production, homogeneity, predictability, and consumption of disposable consumer goods. While the World State lacks any supernatural-based religions, Ford himself is revered as the creator of their society but not as a deity, and characters celebrate Ford Day and swear oaths by his name (e.g., "By Ford!"). In this sense, some fragments of traditional religion are present, such as Christian crosses, which had their tops cut off to be changed to a "T". In England, there is an Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury, obviously continuing the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and in America the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' continues publication as ''The Fordian Science Monitor''. The World State calendar numbers years in the "AF" era — "Anno Ford" — with the calendar beginning in AD 1908, the year in which Ford's first [[Ford Model T|Model T]] rolled off his assembly line. The novel's [[Gregorian calendar]] year is AD 2540, but it is referred to in the book as AF 632.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

From birth, members of every class are [[indoctrination|indoctrinated]] by recorded voices repeating slogans while they sleep (called "hypnopædia" in the book) to believe their own class is superior, but that the other classes perform needed functions. Any residual unhappiness is resolved by an [[antidepressant]] and [[hallucinogenic drug]] called ''soma.''

The biological techniques used to control the populace in ''Brave New World'' do not include [[genetic engineering]]; Huxley wrote the book before the structure of [[DNA]] was known. However, [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work with inheritance patterns in peas had been rediscovered in 1900 and the [[eugenics]] movement, based on [[artificial selection]], was well established. [[Huxley family|Huxley's family]] included a number of prominent biologists including [[Thomas Huxley]], half-brother and [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Andrew Huxley]], and his brother [[Julian Huxley]] who was a biologist and involved in the eugenics movement. Nonetheless, Huxley emphasises conditioning over breeding ([[nature versus nurture|nurture versus nature]]); human embryos and fetuses are conditioned through a carefully designed regimen of chemical (such as exposure to hormones and toxins), thermal (exposure to intense heat or cold, as one's future career would dictate), and other environmental stimuli, although there is an element of [[selective breeding]] as well.

==Comparisons with George Orwell's '' Nineteen Eighty-Four ''==
Social critic [[Neil Postman]] contrasted the worlds of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''Brave New World'' in the foreword of his 1985 book ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]''. He writes:
{{Quote|What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in ''Brave New World Revisited,'' the civil [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In ''1984'', Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In ''Brave New World,'' they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that our fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.}}

Journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]], who himself published several articles on Huxley and a book on Orwell, noted the difference between the two texts in the introduction to his 1999 article "Why Americans Are Not Taught History":

{{Quote|We dwell in a present-tense culture that somehow, significantly, decided to employ the telling expression "You're history" as a choice reprobation or insult, and thus elected to speak forgotten volumes about itself. By that standard, the forbidding dystopia of George Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' already belongs, both as a text and as a date, with [[Ur]] and [[Mycenae]], while the [[hedonism|hedonist]] [[nihilism]] of Huxley still beckons toward a painless, amusement-sodden, and stress-free consensus. Orwell's was a house of horrors. He seemed to strain credulity because he posited a regime that would go to any lengths to own and possess history, to rewrite and construct it, and to inculcate it by means of coercion. Whereas Huxley ... rightly foresaw that any such regime could break because it could not bend. In 1988, four years after 1984, the [[Soviet Union]] scrapped its official history curriculum and announced that a newly authorized version was somewhere in the works. This was the precise moment when the regime conceded its own extinction. For true blissed-out and vacant servitude, though, you need an otherwise sophisticated society where no serious history is taught.&lt;ref name="Hitches"&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens]], "Goodbye to All That: Why Americans Are Not Taught History." ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''. November 1998, pp. 37–47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==''Brave New World Revisited''==
[[File:BraveNewWorldRevisited.JPG|thumb|First UK edition]]
'''''Brave New World Revisited''''' ([[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Brothers]], US, 1958; [[Chatto &amp; Windus]], UK, 1959),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betweenthecovers.com/btc/item/60450 |title=Brave New World Revisited – HUXLEY, Aldous &amp;#124; Between the Covers Rare Books |publisher=Betweenthecovers.com |accessdate=1 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609233725/http://www.betweenthecovers.com/btc/item/60450 |archivedate=9 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; written by Huxley almost thirty years after ''Brave New World'', is a non-fiction work in which Huxley considered whether the world had moved toward or away from his vision of the future from the 1930s. He believed when he wrote the original novel that it was a reasonable guess as to where the world might go in the future. In ''Brave New World Revisited'', he concluded that the world was becoming like ''Brave New World'' much faster than he originally thought.

Huxley analysed the causes of this, such as [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], as well as all the means by which populations can be controlled. He was particularly interested in the effects of [[recreational drug use|drugs]] and [[subliminal message|subliminal suggestion]]. ''Brave New World Revisited'' is different in tone because of Huxley's evolving thought, as well as his conversion to Hindu [[Vedanta]] in the interim between the two books.

The last chapter of the book aims to propose action which could be taken to prevent a democracy from turning into the [[totalitarian]] world described in ''Brave New World''. In Huxley's last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'', he again expounds similar ideas to describe a utopian nation, which is generally known as a counterpart to his most famous work.

== Censorship/banning instances, accusation of plagiarism ==
The [[American Library Association]] ranks ''Brave New World'' as No. 52 on their list of [[most challenged books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=bbwlinks&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=85714|title=The 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10#2010|title=Top ten frequently challenged books lists of the 21st century|work=ala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list includes some notable incidents in which it has been censored, banned, or challenged:

*In 1932, the book was banned in [[Ireland]] for its language, and for supposedly being anti-family and anti-religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classiclit.about.com/od/bannedliteratur1/tp/aa_bannedbooks.htm|title=Banned Books|date=2 November 2009|publisher=Classiclit.about.com|accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcc.edu/library/news/banned_books.html |title=Banned Books |publisher=pcc.edu |accessdate=11 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602184644/https://www.pcc.edu/library/news/banned_books.html |archivedate= 2 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1965, a [[Maryland]] English teacher alleged that he was fired for assigning ''Brave New World'' to students. The teacher sued for violation of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights but lost both his case and the appeal.&lt;ref name="karolides2011_p472_1"&gt;{{cite book|title=120 Banned Books: Censorship Histories of World Literature|last2=Bald|first2=Margaret|last3=Sova|first3=Dawn B.|publisher=Checkmark Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8160-8232-2|edition=Second|page=472|quote=In 1965, a teacher of English in Maryland claimed that the local school board had violated his First Amendment rights by firing him after he assigned ''Brave New World'' as a required reading in his class. The district court ruled against the teacher in ''Parker v. Board of Education'', 237 F. Supp. 222 (D.Md) and refused his request for reinstatement in the teaching position. When the case was later heard by the circuit court, ''Parker v. Board of Education'', 348 F.2d 464 (4th Cir. 1965), the presiding judge affirmed the ruling of the lower court and included in the determination the opinion that the nontenured status of the teacher accounted for the firing and not the assignment of a particular book.|last1=Karolides|first1=Nicholas J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The book was banned in India in 1967, with Huxley accused of being a "pornographer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bare breasts and Bare Bottoms: Anatomy of Film Censorship in India|last=Sharma|first=Partap|publisher=[[Jaico Publishing House]]|year=1975|editor-last=Razdan|editor-first=C.

*In 1980, it was removed from classrooms in [[Miller, Missouri|Miller]], Missouri among other challenges.
*In 1982, [[Polish people|Polish]] author Antoni Smuszkiewicz, in his analysis of Polish science-fiction ''Zaczarowana gra'' ("The Magic Game"), presented accusations of [[plagiarism]] against Huxley. Smuszkiewicz showed similarities between ''Brave New World'' and two science fiction novels written earlier by Polish author [[Mieczysław Smolarski]], namely ''Miasto światłości'' ("The City of Light", 1924) and ''Podróż poślubna pana Hamiltona'' ("Mr Hamilton's Honeymoon Trip", 1928).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zaczarowana gra|last=Smuszkiewicz|first=Antoni|publisher=Wydawn. Poznanskie|year=1982|location=[[Poznań]]|language=Polish|oclc=251929765}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smolarski wrote in his open letter to Huxley: "This work of a great author, both in the general depiction of the world as well as countless details, is so similar to two of my novels that in my opinion there is no possibility of accidental analogy."&lt;ref&gt;Nowiny Literackie" 1948 No. 4, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Kurt Vonnegut]] said that in writing ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'' (1952), he "cheerfully ripped off the plot of ''Brave New World'', whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin's ''We''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Playboy]] [http://www.playboy.com/magazine/interview_archive/kurt-vonnegut/kurt-vonnegut.html interview with Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210155908/http://www.playboy.com/magazine/interview_archive/kurt-vonnegut/kurt-vonnegut.html |date=10 February 2009 }}, July 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Travellers attacked by brigands.jpg|thumb|200px|The painting, ''Travellers attacked by brigands'', by [[Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem]] (c. 1670)]]
'''Brigandage''' is the life and practice of [[highway robbery]] and [[plunder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition, 1989. "Brigandage" The first recorded usage of the word was by "[Clive] Holland ''Livy'' XXXVIII. xlv. 1011e, A privat brigandage and robberie."&lt;/ref&gt; It is practiced by a '''brigand''', a person who usually lives in a [[gang]] and lives by pillage and robbery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition, 1989. "Brigand.2" first recorded usage of the word was by "H. LUTTRELL in Ellis ''Orig. Lett.'' II. 27 I. 85 Ther ys no steryng of none evyl doers, saf byonde the rivere of Sayne..of certains brigaunts."&lt;/ref&gt;

The brigand is an outlaw who conducts warfare after the manner of an [[Irregular military|irregular]] or partisan soldier by [[Skirmisher|skirmishes]] and surprises, who makes the war support itself by plunder, by extortion, by capturing prisoners and holding them to [[ransom]], who enforces his demands by violence, and kills the prisoners who cannot pay.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition 1989 brigandry "1980 Guardian Weekly 28 Dec. 14/2 Today the rebels wound, mutilate, and kill civilians: where do you draw the fine line between subversion and brigandry?"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word ''brigant'' (also ''brigaunt'') was introduced as early as 1400, via [[Old French]] '' [[wikt:brigand|brigand]]'' from Italian ''brigante'' "trooper, skirmisher, foot soldier". The Italian word is from a verb ''brigare'' "to brawl, fight" (whence also ''[[brigade]]'').

As for the related term ''[[bandit]]'',  a ''bandito'' was a man declared [[outlaw]] by proclamation, or ''bando''.
{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}{{sfn|Rickards|2000|p=39}}

==Laws of war==
Towards the end of wars, irreconcilables may refuse to accept the loss of their cause, and may continue hostilities using irregular tactics. Upon capture by the victorious side, whether the capturing power has to recognize them as soldiers (who must be treated as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]) or as brigands (who can be tried under civilian law as common criminals) depends on whether the detainees "respect the laws and customs of war" and whether they operate within a chain of command and are "not persons acting on their own responsibility".{{sfn|Axinn|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xMC5bIE-q7QC&amp;pg=PA73#PPA89,M1 89]}}{{sfn|Elsea|2005|loc=CRS-17, CRS-29}}{{sfn|Lieber|Lieber|Shelly|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7eRfPo2jvx8C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95 95]}}

== Resistance ==
{{see also|Brigandage in the Two Sicilies}}
In certain conditions the brigand has not been a mere malefactor. Brigandage may be, and not infrequently has been, the last resort of a people subject to invasion.

The Calabrians who fought for [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]], and the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[Conscription|levies]], which maintained the national resistance against the French from 1808 to 1814, were called brigands by their enemies.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}  "''It is you who are the thieves''",{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}} was the defence of the [[Calabria]]n who was tried as a brigand by a [[France|French]] [[court-martial]] during the reign of [[Joachim Murat]] in [[Naples]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}

In the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]], under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[History of the Balkans#The Ottoman Empire (15th to 19th c.)|rule]], the brigands (called ''[[klepht]]s'' by the [[Greeks]] and ''hayduks'' or ''haydutzi'' by the [[South Slavs|Slavs]]) had some claim to believe themselves the representatives of their people against oppressors. The only approach to an attempt to maintain order was the [[Right to arms|permission given to part of the population to carry arms]] in order to repress the klephts. They were hence called ''armatoli''. In fact the armatole tended to act more as allies than enemies of the klephts.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}

==Causes==
The conditions which favour the development of brigandage may be summed up as [[political corruption|bad administration]]{{efn|{{quote|[...] it would be going much too far to say that the absence of an efficient police is the sole cause of brigandage in countries not subject to foreign invasion, or where the state is not very feeble. [...] But there have been times and countries in which the law and its administration have been so far regarded as enemies by people who were not themselves criminals, that all who defied them have been sure of a measure of sympathy. Then and there it was that brigandage has flourished, and has been difficult to extirpate.|{{harvnb|Hannay|1911|p=563}}}}
}} and to a lesser degree, terrain that permits easy escape from the incumbents.{{efn|"in a less degree, the possession of convenient hiding-places. A country of mountain and forest is favourable to the brigand. The highlands of Scotland supplied a safe refuge to the 'gentlemen [[Border Reivers|reavers]],' who carried off the cattle of the [[Sassenach]] landlords" {{harv|Hannay|1911|p=564}}.}}

The [[Scottish Marches]] supplied a theatre for the ''[[Border Reivers|gentlemen reivers]]''.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}} After the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (1639–1651), policing the Scottish [[moss-trooper]]s tied up many English soldiers of the occupying [[New Model Army]]. Their contemporaries in Ireland became known as [[Tóraidhe|"tories"]].  [[Rapparees]], Irish guerrillas of a later generation, fought for King [[James II of England|James II]] after the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]] and on his defeat degenerated into brigands.

==Terrain==
[[File:Glatt-Räuber8113.jpg|thumb|[[Xaver Hohenleiter]] and his robber band]]
The forests of [[England]] gave cover to the outlaws, who were flatteringly portrayed in the ballads of [[Robin Hood]]. The dense [[Maquis shrubland]] and hills of [[Corsica]] gave the Corsican brigand many advantages, just as the bush of [[Australia]] concealed the [[bushranger]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

The [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], the mountains of [[Calabria]], the [[Sierra mountains (disambiguation)|Sierras]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; of [[Spain]], were the homes of the Italian ''banditi'', and the Spanish ''bandoleros'' (member of a gang) and ''salteadores''  (raiders).  The great haunts of brigands in Europe have been central and southern Italy and parts of Spain.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

England was ruled by [[William III of England|William III]], when "a fraternity of plunderers, thirty in number according to the lowest estimate, squatted near Waltham Cross under the shades of [[Epping Forest]], and built themselves huts, from which they sallied forth with sword and pistol to bid passengers stand".{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}} The Gubbings (so called in contempt from the trimmings and refuse of fish) infested [[Devon]]shire for a generation from their headquarters near [[Brent Tor]], on the edge of [[Dartmoor]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

==Historical examples==
===France===
In France there were the ''[[Écorcheurs]]'', or Skinners, in the 15th century, and the ''Chauffeurs'' around the time of the revolution. The first were large bands of discharged [[mercenary]] soldiers who pillaged the country. The second were ruffians who forced their victims to pay ransom by holding their feet in fires.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

In the years preceding the [[French Revolution]], the royal government was defied by the troops of [[Smuggling|smugglers]] and brigands known as ''faux saulniers'', unauthorized [[salt]]-sellers, and gangs of [[Poaching|poachers]] haunted the king's preserves round [[Paris]]. The salt monopoly and the excessive preservation of the game were so oppressive that the peasantry were provoked to violent resistance and to brigandage. The offenders enjoyed a large measure of public sympathy, and were warned or concealed by the population, even when they were not actively supported.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

[[s:Author:David Hannay|David Hannay]] writing in the 1911 edition of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] stated that in "[[Corsica]] the ''maquis'' has never been without its brigand hero, because industry has been stagnant, family feuds persist, and the government has never quite succeeded in persuading the people to support the law. The brigand is always a hero to at least one faction of [[Corsican people|Corsican]]s."{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

===Greece and the Balkans===
In 1870 an English party, consisting of [[Josslyn Pennington, 5th Baron Muncaster|Lord and Lady Muncaster]], Mr Vyner, Mr Lloyd, Mr Herbert, and Count de Boyl, was captured at Oropos, near Marathon, and a ransom of £25,000 was demanded. Lord and Lady Muncaster were set at liberty to seek for the ransom, but the Greek government sent troops in pursuit of the brigands, and the other prisoners were then murdered.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

In the Balkan peninsula, under Turkish rule, brigandage continued to exist in connection with Christian revolt against the Turks.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

=== India ===
The ''[[Dacoity|dacoits]]'' or brigands of India were of the same stamp as their European colleagues. The [[Pindari]]s were more than brigands, and the [[Thuggee|Thugs]] were a religious sect.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

=== Italy ===

{{see also|Brigandage in the Two Sicilies}}
Until the middle of the 19th century Italy was divided into small states; therefore, the brigand who was closely pursued in one could flee to another. Thus it was that Marco Sciarra of the [[Abruzzo|Abruzzi]], when hard pressed by the Spanish viceroy of Naples - just before and after 1600 - could cross the border of the [[papal states]] and return on a favourable opportunity. When [[pope]] and [[viceroy]] combined against him he took service with [[Venice]], from whence he communicated with his friends at home and paid them occasional visits. On one such visit he was led into a trap and slain.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

Marco Sciarra was the follower and imitator of Benedetto Mangone, who was documented to have stopped a party of travellers which included [[Torquato Tasso]]. Sciarrae allowed them to pass unharmed out of his reverence for poets and poetry. Mangone was finally taken and beaten to death with hammers at Naples. He and his like are the heroes of much popular verse, written in ''ottava rima'' beginning with the traditional epic invocation to the muse. A fine example is ''The most beautiful history of the life and death of Pietro Mancino, chief of Banditi'',{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}} which begins:
{{cquote|
:"Io canto li ricatti, e il fiero ardire
:Del gran Pietro Mancino fuoruscito
:(Pietro Mancino that great outlawed man
:I sing, and all his rage.){{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}}}

In [[Kingdom of Naples]], every successive revolutionary disturbance saw a recrudescence of brigandage down to the unification of 1860–1861. The source of the trouble was the supporters of brigands (like [[Carmine Crocco]] from [[Basilicata]], the most famous outlaw during the [[Italian unification]]){{sfn|Hobsbawm|1985|p=25}} received from various kinds of ''manuténgoli'' (maintainers) - great men, corrupt officials, political parties, and the peasants who were terrorized, or who profited by selling the brigands food and clothes.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

In the Campagna in 1866, two English travellers, [[William John Charles Möens]] and the Rev. John Cruger Murray Aynsley, were captured and held for ransom; Aynsley was released shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Lee|1912|p=627}} Möens found that the ''manuténgoli'' of the brigands among the peasants charged famine prices for food, and extortionate prices for clothes and cartridges.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

===Mexico===
The [[Mexico|Mexican]] brigand [[Juan Cortina]] made incursions into [[Texas]] before the [[American Civil War]]. In Mexico the "[[Rurales]]" ended brigandage.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

=== Spain ===
[[File:Tempranillo by Lewis.jpg|thumb|200px|Jose María el Tempranillo, legendary Spanish brigand of the 19th century.]]
In Spain brigandage was common in and south of the [[Sierra Morena]]. It reached its greatest heights in [[Catalonia]], where it began in the strife of the peasants against the feudal exactions of the landlords. It had its traditional hero, Roque Guinart, who figures in the second part of ''[[Don Quixote]].'' The revolt against the house of Austria in 1640 and the [[War of the Spanish Succession|War of the Succession]] (1700–1714) greatly stimululated Catalan brigandage. A country gentleman named Pedro Veciana, hereditary ''balio'' (military and civil lieutenant) of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tarragona|archbishop of Tarragona]] in the town of [[Valls]], armed his farm-servantsand resisted the attacks of the brigands. With the help of neighbouring country gentlemen he formed a strong band, known as the Mozos (Boys) of Veciana. The brigands combined to get rid of him by making an attack on the town of Valls, but were repulsed with great loss. The government of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] then commissioned Veciana to raise a special corps of police, the ''Escuadra de Cataluna'', which still exists. For five generations the colonel of the escuadra was always a Veciana. Since the organization of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'' by the Duke of Ahumada, about 1844, brigandage has been well kept down. At the close of the [[Carlist War]] in 1874 a few bands infested [[Catalonia]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

The Sierra Morena, and the [[Serrania de Ronda]], have produced the bandits whose achievements form the subject of popular ballads, such as Francisco Esteban El Guapo (Francis Stephen, the Buck or Dandy), Don Juan de Serralonga, Pedranza, &amp;c. Jose Maria, called El Tempranillo (The Early Bird), was a liberal in the rising against [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], 1820–1823, then a smuggler, then a ''bandolero''. He was finally bought off by the government and took a commission to suppress the other brigands. Jose Maria was at last shot by one of them, whom he was endeavouring to arrest.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

===United States===
In relatively unsettled parts of the [[United States]] there was a considerable amount of a certain kind of brigandage, in early days, when the travel routes to the [[American West]] were infested by [[highwaymen]].  Such outlaws, when captured, were often dealt with in an extra-legal manner by groups of [[vigilante]]s known as [[vigilance committee]]s.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}  A notable example is the [[Harpe brothers]], who were active during the late 18th century.

{{Ancient Near East topics}}
The '''chronology of the ancient Near East''' provides a framework of dates for various events, rulers and dynasties. Individual inscriptions and texts customarily record events in terms of a succession of officials or rulers, taking forms like "in the year X of king Y". Thus by piecing together many records a [[relative dating|relative chronology]] is arrived at, relating dates in cities over a wide area. For the first millennium BC, the relative [[chronology]] can be tied to actual calendar years by identifying significant astronomical events. An inscription from the tenth year of Assyrian king [[Ashur-Dan III]] refers to an eclipse of the sun, and astronomical calculations among the range of possible dates identify the eclipse as having occurred 15 June 763 BC. The date can be corroborated with other mentions of astronomical events and a secure [[Absolute dating|absolute chronology]] established, that ties the relative chronologies into our calendar.

For the third and second millennia, the correlation is not so fixed. A key document is the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]], preserving record of astronomical observations of [[Venus]], as preserved in numerous [[cuneiform]] tablets during the reign of the  Babylonian king [[Ammisaduqa]], known to be the fourth ruler after [[Hammurabi]] in the ''relative calendar''. In the series, the conjunction of the rise of Venus with the new moon provides a fixed point, or rather three fixed points, for the conjunction is a [[Periodic function|periodic]] occurrence. Astronomical calculation can therefore fix, for example, the first dates of the reign of Hammurabi in this manner either as 1848, 1792, or 1736 BC, depending on whether the "high" (or "long"), "[[Middle chronology|middle]]" or "low (or short) chronology" is followed.

For the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd]] and [[2nd millennium BC|2nd]] millennia BC, the following periods can be distinguished:
#[[Early Bronze Age]]: A series of rulers and dynasties whose existence is based mostly on the [[Sumerian King List]] besides some that are attested [[Epigraphy|epigraphically]] (e.&amp;nbsp;g., [[En-me-barage-si]]). No absolute dates within a certainty better than a century can be assigned to this period.
#[[Middle Bronze Age|Middle]] to [[Late Bronze Age]]: Beginning with the [[Akkadian Empire]] around 2300 BC, the chronological evidence becomes internally more consistent. Essentially, for this period, a good picture can be drawn of who succeeded whom, and synchronisms between [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and the more robust [[chronology of Ancient Egypt]] can be established. The assignment of absolute dates is a matter of dispute; the conventional ''middle chronology'' fixes the [[sack of Babylon]] at 1595 BC while the ''short chronology'' fixes it at 1531 BC.
#The [[Bronze Age collapse]]: a "Dark Age" begins with the fall of Babylonian Dynasty III (Kassite) around 1200 BC, the invasions of the [[Sea Peoples]] and the collapse of  the [[Hittite Empire]].
#[[Early Iron Age]]: around 900 BC, historical data, written records become more numerous once more, with the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], enabling the certain assignment of absolute dates. Classical sources such as the [[Canon of Ptolemy]], the works of [[Berossus]] and the [[Hebrew Bible]] provide chronological support and synchronisms. An eclipse in 763 BC anchors the [[Assyria]]n list of imperial officials.

==Variant Bronze Age chronologies==
[[File:Mesopotamian Chronology 2-2011-29-03.png|thumb|Middle chronology of the main dominations]]
Due to the sparsity of sources throughout the "Dark Age", the history of the Near Eastern [[Bronze Age]]  down to the end of the [[Third Babylonian Dynasty]] is a "floating chronology". In other words, it fits together internally as a "relative chronology" but not as an "absolute chronology".

The major schools of thought on the length of the Dark Age are separated by 56 or 64 years. This is because the key source for their dates is the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] and the visibility of Venus has a 56/64{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} year cycle. More recent work by [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] has suggested that the fundamental 8-year cycle of Venus is a better metric.&lt;ref name="ultra"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0311035] Gurzadyan, V. G., ''On the Astronomical Records and Babylonian Chronology'', Akkadica, v 119–120 (2000), pp. 175–184.)&lt;/ref&gt; (see update in &lt;ref name="ultra1"&gt;Warburton, D.A., The Fall of Babylon in 1499: Another Update, in Akkadica, v 132, 1 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="ultra2"&gt;Warburton, D.A., A Rejoinder in favour of an Ultra-Low Chronology, Akkadica, v 134, 17 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;) There are also some scholars who discount the validity of the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa entirely. There have been other attempts to anchor the chronology using records of eclipses and other methods, but they are not yet widely supported. The alternative major chronologies are defined by the date of the 8th year of the reign of [[Ammisaduqa]], king of Babylon. This choice then defines the reign of [[Hammurabi]].

The ''[[middle chronology]]'' (reign of Hammurabi 1792–1750 BC) is commonly encountered in literature, and many current textbooks on the archaeology and history of the ancient Near East continue using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhrt|first=A.|title=Ancient Near East c. 3000–330 BC |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge|page=12|location=London|isbn=0-415-16763-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potts|first=D.

A recent analysis combining [[dendrochronology]] and radiocarbon dating pointed to the middle chronology as being most likely. A further refinement by the same group shifted that to the "low-middle chronology" ie 8 years lower.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, S. W.; Kromer, B.; Kuniholm, P. I.; and Newton, M.

As is mentioned below, at present, there are no continuous chronologies for the Near East and a floating chronology has been developed using trees in Anatolia for the Bronze and Iron Ages. Until a continuous sequence is developed, the usefulness of dendrochronology for improving the chronology of the Ancient Near East is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Anatolian tree rings and the absolute chronology of the eastern Mediterranean, 2220–718 BC Kuniholm, Peter Ian, Kromer, Bernd, Manning, Sturt W, Newton, Maryanne, et al.

The following table gives an overview of the competing proposals, listing some key dates and the deviation relative to the short chronology:

The chronologies of Mesopotamia, the Levant and Anatolia depend significantly on the [[chronology of Ancient Egypt]]. To the extent that there are problems  in the Egyptian chronology, these issues will be inherited in chronologies based on synchronisms with Ancient Egypt.

==Sources of chronological data==

===Inscriptional===
Thousands of cuneiform tablets have been found in an area running from Anatolia to Egypt. While many are the ancient equivalent of modern grocery receipts, these tablets, along with inscriptions on buildings and public monuments, provide the major source of chronological information for the ancient Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Cuneiform Texts and the Writing of History, Marc van de Mieroop, Routledge, 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-19532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Underlying issues====
*State of materials
While there are some relatively pristine objects, such as you might see in the Louvre or the British Museum, the vast majority of recovered tables and inscriptions are in much worse condition. They have been broken with only portions found, intentionally defaced, and damaged by weather or the effects of being buried underground. Many tablets were not even baked in antiquity and have to be carefully handled until they are heated properly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlj/2003/cdlj2003_001.html] Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative&lt;/ref&gt;
*Provenance
The site of an item's recovery is an important piece of information for archaeologists. Unfortunately, two factors impinge on this.  First, in ancient times old materials were often reused either as building material or fill, sometimes at a great distance from the original location. Secondly, looting has been a fact of life for archaeological sites, dating at least back to Roman times. The provenance of a looted object is difficult or impossible to determine.
*Multiple versions
Over time, key documents like the [[Sumerian King List]] were repeatedly copied across the generations. As a result, there are sometimes multiple versions of a chronological source that differ from each other. It can be very hard to determine which version is correct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr211.htm] Translation of Sumerian King List&lt;/ref&gt;
*Translation
The translation of cuneiform documents is quite difficult, especially given the damaged nature of much source material. Additionally, our knowledge of the underlying languages, like Akkadian and Sumerian, have evolved over time, so a translation done now may be quite different than one done in AD 1900. The result of all this is that there can be honest disagreement what the document really says. Worse yet, many archaeological finds have not yet been published, much less translated. Those held in private collections may never be.
*Slant
Many of our important source documents, such as the Assyrian King List, are the products of government and religious establishments. They often have a built-in slant in favor of the king or god in charge. A king may even take credit for a battle or construction project of an earlier ruler. The Assyrians in particular have a literary tradition of always putting the best possible face on history. The tablets or inscriptions in question still have value, though one does have to keep the slant in mind.

====King Lists====
Keeping historical lists of rulers was traditional in the ancient Near East.

*[[Sumerian King List]]
Covers rulers of Mesopotamia from a time "before the flood" up to the fall of the Isin Dynasty. For many early city-states it is the only source of chronological data. A major problem is that many early rulers are listed with fantastically long reigns. There has been some speculation that this stems from an error transcribing from the base 60 arithmetic of the Sumerians to the decimal-based system of the later Akkadians.&lt;ref&gt;"A Mathematical Approach to Certain Dynastic Spans in the Sumerian King List," Dwight W. Young, ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', Vol. 47, No. 2 (Apr., 1988), pp. 123–129&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Babylonian King List]]
This list deals only with the rulers of Babylon. It has been found in two versions, Babylonian King List A and Babylonian King List B. The later dynasties in the list reflect the Kassite and Sealand periods of Babylon. There is also a Babylonian King List of the Hellenistic Period which covers the later part of the 1st millennium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/k/kinglist/babylonian_hellenistic.html] Babylonian King List of the Hellenistic Period&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Assyrian King List]]
Found in multiple differing copies, this tablet lists all the kings of Assyria and their regnal lengths back into the mists of time, with the portions with reasonable data beginning at around the 14th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/k/kinglist/assyrian.html] Assyrian King List at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with the various Assyrian chronicles, the Assyrian King List anchors the chronology of the 1st millennium.
*[[Waddell's chronology|Indus Valley King List]]
A list of [[Indus Valley Civilization]] kings was compiled by [[Laurence Waddell]], but it is not generally accepted or well regarded by mainstream academia.&lt;ref name="Macnaughton1932"&gt;{{cite book|author=Duncan Macnaughton|title=A scheme of Egyptian chronology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLYrAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 October 2012|year=1932|publisher=Luzac &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chronicles====
Many chronicles have been recovered in the ancient Near East. Most are partial or fragmentary, but when combined with other sources, they provide a rich source of chronological data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/chron00.html |work=Livius |title=Mesopotamian Chronicles |date=21 May 2017|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Synchronistic Chronicle
Found in the library of Assurbanipal in Nineveh, it records the interaction of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires, from the Assyrian point of view. While useful, the consensus is that this chronicle should not be considered reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc21/synchronistic1.html] Synchronistic Chronicle at Livius.org&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chronicle P]]
While quite incomplete, this tablet provides the same type of information as the Assyrian Synchronistic Chronicle, but from the Babylonian point of view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc22/p.html] Chronicle P at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Royal Chronicle of Lagash
The Sumerian King List omits any mention of [[Lagash]], even though it was clearly a major power during the period covered by the list. The Royal Chronicle of Lagash appears to be an attempt to remedy that omission, listing the kings of Lagash in the form of a chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/cm/lagash.html] Royal Chronicle of Lagash at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe the chronicle to be either a parody of the Sumerian King List or a complete fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Mesopotamian Chronicles,Jean-Jacques Glassner,(2004) {{ISBN|1-58983-090-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Royal inscriptions====

In general, political figures in the ancient Near East liked to take credit for public works. Temples, buildings and statues built by a ruler are likely to have some sort of inscription mentioning his name. The kings also were sure to record major deeds like battles won, titles acquired, or gods appeased in some form of public inscription. These are very useful in tracking the reign of a ruler.

====Year lists====

Unlike current calendars, most ancient calendars were based on how long the current ruler had been in power. A year might be "the 5th year in the reign of Hammurabi". As part of this, each royal year was given a title, like "the year Ur was defeated". Most often this reflected a deed of the ruler. The compilation of these years are called date lists.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/yearnames/yn_index.html] Mesopotamian Year Names&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eponym (limmu) lists====

In Assyria, a royal official or [[limmu]] was selected every year of a king's reign. Many copies of these lists have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/li-ln/limmu/limmu_2.html] Assyrian Eponym List 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Eponyms of the Assyrian Empire 910–612 B.C., by Alan Millard. State Archives of Assyria Studies 11, Helsinki: Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 1994. xvi + 153 pp., 20 plates&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, details are not always clear-cut. There are sometimes too many or few ''limmū'' for the length of a king's reign and sometimes the different versions of the eponym list disagree on a limmu. An example is the [[Mari Eponym Chronicle]]. There is now a Assyrian Revised Eponym List which attempts to resolve some of these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Gojko Barjamovic, Thomas Hertel and Mogens T. Larsen, Ups and Downs at Kanesh: Chronology, History and Society in the Old Assyrian Period (Leiden: Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade, diplomatic, and disbursement records====

As is often the case in archaeology, it is everyday records that give the best picture of a civilization. Cuneiform tablets were constantly moving around the ancient Near East, offering alliances (sometimes including daughters for marriage), threatening war, acting as shipping documents for mundane supplies or settling accounts receivable. Most were tossed away after use the way that we would discard unwanted receipts. Fortunately for us, tablets are durable and many are well-preserved even when used as material for wall filler in new construction.

*[[Amarna letters]]

The classic example. A number of cuneiform tablets were found at Amarna in Egypt, the city of the pharaoh [[Akhenaten]]. They were written mostly in Akkadian, the diplomatic language of the time. Several named rulers in the region including the kings of Assyria and Babylon. Assuming that the correct kings have been identified, it locks the chronology of the ancient Near East to that of Egypt, at least from the middle of the 2nd millennium.

===Classical===
Some data sources are available to us from the classical period:
*[[Berossus]]
Berossus was a Babylonian astronomer living during the Hellenistic period. He wrote a history of Babylon which has not survived to modern times. Luckily, portions of this work were preserved by other classical writers.
*Canon of Ptolemy or [[Canon of Kings]]
This book provides a list of kings starting at around 750 BC in Babylon and forward through the Persian and Roman periods, in an astronomical context. It is used to help define the chronology of the 1st millennium.
*Hebrew Bible
Not having the benefit of being written into clay and buried, the records of the Hebrews have an additional layer of time to work through in being used as a source for chronology. On the other hand, the Hebrews did live pretty much in a territory directly in the crosshairs of Babylon, Assyria, Egypt and the Hittites, giving them a front row seat to actions in the area. Mainly of use in the 1st millennium and with the Assyrian New Kingdom.

===Astronomical===
*[[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]]

A record of the movements of Venus during the reign of a king of the First Babylonian Dynasty. Using it, various scholars have proposed dates for the fall of Babylon based on the 56/64 year cycle of Venus.  The mentioned recent work suggesting that the fundamental 8-year cycle of Venus is a better metric, led to the proposal of an "ultra-low" chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Gurzadyan, V. G., The Venus Tablet and Refraction, ''Akkadica'', v. 124 (2003), pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eclipses====

A number of lunar and solar eclipses have been suggested for use in dating the ancient Near East. Many suffer from the vagueness of the original tablets in showing that an actual eclipse occurred. At that point, it becomes a question of using computer models to show when a given eclipse would have been visible at a site, complicated by difficulties in modeling the slowing rotation of the earth, [[Delta T]]. One important event is the [[Assyrian eclipse|Nineveh eclipse]], found in an Assyrian limmu list q.e. "Bur-Sagale of Guzana, revolt in the city of Ashur. In the month Simanu an eclipse of the sun took place." This eclipse is considered to be solidly dated to 15 June 763 BC. Another important event is the [[Ur III]] Lunar/Solar Eclipse pair in the reign of [[Shulgi]]. Most calculations for dating using eclipses have assumed that the Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa is a legitimate source.&lt;ref name="ultra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Wayne A., "Ancient Astronomical Observations and Near Eastern Chronology", ''JACF'', v.3 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dendrochronology===

[[Dendrochronology]] attempts to use the variable growth pattern of trees, expressed in their rings, to build up a chronological timeline. At present, there are no continuous chronologies for the Near East. A floating chronology has been developed using trees in Anatolia for the Bronze and Iron Ages.  Until a continuous sequence is developed, the usefulness for improving the chronology of the Ancient Near East is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Anatolian tree rings and the absolute chronology of the eastern Mediterranean, 2220–718 BC Kuniholm, Peter Ian, Kromer, Bernd, Manning, Sturt W, Newton, Maryanne, et al. Nature. London: Jun 27, 1996. Vol. 381, Iss. 6585; pp. 780–783&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dendrochronological Dating in Anatolia: The Second Millennium B.C."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter I. Kuniholm, Maryanne W. Newton, Carol B. Griggs, &amp; Pamela J. Sullivan, Der Anschnitt, Anatolian Metal III, Beiheft 18, 2005, pp. 41–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=="dendro_2016"&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://dendro.cornell.edu/projects/aegean.php|title=Aegean Dendrochronology Project |series=Cornell Tree-Ring Laboratory |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in tying the chronology to the modern day lies primarily in the Roman period, for which few good wood samples have been found, and many of those turn out to be imported from outside the Near East.&lt;ref name=="dendro_2016"/&gt;

===Radiocarbon dating===

As in Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean, radiocarbon dates run one or two centuries earlier than the dates proposed by archaeologists. It is not at all clear which group is right, if either.&lt;ref&gt;Recent Developments in Near Eastern Chronology and Radiocarbon Dating, Michael G. Hasel, Institute of Archaeology, Southern Adventist University, Origins Vol 56 2004, pp. 6–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of accelerator based carbon dating techniques may help clear up the issue. Another promising front is the dating of lime plaster from structures.&lt;ref&gt;New Uses for Old Laboratory techniques, Jason A. Rech, Near Eastern Archaeology, Dec. 2004; 67,4. pp. 212–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, radiocarbon dates from the final destruction of [[Ebla]] have been shown to definitely favour the middle chronology (with the fall of Babylon and Aleppo at c. 1595 BC), and do not seem to fall with the ultra-low chronology (same event at c. 1499 BC), although it is emphasized that this is not to be seen as a decisive argument.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiae, P. (2007). The Destruction of Old Syrian Ebla. In Matthiae, P., Pinnock, F., Nigro, L. and Peyronel, L. (eds.) ''From relative chronology to absolute chronology: The second millennium BC in Syria-Palestine.'' Contributi del Centro Linceo Interdisciplinare "Beniamino Segre" N. 117. Roma. pp. 5–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Other emerging technical dating methods include [[Rehydroxylation dating]], [[Luminescence dating]] and archeointensity dating (geomagnetic). &lt;ref name="WilsonCHH09"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Wilson | first = Moira A. | last2 = Carter | first2 = Margaret A. | last3 = Hall | first3 = Christopher | last4 = Hoff | first4 = William D. | last5 = Ince | first5 = Ceren | last6 = Wilson | first6 = Moira A. | last7 = Savage | first7 = Shaun D. | last8 = McKay | first8 = Bernard | last9 = Betts | first9 = Ian M. | title = Dating fired-clay ceramics using long-term power law rehydroxylation kinetics | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A| volume = 465 | issue = 2108 | pages = 2407–2415 | date = 8 August 2009 | url = http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/465/2108/2407 | doi=10.1098/rspa.2009.0117| bibcode = 2009RSPSA.465.2407W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;YvesGallet et al, Possible impact of the Earth's magnetic field on the history of ancient civilizations, Earth and Planetary Science Letters, vol. 246, iss. 1–2, pp. 17-26, 15 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synchronisms===

====Egypt====
At least as far back as the reign of [[Thutmose I]], Egypt took a strong interest in the ancient Near East. At times they occupied portions of the region, a favor returned in later days by the Assyrians. Some key synchronisms:
*[[Battle of Kadesh]], involving [[Ramses II]] of Egypt (in his 5th year of reign) and [[Muwatalli II]] of the Hittite empire. Recorded by both Egyptian and Hittite records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hittites.info/history.aspx?text%3Dhistory%2FMiddle+Late+Empire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014163832/http://www.hittites.info/history.aspx?text=history%2FMiddle+Late+Empire.htm |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Battle of Kadesh – Hittite Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;
*Peace treaty between Ramses II of Egypt (in his 21st year of reign) and [[Hattusili III]] of the Hittites. Recorded by both Egyptian and Hittite records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/ramses-hattusili-treaty.htm] Treaty between Egypt and the Hittite Empire&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Amenhotep III]] (Amenophis III) marries the daughter of [[Shuttarna II]] of [[Mitanni]]. There is also a record of messages from the pharaoh to [[Kadashman-Enlil I]] of Babylon in the Amarna Letter (EA1–5). Other Amarna letters link Amenhotep III to [[Burnaburiash II]] of Babylon (EA6) and [[Tushratta]] of Mitanni (EA17–29) as well.
*[[Akhenaten]] (Amenhotep IV) married the daughter of Tushratta of Mitanni (as did his father Amenhotep III), leaving a number of records on the matter. He also corresponded with [[Burna-Buriash II]] of Babylon (EA7–11, 15), and [[Ashuruballit I]] of Assyria (EA15–16)

There are problems with using Egyptian chronology. Besides some minor issues of regnal lengths and overlaps there are three long periods of poorly documented chaos in the history of ancient Egypt, the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]], and the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]], whose lengths are not well understood. This means the Egyptian Chronology is actually made up of three floating chronologies.

====Indus Valley====

There is much evidence that the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] civilization of the [[Indus Valley]] traded with the region. This is demonstrated by clay seals found at Ur III and in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;Gadd, C. J. “Seals of Ancient Indian Style Found at Ur.” Proceedings of the British Academy 18 (1932): 191–210.&lt;/ref&gt; Seals and beads were also found at the site of [[Esnunna]]. &lt;ref&gt;Henri Frankfort, The Indus civilization and the Near East. Annual Bibliography of Indian Archaeology for 1932, Leyden, VI, pp. 1-12, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if the land of [[Meluhha]] does indeed refer to the Indus Valley, then there are extensive trade records ranging from the Akkadian Empire until the Babylonian Dynasty I.

====Thera and Eastern Mediterranean====

Goods from Greece made their way into the ancient Near East, directly in Anatolia and via the island of [[Cyprus]] in the rest of the region and Egypt. A Hittite king, Tudhaliya IV, even captured Cyprus as part of an attempt to enforce a blockade of the Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;Urbanism on Late Bronze Age Cyprus: LC II in Retrospect, Ora Negbi, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, Feb 2005, Iss. 337; pp. 1–45&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[minoan eruption|eruption of the Thera volcano]] provides a possible time marker for the region. A large eruption, it would have sent a plume of ash directly over Anatolia and filled the sea in the area with floating pumice. This pumice appeared in Egypt, apparently via trade. Current excavations in the Levant may also add to the timeline. The exact date of the volcanic eruption has been the subject of strong debate, with dates ranging between 1628 and 1520 BC. Radiocarbon dating has placed it at between 1627&amp;nbsp;BC and 1600&amp;nbsp;BC with a 95% degree of probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Friedrich|first=Walter L|authorlink=|author2=Kromer, B |author3=Friedrich, M |author4=Heinemeier, J |author5=Pfeiffer, T |author6=Talamo, S |title=Santorini Eruption Radiocarbon Dated to 1627–1600 B.C.|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5773|pages=548|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=2006|doi=10.1126/science.1125087|id=|accessdate=10 March 2007 |pmid=16645088 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manning |first=Sturt W |author2=Ramsey, CB |author3=Kutschera, W |author4=Higham, T |author5=Kromer, B |author6=Steier, P |author7=Wild, EM|title=Chronology for the Aegean Late Bronze Age 1700–1400 B.C. |journal=Science |volume=312 |issue=5773 |pages=565–569 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=2006 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/565 |doi=10.1126/science.1125682 |accessdate=10 March 2007 |pmid=16645092 |bibcode=2006Sci...312..565M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = SW | last = Manning | contribution=Clarifying the "high" v.

'''Cognitive deficit''' or '''cognitive impairment''' is an inclusive term to describe any characteristic that acts as a barrier to [[cognition|the cognition process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coren |first=Stanley |author2=Lawrence M. Ward |author3=James T. Enns  |title=Sensation and Perception |publisher=[[Harcourt Brace]] |year=1999 |page=9 |isbn= 0-470-00226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term may describe
* deficits in overall [[intelligence]] (as with [[intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]]),
* specific and restricted deficits in cognitive abilities (such as in [[learning disability|learning disorders]] like [[dyslexia]]),
* [[Neuropsychological assessment|neuropsychological deficits]] (such as in [[attention]], [[working memory]] or [[Executive functions|executive function]]),
* or it may describe drug-induced impairment in cognition and memory (such as that seen with [[alcohol]], [[glucocorticoids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11461709 | volume=35 | title=Corticosteroids and cognition. | journal=J Psychiatr Res | pages=127–45 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3956(01)00018-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[benzodiazepine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kalachnik | first1 = JE. | last2 = Hanzel | first2 = TE. | last3 = Sevenich | first3 = R. | last4 = Harder | first4 = SR. | title = Benzodiazepine behavioral side effects: review and implications for individuals with mental retardation | journal = Am J Ment Retard | volume = 107 | issue = 5 | pages = 376–410 |date=Sep 2002 | pmid = 12186578 | doi = 10.1352/0895-8017(2002)107&lt;0376:BBSERA&gt;2.0.CO;2| issn = 0895-8017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
It usually refers to a durable characteristic, as opposed to [[altered level of consciousness]], which may be acute and reversible. Cognitive deficits may be [[Congenital disorder|inborn]] or caused by environmental factors such as [[acquired brain injury|brain injuries]], [[neurological disorders]], or [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hockenbury, Don and Sandy | title=Discovering Psychology | publisher=Worth Publishers | year=2004 | isbn=0-7167-5704-4}}{{page needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Fried, Yehuda  |author2=Joseph Agassi, | title=Paranoia: A Study in Diagnosis| publisher=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, 50 | year=1976 | isbn=90-277-0704-9}}{{page needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Older people with cognitive impairment appear to improve somewhat with [[light therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiu|first1=HL|last2=Chan|first2=PT|last3=Chu|first3=H|last4=Hsiao|first4=SS|last5=Liu|first5=D|last6=Lin|first6=CH|last7=Chou|first7=KR|title=Effectiveness of Light Therapy in Cognitively Impaired Persons: A Metaanalysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=October 2017|volume=65|issue=10|pages=2227-2234|doi=10.1111/jgs.14990|pmid=28734045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case studies ==

{{Cleanup|section|reason=most of these examples are longitudinal studies with large samples, not case studies|date=December 2015}}

There is evidence to indicate that parallel age trends have been similar over a vast amount of time, as with Schaie’s Seattle Longitudinal Study, which contained fifty years worth of data  as well as seventy years in Wechsler tests. Studies such as these{{Example needed}} have demonstrated the different patterns in age trends have two specific patterns in cognition, a constant decrease in measures of processing abilities such as reasoning, and stability followed by a steady decline for knowledge previously acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gualtieri|first=C. Thomas|author2=Johnson, Lynda G.|title=Age-related cognitive decline in patients with mood disorders|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry|volume=32|issue=4|pages=962–967|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2007.12.030|pmid=18243461|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A twelve-year study published in 2012 researched the effects of lifestyle activities on cognitive deficit in the hopes that a long study such as this could, to some degree, help older adults to ward off cognitive decline. The study looked at verbal speed, episodic memory, and semantic memory to be influenced by physical, social, and cognitive activities. The results of the study concluded that maintenance of cognitive functions with normal aging can be maintained by keeping an active lifestyle. The results also seemed to conclude that the correlation between lifestyle activities and cognition is not a simple one, as not all cognitive abilities were related to changes in the daily activities. Therefore, further research of longitudinal design observing the matches between activities and cognitive abilities in cognitively impaired adults could be critical.&lt;ref name="Small 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=B|author2=Dixon R|author3=McArdle J|author4=Grimm K.|title=Do changes in lifestyle engagement moderate cognitive decline in normal aging? Evidence from the Victoria Longitudinal Study|journal=Neuropsychology|date=March 2012|volume=26|issue=2|pages=144–155|doi=10.1037/a0026579|pmid=22149165|pmc=3761970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies using brain imaging have been done in an attempt to note early signs of cognitive decline on healthy individuals before changes noticed clinically occur. In this way the study attempted to find more biomarkers for early onset of degenerative diseases.  The results from the study concluded that there are indeed patterns of brain abnormality that can be associated with brain decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=VH|author2=Resnick SM|author3=Doshi J|author4=Beason-Held LL|author5=Zhou Y|author6=Ferrucci L|author7=Wong DF|author8=Kraut MA|author9=Davatzikos C|title=Longitudinal imaging pattern analysis (SPARE-CD index) detects early structural and functional changes before cognitive decline in healthy older adults|journal=Neurobiology of Aging|volume=33|issue=12|pages=2733–45|doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.01.010|pmid=22365049|pmc=4023476|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-sectional study, researchers investigated patients with mood disorders in comparison with a control group to see if there was a difference on the effect of aging between the groups. These patients were tested with the Central Nervous System Vital Signs, a neurocognitive battery test. The study examined subjects from ages 18 to 90, noticing a sharp decline in the patients with mood disorder compared to the normal group when subjects were ages 65 and up. These declines were observed in the cognitive areas of attention, executive function, processing speed, and memory.&lt;ref name="Small 2012" /&gt;

== Other findings ==

Although one would expect cognitive decline to have major effects on [[job performance]], it seems that there is little to no correlation of health with job performance.  With the exception of cognitive-dependent jobs such as air-traffic controller, professional athlete, or other elite jobs, age does not seem to impact one’s job performance. This obviously conflicts with cognitive tests given, so the matter has been researched further.
One possible reason for this conclusion is the rare need for a person to perform at their maximum. There is a difference between typical functioning, that is&amp;nbsp;– the normal level of functioning for daily life, and maximal functioning, that is&amp;nbsp;– what cognitive tests observe as our maximum level of functioning. As the maximum cognitive ability that we are able to achieve decreases, it may not actually affect our daily lives, which only require the normal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salthouse|first=Timothy|title=Consequences of Age-Related Cognitive Declines|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=10 January 2012|volume=63|issue=1|pages=201–226|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100328|pmc=3632788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have indicated that childhood hunger might have a protective effect on cognitive decline. One possible explanation is that the onset of age-related changes in the body can be delayed by [[calorie restriction]]. Another possible explanation is the selective survival effect, as the study participants who had a childhood with hunger tend to be the healthiest of their era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barnes |first=L.

'''Coker College''' is a private, co-educational four-year [[liberal arts college]] in [[Hartsville, South Carolina]]. Coker College was founded in 1908 and is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacscoc.org/details.asp?instid=22640 Commission on Colleges&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107195040/http://www.sacscoc.org/details.asp?instid=22640 |date=January 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coker's sports teams, nicknamed the Cobras, compete in [[NCAA Division II]].

==Academics==
Coker refers to the academic program for the four-year undergraduate degree as the Trans4mations Program, with the first year being foundational, the second year requiring service and attendance at cultural events, the third year requiring at least two weeks of study off-campus, and the final year called a "capstone".&lt;ref&gt;Coker College, Academics, Trans4mations Program, [https://coker.edu/academics/trans4mations/year-1-personal-academic-exploration Year 1: Personal &amp; Academic Exploration], [https://coker.edu/academics/trans4mations/year-2-service-cultural-engagement Year 2: Service &amp; Cultural Engagement], [https://coker.edu/academics/trans4mations/year-3-study-away Year 3: Study Away], [https://coker.edu/academics/trans4mations/year-4-capstone-experience Year 4: Capstone Experience], retrieved June 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal Arts Studies Program (LASP) is divided into Core Skills, Knowledge of the Arts, Knowledge of the Behavioral Sciences, Knowledge of the Humanities, Knowledge of the Natural Sciences, Knowledge of the United States, and Knowledge of the Wider World.&lt;ref&gt;[https://coker.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/academic_catalog/2015_16_Academic_Catalog.pdf Coker College Academic Catalog, 2015–16] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527192119/https://coker.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/academic_catalog/2015_16_Academic_Catalog.pdf |date=May 27, 2016 }}, pp.&amp;nbsp;97–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coker offers 29 majors and 23 minors of study. The college also offers individual majors and double majors, self-designated degree programs, specializations and pre-professional programs.

==History==
[[File:Rear of Davidson Hall at Coker College, Hartsville, SC, US.jpg|right|thumb|Rear of Davidson Hall]]
Coker College began in 1894 as Welsh Neck High School, founded by a local businessman and [[American Civil War]] veteran, [[Major James Lide Coker]] (1837–1918). In 1908, when [[South Carolina]] created a statewide public school system, Coker led the effort to convert the school to Coker College for Women. [[Davidson Hall, Coker College|Davidson Hall]] and [[Memorial Hall (Hartsville, South Carolina)|Memorial Hall]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1920s until just after [[World War II]], it was the only college between [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].

Coker was once affiliated with the [[South Carolina Baptist Convention]], but has been non-denominational since 1944. It officially became co-educational in 1969, although men had been attending since the end of World War II.

The [[South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics]] was located on the Coker campus from 1988 until moving to its own campus in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/49238644.pdf |title=S.C.

==Campus==
The {{convert|15|acre|adj=on}} main campus contains mostly Georgian-style brick buildings, some of which (such as Davidson Hall, home to the college's round table classrooms) are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The Alumni House (Drengaelen), The President's House, The Dean's and President's Offices (David and May Coker House) and The Registrar's Offices (Lawton-Wilson House) are all located in old mansions along the northern edge of campus.

Hartsville and Coker College owe much to the generosity of the Coker family, founders of [[Sonoco]] and Coker's Pedigreed Seed Company.  The Coker family's patronage of the college has led to the vast majority of buildings on campus having Coker somewhere in the name.  Students often joke to freshmen or visitors that they'll meet them "in the Coker" building as a way to gently initiate newcomers to campus.

===Residence halls===
On-campus residence halls include Memorial (1914), Belk (1916), Coker (1916) and Grannis (1969), which all adjoin the Linville Dining Hall (1916). Richard and Tuck Coker Hall (1988), commonly called the RTC, and James Lide Coker III (2009) occupy separate buildings near Memorial Hall. Most of the older residence halls have been remodeled since 2005 and are fully modernized. A new residence hall, the Betty Y. and Charles L. Sullivan Jr. Residence Hall at The Village at Byerly Place, opened in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ardie |last=Arvidson |url=http://www.scnow.com/messenger/news/article_eb0b60e4-05cf-11e3-a720-001a4bcf6878.html |title=Coker opens, dedicates Betty Y. and Charles L.

Memorial Hall houses the Drawing Room, a ballroom/dining hall for special events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coker.edu/campus/belk&amp;memorial.htm Coker College Administration Building&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107073719/http://www.coker.edu/campus/belk%26memorial.htm |date=January 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library===
In January 2008, students began using the {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} Charles W. and Joan S. Coker Library-Information Technology Center.  The new library was built entirely from donations from a capital campaign and is an example of Coker alumni generosity to the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coker.edu/LITCenter/index.htm|title=Coker College: Library-Information Technology Center|publisher=|accessdate=June 28, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830095123/http://www.coker.edu/LITCenter/index.htm|archivedate=August 30, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartsvillemessenger.com/City/071026_citydesk1.php|title=SCNow|work=SCNow|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former James Lide Coker Memorial Library is now James Lide Coker Memorial Residence Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Faile |url=http://www.scnow.com/news/local/article_0b2496ac-808d-5d89-89f2-fc9aabf1be49.html |title=2008; The year in review part I |website=SC Now |date=December 31, 2008 |accessdate=June 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
Adjacent to the main campus is a 22-acre athletics complex with baseball, softball, soccer and tennis facilities. Near the athletics complex is the DeLoach Center, which contains a 1,908 seat gymnasium, an auxiliary gym, interactive classrooms, a student-athlete only weight room, a fitness center, athletic offices and more.

The college has 19 varsity athletics programs, which compete in The [[South Atlantic Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesac.com/landing/index|title=South Atlantic Conference }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include Women's Basketball, Men's Basketball, Baseball, Softball, Women's Volleyball, Men's Volleyball, Men's Lacrosse, Women's Lacrosse, Women's Tennis, Men's Tennis, Women's Golf, Men's Golf, Women's Soccer, Men's Soccer, Women's Field Hockey, Women's Cross Country, Men's Cross Country, Women's Track and Field (Indoor/Outdoor), Men's Track and Field (Indoor/Outdoor), and Wrestling.

In the 2013 season the Coker baseball team won the Conference Carolinas Tournament title, earned the team's first-ever postseason bid, won the NCAA Southeast Regional and advanced to the NCAA DII Baseball National Championship. They finished the year with a record of 38–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Haselden |url=http://www.scnow.com/sports/article_287e2994-6f4c-11e3-a18c-0019bb30f31a.html |title=2013 Year in Review: Coker's remarkable baseball run tops 2013 sports stories |website=SC Now |date=December 27, 2013 |accessdate=June 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Combat readiness''' is a condition of the [[armed forces]] and their constituent [[Military organization|units and formations]], [[warship]]s, [[aircraft]], [[weapon system]]s or other [[military technology and equipment]] to perform during [[combat]] [[military operation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_3_90/ai_82009553?tag=content;col1 Kruys]&lt;/ref&gt; or functions consistent with the purpose for which they are [[military organization|organized]] or designed, or the managing of resources and personnel training in preparation for combat.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews &amp; Shambo, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Most armed forces maintain varying [[Level of readiness|levels]] of readiness by the troops to engage in combat due to economic considerations which vary from minutes to months.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; In modern armed forces troops designated [[special forces]] are usually those kept at the highest state of readiness for combat, and are often alerted only a few hours before being committed to combat. Where time is of the essence in [[military action (combat)|military action]] being initiated, the troops, such as pilots of [[interceptor aircraft]], may be kept in constant state of combat readiness.

'''Computational creativity''' (also known as '''artificial creativity''', '''mechanical creativity''', '''creative computing''' or '''creative computation''') is a multidisciplinary endeavour that is located at the intersection of the fields of [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[the arts]].

The goal of computational creativity is to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one of several ends:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* To construct a [[computer program|program]] or [[computer]] capable of human-level [[creativity]].
* To better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans.
* To design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves.

The field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity. Theoretical work on the nature and proper definition of creativity is performed in parallel with practical work on the implementation of systems that exhibit creativity, with one strand of work informing the other.

==Theoretical issues==
As measured by the amount of activity in the field (e.g., publications, conferences and workshops), computational creativity is a growing area of research.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} But the field is still hampered by a number of fundamental problems. Creativity is very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to define in objective terms.  Is it a state of mind, a talent or ability, or a process?   Creativity takes many forms in human activity, some ''eminent'' (sometimes referred to as "Creativity" with a capital C) and some ''mundane''.

These are problems that complicate the study of creativity in general, but certain problems attach themselves specifically to ''computational'' creativity:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* Can creativity be hard-wired? In existing systems to which creativity is attributed, is the creativity that of the system or that of the system's programmer or designer?
* How do we evaluate computational creativity? What counts as creativity in a computational system? Are [[natural language generation]] systems creative? Are [[machine translation]] systems creative? What distinguishes research in computational creativity from research in [[artificial intelligence]] generally?
* If eminent creativity is about rule-breaking or the disavowal of convention, how is it possible for an algorithmic system to be creative? In essence, this is a variant of [[Ada Lovelace]]'s objection to machine intelligence, as recapitulated by modern theorists such as Teresa Amabile.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The social psychology of creativity|first = Teresa|last = Amabile|year = 1983|publisher = New York, NY: Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a machine can do only what it was programmed to do, how can its behavior ever be called ''creative''?

Indeed, not all computer theorists would agree with the premise that computers can only do what they are programmed to do&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Why programming is a good medium for expressing poorly understood and sloppily formulated ideas|first=Marvin|last=Minsky|booktitle=Design and Planning II-Computers in Design and Communication|year=1967|pages=120–125|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7511/307c10790f077e66844efd1e37e4f084dd1b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a key point in favor of computational creativity.

==Defining creativity in computational terms==

Because no single perspective or definition seems to offer a complete picture of creativity, the AI researchers Newell, Shaw and Simon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The process of creative thinking  | first = Shaw, J. G., and Simon, Herbert A.  |last =  Newell, Allen | year = 1963 | publisher =  H. E. Gruber, G. Terrell and M. Wertheimer (Eds.), Contemporary Approaches to Creative Thinking, pp 63 – 119. New York: Atherton }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the combination of novelty and usefulness into the cornerstone of a multi-pronged view of creativity, one that uses the following four criteria to categorize a given answer or solution as creative:

# The answer is novel and useful (either for the individual or for society)
# The answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted
# The answer results from intense motivation and persistence
# The answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague

Whereas the above reflects a "top-down" approach to computational creativity, an alternative thread has developed among "bottom-up" computational psychologists involved in artificial neural network research. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, such generative neural systems were driven by [[genetic algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, P. M. (1991) [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/140338/ NEUROGEN, musical composition using genetic algorithms and cooperating neural networks], Second International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks: 309-313.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments involving recurrent nets&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Todd | first1 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = A connectionist approach to algorithmic composition | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 27–43 | doi=10.2307/3679551}}&lt;/ref&gt; were successful in hybridizing simple musical melodies and predicting listener expectations.

Concurrent with such research, a number of computational psychologists took the perspective, popularized by [[Stephen Wolfram]], that system behaviors perceived as complex, including the mind's creative output, could arise from what would be considered simple algorithms. As neuro-philosophical thinking matured, it also became evident that language actually presented an obstacle to producing a scientific model of cognition, creative or not, since it carried with it so many unscientific aggrandizements that were more uplifting than accurate. Thus questions naturally arose as to how "rich," "complex," and "wonderful" creative cognition actually was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thaler | first1 = S. L. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging intelligence and its critical look at us | url = http://newdualism.org/nde-papers/Thaler/Thaler-Journal%20of%20Near-Death%20Studies_1998-17-21-29.pdf | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 21–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial neural networks==

Before 1989, [[artificial neural network]]s have been used to model certain aspects of creativity. Peter Todd (1989) first trained a neural network to reproduce musical melodies from a training set of musical pieces. Then he used a change algorithm to modify the network's input parameters.  The network was able to randomly generate new music in a highly uncontrolled manner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bharucha | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Todd | first2 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 44–53 | doi=10.2307/3679552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M., and Loy, D.G. (Eds.) (1991). Music and connectionism. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, Todd&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M. (1992). A connectionist system for exploring melody space.

extended this work, using the so-called distal teacher approach that had been developed by
Paul Munro,&lt;ref&gt;A dual backpropagation scheme for scalar-reward learning.

PJ Werbos - Decision and Control, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  D. Nguyen and [[Bernard Widrow]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee373b/truckbackerupper.pdf The truck backer-upper: An example of self-learning in neural networks].

MI Jordan, DE Rumelhart - Cognitive Science, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In the new approach there are two neural networks, one of which is supplying training patterns to another. 
In later efforts by Todd, a composer would select a set of melodies that define the melody space, position them on a 2-d plane with a mouse-based graphic interface, and train a connectionist network to produce those melodies, and listen to the new "interpolated" melodies that the network generates corresponding to intermediate points in the 2-d plane.

More recently a neurodynamical model of [[semantic network]]s has been developed to study how the connectivity structure of these networks relates to the richness of the semantic constructs, or ideas, they can generate. It was demonstrated that [[semantic neural network]]s  that have richer semantic dynamics than those with other connectivity structures may provide insight into the important issue of how the physical structure of the brain determines one of the most profound features of the human mind – its capacity for creative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Marupaka, Nagendra, and Ali A. Minai. "Connectivity and creativity in semantic neural networks." Neural Networks (IJCNN), The 2011 International Joint Conference on. IEEE, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key concepts from the literature==
Some high-level and philosophical themes recur throughout the field of computational creativity.{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}

===Important categories of creativity===
Margaret Boden&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Creative Mind: Myths and Mechanisms  | first = Margaret  |last =  Boden | year = 1990 | publisher = London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Computational models of creativity. | first = Margaret |last = Boden | year = 1999 | publisher = Handbook of Creativity, pp 351&amp;ndash;373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  refers to creativity that is novel ''merely to the agent that produces it'' as "P-creativity" (or "psychological creativity"), and refers to creativity that is recognized as novel ''by society at large'' as "H-creativity" (or "historical creativity"). Stephen Thaler has suggested a new category he calls "V-" or "Visceral creativity" wherein significance is invented to raw sensory inputs to a Creativity Machine architecture, with the "gateway" nets perturbed to produce alternative interpretations, and downstream nets shifting such interpretations to fit the overarching context. An important variety of such V-creativity is consciousness itself, wherein meaning is reflexively invented to activation turnover within the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creative computing|url=http://www.apaonline.org/404.asp?aspxerrorpath=/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx#Thaler|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=16 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115232433/http://www.apaonline.org/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx|archivedate=15 November 2012|location=Wayback machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploratory and transformational creativity===
Boden also distinguishes between the creativity that arises from an exploration within an established conceptual space, and the creativity that arises from a deliberate transformation or transcendence of this space. She labels the former as ''exploratory creativity'' and the latter as ''transformational creativity'', seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical, challenging, and rarer than the former. Following the criteria from Newell and Simon elaborated above, we can see that both forms of creativity should produce results that are appreciably novel and useful (criterion 1), but exploratory creativity is more likely to arise from a thorough and persistent search of a well-understood space (criterion 3) -- while transformational creativity should involve the rejection of some of the constraints that define this space (criterion 2) or some of the assumptions that define the problem itself (criterion 4).  Boden's insights have guided work in computational creativity at a very general level, providing more an inspirational touchstone for development work than a technical framework of algorithmic substance. However, Boden's insights are more recently also the subject of formalization, most notably in the work by Geraint Wiggins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Preliminary Framework for Description, Analysis and Comparison of Creative Systems | first = Geraint   |last =  Wiggins | year = 2006 | publisher = Journal of Knowledge Based Systems 19(7), pp. 449-458  |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.581.5208&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generation and evaluation===
The criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases, generation and evaluation. In the first phase, novel (to the system itself, thus P-Creative)  constructs are generated; unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage. This body of potentially creative constructs are then evaluated, to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not. This two-phase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke, Ward and Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creative cognition: Theory, research and applications | first =  Ward, T., and Smith, S. |last = Finke, R.  | year = 1992 | publisher = Cambridge: MIT press.|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/oldmodelling/hi/theses/paulness/appendixd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity.

===Combinatorial creativity===
A great deal, perhaps all, of human creativity can be understood as a novel combination of pre-existing ideas or objects {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Common strategies for combinatorial creativity include:
*Placing a familiar object in an unfamiliar setting (e.g., [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'') or an unfamiliar object in a familiar setting (e.g., a fish-out-of-water story such as ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'')
*Blending two superficially different objects or genres (e.g., a sci-fi story set in the Wild West, with robot cowboys, as in ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'', or the reverse, as in ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''; Japanese [[haiku]] poems, etc.)
*Comparing a familiar object to a superficially unrelated and semantically distant concept (e.g., "Makeup is the Western [[Burqa|burka]]"; "A [[zoo]] is a gallery with living exhibits")
*Adding a new and unexpected feature to an existing concept (e.g., adding a [[scalpel]] to a [[Swiss Army knife]]; adding a [[camera phone|camera]] to a [[mobile phone]])
*Compressing two incongruous scenarios into the same narrative to get a joke (e.g., the [[Emo Philips]] joke "Women are always using me to advance their careers. Damned anthropologists!")
*Using an iconic image from one domain in a domain for an unrelated or incongruous idea or product (e.g., using the [[Marlboro Man]] image to sell cars, or to advertise the dangers of smoking-related impotence).
The combinatorial perspective allows us to model creativity as a search process through the space of possible combinations. The combinations can arise from composition or concatenation of different representations, or through a rule-based or stochastic transformation of initial and intermediate representations. [[Genetic algorithm]]s and [[neural network]]s can be used to generate blended or crossover representations that capture a combination of different inputs.

====Conceptual blending====
{{Main article|Conceptual blending}}
Mark Turner and Gilles Fauconnier&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Way We Think|first =  Turner, Mark|last =  Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Conceptual Integration Networks|first =Turner, Mark|last =Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Cognitive Science, 22(2) pp 133–187  }}&lt;/ref&gt; propose a model called Conceptual Integration Networks that elaborates upon [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ideas about [[The Act of Creation|creativity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title={The act of creation}|last=Koestler|first=Arthur|year=1964|publisher=London: Hutchinson, and New York: Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more recent work by Lakoff and Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|title=Metaphors we live by
|last=Lakoff
|first=George
|author2=Johnson, Mark

|year=2008
|publisher=University of Chicago press
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; by synthesizing ideas from Cognitive Linguistic research into [[mental space]]s and [[conceptual metaphors]]. Their basic model defines an integration network as four connected spaces:

*A first input space (contains one conceptual structure or mental space)
*A second input space (to be blended with the first input)
*A ''generic space'' of stock conventions and image-schemas that allow the input spaces to be understood from an integrated perspective
*A ''blend space'' in which a selected projection of elements from both input spaces are combined; inferences arising from this combination also reside here, sometimes leading to emergent structures that conflict with the inputs.

Fauconnier and Turner describe a collection of optimality principles that are claimed to guide the construction of a well-formed integration network. In essence, they see blending as a compression mechanism in which two or more input structures are compressed into a single blend structure. This compression operates on the level of conceptual relations.  For example, a series of similarity relations between the input spaces can be compressed into a single identity relationship in the blend.

Some computational success has been achieved with the blending model by extending pre-existing computational models of analogical mapping that are compatible by virtue of their emphasis on connected semantic structures.&lt;ref name="Veale2007"&gt;{{citation|title = Computation and Blending  | first = O'Donoghue, Diarmuid  |last = Veale, Tony  | year = 2007 | publisher =  Cognitive Linguistics, 11(3-4), special issue on Conceptual Blending }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Francisco Câmara Pereira&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creativity and Artificial Intelligence: A Conceptual Blending Approach | first = Francisco Câmara  |last = Pereira  | year = 2006 | url=http://eden.dei.uc.pt/~camara/AICreativity | publisher =  Applications of Cognitive Linguistics. Amsterdam: Mouton de Gruyter }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented an implementation of blending theory that employs ideas both from [[GOFAI]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to realize some aspects of blending theory in a practical form; his example domains range from the linguistic to the visual, and the latter most notably includes the creation of mythical monsters by combining 3-D graphical models.

==Linguistic creativity==
Language provides continuous opportunity for creativity, evident in the generation of novel sentences, phrasings, [[pun]]s, [[neologism]]s, [[rhyme]]s, [[allusion]]s, [[sarcasm]], [[irony]], [[simile]]s, [[metaphor]]s, [[analogy|analogies]], [[witticism]]s, and [[joke]]s. Native speakers of morphologically rich languages  frequently create new [[Word form|word-forms]] that are easily understood, although they will never find their way to the dictionary. The area of [[natural language generation]] has been well studied, but these creative aspects of everyday language have yet to be incorporated with any robustness or scale.

===Story generation===
Substantial work has been conducted in this area of linguistic creation since the 1970s, with the development of James Meehan's TALE-SPIN
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=TALE-SPIN|first=James|last=Meehan|year=1981|publisher=Shank, R. C. and Riesbeck, C. K., (eds.), ''Inside Computer Understanding: Five Programs plus Miniatures''. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system. TALE-SPIN viewed stories as narrative descriptions of a problem-solving effort, and created stories by first establishing a goal for the story's characters so that their search for a solution could be tracked and recorded. The MINSTREL&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Creative Process: A Computer Model of Storytelling|first = S.R.|last=Turner|year=1994|publisher =Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system represents a complex elaboration of this basis approach, distinguishing a range of character-level goals in the story from a range of author-level goals for the story. Systems like Bringsjord's BRUTUS&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity. Inside the Mind of BRUTUS, a Storytelling Machine.   | first = Ferrucci, D. A.  |last =  Bringsjord, S. | year = 2000 | publisher = Hillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates }}&lt;/ref&gt; elaborate these ideas further to create stories with complex inter-personal themes like betrayal. Nonetheless, MINSTREL explicitly models the creative process with a set of Transform Recall Adapt Methods (TRAMs) to create novel scenes from old. The MEXICA&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = MEXICA: A computer model of a cognitive account of creative writing  | first = Sharples, Mike  |last = Pérez y Pérez, Rafael  | year = 2001 | publisher =  Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 13, pp 119-139 |url=http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~dan/673/papers/perezyperez.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; model of Rafael Pérez y Pérez and Mike Sharples is more explicitly interested in the creative process of storytelling, and implements a version of the engagement-reflection cognitive model of creative writing.

The company [[Narrative Science]] makes computer generated news and reports commercially available, including summarizing team sporting events based on statistical data from the game.  It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103192105/http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |archivedate=2011-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphor and simile===
Example of a metaphor: ''"She was an ape."''

Example of a simile: ''"Felt like a tiger-fur blanket.''"
The computational study of these phenomena has mainly focused on interpretation as a knowledge-based process. Computationalists such as [[Yorick Wilks]], James Martin,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Computational Model of Metaphor Interpretation | first =  James |last =  Martin | year = 1990 | publisher =  Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Fass, John Barnden,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Belief in Metaphor: Taking Commonsense Psychology Seriously  | first =  John  |last = Barnden  | year = 1992 | publisher =   Computational Intelligence 8, pp 520-552}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Lee have developed knowledge-based approaches to the processing of metaphors, either at a linguistic level or a logical level. Tony Veale and Yanfen Hao have developed a system, called Sardonicus, that acquires a comprehensive database of explicit similes from the web; these similes are then tagged as bona-fide (e.g., "as hard as steel") or ironic (e.g., "as hairy as a [[bowling ball]]", "as pleasant as a [[endodontic therapy|root canal]]"); similes of either type can be retrieved on demand for any given adjective. They use these similes as the basis of an on-line metaphor generation system called Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Comprehending and Generating Apt Metaphors: A Web-driven, Case-based Approach to Figurative Language|first=Hao, Yanfen|last=Veale, Tony|year=2007|publisher=Proceedings of AAAI 2007, the 22nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vancouver, Canada|url=http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-233.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can suggest lexical metaphors for a given descriptive goal (e.g., to describe a supermodel as skinny, the source terms "pencil", "whip", "[[whippet]]", "rope", "[[Phasmatodea|stick-insect]]" and "snake" are suggested).

===Analogy===
The process of analogical reasoning has been studied from both a mapping and a retrieval perspective, the latter being key to the generation of novel analogies. The dominant school of research, as advanced by [[Dedre Gentner]], views analogy as a structure-preserving process; this view has been implemented in the [[structure mapping engine]] or SME,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The structure-mapping engine: Algorithm and examples | first = Forbus, Ken and Gentner, Dedre  |last =  Falkenhainer, Brian | year = 1989 | url = http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/papers/Files/smeff2(searchable).pdf| publisher =   Artificial Intelligence, 20(41) pp 1–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MAC/FAC retrieval engine (Many Are Called, Few Are Chosen), ACME ([[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]]) and ARCS ([[Analogical Retrieval Constraint System]]). Other mapping-based approaches include Sapper,&lt;ref name="Veale2007" /&gt; which situates the mapping process in a semantic-network model of memory. Analogy is a very active sub-area of creative computation and creative cognition; active figures in this sub-area include [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Paul Thagard]], and [[Keith Holyoak]]. Also worthy of note here is Peter Turney and Michael Littman's [[machine learning]] approach to the solving of [[SAT]]-style analogy problems; their approach achieves a score that compares well with average scores achieved by humans on these tests.

===Joke generation===
{{main article|Computational humor}}

Humour is an especially knowledge-hungry process, and the most successful joke-generation systems to date have focussed on pun-generation, as exemplified by the work of Kim Binsted and Graeme Ritchie.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Children's evaluation of computer-generated punning riddles|first=Pain, H., and Ritchie, G.|last=Binsted, K.|year=1997|publisher=''Pragmatics and Cognition'', 5(2), pp 309&amp;ndash;358|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Helen_Pain/publication/2337083_Children%27s_Evaluation_of_Computer--Generated_Punning_Riddles/links/0fcfd5100419c21c7c000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work includes the [[JAPE (software)|JAPE]] system, which can generate a wide range of puns that are consistently evaluated as novel and humorous by young children. An improved version of JAPE has been developed in the guise of the STANDUP system, which has been experimentally deployed as a means of enhancing linguistic interaction with children with communication disabilities. Some limited progress has been made in generating humour that involves other aspects of natural language, such as the deliberate misunderstanding of pronominal reference (in the work of Hans Wim Tinholt and Anton Nijholt), as well as in the generation of humorous acronyms in the HAHAcronym system&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=HAHAcronym: Humorous agents for humorous acronyms|first=Strapparava, Carlo|last=Stock, Oliviero|year=2003|publisher=Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 16(3) pp 297–314|url=https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/5127042/twlt20.pdf#page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Oliviero Stock and Carlo Strapparava.

===Neologism===
The blending of multiple word forms is a dominant force for new word creation in language; these new words are commonly called "blends" or "[[portmanteau word]]s" (after [[Lewis Carroll]]). Tony Veale has developed a system called ZeitGeist&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Tracking the Lexical Zeitgeist with Wikipedia and WordNet | first = Tony  |last = Veale  | year = 2006 | publisher =Proceedings of ECAI'2006, the 17th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; that harvests neological [[headword]]s from [[Wikipedia]] and interprets them relative to their local context in Wikipedia and relative to specific word senses in [[WordNet]]. ZeitGeist has been extended to generate neologisms of its own; the approach combines elements from an inventory of word parts that are harvested from WordNet, and simultaneously determines likely glosses for these new words (e.g., "food traveller" for "gastronaut" and "time traveller" for "[[wikt:chrononaut|chrononaut]]"). It then uses [[Web search]] to determine which glosses are meaningful and which neologisms have not been used before; this search identifies the subset of generated words that are both novel ("H-creative") and useful. [[Neurolinguistics|Neurolinguistic]] inspirations have been used to analyze the process of novel word creation in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Creativity and the Brain, In: A Handbook of Creativity for Teachers. Ed. Ai-Girl Tan|first=Wlodzislaw|last=Duch|year=2007|publisher=World Scientific Publishing, Singapore, pp 507–530|url=http://cogprints.org/5356/1/06-Creativity-Brain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; understand neurocognitive processes responsible for intuition, insight, imagination and creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Intuition, Insight, Imagination and Creativity|first=Wlodzislaw|last=Duch|year=2007|publisher=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 2(3) pp 40–52|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duch_Wlodzislaw/publication/3455552_Intuition_Insight_Imagination_and_Creativity/links/0046352b15de1ce647000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to create a server that invents novel names for products, based on their description.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Experiments with computational creativity|first=Duch Wlodzislaw|last=Pilichowski Maciej|year=2007|publisher=Neural Information Processing – Letters and Reviews, 11(4-6) pp 123-133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the system Nehovah&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Nehovah: A Neologism Creator Nomen Ipsum|first=Hintze, R. S., and Ventura, D.|last=Smith, M. R.|year=2014|publisher=Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC 2014), pp 173-181 | url = http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/06//10.1_Smith.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; blends two source words into a neologism that blends the meanings of the two source words. Nehovah searches WordNet for synonyms and TheTopTens.com for pop culture hyponyms. The synonyms and hyponyms are blended together to create a set of candidate neologisms. The neologisms are then scored based on their word structure, how unique the word is, how apparent the concepts are conveyed, and if the neologism has a pop culture reference. Nehovah loosely follows conceptual blending.

===Poetry===
&lt;div style="float:right; border:1px solid gray; padding:5px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; text-align:right; background:lightyellow"&gt;
More than iron, more than lead, more than gold I need electricity.&lt;br&gt;I need it more than I need lamb or pork or lettuce or cucumber.&lt;br&gt;I need it for my dreams.
&lt;small&gt;Racter, from ''The Policeman's Beard Is Half Constructed''&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Like jokes, poems involve a complex interaction of different constraints, and no general-purpose poem generator adequately combines the meaning, phrasing, structure and rhyme aspects of poetry. Nonetheless, Pablo Gervás&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = An expert system for the composition of formal Spanish poetry|first=Pablo|last=Gervás|year=2001|publisher=Journal of Knowledge-Based Systems 14(3-4) pp 181&amp;ndash;188|url=http://nil.fdi.ucm.es/sites/default/files/gervasjkbs2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a [[case-based reasoning]] (CBR) approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a case-base of existing poems. Each poem fragment in the ASPERA case-base is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment, and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment. [[Meter (poetry)|Metrical]] rules are then used to combine these fragments into a well-formed poetic structure. [[Racter]] is an example of such a software project.

==Musical creativity==
Computational creativity in the music domain has focused both on the generation of musical scores for use by human musicians, and on the generation of music for performance by computers. The domain of generation has included classical music (with software that generates music in the style of [[Mozart]] and [[Bach]]) and [[jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A Functional Taxonomy of Music Generation Systems

In Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference, San Francisco: Computer Music Assn.&lt;/ref&gt;  that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style. EMI's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human-generated to a high level of competence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ Triumph of the Cyborg Composer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226121804/http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ |date=February 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of contemporary classical music, [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] is the first computer that composes from scratch, and produces final scores that professional interpreters can play. The [[London Symphony Orchestra]] played a piece for full orchestra, included in [[Iamus (album)|Iamus' debut CD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Iamus' debut CD|year = 2012|publisher = Melomics Records}}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv4y_BRJokM&amp;feature=relmfu]&lt;/ref&gt; which ''[[New Scientist]]'' described as "The first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Computer composer honours Turing's centenary| journal= New Scientist| date =5 July 2012| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melomics]], the technology behind Iamus, is able to generate pieces in different styles of music with a similar level of quality.

Creativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and the cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent: reasoning about time, remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played, and planning ahead for what might be played next.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  The robot Shimon, developed by Gil Weinberg of Georgia Tech, has demonstrated jazz improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121763193|title=A Robot Named Shimon Wants To Jam With You|date=22 December 2009|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual improvisation software based on machine learning models of musical style include OMax, SoMax and PyOracle, are used to create improvisations in real-time by re-injecting variable length sequences learned on the fly from live performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1 = Shlomo | last1 = Dubnov | first2 = Greg | last2 = Surges | title = Delegating Creativity: Use of Musical Algorithms in Machine Listening and Composition | publisher = Newton Lee (Ed.), Digital Da Vinci, Springer | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a Creativity Machine architecture (see above) was able to generate 11,000 musical hooks by training a synaptically perturbed neural net on 100 melodies that had appeared on the top ten list over the last 30 years. In 1996, a self-bootstrapping Creativity Machine observed audience facial expressions through an advanced machine vision system and perfected its musical talents to generate an album entitled "Song of the Neurons"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagination-engines.com/iei_son.php|title=Song of the Neurons|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of musical composition, the patented works&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Article de presse : [http://www.realcomposer.com/Medal%20-%20RevuePresse.htm « Génération automatique d'œuvres numériques », article sur l'invention Medal de Béatrice Perret du Cray] », ''[[Science et Vie Micro]]''&lt;/ref&gt; by [[René-Louis Baron]] allowed to make a robot that can create and play a multitude of orchestrated melodies so-called "coherent" in any musical style. All outdoor physical parameter associated with one or more specific musical parameters, can influence and develop each of these songs (in real time while listening to the song). The patented invention ''[[René-Louis Baron#Inventor.27s path|Medal-Composer]]'' raises problems of copyright.

==Visual and artistic creativity==
Computational creativity in the generation of visual art has had some notable successes in the creation of both abstract art and representational art. The most famous program in this domain is [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]'s [[AARON]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Aaron's Code.|first = Pamela|last=McCorduck|author-link=Pamela McCorduck|year=1991|publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been continuously developed and augmented since 1973. Though formulaic, Aaron exhibits a range of outputs, generating black-and-white drawings or colour paintings that incorporate human figures (such as dancers), potted plants, rocks, and other elements of background imagery. These images are of a sufficiently high quality to be displayed in reputable galleries.

Other software artists of note include the NEvAr system (for "[[neuroevolution|Neuro-Evolutionary]] Art") of Penousal Machado.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Art of Artificial Evolution: A Handbook on Evolutionary Art and Music|first= Machado, Penousal (eds.)|last=Romero, Juan|year = 2008|publisher =  Natural Computing Series. Berlin: Springer Verlag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypdCBD6JrAsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEvAr uses a genetic algorithm to derive a mathematical function that is then used to generate a coloured three-dimensional surface. A human user is allowed to select the best pictures after each phase of the genetic algorithm, and these preferences are used to guide successive phases, thereby pushing NEvAr's search into pockets of the search space that are considered most appealing to the user.

[[The Painting Fool]], developed by [[Simon Colton]] originated as a system for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting styles, colour palettes and brush types. Given its dependence on an input source image to work with, the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool raised questions about the extent of, or lack of, creativity in a computational art system. Nonetheless, in more recent work, The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images, much as [[AARON]] does, from its own limited imagination. Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests, which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user (e.g., these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more color-saturated, while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller). Artistically, the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron, though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former (constraint satisfaction, etc.) may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter.

The artist Krasimira Dimtchevska and the software developer Svillen Ranev have created a computational system combining a rule-based generator of English sentences and a visual composition builder that converts sentences generated by the system into abstract art.&lt;ref&gt;"Methods, systems and software for generating sentences, and visual and audio compositions representing said sentences" Canadian Patent 2704163&lt;/ref&gt; The software generates automatically indefinite number of different images using different color, shape and size palettes. The software also allows the user to select the subject of the generated sentences or/and the one or more of the palettes used by the visual composition builder.

An emerging area of computational creativity is that of video games. ANGELINA is a system for creatively developing video games in Java by Michael Cook. One important aspect is Mechanic Miner, a system which can generate short segments of code which act as simple game mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2012/11/introducing-mechanic-miner/|title=Introducing Mechanic Miner|work=Games By Angelina}}&lt;/ref&gt; ANGELINA can evaluate these mechanics for usefulness by playing simple unsolvable game levels and testing to see if the new mechanic makes the level solvable. Sometimes Mechanic Miner discovers bugs in the code and exploits these to make new mechanics for the player to solve problems with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2012/11/why-i-think-mechanic-miner-is-exciting/|title=Why I Think Mechanic Miner Is Cool|work=Games By Angelina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 [[Google]] released ''[[DeepDream]]'' – an [[Open-source software|open source]]&lt;ref name=github&gt;{{Github|google/deepdream}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer vision program, created to detect faces and other patterns in images with the aim of automatically classifying images, which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic [[pareidolia]], thus creating a dreamlike [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christian |last1=Szegedy  |first2=Wei |last2=Liu |first3=Yangqing |last3=Jia|first4=Pierre |last4=Sermanet|first5=Scott |last5=Reed|first6=Dragomir |last6=Anguelov|first7=Dumitru |last7=Erhan|first8=Vincent |last8=Vanhoucke|first9=Andrew |last9=Rabinovich|title = Going Deeper with Convolutions|journal= Computing Research Repository|year=2014 |arxiv= 1409.4842|bibcode=2014arXiv1409.4842S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=codexample&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708233542/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|archivedate=2015-07-08|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|title=DeepDream - a code example for visualizing Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 researchers from [[Tübingen, Germany]] created a convolutional neural network that uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images which is able to turn images into stylistic imitations of works of art by artists such as a [[Picasso]] or [[Van Gogh]] in about an hour. Their algorithm is put into use in the website [[DeepArt]] that allows users to create unique artistic images by their algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McFarland|first1=Matt|title=This algorithm can create a new Van Gogh or Picasso in just an hour|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/08/31/this-algorithm-can-create-a-new-van-gogh-or-picasso-in-just-an-hour/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Culpan|first1=Daniel|title=This algorithm can create an imitation Van Gogh in 60 minutes|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/01/art-algorithm-recreates-paintings|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GitXiv - A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|url=http://gitxiv.com/posts/jG46ukGod8R7Rdtud/a-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style|website=gitxiv.com|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Gatys|first1=Leon A.|last2=Ecker|first2=Alexander S.|last3=Bethge|first3=Matthias|title=A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|arxiv=1508.06576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, a global team of researchers explained how a new computational creativity approach known as the Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate (DSNS) could be used to generate original chess puzzles that were not derived from endgame databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Iqbal |first1=Azlan |last2=Guid  |first2=Matej |last3=Colton |first3=Simon |last4=Krivec |first4=Jana |last5=Azman |first5=Shazril |last6=Haghighi |first6=Boshra |series=SpringerBriefs in Cognitive Computation |title=The Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate: A New Approach to Computational Creativity |publisher=Springer |location=Switzerland |date=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-28078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSNS is able to combine features of different objects (e.g. chess problems, paintings, music) using stochastic methods in order to derive new feature specifications which can be used to generate objects in any of the original domains. The generated chess puzzles have also been featured on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvub4ug2bM9nlx7VbF5nWhw Chesthetica's YouTube Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creativity in problem solving==
Creativity is also useful in allowing for unusual solutions in [[problem solving]]. In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], this research area is called [[creative problem solving]]. The Explicit-Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity has recently been implemented using a [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION]]-based computational model that allows for the simulation of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]] in problem solving.&lt;ref name ="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Helie | first1 = S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis of this computational creativity project is not on performance per se (as in [[artificial intelligence]] projects) but rather on the explanation of the psychological processes leading to human creativity and the reproduction of data collected in psychology experiments. So far, this project has been successful in providing an explanation for incubation effects in simple memory experiments, insight in problem solving, and reproducing the overshadowing effect in problem solving.

==Debate about "general" theories of creativity==

Some researchers feel that creativity is a complex phenomenon whose study is further complicated by the plasticity of the language we use to describe it. We can describe not just the agent of creativity as "creative" but also the product and the method. Consequently, it could be claimed that it is unrealistic to speak of a ''general theory of creativity''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Nonetheless, some generative principles are more general than others, leading some advocates to claim that certain computational approaches are "general theories". Stephen Thaler, for instance, proposes that certain modalities of neural networks are generative enough, and general enough, to manifest a high degree of creative capabilities. Likewise, the Formal Theory of Creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990-2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a simple computational principle published by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J. 1991"&gt;Schmidhuber, J. (1991), [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/170605/ Curious model-building control systems]. In Proc. ICANN, Singapore, volume 2, pp 1458-1463. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory postulates that creativity and [[curiosity]] and [[selective attention]] in general are by-products of a simple [[algorithm]]ic principle for measuring and [[optimizing]] learning progress.

==Criticism of Computational Creativity==
{{Weasel|reason=Broad claims are made which contradict much of the rest of this article, without specific attribution|date=December 2018}}

Traditional computers, as mainly used in the computational creativity application, do not support creativity, as they fundamentally transform a set of discrete, limited domain of input parameters into a set of discrete, limited domain of output parameters using a limited set of computational functions  {{Citation needed|reason=This does not seem to line up with current approaches in generative AI. What does "limited set of computational functions" mean?|date=November 2018}}. As such, a computer cannot be creative, as everything in the output must have been already present in the input data or the algorithms {{Citation needed|reason=This seems like an opinion, one that uses a very specific definition of creativity, a very narrow definition of "traditional computer", and a fairly fundamental misunderstanding of how generative models actually work|date=November 2018}}. For some related discussions and references to related work are captured in some recent work on philosophical foundations of simulation&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, A. (2013). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31140-6_1 Truth, Trust, and Turing–Implications for Modeling and Simulation]. In: Ontology, Epistemology, and Teleology for Modeling and Simulation, pp. 1-26. Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mathematically, the same set of arguments against creativity has been made by Chaitin&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin, G. J. (1987). Algorithmic information theory. Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Similar observations come from a Model Theory perspective. All this criticism emphasizes that computational creativity is useful and may look like creativity, but it is not real creativity, as nothing new is created, just transformed in well defined algorithms.

'''''Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology''''' is an academic anthology published by [[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate]] in 2009 and edited by the Norwegian [[religious studies]] scholar Jesper Aa. Petersen. Containing eight separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of Satanism studies, the book examines different forms of [[Satanism]] as practiced in Europe and North America. ''Contemporary Religious Satanism'' was a part of Ashgate's series of books on "Controversial New Religions" alongside tomes devoted to religious movements like [[Wicca]] and the [[Order of the Solar Temple]].

Edited by Petersen, then a lecturer at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]], the book was divided into three sections.

Academic reviews were mixed, being printed in peer reviewed journals such as ''[[Nova Religio]]'', ''[[Aries (journal)|Aries]]'' and ''[[Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft]]''. It was recognised as a pioneering publication in the field of Satanism studies.

==Reception==
The volume was reviewed by French anthropologist Jean La Fontaine for the ''[[Nova Religio]]'' journal.

Erik Davis of [[Rice University]] reviewed the anthology for the ''[[Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft]]'' journal, noting that the book was primarily sociological in basis but that it opened up "an underresearched and underreported topic". Describing Petersen's "thorough introduction", he then discusses the various papers within the anthology. He opines that Lowney had "beautifully" described her encounters, but that it was "unfortunate" that she spent so much of the text reflecting on her logistical challenges, subsequently describing Søderlind and Dyrendal's contribution as "one of the most lively and entertaining" parts of the volume. He remarks positively of Granholm's criticism of the term "Satanism", describing his chapter as a "crucial contribution", and believing that he has made a "good case" for the term "Left Hand Path". Moving on to review the inclusion of primary documents at the end of the volume, he believes that the works presented appear "minor in context", and that it is unfortunate that texts from LaVey and Aquino were not included. As such, he believes that ''Contemporary Religious Satanism'' is not "the perfect reader." Wishing that philosophical and symbolic analyses of Satanism had been included alongside the sociological studies, he also felt that "much more can be made" regarding the differences between LaVeyan-influenced secular Satanists and the mystical Left-Hand Path followers. He believed that the volume would be of great interest to scholars of magic, contemporary Paganism and new religious movements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav11|Davis 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Easily confused Buddhist representations''' are images or statues that may resemble the mortal, historical Buddha known as [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]], Śākyamuni, or [[Tathāgata]] (or others), but were actually created to represent other individuals.

Depictions could be Gautama, or a bodhisattva, guardian, protector, disciple, or saint. Clues to a figure's identity are found in, for example, the [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]], the objects the figure is holding, its ''[[mudra]]'' (hand gesture), and ''[[asana]]'' (sitting or standing position of the body).&lt;ref name="Sjoquist"&gt;Sjoquist&lt;/ref&gt; There may be an image in the figure's [[crown (headgear)|crown]],&lt;ref&gt;Sakya, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; or the figure could be holding a book, thunderbolt, vase, jewel, or lotus flower or stem.&lt;ref&gt;Sakya, various.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mandala]]s created for [[Shingon Buddhism|Japanese Shingon Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] can contain hundreds of different figures that may need [[Womb Realm#Womb Realm map|interpretation]].&lt;ref name="Sjoquist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring the Mandala|url=http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/mandala/|publisher=Cornell University Program of Computer Graphics|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his paper on the ''mudrās'' of [[bodhisattva]]s, Carl B. Becker, [[Kyoto University]] professor, describes the situation:

{{quote|When the uninitiated observer first confronts the Buddhist pantheon [of Japan], his reaction may border on bewilderment or dismay. Far from the ascetic agnosticism taught by Gautama, Buddha-like deities are available to answer every material or spiritual need. They wear regal robes or deerskins; they sit, stand, or fly; they have their own ''sūtras'', temples, and guardians....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hands of the Bodhisattva The Standardization of Mudrās in Japanese Buddhist Sculpture Prior to A.D. 1200|author=Becker, Carl B.|journal=East and West|volume=43|issue=1/4|date=December 1993|pages= 199–232|publisher=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente [IsIAO]|jstor=29757091}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Dhyani Buddhas==
{{main|Five Dhyani Buddhas}}
Representations of the [[five Dhyani Buddhas]], who are abstract aspects of [[Buddhahood]] rather than Buddhas or gods, have elaborate differences.&lt;ref&gt;Sakya, pp. 35, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Each must face in a different direction (north, south, east, west, or center), and, when painted, each is a different color (blue, yellow, red, green, or white). Each has a different ''mudrā'' and symbol; embodies a different aspect, type of evil, and cosmic element; has a different consort and spiritual son, as well as different animal vehicles (elephant, lion, peacock, harpys or [[garuda]], or dragon).&lt;ref name="Sakya, p. 76"&gt;Sakya, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vairocana]], the first Dhyani Buddha, embodying [[sovereignty]] and occupying the center,&lt;ref name="Sakya, p. 76"/&gt; is a special case (in any case, he is distinct from Gautama and not normally confused with him). He was one of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] blown up by the [[Taliban]] which China mourned and tried to replace with the [[List of statues by height|world's tallest statue]], named [[Spring Temple Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China enters biggest Buddhist statue race|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1315785.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land Buddhists]] think that Vairocana and the other Dhyani Buddhas are manifestations of [[Amitābha]], but Japanese Shingon Buddhists think that Amitābha and the other Dhyani Buddhas are manifestations of Vairocana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Getty, Alice|title=The gods of northern Buddhism: their history, iconography and progressive evolution through the northern Buddhist countries|year=1914|publisher=Oxford Clarendon Press via Internet Archive|page=3|url=https://archive.org/stream/northernbuddhism00gettuoft#page/n73/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Akshobhya]], the second Dhyani Buddha who embodies steadfastness and faces east, and Gautama are indistinguishable. Both can be seated in the ''Vajraparyanka'' (also known as ''Bhūmisparśa'') pose, with the right hand on the right knee, palm turned inwardly, and middle finger touching the ground.&lt;ref name="Sakya, p. 76"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The ''Lotus Sutra'' focus on Śākyamuni also fits the main Buddha figure in Zen, rather than the Buddhas Amida or Vairocana venerated in the contemporary
Pure Land and Esoteric (and Kegon) movements." in {{cite journal|author=Taigen Dan Leighton|title=Dōgen's Appropriation of Lotus Sutra Ground and Space|page=87|volume=32|issue=1|year=2005|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|publisher=Nanzan University|jstor=30233778|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195320930.003.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"One of the two wives of Songtsen Gampo, she brought a large image of either Shakyamuni or Akshobhya Buddha (they are visually

A statue of Amitābha, when seated, has a ''[[samadhi]]'' ''mudrā'' with both palms face up, on top of each other, in his lap.&lt;ref name="Sakya, p. 76"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakya, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Similarities with Amitabha in {{cite web|title=Who’s Who of Buddhism|url=http://www.thedhamma.com/whos_who.htm|publisher=Vipassana Foundation|accessdate=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bodhisattvas==
{{main|Bodhisattva|Budai|Avalokiteśvara}}
[[Budai]] (in Chinese, or Hotei in Japanese) is often confused with Gautama or is thought to have originated Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who’s Who of Buddhism|url=http://www.thedhamma.com/whos_who.htm|publisher=Vipassana Foundation|accessdate=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an incarnation of the bodhisattva and future Buddha, [[Maitreya]],&lt;ref name=Econ&gt;{{cite web|title=The joy of belief|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-01-31/news/31010485_1_monk-sweets-bag|work=The Economic Times|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.|date=January 31, 2012|accessdate=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who will come to Earth 4,000 years after Gautama disappears.&lt;ref&gt;Sakya, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; His name means "Cloth Sack" for the bag of sweets he carries, eats and gives to children. Admired for his happiness and contentment,&lt;ref name=Econ /&gt; he is known in Chinese as "The Laughing Buddha" and sometimes in English as "The Fat Buddha".

The '''Glagolita Clozianus''' is a 14-folio [[Glagolitic script|Glagolitic]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[Old_Church_Slavonic#Canon|canon]] [[miscellany]], written in the eleventh century.

What remained of an originally very large codex, having probably 552 folios (1104 pages), are 14 folios containing five [[homily|homilies]]. Two of the homilies are complete; one by [[John Chrysostom]] and one by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], and three of them are fragments, one by John Chrysostom, one by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] and one that is usually attributed to [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]]. Four of those homilies are known from other Old Church Slavonic codices, the exception being the one usually attributed to St. Methodius, which is found only in Clo, and sometimes referred to as the ''Anonymous Homily''.

The codex was named after the Count [[Paris Cloz]] who owned it in the first half of the 19th century. Prior to that, up until the end of the 15th century, it was owned by the Croatian nobles of the [[House of Frankopan]], who used the codex as a house [[relic]] (it was bound with silver and gold) in worship, believing St. [[Jerome]] to be the author. Count Cloz donated the codex to the City Museum in [[Trento|Trent]], where the first 12 folios are being kept today. The remaining 2 folios, discovered by Slovene Slavist [[Franc Miklošič]], are kept in the [[Ferdinandeum]] museum in [[Innsbruck]].

Linguists somewhat disagree when discussing the source of the text; some, arguing on the similarity of the rounded Glagolitic with Sinaitic codices ([[Psalterium Sinaiticum]], [[Euchologium Sinaiticum]]), hold that the manuscript originated in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and others that it was written in [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]], justifying it with the change of ''ь'' to ''ъ'' behind palatal ''č'', ''ž'', ''št'' and ''žd'', a trait commonly found in other Croatian Glagolitic mediaeval manuscripts. The reasonable conclusion that follows is that the manuscript was copied on the Croatian territory from the original written in Macedonia.

The text was first published by [[Jernej Kopitar|Jernej B. Kopitar]] (Vienna 1836, the first 12 folios), together with the [[Freising Fragments]] and the manuscript ''De conversione Bagaorium et Carantanorum''. Franc Miklošič published two folios from Innsbruck in 1860, and both pieces were published together by I. I. Sreznjevski in 1866. Critical edition with Ancient Greek originals was published by [[Václav Vondrák]] (''Glagolita Clozùv'' 1893) and finally by [[Antonín Dostál]] (''Clozianus, staroslověnsky hlaholský sborník tridentský a innsbrucký'', Prague 1959). Dostal's edition contains photographs, Cyrillic transcription, Ancient Greek original, translations to Czech and a dictionary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3182">'''Haber's rule''' or '''Haber's law''' is a [[mathematical]] statement of the relationship between the [[concentration]] of a [[poisonous]] [[gas]] and how long the gas must be breathed to produce death, or other [[toxic]] effect. The rule was formulated by [[Germany|German]] [[chemist]] [[Fritz Haber]] in the early 1900s.

Haber's rule states that, for a given poisonous gas, &lt;math&gt;C\times t = k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of the gas (mass per unit volume), &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of time necessary to breathe the gas, in order to produce a given toxic effect, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, depending on both the gas and the effect. Thus, the rule states that doubling the concentration will halve the time, for example.

It makes [[Equivalent (chemistry)|equivalent]] any two groupings of [[dose concentration]] and [[exposure time]] that have equivalent [[mathematical product]]s.  For instance, if we assign [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] [[concentration]] the [[symbol]] C, and [[time]] the classic t, then for any two dose [[Conceptual model|schema]], if C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then under Haber's rule the two dose schema are equivalent.

Haber's rule is an approximation, useful with certain inhaled poisons under certain conditions, and Haber himself acknowledged that it was not always applicable. If a substance is efficiently eliminated in the host, for example, then Haber's Law breaks down in the limit of t approaching the [[Order of reaction|order]] of the [[half-life]] of the [[drug]], rewriting the equation as the integral ∫Cdt = constant for arbitrary varying C and elapsed time T.  It is very convenient, however, because its relationship between &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; appears as a straight line in a [[log-log plot]].

In 1940, [[statistician]] C. I. Bliss published a study of [[toxicity]] in [[insecticide]]s in which he proposed more complex [[mathematical model|models]], for example, expressing the relationship between &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as two straight line segments in a [[log-log plot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=C. I. Bliss | title= The relationship between exposure, time, concentration and toxicity in experiments on insecticides | journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America | year=1940 | volume=33 | pages=721–766}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of its simplicity, Haber's rule continued to be widely used. Recently, some researchers have argued that it is time to move beyond the simple relationship expressed by Haber's rule and to make regular use of more sophisticated models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=F.

'''''Health Education &amp; Behavior''''' is a bimonthly [[peer-reviewed]] [[healthcare journal]] covering applied [[Behavioral science|behavioral]] and [[social science]] in [[public health]] published by [[SAGE Publications]]. It is an official journal of the [[Society for Public Health Education]] (SOPHE).

==History==
The journal was established in 1957 as ''Health Education Monographs'' which was produced on an occasional basis with no set publishing schedule until 1974, when it became a quarterly publication with standard volume numbering and pagination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zimmerman |first=M. A. |date=2016-07-01 |title=Message From the Editor |journal=Health Education &amp; Behavior |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=5–7 |doi=10.1177/109019819802500101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of 1974 became volume 2, issue 1. All previous issues covering issues 1 to 36, from 1957 to 1973, were designated to constitute volume 1. During this period, ''Health Education Monographs'' was printed by various small publishing companies or cooperatively by SOPHE and the [[World Health Organization]]. No volume was published in 1979 due to extensive ongoing changes, including a new publisher, editor, and format.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1980, the journal was renamed ''Health Education Quarterly'' and a publication agreement was negotiated with Human Sciences Press.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] became the publisher with volume 10 in 1983 and the journal changed to its present publisher, SAGE Publications, in 1995. In 1997, the journal expanded to six issues annually to accommodate the growing volume of submissions and was renamed ''Health Education &amp; Behavior''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Abstracting and indexing==
The journal is abstracted and indexed by [[CAB Abstracts]], [[CINAHL]], [[Current Contents]]/Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, [[Global Health]], [[Index Medicus]]/[[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]], [[ProQuest|ProQuest databases]], [[Psychological Abstracts]], [[PsycINFO]], [[PsycLIT]], [[SafetyLit]], [[Scopus]], [[Social Sciences Citation Index]], and [[Sociological Abstracts]]. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal's 2015 [[impact factor]] is 2.312.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2016 |chapter=Health Education &amp; Behavior|title=2015 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Social Sciences |series=[[Web of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sir Henry Royce Institute''' is an institute of nine UK university and other research organisation partners, led by the [[University of Manchester]]. It is a [[Spoke–hub distribution paradigm|hub and spoke]] collaboration between the [[University of Manchester]] (the hub), [[Culham Centre for Fusion Energy]], [[Imperial College London]], [[National Nuclear Laboratory]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;ref name="website" /&gt;

The cost of the institution, including the building in Manchester, is £235 million.&lt;ref name="Manchester_12Dec16" /&gt;

== Building ==
The nine-storey building which is the focus of the [[University of Manchester]]'s Royce Institute research activity will be {{convert|46|m|ft}} high, making it the tallest current building on the campus (although the [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics Tower]] was taller before its demolition). It will have {{convert|16,000|sqm|sqft}} of space. It will be located next to the [[Alan Turing Building]], close to the [[National Graphene Institute]] as well as the [[School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester|School of Physics and Astronomy]], the [[School of Chemistry, University of Manchester|School of Chemistry]], and the [[Manchester Engineering Campus Development]].&lt;ref name="Manchester_12Dec16" /&gt;

The building will cost £105 million, and will open in early 2020.&lt;ref name=constructionbegins&gt;{{cite web|title=Construction begins on UK centre for advanced materials research and commercialisation in Manchester |url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/construction-uk-centre-advanced-materials-research-and-commercialisation-manchester/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planning permission was granted in February 2017 and construction started in December 2017.&lt;ref name="MEN_11Feb17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=constructionbegins/&gt; It was originally going to be constructed on the site of the [[New Broadcasting House (Manchester)|BBC's New Broadcasting House]], but the site was changed to the main campus of the university.&lt;ref name="MEN_11Feb17" /&gt;

US military bodies tend to speak in terms of a hybrid threat, while academic literature speaks of a hybrid warfare. For the purposes of this article, these terms will be used interchangeably.

== Definition ==
{{quote box|quote=Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.|source=—[[Carl von Clausewitz]]&lt;ref name="Clausewitz"&gt;{{cite book | last1=von Clausewitz | first1=Carl | date=1989 | title=On War | editor1-last=Howard | editor1-first=Michael | editor2-last=Paret | editor2-first=Peter | publisher=Princeton University Press | publication-place=Princeton, NJ | page=593}}&lt;/ref&gt;|salign=right|width=300px}}
There is no universally accepted definition of hybrid warfare which leads to some debate whether the term is useful at all. Some argue that the term is too abstract and only the latest term to refer to [[Irregular warfare|irregular methods]] to counter a [[Conventional warfare|conventionally]] superior force. The abstractness of the term means that it is often used as a catch all term for all non-linear threats.&lt;ref name="SWJ_IS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/the-islamic-state-is-a-hybrid-threat-why-does-that-matter | title=The Islamic State is a Hybrid Threat: Why Does That Matter? | last1=Jasper | first1=Scott | last2=Moreland | first2=Scott | date=2014-12-02 | website=[[Small Wars Journal]] | publisher=Small Wars Foundation | access-date=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hybrid_threat_concept"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cgsc.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getdownloaditem/collection/p4013coll3/id/2752/filename/2753.pdf | title=Hybrid threat concept: contemporary war, military planning and the advent of unrestricted operational art.  | last1=Fleming | first1=Brian P. | date=2011-05-19 | publisher=[[United States Army Command and General Staff College]] | format=pdf | access-date=2015-08-05 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcgsc.contentdm.oclc.org%2Futils%2Fgetdownloaditem%2Fcollection%2Fp4013coll3%2Fid%2F2752%2Ffilename%2F2753.pdf&amp;date=2015-08-05 | archive-date=2015-08-05 | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hybrid_wars"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.govexec.com/magazine/features/2008/05/hybrid-wars/26799/ | title=Hybrid Wars | last1=Grant | first1=Greg | date=2008-05-01 | website=[[Government Executive]] | publisher=National Journal Group | access-date=2015-08-05 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.govexec.com%2Fmagazine%2Ffeatures%2F2008%2F05%2Fhybrid-wars%2F26799%2F&amp;date=2015-08-05 | archive-date=2015-08-05 | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid warfare is warfare with the following aspects:
* ''A non-standard, complex, and fluid adversary.'' A hybrid adversary can be state or non-state. For example, in the [[2006 Lebanon War|Israel–Hezbollah War]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]] the main adversaries are non-state entities within the state system. These non-state actors can act as [[Proxy war|proxies]] for countries but have independent agendas as well. For example, [[Iran]] is a sponsor of [[Hezbollah]] but it was Hezbollah’s, not Iran’s, agenda that resulted in the kidnapping of Israeli troops that led to the Israel–Hezbollah war. On the other hand, [[War in Donbass|Russian involvement in Ukraine]] can be described as a traditional state actor waging a hybrid war (in addition to using a local hybrid proxy). Note that [[Russia]] denies involvement in the Ukraine conflict.&lt;ref name="hybrid_threat_concept" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hybrid_wars" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SWJ_hybrid_war"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/hybrid-war-old-concept-new-techniques | title=Hybrid War: Old Concept, New Techniques  | last1=Deep | first1=Alex | date=2015-03-02 | website=[[Small Wars Journal]] | publisher=Small Wars Foundation | access-date=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A hybrid adversary uses a combination of conventional and irregular methods.'' Methods and tactics include [[Conventional warfare|conventional capabilities]], [[Irregular warfare|irregular tactics]], irregular formations, diplomacy, politics, [[Terrorism|terrorist acts]], indiscriminate violence, and criminal activity. A hybrid adversary also uses clandestine actions to avoid attribution or retribution. These methods are used simultaneously across the spectrum of conflict with a unified strategy.

=== Other definitions ===
[[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|The U.S. Army Chief of Staff]] defined a hybrid threat in 2008 as an adversary that incorporates "diverse and dynamic combinations of conventional, irregular, terrorist and criminal capabilities".&lt;ref name="hybrid_threat_concept" /&gt; [[United States Joint Forces Command|The United States Joint Forces Command]] defines a hybrid threat as, “any adversary that simultaneously and adaptively employs a tailored mix of conventional, irregular, terrorism and criminal means or activities in the operational battle space. Rather than a single entity, a hybrid threat or challenger may be a combination of state and nonstate actors".&lt;ref name="hybrid_threat_concept" /&gt; [[United States Army|The U.S. Army]] defined a hybrid threat in 2011 as "the diverse and dynamic combination of regular forces, irregular forces, criminal elements, or a combination of these forces and elements all unified to achieve mutually benefiting effects".&lt;ref name="hybrid_threat_concept" /&gt; [[NATO]] uses the term to describe "adversaries with the ability to simultaneously employ conventional and non-conventional means adaptively in pursuit of their objectives".&lt;ref name="SWJ_IS" /&gt; Former [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|U.S. Army Chief]] [[George W. Casey Jr.|Gen. George W. Casey]] talked of a new type of war that would become increasingly common in the future: "A hybrid of irregular warfare and conventional warfare."&lt;ref name="hybrid_wars" /&gt; According to the 2017-inaugurated [[European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats]], "[h]ybrid threats are methods and activities that are targeted towards vulnerabilities of the opponent" where the "range of methods and activities is wide."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hybridcoe.fi/hybrid-threats/|title=HYBRID THREATS - Hybrid CoE|work=Hybrid CoE|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
Traditional militaries find it hard to respond to hybrid warfare. Collective defense organizations such as [[NATO]] might find it hard to agree on the source of the conflict making response difficult. An article published in ''[[Global Security Review]]'' entitled "[https://globalsecurityreview.com/hybrid-and-non-linear-warfare-systematically-erases-the-divide-between-war-peace/ What is Hybrid Warfare?]," compares the notion of hybrid warfare to the Russian concept of "non-linear" warfare. It defines non-linear warfare as the deployment of "conventional and irregular military forces in conjunction with psychological, economic, political, and cyber assaults." The article partially attributes this difficulty to the "rigid" or static military taxonomy used by NATO to define the very concept of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stowell |first1=Joshua |title=What is Hybrid Warfare? |url=https://globalsecurityreview.com/hybrid-and-non-linear-warfare-systematically-erases-the-divide-between-war-peace/ |website=Global Security Review |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, to counter a hybrid threat, [[hard power]] is often insufficient. Often the conflict evolves under the radar and even a "rapid" response turns out to be too late. Overwhelming force is an insufficient deterrent. Many traditional militaries lack the flexibility to shift tactics, priorities, and objectives on a constant basis.&lt;ref name="SWJ_hybrid_war" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NATO_deterring" /&gt;

== History ==
The combination of conventional and irregular methods is not new and has been used throughout history. Some historians find the origins of the concept in the campaigns waged in ancient Hispania by the Iberian leader Virathus or the renegade general Sertorius against the forces of the Roman Republic in the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C. respectively. Elements of hybrid warfare are also seen in the concept of ''la petite guerre'' , a sort of reconnaissance in force practiced by light troops in European armies during the 17th and 18th centuries. A few examples of this type of combat are found in the [[American Revolution]] (a combination of [[Continental Army|Washington’s Continental Army]] with militia forces) and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (British regulars cooperated with Spanish guerrillas).&lt;ref name="Hoffman2"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Hoffman | first1=Frank | date=2007 | title=Conflict in the 21st Century: The Rise of Hybrid War | publisher=Potomac Institute for Policy Studies | publication-place=Arlington | pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can also find examples of hybrid warfare in smaller conflicts during the nineteenth century. For instance, between 1837 and 1840 [[Rafael Carrera]], a Conservative peasant rebel leader in Guatemala, waged a successful military campaign against the Liberals and the Federal government of Central America utilizing a strategy that combined classical guerrilla tactics with conventional operations. Carrera's hybrid approach to warfare gave him the edge over his numerically superior and better armed enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Visoni-Alonzo, G., ''The Carrera Revolt and "Hybrid Warfare" in Nineteenth Century Central America (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 2.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the [[Cold War]] created a unipolar system (with a preponderant [[United States|American]] military power) and though this has tempered traditional conflicts, regional conflicts and threats that leverage the weaknesses of conventional military structure are becoming more frequent.&lt;ref name="SWJ_hybrid_war" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SWJ_training"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/training-a-hybrid-warrior-at-the-infantry-officer-course | title=Training a "Hybrid" Warrior at the Infantry Officer Course  | authors=SWJ Editors | date=2008-01-27 | website=[[Small Wars Journal]] | publisher=Small Wars Foundation | access-date=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is also new is the sophistication and lethality of [[non-state actor]]s. These actors are well armed with technologically advanced weapons that are now available at low prices. Similarly, commercial technologies such as cell phones and digital networks are adapted to the battlefield.&lt;ref name="SWJ_IS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hybrid_wars" /&gt; Another new element is the ability of non-state actors to persist within the modern system.&lt;ref name="SWJ_hybrid_war" /&gt;

=== 2006 Israel–Hezbollah War ===
One of the most often quoted examples of a hybrid war is the [[2006 Lebanon War|2006 conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah]]. The [[Hezbollah]] is a sophisticated [[non-state actor]] sponsored by [[Iran]]. While the group often acts as a proxy for Iran, it has its own agenda. It was Hezbollah policy, rather than Iran’s, that led to the kidnapping of Israeli troops that was the impetus for the war.&lt;ref name="SWJ_hybrid_war" /&gt; The war featured about 3,000 Hezbollah fighters embedded in the local population attacked by about 30,000 Israeli regular troops.&lt;ref name="hybrid_wars" /&gt;

The group used decentralized cells composed of guerrillas and regular troops armed with weaponry that nation states use such as [[anti-tank missiles]], rockets, armed [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, and advanced [[improvised explosive device]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoffman3"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Hoffman | first1=Frank | date=2007 | title=Conflict in the 21st Century: The Rise of Hybrid War | publisher=Potomac Institute for Policy Studies | publication-place=Arlington | pages=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hezbollah cells downed Israeli helicopters, damaged [[Merkava|Merkava IV tanks]], communicated with encrypted cell phones, and monitored Israeli troops movements with night vision and thermal imaging devices. [[Quds Force|Iranian Quds Force]] operatives acted as mentors and suppliers of advanced systems.&lt;ref name="hybrid_wars" /&gt;

Hezbollah leveraged mass communication immediately distributing battlefield photos and videos dominating the perception battle throughout the conflict. Israel did not lose the war on the battlefield but lost the information battle as the overwhelming perception at the time was of Israeli defeat.&lt;ref name="Hoffman4"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Hoffman | first1=Frank | date=2007 | title=Conflict in the 21st Century: The Rise of Hybrid War | publisher=Potomac Institute for Policy Studies | publication-place=Arlington | pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014 ISIL advance into Iraq ===
The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) is a non-state actor utilizing hybrid tactics against the conventional Iraqi military. ISIL has transitional aspirations, and uses irregular and regular tactics and [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="SWJ_IS"/&gt; In response, the state of [[Iraq]] itself turned to hybrid tactics utilizing non-state and international actors to [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|counter the ISIL advance]]. The [[United States]] likewise is a hybrid participant through a combination of traditional air power, advisers to Iraqi government troops, [[Peshmerga|Kurdish peshmerga]], and sectarian militias, and training opposition forces within [[Syria]]. The Iraq–Syria hybrid war is a conflict with an interconnected group of state and non-state actors pursuing overlapping goals and a weak local state.&lt;ref name="Schroel_Kaufman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schroefl | first1=Joseph | last2=Kaufman | first2=Stuart | title=Hybrid Actors, Tactical Variety: Rethinking Asymmetric and Hybrid War | journal=Studies in Conflict and Terrorism | volume=37 | issue=10 | pages=863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian activities in the 2010s===
{{Further|Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russia–European Union relations#Allegations of Russian intimidation and destabilisation of EU states|Cyberwarfare by Russia}}
The Russian government′s wide use in conflicts such as [[Syrian Civil War|in Syria]] and in Ukraine, of private military contractors such as those of the [[Wagner Group]] was in 2018 singled out by experts as a key part of Russia's strategy of hybrid warfare to advance her interests, while obfuscating her involvement and role.&lt;ref name="bloombmattis"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-16/russia-attacked-u-s-troops-in-syria Don't Be Fooled: Russia Attacked U.S. Troops in Syria: Mattis gave Putin "plausible deniability" for a military assault that went badly awry.] Bloomberg, 16 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In respect of Russia, Michael Kofman, a senior research scientist at [[CNA (nonprofit)|CNA]] and a fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute, noted in March 2018 that the West′s frequent references to hybrid warfare was in effect "an unintelligible Western reaction, after decades of wars of choice against paltry adversaries, to confrontation with another power that is capable across the full spectrum of conflict".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43581449 Russia v the West: Is this a new Cold War?] BBC,  1 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia on US activities ===
Moscow has accused Washington of conducting hybrid warfare against Russia during the [[colour revolution]]s. Its perception of being at war or in a '[[Perpetual war|permanent state of conflict]]' with the US and its allies were furthered by the 2014 [[Euromaidan|Maidan uprising]] in Ukraine. Russia's activities in former Soviet states have been described as Hobbesian and redolent of Cold War thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thornton|first1=Rod|title=The Changing Nature of Modern Warfare|journal=The RUSI Journal|date=4 September 2015|volume=160|issue=4|pages=40–48|doi=10.1080/03071847.2015.1079047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at the [[Valdai Discussion Club]] in November 2014, Russian foreign minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/remarks_by_foreign_minister_sergey_lavrov_at_the_xxii_assembly_of_the_council_on_foreign_and_defence/ | title=REMARKS BY FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV AT THE XXII ASSEMBLY OF THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN AND DEFENCE POLICY | date=2014-11-25 | access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carden|first1=James|title=Russia and America's Dangerous Dance|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/russia-americas-dangerous-dance-11798|publisher=The National Interest|accessdate=19 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is an interesting term, but I would apply it above all to the United States and its war strategy – it is truly a hybrid war aimed not so much at defeating the enemy militarily as at changing the regimes in the states that pursue a policy Washington does not like. It is using financial and economic pressure, information attacks, using others on the perimeter of a corresponding state as proxies and of course information and ideological pressure through externally financed non-governmental organisations. Is it not a hybrid process and not what we call war?}}

===United States on Russian involvement with Middle-Eastern refugees ===

General [[Philip Breedlove]], in a US Senate hearing February 2016, claimed that Russia is using [[European migrant crisis|refugees]] to weaken Europe, directing the influx of refugees in the continent to destabilize areas and regions in terms of economy and to create social unrest. On 10 February 2016, Finnish Defence Minister [[Jussi Niinistö]] told a meeting of NATO Defence Ministers that Finland expects Russia to open a second front, where as many as 1 million migrants may arrive over the Finnish/Russian border. A similar statement was made by [[Ilkka Kanerva]], Finland's former foreign minister and now chairman of the country's parliamentary Defense Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/world/europe/for-migrants-into-europe-a-road-less-traveled.html | title=E.U.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16269">An '''ideograph''' or '''virtue word''' is a word frequently used in political discourse that uses an abstract concept to develop support for political positions. Such words are usually terms that do not have a clear definition but are used to give the impression of a clear meaning. An ideograph in rhetoric often exists as a building block or simply one term or short phrase that summarizes the orientation or attitude of an ideology. Such examples notably include &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[freedom]]&gt;, &lt;[[democracy]]&gt; and &lt;[[rights]]&gt;. Rhetorical critics use chevrons or angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) to mark off ideographs.

The term ideograph was coined by rhetorical scholar and critic [[Michael Calvin McGee]] (1980) describing the use of particular words and phrases as political language in a way that captures (as well as creates or reinforces) particular ideological positions.  McGee sees the ideograph as a way of understanding of how specific, concrete instances of political discourse relate to the more abstract idea of political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, J. (2001).  ''Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robertson defines ideographs as “political slogans or labels that encapsulate ideology in political discourse.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasinski|first=James|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|year=2001|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, [[Celeste Condit]] and [[John Lucaites]], influenced by McGee, explain, “Ideographs represent in condensed form the normative, collective commitments of the members of a public, and they typically appear in public argumentation as the necessary motivations or justifications for action performed in the name of the public.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condit &amp; Lucaites|first=C.M. &amp; J.L.|title=Crafting equality: America’s Anglo-African word|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=xxii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideographs are common in [[advertising]] and political discourse.

==Definition==
McGee uses the term in his seminal article “The ‘Ideograph’: A Link Between Rhetoric and Ideology” which appeared in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Speech]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref name=McGee&gt;McGee, M.C. (1980). The “ideograph”: A link between rhetoric and ideology. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 66'', 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; He begins his essay by defining the practice of [[ideology]] as practice of political language in specific contexts—actual discursive acts by individual speakers and writers. The question this raises is how does this practice of [[ideology]] create social control.

McGee’s answer to this is to say that “political language which manifests ideology seems characterized by slogans, a vocabulary of ‘ideographs’ easily mistaken for the technical terminology of [[political philosophy]].”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;  He goes on to offer his definition of “ideograph”:  “an ideograph is an ordinary-language term found in political discourse.  It is a high order abstraction representing commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal.”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;

An ideograph, then, is not just any particular word or phrase used in political discourse, but one of a particular subset of terms that are often invoked in political discourse but which does not have a clear, univocal definition.  Despite this, in their use, ideographs are often invoked precisely to give the sense of a clearly understood and shared meaning. This potency makes them the primary tools for shaping public decisions. It is in this role as the [[vocabulary]] for public values and decision-making that they are linked to [[ideology]].

== Examples ==
There is no absolute litmus test for what terms are or are not ideographs. Rather, this is a judgment that must be made through the study of specific examples of discourse. However, McGee (and others who have followed him) have identified several examples of ideographs or virtue words in Western liberal political discourse, such as &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[property]]&gt;, &lt;[[freedom of speech]]&gt;, &lt;[[religion]]&gt;, and &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt;. In each case, the term does not have a specific [[referent]].  Rather, each term refers to an [[abstraction]] which may have many different meanings depending on its [[context (language use)|context]].  It is in their mutability between circumstances that give the terms such rhetorical power.  If the definition of a term such as &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt; can be stretched to include a particular act or condition, then public support for that act or condition is likely to be stronger than it was previously.

By encapsulating values which are perceived to be widely shared by the community, but which are in fact highly abstract and defined in very different ways by individuals, ideographs provide a potent persuasive tool for the political speaker. McGee offers the example of [[Richard Nixon]]’s attempt to defend his decision not to turn over documents to Congress during the [[Watergate scandal]] by invoking “the principle of [[confidentiality]].” Recognizing that his refusal to submit to Congress could be seen as a violation of the "[[rule of law]]", Nixon pitted "the principle of [[confidentiality]]” against the “[[rule of law]],” despite the fact that these two ideographs would, in the abstract, not likely be seen as in conflict with one another.&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt; Nixon, in an attempt to expand the understanding of “the principle of [[confidentiality]]” to cover his own specific refusal to cooperate with Congress, used the abstractness of the term to his benefit, claiming that right to confidentiality was the more central term.&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;

While the term has remained mostly in this sphere of academic [[rhetorical criticism]], some [[political consulting|political consultants]] and practitioners are becoming savvy to this art.

Ideographs appear in [[advertising]] and [[political campaigns]] regularly, and are crucial to helping the public understand what is really being asked of them. For example, “[[Social equality|equality]]” is a term commonly used in political discourse and rarely defined. It can refer to a situation in which all people have the same opportunities, or a condition in which social resources are distributed uniformly to different individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasinski|first=James|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|year=2001|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is the more commonly used definition in US history, according to Condit &amp; Lucaites, although in a socialist or left-leaning political state, the term may refer foremost to the distribution of social resources. Condit and Lucaites depict the racial facet of equality as the dominant meaning in an American context of political discourse, since 1865.&lt;ref name="Condit &amp; Lucaites 1993 xvii"&gt;{{cite book|last=Condit &amp; Lucaites|first=C.M. &amp; J.L.|title=Crafting equality: America’s Anglo-African word|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important ideograph used specifically by U.S. presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks is &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt;. The term does not have a clear or specific definition, but when applied to the context in the fear-stricken country after the devastating attacks in 2001, this term held significant weight and meaning to Americans all across the country. Kelly Long explores Obama’s discourse on the &lt;[[War on Terror]]&gt; and states that “by developing an ideological justification for the conflicts that the United States was involved in at the time, Obama remedied much of the damage done by the Bush administration”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Kelly|title="Terrorism" in the Age of Obama: The Rhetorical Evolution of President Obama's Discourse on the "War on Terror"|journal=Undergraduate Review|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1|page=90|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/undergrad_rev/vol9/iss1/19|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama justified the &lt;[[War on Terror]]&gt; by addressing the nation and saying that in order to protect the &lt;[[rule of law]]&gt; and &lt;democratic values&gt;, we must fight against &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt;.  Obama used this term to his advantage and made &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt; appear to be a common enemy and fighting back was the common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Kelly|title="Terrorism" in the Age of Obama: The Rhetorical Evolution of President Obama's Discourse on the "War on Terror"|journal=Undergraduate Review|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1|page=91|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/undergrad_rev/vol9/iss1/19|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the ideograph unified the country creating a sense of identity for American citizens, “defining what the nation stands for and against. The term divides those who are civilized from those who are uncivilized, those who defend economic freedom from those who would attack America’s way of life and those who support democracy from those who would disrupt it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkler|first1=Carol|title=In the Name of Terrorism: Presidents on Political Violence in the Post-World War II Era|date=2006|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, New York|page=2|edition=SUNY series on the Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNXc1s_BKSoC&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;ots=YOlgZgkKFn&amp;dq=carol%20winkler%20in%20the%20name%20of%20terrorism&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=carol%20winkler%20in%20the%20name%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marouf Hasian discusses how key ideographs representative of a society’s commitments change over time, particularly in the name of &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt;, or &lt;[[privacy]]&gt; epitomized in [[eugenics]]. From the 1900s-1930s, Americans justified the restriction of reproductive rights based on medical, social, economic, and political considerations, but were appalled when the [[Nazis]] used some of the same arguments in their creation of the “perfect race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasian|first=M.A.|title=The rhetoric of eugenics in Anglo-American thought|year=1996|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While rhetorical critics identify these terms as ideographs, political leaders viewed each other’s terms as "[[glittering generalities]],” as Lincoln first identified his opponent's words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|title=Lincoln to Henry Pierce|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/pierce.htm|publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to practitioners, [[marketing|corporate marketing]] and [[political consulting]] use key terms in this way, concentrating on the [[image]] and [[brand management|branding]] of terms. For example, [[Frank Luntz]] tests audience reaction to certain words or phrases using dial technology, a mechanism which instantaneously shows moment by moment reactions to speeches or presentations. This research has been extremely beneficial to his clients, as they can utilize ideographs as "trigger words" in an [[advertising campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luntz|first=Frank|title=Words that work: It’s not what you say, it’s what people hear|year=2007|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
There are three primary ways in which the concept of the ideograph is important to rhetorical critics.  First, it suggests a way of studying political ideology using concrete instances of language use.  By showing how looking at specific uses of key words and phrases in political language reveal underlying ideological commitments, McGee offers a concrete method for understanding the highly abstract concept of ideology.

Second, the definition of the ideograph makes clear that the [[rhetoric|rhetorical study]] of a term is different from a legal, historical, or etymological study of a term. Unlike other perspectives that focus on how a term has changed over time, a rhetorical study of a term focuses on the forces involved in the creation of these meanings. In short, a rhetorical study of a term is the study of the use of that term in practice.

This leads to a third key aspect of what the concept of the ideograph offers to rhetorical critics.  McGee notes that the study of a term must not, and should not, be limited to its use in “formal discourse.” Instead, the critic is much more likely to gain a better understanding of an ideograph by looking at how it is used and depicted in movies, plays, and songs, as well as how it is presented in educational texts aimed at children.  This moves the study of ideology beyond the limits of social philosophy or even political discourse as traditionally conceived (i.e., “great speeches by great men”).

==Cultural variability==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"An ideograph is a culturally biased, abstract word or phrase drawn from ordinary language, which serves a constitutional value for a historically situated collectivity."&lt;ref name="Condit &amp; Lucaites 1993 xvii"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There exists a culturally-specific understanding in each culture about what an ideograph means. Ideographs in rhetoric are culturally specific but recur inter-culturally; meaning the understanding of one ideograph can be used and interpreted differently across cultures.  The idea may be different from culture to culture, but this doesn’t mean some aspects won’t be the same in one or more cultures.  Such as the concept of [[femininity]] that exists cross-culturally to define ideas about women, yet one can expect these ideas from culture to culture.

==Critical use==
At the end of his essay defining the ideograph, McGee says that
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
“A complete description of an ideology . . . will consist of (1) the isolation of a society’s ideographs, (2) the exposure and analysis of the [[Synchronic analysis|diachronic]] structure of every ideography, and (3) characterization of [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]] relationships among all the ideographs in a particular context.”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such an exhaustive study of any ideology has yet to materialize, but many scholars have made use of the ideograph as a tool of understanding both specific [[rhetorical situations]] as well as a broader scope of ideological history. As a teacher, McGee himself made use of the ideograph as a tool for structuring the study of the rise of liberalism in British public address, focusing on ideographs such as &lt;[[property]]&gt;, &lt;[[patriarchy]]&gt;, &lt;[[religion]]&gt;, &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;. Other scholars have made a study of specific uses of ideographs such as &lt;[[family values]]&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, D. L. (1998).  The rhetoric of &lt;family values&gt;: Scapegoating, utopia, and the privatization of social responsibility.  ''Western Journal of Communication, 62'', 387-419.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;[[Egalitarianism|equality]]&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Condit, C. M. &amp; Lucaites, J. L. (1993).  ''Crafting quality: America’s Anglo-African word''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have gone beyond the idea that an ideograph must be a verbal symbol and have expanded the notion to include [[photographs]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. L. &amp; Winkler, C. K. (1997). Representative forms and the visual ideograph: The Iwo Jima image in editorial cartoons.  ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 83'', 289-310.&lt;/ref&gt; and objects represented in [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. P. (1996).  The cigarette as representative ideograph in the debate over environmental tobacco smoke.  ''Communication Monographs, 64'', 47-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of '''individuation''', or '''''{{lang|la|principium individuationis}}''''',&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion |last=Reese |first=William L. |edition=1st |year=1980 |publisher=Humanities Press |location=Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey |isbn=0-391-00688-6 |pages=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the manner in which a thing is identified as distinguished from other things.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |editor1-last= Audi |editor1-first=Robert |edition= 2nd |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-63136-X |pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept appears in numerous fields and is encountered in works of [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[David Bohm]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Gilles Deleuze]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Smith, Henry Somers-Hall (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Deleuze'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manuel De Landa]].

==Usage==
The word ''individuation'' occurs with different meanings and connotations in different fields.

===In philosophy===
Philosophically, "individuation" expresses the general idea of how a thing is identified as an individual thing that "is not something else". This includes how an individual person is held to be distinct from other elements in the world and how a person is distinct from other persons.

===In Jungian psychology===
In [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]], also called [[analytical psychology]], individuation is the process in which the individual self develops out of an undifferentiated [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] – seen as a developmental [[Psyche (psychology)|psychic process]] during which innate elements of personality, the components of the immature [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], and the [[Experience (disambiguation)|experience]]s of the person's life become, if the process is more or less successful, integrated over time into a well-functioning whole.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
{{See also|Analytical psychology#Self-realization and neuroticism}}

===In the media industry===
The media industry has begun using the term ''individuation'' to denote new printing and online technologies that permit [[mass customization]] of the contents of a newspaper, a magazine, a broadcast program, or a website so that its contents match each individual user's unique interests. This differs from the traditional [[mass-media]] practice of producing the same contents for all readers, viewers, listeners, or online users.

Communications theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]] alluded to this trend{{qn|date=June 2015}} when discussing{{when|date=June 2015}} the future of printed books in an electronically interconnected world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UUMoGmujREwC&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;ots=2C5ZRF6d1W&amp;dq=mcluhan%20packaged%20information%20services&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false alluded to this trend], books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===In physics===
Two [[quantum entanglement|quantum entangled]] particles cannot be understood independently. Two or more states in [[quantum superposition]], e.g., as in [[Schrödinger's cat]] being simultaneously dead and alive, is mathematically not the same as assuming the cat is in an individual alive state with 50% probability. The [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] says that [[Complementarity (physics)|complementary variables]], such as [[Position (vector)|position]] and [[momentum]], cannot both be precisely known - in some sense, they are not individual variables. A ''natural criterion of individuality'' has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=Individuation in Quantum Mechanics|journal=Foundations of Physics|date=2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=299–304|doi=10.1007/s10701-009-9382-x|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-009-9382-x|bibcode=2011FoPh...41..299J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arthur Schopenhauer==

For Schopenhauer the principium individuationis constituted of time and space, being the ground of multiplicity. In his view, the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different, with each of the two states having its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other. 

This view influenced [[Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Howard|first=Don A.|title=Albert Einstein as a Philosopher of Science|date=December 2005|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~dhoward1/vol58no12p34_40.pdf|journal=Physics Today|volume=58|issue=12|pages=34–40|publisher=American Institute of Physics|format=PDF|bibcode=2005PhT....58l..34H|doi=10.1063/1.2169442|accessdate=2015-03-08|via=University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, author's personal webpage|quote=From Schopenhauer he had learned to regard the independence of spatially separated systems as, virtually, a necessary a priori assumption ... Einstein regarded his separation principle, descended from Schopenhauer's ''principium individuationis'', as virtually an axiom for any future fundamental physics. ... Schopenhauer stressed the essential structuring role of space and time in individuating physical systems and their evolving states. This view implies that difference of location suffices to make two systems different in the sense that each has its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other. For Schopenhauer, the mutual independence of spatially separated systems was a necessary a priori truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schrödinger]] put the Schopenhaurian label on a folder of papers in his files “Collection of Thoughts on the physical Principium individuationis.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cosmos of Science: Essays of Exploration|last=John Earman, John D. Norton|first=|publisher=Univ of Pittsburgh Pr|year=1997|isbn=0822939304|location=|pages=131|quote=Schrödinger's biographer, Walter Moore, details the lifelong influence of Schopenhauer on Schrödinger ... or the Schopenhauerian label that Schrödinger put on one folder of papers in his files: "Sammlung der Gedanken über das physikalische Principium individuationis".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carl Jung==
{{Main|Carl Jung}}
According to [[Jungian psychology]], individuation ({{lang-de|Individuation}}) is a process of psychological integration. "In general, it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated [from other human beings]; in particular, it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general, collective psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G.  ''Psychological Types''.  Collected Works, vol. 6, par. 757.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and [[collective unconscious]] are brought into consciousness (e.g., by means of dreams, [[active imagination]], or [[Free association (psychology)|free association]]) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche.&lt;ref name="jung1"&gt;Jung, C.G. (1962). ''Symbols of Transformation: An Analysis of the Prelude to a Case of Schizophrenia'' (vol. 2). New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuation has a [[Holistic health|holistic healing]] effect on the person, both mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="jung1"/&gt;

In addition to [[Complex (psychology)|Jung's theory of complexes]], his theory of the individuation process forms conceptions of an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] filled with mythic images, a non-sexual [[libido]], the general types of [[extraversion and introversion]], the compensatory and prospective functions of [[dream]]s, and the synthetic and constructive approaches to fantasy formation and utilization.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. (Shamdasani, S). (2009). ''The Red Book'', p. 208, par. 3. Verona, Italy: Mondadori Printing.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The symbols of the individuation process . . . mark its stages like milestones, prominent among them for Jungians being the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]], the [[wise old man]] . . . and lastly [[Anima and animus|the anima in man and the animus]] in woman."&lt;ref&gt;Jung quoted in J. Jacobi, ''Complex, Archetype, Symbol'' (London 1959) p. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "There is often a movement from dealing with the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] at the start . . . to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] at the second stage, to the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] as the third stage, to the anima or animus, to the [[Self]] as the final stage. Some would interpose the [[Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman|Wise Old Man and the Wise Old Woman]] as spiritual archetypes coming before the final step of the [[Self]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, John, ''Subpersonalities'' (London 1990) p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gilbert Simondon==
{{Main|Gilbert Simondon}}
In ''L'individuation psychique et collective'', Gilbert Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending [[Process philosophy|ontological process]] of individuation.

Simondon also conceived of "pre-individual fields" which make individuation possible. Individuation is an ever-incomplete process, always leaving a "pre-individual" left over, which makes possible future individuations. Furthermore, individuation always creates both an individual subject and a collective subject, which individuate themselves concurrently.

==Bernard Stiegler==
{{Main|Bernard Stiegler}}
The philosophy of Bernard Stiegler draws upon and modifies the work of [[Gilbert Simondon]] on individuation and also upon similar ideas in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. During a talk given at the [[Tate Modern]] art gallery in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/bernard-stiegler-culture-and-technology Bernard Stiegler: Culture and Technology], tate.org.uk, 13 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Stiegler summarized his understanding of individuation. The essential points are the following:

*The ''I'', as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to ''we'', which is a collective individual. The ''I'' is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of ''I''&amp;nbsp;’s acknowledge each other’s existence.
*This inheritance is an adoption, in that I can very well, as the French grandson of a German immigrant, recognize myself in a past which was not the past of my ancestors but which I can make my own. This process of adoption is thus structurally factual.
*The ''I'' is essentially a process, not a state, and this process is an in-dividuation — it is a process of psychic individuation. It is the tendency to ''become one'', that is, to become indivisible.
*This tendency never accomplishes itself because it runs into a counter-tendency with which it forms a [[Metastability|metastable equilibrium]]. (It must be pointed out how closely this conception of the dynamic of individuation is to the Freudian [[Drive theory#Psychoanalysis|theory of drives]] and to the thinking of [[Nietzsche]] and [[Empedocles]].)
*The ''we'' is also such a process (the process of collective individuation). The individuation of the ''I'' is always inscribed in that of the ''we'', whereas the individuation of the ''we'' takes place only through the individuations, polemical in nature, of the ''I''&amp;nbsp;’s which constitute it.
*That which links the individuations of the ''I'' and the ''we'' is a pre-individual system possessing positive conditions of effectiveness that  belong to what Stiegler calls retentional apparatuses. These retentional apparatuses arise from a technical system which is the condition of the encounter of the ''I'' and the ''we'' — the individuation of the ''I'' and the ''we'' is in this respect also the individuation of the technical system.
*The technical system is an apparatus which has a specific role wherein all objects are inserted — a technical object exists only insofar as it is disposed within such an apparatus with other technical objects (this is what [[Gilbert Simondon]] calls the technical group).
*The technical system is also that which founds the possibility of the constitution of retentional apparatuses, springing from the processes of [[Grammar|grammatization]] growing out of the process of individuation of the technical system. And these retentional apparatuses are the basis for the dispositions between the individuation of the ''I'' and the individuation of the ''we'' in a single process of psychic, collective, and technical individuation composed of three branches, each branching out into process groups.
*This process of triple individuation is itself inscribed within a vital individuation which must be apprehended as
**the vital individuation of natural organs,
**the technological individuation of artificial organs,
**and the psycho-social individuation of organizations linking them together.
*In the process of individuation, wherein knowledge as such emerges, there are individuations of mnemo-technological subsystems which overdetermine, ''qua'' specific organizations of what Stiegler calls tertiary retentions, the organization, transmission, and elaboration of knowledge stemming from the experience of the sensible.

'''Intertidal ecology''' is the study of [[intertidal zone|intertidal]] [[ecosystem]]s, where organisms live between the low and high [[tide]] lines. At low tide, the intertidal is exposed whereas at high tide, the intertidal is underwater. Intertidal [[ecologist]]s therefore study the interactions between intertidal organisms and their environment, as well as between [[biological interaction|different species]] of intertidal organisms within a particular intertidal community. The most important environmental and species interactions may vary based on the type of intertidal community being studied, the broadest of classifications being based on substrates—[[rocky shore]] and soft bottom communities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intertidal Ecology|last=Raffaelli|first=David|last2=Hawkins|first2=Stephen J.|publisher=Springer|year=1996|isbn=978-0-412-29950-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tomanek|first=Lars|last2=Helmuth|first2=Brian|date=|title=Physiological Ecology of Rocky Intertidal Organisms: A Synergy of Concepts|url=https://www.calpoly.edu/~ltomanek/PDF%20files/ICB%202002%20Intro.pdf|journal=[[Integrative and Comparative Biology]]|publication-date=August 2002|volume=42|issue=4|pages=771–775|doi=10.1093/icb/42.4.771|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms living in this zone have a highly variable and often hostile environment, and have evolved various [[adaptation]]s to cope with and even exploit these conditions. One easily visible feature of intertidal communities is [[vertical zonation]], where the community is divided into distinct vertical bands of specific species going up the shore. Species ability to cope with [[Abiotic stress|abiotic factors]] associated with emersion stress, such as [[desiccation]] determines their upper limits, while [[Biotic component|biotic]] interactions e.g.[[competition (biology)|competition]] with other species sets their lower limits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Intertidal regions are [[Exploitation of natural resources|utilized]] by humans for food and recreation, but anthropogenic actions also have major impacts, with [[overexploitation]], [[invasive species]] and [[global warming|climate change]] being among the problems faced by intertidal communities. In some places [[Marine Protected Area]]s have been established to protect these areas and aid in [[scientific research]].&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences.

==Types of intertidal communities==
Intertidal habitats can be characterized as having either hard or soft bottoms substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugan|first=Jenifer E.|last2=Hubbard|first2=David M.|last3=Quigley|first3=Brenna J.|date=|title=Beyond beach width: Steps toward identifying and integrating ecological envelopes with geomorphic features and datums for sandy beach ecosystems|url=|journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]]|publication-date=October 2013|volume=199|pages=95–105|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.04.043|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocky intertidal communities occur on [[rocky shore]]s, such as [[headland]]s, cobble [[beach]]es, or human-made [[jetty|jetties]]. Their degree of exposure may be calculated using the [[Ballantine Scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballantine, W.J. (1961). "A Biologically-defined Exposure Scale for the Comparative Description of Rocky Shores".

These habitats differ in levels of [[abiotic]], or non-living, environmental factors. Rocky shores tend to have higher wave action, requiring adaptations allowing the inhabitants to cling tightly to the rocks. Soft-bottom habitats are generally protected from large waves but tend to have more variable [[salinity]] levels. They also offer a third habitable dimension: depth. Thus, many soft-sediment inhabitants are adapted for burrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banks|first=Simon A.|last2=Skilleter|first2=Greg A.|date=|year=2002|title=Mapping intertidal habitats and an evaluation of their conservation status in Queensland, Australia|url=|journal=Ocean &amp; Coastal Management|volume=45|issue=8|pages=485–509|doi=10.1016/S0964-5691(02)00082-0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelleher, Graeme; Bleakley, Chris; Wells, Sue C.

==Environment==
[[Image:Intertide zonation at Kalaloch.jpg|thumb|upright|A rock, seen at low tide, exhibiting typical intertidal zonation.]]
Because intertidal organisms endure regular periods of immersion and emersion, they essentially live both underwater and on land and must be adapted to a large range of climatic conditions. The intensity of climate stressors varies with relative tide height because organisms living in areas with higher tide heights are emersed for longer periods than those living in areas with lower tide heights. This gradient of climate with tide height leads to patterns of [[intertidal|intertidal zonation]], with high intertidal species being more adapted to emersion stresses than low intertidal species. These adaptations may be behavioral (i.e. movements or actions), morphological (i.e. characteristics of external body structure), or physiological (i.e. internal functions of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Somero|first=George N.|date=|year=2002|title=Thermal Physiology and Vertical Zonation of Intertidal Animals: Optima, Limits, and Costs of Living|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.555.2223&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=[[Integrative and Comparative Biology]]|volume=42|issue=4|pages=780–789|doi=10.1093/icb/42.4.780|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, such adaptations generally cost the organism in terms of energy (e.g. to move or to grow certain structures), leading to trade-offs (i.e. spending more energy on deterring predators leaves less energy for other functions like reproduction).

Intertidal organisms, especially those in the high intertidal, must cope with a large range of [[temperatures]]. While they are underwater, temperatures may only vary by a few degrees over the year. However, at low tide, temperatures may dip to below freezing or may become scaldingly hot, leading to a temperature range that may approach 30&amp;nbsp;°C (86&amp;nbsp;°F) during a period of a few hours. Many mobile organisms, such as snails and crabs, avoid temperature fluctuations by crawling around and searching for food at high tide and hiding in cool, moist refuges (crevices or burrows) at low tide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burnaford|first=Jennifer L.|date=|title=Habitat modification and refuge from sublethal stress drive a marine plant-herbivore association|url=|journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]|publication-date=October 2004|volume=85|issue=10|pages=2837–2849|doi=10.1890/03-0113|jstor=3450442|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides simply living at lower tide heights, non-motile organisms may be more dependent on coping mechanisms. For example, high intertidal organisms have a stronger stress response, a physiological response of making proteins that help recovery from temperature stress just as the immune response aids in the recovery from infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Between Pacific Tides]]|last=Ricketts|first=Edward F.|last2=Calvin|first2=Jack|last3=Hedgpeth|first3=Joel W.|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=1992|isbn=|edition=Fifth|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intertidal organisms are also especially prone to [[desiccation]] during periods of emersion. Again, mobile organisms avoid desiccation in the same way as they avoid extreme temperatures: by hunkering down in mild and moist refuges. Many intertidal organisms, including ''Littorina'' snails, prevent water loss by having waterproof outer surfaces, pulling completely into their shells, and sealing shut their shell opening. [[Limpets]] (''Patella'') do not use such a sealing plate but occupy a home-scar to which they seal the lower edge of their flattened conical shell using a grinding action. They return to this home-scar after each grazing excursion, typically just before emersion. On soft rocks, these scars are quite obvious. Still other organisms, such as the algae ''Ulva'' and ''Porphyra'', are able to rehydrate and recover after periods of severe desiccation.

The level of [[salinity]] can also be quite variable. Low salinities can be caused by rainwater or river inputs of freshwater. Estuarine species must be especially [[euryhaline]], or able to tolerate a wide range of salinities. High salinities occur in locations with high evaporation rates, such as in salt marshes and high intertidal pools. Shading by plants, especially in the salt marsh, can slow evaporation and thus ameliorate salinity stress. In addition, salt marsh plants tolerate high salinities by several physiological mechanisms, including excreting salt through salt glands and preventing salt uptake into the roots.

In addition to these exposure stresses (temperature, desiccation, and salinity), intertidal organisms experience strong mechanical stresses, especially in locations of high [[wave|wave action]]. There are myriad ways in which the organisms prevent dislodgement due to waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Egbert G., Jr.|last2=Paine|first2=Robert T.|author-link2=Robert T. Paine (zoologist)|last3=Quinn|first3=James F.|last4=Suchanek|first4=Thomas H.|date=|title=Wave energy and intertidal productivity|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/84/5/1314.full.pdf|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|publication-date=March 1987|volume=84|issue=5|pages=1314–1318|doi=10.1073/pnas.84.5.1314|osti=6128805|via=|pmc=304418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morphologically, many mollusks (such as limpets and chitons) have low-profile, hydrodynamic shells. Types of substrate attachments include mussels' tethering byssal threads and glues, [[sea stars]]' thousands of suctioning tube feet, and isopods' hook-like appendages that help them hold on to intertidal kelps. Higher profile organisms, such as kelps, must also avoid breaking in high flow locations, and they do so with their strength and flexibility. Finally, organisms can also avoid high flow environments, such as by seeking out low flow microhabitats. Additional forms of mechanical stresses include ice and sand scour, as well as dislodgment by water-borne rocks, logs, etc.

For each of these climate stresses, species exist that are adapted to and thrive in the most stressful of locations. For example, the tiny crustacean copepod ''Tigriopus'' thrives in very salty, high intertidal tidepools, and many [[filter feeders]] find more to eat in wavier and higher flow locations. Adapting to such challenging environments gives these species competitive edges in such locations.

==Food web structure==
[[Image:Barnacles.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Semibalanus balanoides]]'']]
During tidal immersion, the food supply to intertidal organisms is subsidized by materials carried in seawater, including [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] [[phytoplankton]] and consumer [[zooplankton]]. These [[plankton]] are eaten by numerous forms of [[filter feeders]]—[[mussels]], [[clams]], [[barnacles]], [[sea squirts]], and [[polychaete]] worms—which filter seawater in their search for planktonic food sources.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paine|first=Robert T.|author-link=Robert T. Paine (zoologist)|date=|title=Food Web Complexity and Species Diversity|url=https://www.cornellcollege.edu/geology/courses/Greenstein/Paleoecology/readings/Paine1966.pdf|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|publication-date=January–February 1966|volume=100|issue=910|pages=65–75|doi=10.1086/282400|jstor=2459379|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjacent ocean is also a primary source of nutrients for [[autotrophs]], photosynthesizing producers ranging in size from microscopic [[algae]] (e.g. benthic [[diatoms]]) to huge [[kelp]]s and other [[seaweeds]]. These intertidal producers are eaten by herbivorous grazers, such as [[limpets]] that scrape rocks clean of their diatom layer and kelp [[crabs]] that creep along blades of the feather boa kelp ''Egregia'' eating the tiny leaf-shaped bladelets. Crabs are eaten by [[Atlantic goliath grouper|goliath grouper]], which are then eaten by sharks. Higher up the [[food web]], [[Predation|predatory]] consumers—especially voracious [[starfish]]—eat other grazers (e.g. [[snails]]) and filter feeders (e.g. [[mussels]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trussell|first=Geoffrey C.|last2=Ewanchuk|first2=Patrick J.|last3=Bertness|first3=Mark D.|author-link3=Mark Bertness|date=|title=Field evidence of trait-mediated indirect interactions in a rocky intertidal food web|url=http://bio.classes.ucsc.edu/bioe200b/pdf%20files/Trussell%20&amp;%20Bertness_TMI_02.pdf|journal=[[Ecology Letters]]|publication-date=March 2002|volume=5|issue=2|pages=241–245|doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00304.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[scavenger]]s, including crabs and [[amphipoda|sand fleas]], eat dead organic material, including dead producers and consumers.

==Species interactions==
[[Image:Tide pools in santa cruz.jpg|thumb|Tide pools with sea stars and [[sea anemone]] in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[California]]]]
In addition to being shaped by aspects of climate, intertidal habitats—especially intertidal zonation patterns—are strongly influenced by species interactions, such as predation, competition, facilitation, and indirect interactions. Ultimately, these interactions feed into the food web structure, described above. Intertidal habitats have been a model system for many classic ecological studies, including those introduced below, because the resident communities are particularly amenable to experimentation.

One dogma of intertidal ecology—supported by such classic studies—is that species' lower tide height limits are set by species interactions whereas their upper limits are set by climate variables. Classic studies by [[Robert T. Paine (zoologist)|Robert Paine]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paine|first=R.T.|author-link=Robert T. Paine (zoologist)|date=|title=Intertidal Community Structure: Experimental Studies on the Relationship between a Dominant Competitor and Its Principal Predator|url=|journal=[[Oecologia]]|publication-date=June 1974|volume=15|issue=2|pages=93–120|doi=10.1007/BF00345739|jstor=4214949|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; established that when sea star predators are removed, mussel beds extend to lower tide heights, smothering resident seaweeds. Thus, mussels' lower limits are set by sea star predation. Conversely, in the presence of sea stars, mussels' lower limits occur at a tide height at which sea stars are unable to tolerate climate conditions.

Competition, especially for space, is another dominant interaction structuring intertidal communities. Space competition is especially fierce in rocky intertidal habitats, where habitable space is limited compared to soft-sediment habitats in which three-dimensional space is available. As seen with the previous sea star example, mussels are competitively dominant when they are not kept in check by sea star predation. [[Joseph Connell]]'s research on two types of high intertidal barnacles, ''Balanus balanoides'', now ''Semibalanus balanoides'', and a ''Chthamalus stellatus'', showed that zonation patterns could also be set by competition between closely related organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connell|first=Joseph H.|author-link=Joseph H. Connell|date=|title=The Influence of Interspecific Competition and Other Factors on the Distribution of the Barnacle ''Chthamalus stellatus''|url=http://faculty.fiu.edu/~trexlerj/Advanced_Ecology/Connell_1961.pdf|journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]|publication-date=October 1961|volume=42|issue=4|pages=710–723|doi=10.2307/1933500|jstor=1933500|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, ''Balanus'' outcompetes ''Chthamalus'' at lower tide heights but is unable to survive at higher tide heights. Thus, ''Balanus'' conforms to the intertidal ecology dogma introduced above: its lower tide height limit is set by a predatory snail and its higher tide height limit is set by climate. Similarly, ''Chthamalus'', which occurs in a refuge from competition (similar to the temperature refuges discussed above), has a lower tide height limit set by competition with ''Balanus'' and a higher tide height limit is set by climate.

Although intertidal ecology has traditionally focused on these negative interactions (predation and competition), there is emerging evidence that positive interactions are also important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruno|first=John F.|last2=Stachowicz|first2=John J.|last3=Berntess|first3=Mark D.|author-link3=Mark Bertness|date=|title=Inclusion of facilitation into ecological theory|url=http://www.bertnesslab.com/docs/labpublications/Bruno%20et%20al%202003.pdf|journal=[[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]]|publication-date=March 2003|volume=18|issue=3|pages=119–125|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)00045-9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Facilitation'' refers to one organism helping another without harming itself. For example, salt marsh plant species of ''Juncus'' and ''Iva'' are unable to tolerate the high soil salinities when evaporation rates are high, thus they depend on neighboring plants to shade the sediment, slow evaporation, and help maintain tolerable salinity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bertness|first=Mark D.|author-link=Mark Bertness|last2=Hacker|first2=Sally D.|date=|title=Physical Stress and Positive Associations Among Marsh Plants|url=|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|publication-date=September 1994|volume=144|issue=3|pages=363–372|doi=10.1086/285681|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In similar examples, many intertidal organisms provide physical structures that are used as refuges by other organisms. Mussels, although they are tough competitors with certain species, are also good facilitators as mussel beds provide a three-dimensional habitat to species of snails, worms, and crustaceans.

All of the examples given so far are of direct interactions: Species A eat Species B or Species B eats Species C. Also important are indirect interactions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menge|first=Bruce A.|author-link=Bruce A. Menge|date=|year=February 1995|title=Indirect Effects in Marine Rocky Intertidal Interaction Webs: Patterns and Importance|url=|journal=[[Ecological Monographs]]|volume=65|issue=1|pages=21–74|doi=10.2307/2937158|jstor=2937158|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, using the previous example, Species A eats so much of Species B that predation on Species C decreases and Species C increases in number. Thus, Species A indirectly benefits Species C. Pathways of indirect interactions can include all other forms of species interactions. To follow the sea star-mussel relationship, sea stars have an indirect negative effect on the diverse community that lives in the mussel bed because, by preying on mussels and decreasing mussel bed structure, those species that are facilitated by mussels are left homeless.
Additional important species interactions include [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], which is seen in symbioses between sea anemones and their internal symbiotic algae, and [[parasitism]], which is prevalent but is only beginning to be appreciated for its effects on community structure.

==Current topics==
Humans are highly dependent on intertidal habitats for food and raw materials,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harley|first=Christopher D.G.|last2=Hughes|first2=A. Randall|last3=Hultgren|first3=Kristin M.|last4=Miner|first4=Benjamin G.|last5=Sorte|first5=Cascade J.B.|last6=Thornber|first6=Carol S.|last7=Rodriguez|first7=Laura F.|last8=Tomanek|first8=Lars|last9=Williams|first9=Susan L.|displayauthors=1|date=|title=The impacts of climate change in coastal marine systems|url=|journal=[[Ecology Letters]]|publication-date=January 2006|volume=9|issue=2|pages=228–241|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00871.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 50% of humans live within 100&amp;nbsp;km of the coast. Therefore, intertidal habitats are greatly influenced by human impacts to both ocean and land habitats. Some of the conservation issues associated with intertidal habitats and at the head of the agendas of managers and intertidal ecologists are:

1. '''[[Climate change]]''': Intertidal species are challenged by several of the effects of global climate change, including increased temperatures, [[sea level rise]], and increased storminess. Ultimately, it has been predicted that the distributions and numbers of species will shift depending on their abilities to adapt (quickly!) to these new environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Due to the global scale of this issue, scientists are mainly working to understand and predict possible changes to intertidal habitats.

2. '''[[Invasive species]]''': Invasive species are especially prevalent in intertidal areas with high volumes of shipping traffic, such as large estuaries, because of the transport of non-native species in [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Andrew N.|last2=Carlton|first2=James T.|date=|title=Accelerating Invasion Rate in a Highly Invaded Estuary|url=http://online.sfsu.edu/modelds/Files/References/CohenCarlton1998Science.pdf|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|publication-date=January 23, 1998|volume=279|issue=5350|pages=555–558|doi=10.1126/science.279.5350.555|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Francisco Bay]], in which an invasive ''[[Spartina]]'' cordgrass from the east coast is currently transforming mudflat communities into ''Spartina'' meadows, is among the most invaded estuaries in the world. Conservation efforts are focused on trying to eradicate some species (like ''Spartina'') in their non-native habitats as well as preventing further species introductions (e.g. by controlling methods of ballast water uptake and release).

3. '''[[Marine protected areas]]''': Many intertidal areas are lightly to heavily exploited by humans for food gathering (e.g. clam digging in soft-sediment habitats and snail, mussel, and algal collecting in rocky intertidal habitats). In some locations, marine protected areas have been established where no collecting is permitted. The benefits of protected areas may spill over to positively impact adjacent unprotected areas. For example, a greater number of larger egg capsules of the edible snail ''Concholepus'' in protected vs. non-protected areas in Chile indicates that these protected areas may help replenish snail stocks in areas open to harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manríquez|first=Patricio H.|last2=Castilla|first2=Juan Carlos|date=|year=2001|title=Significance of marine protected areas in central Chile as seeding grounds for the gastropod ''Concholepas concholepas''|url=https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/215/m215p201.pdf|journal=[[Marine Ecology Progress Series]]|volume=215|pages=201–211|doi=10.3354/meps215201|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which collecting is regulated by law differs with the species and habitat.

'''Josephine Louise Miles''' (June 11, 1911 – May 12, 1985) was an [[United States|American]] poet and literary critic; the first woman [[tenure]]d in the [[English studies|English Department]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="CaliSphere" /&gt; She wrote over a dozen books of poetry and several works of criticism.

Miles was born in Chicago, in 1911. When she was young, her family moved to Southern California.&lt;ref name="CaliSphere" /&gt; Due to disabling arthritis, she was educated at home by tutors, but was able to graduate from Los Angeles High School in a class that included the composer [[John Cage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www26.us.archive.org/stream/poetryjosephine00milerich/poetryjosephine00milerich_djvu.txt | title=Interview conducted at the Josephine Miles house 1977-1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miles attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where she earned a bachelor's degree in English literature before moving to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to pursue a doctorate. She received a Fellowship from the [[American Association of University Women]] in 1939. Her dissertation work on Wordsworth led to ''Wordsworth and the Vocabulary of Emotion'', published in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wordsworth and the vocabulary of emotion|last=Miles|first=Josephine|date=1976|publisher=Octagon Books|isbn=978-0-374-95681-3|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her early career, Miles became a foundational scholar of quantitative and computational methods in the humanities.&lt;ref name=SearchReplace&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 3| issue = 1| title = Search and Replace: Josephine Miles and the Origins of Distant Reading| journal = Modernism / Modernity Print+| accessdate = 2018-08-17| date = 2018-04-11| url = https://modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/search-and-replace}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s and 1940s, she conducted [[distant reading]] research projects, first on "the adjectives favored by Romantic poets" and second on "the phrasal forms of the poetry of the 1640s, 1740s, and 1840s."&lt;ref name=SearchReplace /&gt; In the 1950s, she became director of project creating a Concordance to the Poetical Works of John Dryden. The project had previously been based in index cards, but Miles worked with the Electrical Engineering department at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] to complete the concordance used punched cards and card-reading computers. After six years of work by a team including Miles, female graduate students, and female punch card operators, the concordance with published.&lt;ref name=SearchReplace /&gt; Rachel Sagner Buurma and Laura Heffernan describe this as "possibly the first literary concordance to use machine methods"; it was published seventeen years before the first volume of [[Roberto Busa]]'s ''[[Index Thomisticus]]'', a work widely credited with this first.&lt;ref name=SearchReplace /&gt;

In 1964, she was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter M|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterM.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained in Berkeley for the rest of her life, receiving many highly coveted fellowships and awards until her death in May 1985. She was the first woman to receive tenure in the English Department at Berkeley and, at the time of her death, held the position of University Professor—one of the rarest and most prestigious honors in academic life.&lt;ref name="CaliSphere" /&gt;

She was fascinated with [[Beat generation|Beat]] poetry, and was both a host and critic to many Beat poets from her chair at Berkeley. Most notably, she helped [[Allen Ginsberg]] publish ''Howl'' by recommending it to [[Richard Eberhart]], who published an article in the ''New York Times'' praising the poem. In 1974, she founded the internationally distributed ''[[Berkeley Poetry Review]]'' on the U.C. Berkeley campus.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite news | author=Knight, Brenda, ed. | title=Josephine Miles - Women of the Beat Generation | work=Biography | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnjTmEsXJwcC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;ots=aDIqJ666Q6&amp;dq=Josephine%20miles%20women%20of%20the%20beat&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=Josephine%20miles%20women%20of%20the%20beat&amp;f=false |  accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miles mentored many young poets, including [[Jack Spicer]], [[Robin Blaser]], [[Diane Wakoski]], [[Diana O'Hehir]],  [[William Stafford (poet)|William Stafford]], and [[A.

Ammons]].&lt;ref name="CaliSphere"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Calisphere, University of California | title=Josephine Miles, English: Berkeley | url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4d5nb20m&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00112&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id= | accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to her lifelong disability, [[Thom Gunn]] recollected that “The unavoidable first fact about Josephine Miles was physical. As a young child she contracted a form of degenerative arthritis so severe that it left her limbs deformed and crippled. As a result, she could not be left alone in a house, she could not handle a mug...she could not use a typewriter; and she could neither walk nor operate a wheelchair.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Thom | last=Gunn | title=In Memoriam: Josephine Miles | publisher=''California Monthly'' 95:6:29 | date=June–July 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Miles bequeathed her Berkeley home to the University of California, which offers the house for use by the visiting Roberta C. Holloway Lecturer in the Practice of Poetry.

The [[PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award]] was established in her honor to recognize achievement in multicultural literature.

In [[natural language processing]], [[linguistics]], and neighboring fields, '''Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD)''' describes a method and an interdisciplinary community concerned with creating, sharing and (re-)using language resources in accordance with [[Linked Data]] principles. The '''Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud''' was conceived and is maintained by the [http://linguistics.okfn.org/  Open Linguistics Working Group (OWLG)] of the [[Open Knowledge|Open Knowledge Foundation]], but has been a point of focal activity for several [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] community groups, research projects and infrastructure efforts since then.

== Linguistic Linked Open Data ==
[[File:LLOD-Cloud-2016-05-24.png|thumb|LLOD Cloud (2016-05-24)]]
Linguistic Linked Open Data is a movement about publishing data for linguistics and natural language processing using the following principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Open Linguistics Working Group|title=Linguistic LOD|url=http://linguistic-lod.org/|website=linguistic-lod.org|publisher=LIDER project|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Data should be openly licensed using licenses such as the [[Creative Commons]] licenses.
* The elements in a dataset should be uniquely identified by means of a [[URI]].
* The URI should resolve, so users can access more information using web browsers.
* Resolving an LLOD resource should return results using [[web standards]] such as [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF).
* [[Hyperlink|Links]] to other resources should be included to help users discover new resources and provide semantics.

The primary benefits of LLOD have been identified as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chiarcos|first1=Christian|last2=McCrae|first2=John|last3=Cimiano|first3=Philipp|last4=Fellbaum|first4=Christiane|title=Towards open data for linguistics: Lexical Linked Data|date=2013|publisher=In: Alessandro Oltramari, Piek Vossen, Lu Qin, and Eduard Hovy (eds.), New Trends of Research in Ontologies and Lexical Resources. Springer|location=Heidelberg|url=https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642317811-c1.pdf|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Representation: [[Linked graph]]s are a more flexible representation format for linguistic data.
* Interoperability: Common RDF models can easily be integrated.
* Federation: Data from multiple sources can trivially be combined.
* Ecosystem: Tools for RDF and linked data are widely available under open source licenses.
* Expressivity: Existing vocabularies help express linguistic resources.
* Semantics: Common links express what you mean.
* Dynamicity: Web data can be continuously improved.

=== Uses of LLOD ===
Linguistic Linked Open Data was applied to address a number of scientific research problems: 
* In all areas of empirical linguistics, [[computational philology]] and [[natural language processing]], linguistic annotation and linguistic markup represent central elements of analysis. However, progress in this field is being hampered by [[Interoperability|interoperability challenges]], most notably differences in vocabularies and annotation schemes used for different resources and tools. Using Linked Data to connect language resources and ontologies/terminology repositories facilitates re-using shared vocabularies and interpreting them against a common basis.
* In [[corpus linguistics]] and computational philology, [[overlapping markup]] represents a notorious problem to conventional [[XML]] formats. Hence, graph-based data models have been suggested since the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bird|first1=Steven|last2=Liberman|first2=Mark|title=Towards a formal framework for linguistic annotations|url=http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/sb/home/papers/icslp98.pdf|publisher=In:  Proceedings of the International Conference on Spoken Language Processing, Sydney, 1998|accessdate=2016-05-25}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are traditionally represented by means of multiple, interlinked XML files (standoff XML),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ISO 24612:2012|title=Language resource management -- Linguistic annotation framework (LAF)|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=37326|publisher=ISO|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are poorly supported by off-the-shelf XML technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eckart|first1=Richard|title=Choosing an XML database for linguistically annotated corpora|date=2008|publisher=SDV.

Linked Data in Linguistics. Representing and Connecting Language Data and Language Metadata, 2012|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eliminates the need for special-purpose technology, and, instead, relies on the existing RDF ecosystem.
* Multilingual issues including the linking of lexical resources such as [[WordNet]] as performed in the [https://globalwordnet.github.io/schemas/ Interlingual Index] of the [[Global WordNet Association]] and interconnecting heterogeneous resources such as WordNet and Wikipedia, as was done in [[BabelNet]].
* Providing forums for standardization of linguistic resource information

=== Selected LLOD resources ===

In October 2018, the 10 most frequently linked resources in the LLOD diagram are (in order of the number of linked datasets):

* The [http://purl.org/olia/ Ontologies of Linguistic Annotation] (OLiA, linked with 74 datasets) provide reference terminology for linguistic annotations and grammatical metadata;
* [[WordNet]] (linked with 51 datasets), a lexical database for English and pivot for developing similar databases for other languages, with several editions (Princeton edition linked with 36 datasets; W3C edition linked with 8 datasets; VU edition linked with 7 datasets);
* [[DBpedia]] (linked with 50 datasets) multilingual knowledge basis of general world knowledge, based on Wikipedia;
* [https://www.lexinfo.net/ lexinfo.net] (linked with 36 datasets) provides reference terminology for lexical resources;
* [[BabelNet]] (linked with 33 datasets)  multilingual lexicalized semantic network, based on the aggregation of various other resources, most notably WordNet and Wikipedia;
* [http://www.lexvo.org/ lexvo.org] (linked with 26 datasets) provides language identifiers and other language-related data. Most importantly, lexvo provides a RDF representation of [[ISO_639-3]] 3-letter codes for language identifiers and information about these languages;
* The [[ISO_12620]] Data Category Registry (ISOcat; RDF edition, linked with 10 datasets) provides a semistructured repository for various language-related terminology. ISOcat is hosted by The Language Archive, respectively, the [[DOBES]] project, at the [[Max_Planck_Institute_for_Psycholinguistics]], but currently in transition to [[CLARIN]];
* [[UBY]] (RDF edition &lt;i&gt;lemon-Uby&lt;/i&gt;, linked with 9 datasets), a lexical network for English, aggregated from various lexical resources;
* [[Glottolog]] (linked with 7 datasets) provides fine-grained language identifiers for low-resource languages, in particular many not covered by lexvo.org;
* [[Wiktionary]]-[[DBpedia]] links (&lt;i&gt;wiktionary.dbpedia.org&lt;/i&gt;, linked with 7 datasets), Wiktionary-based lexicalizations for DBpedia concepts.

=== LLOD cloud development and community activities ===
The LLOD cloud diagram is maintained by the Open Linguistics Working Group (OWLG) of the Open Knowledge Foundation (since 2014 Open Knowledge), an open and interdisciplinary of experts in language resources.

The OWLG organizes community events and coordinates LLOD developments and facilitates interdisciplinary communication between and among LLOD contributors and users.

Several W3C Business and Community Groups focus on specialized aspects of LLOD:
* The W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group develops and maintains specifications for machine-readable dictionaries in the LLOD cloud
* The W3C Best Practices for Multilingual Linked Open Data Community Group gathers information on best practises for producing multilingual linked open data.
* The W3C Linked Data for Language Technology Community Group assembles user cases and requirements for language technology applications that use Linked Data.

LLOD development is driven forward by and documented in series of international workshops, datathons, and associated publications. Among others, these include
* Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL), annual scientific workshop, since 2012
* Multilingual Linked Open Data for Enterprises (MLODE), bi-annual community meeting (2012 and 2014)
* Summer Datathon on Linguistic Linked Open Data (SD-LLOD), bi-annual datathon, since 2015

Uses and development of LLOD have been subject to several research projects, including
* [https://archive.is/20140307183201/http://lod2.okfn.org/ LOD2] (11 EU countries + Korea, 2010–2014)
* MONNET (5 EU countries, 2010–2013)
* [http://www.lider-project.eu LIDER] (5 EU countries, 2013–2015)
* [http://qtleap.eu/ QTLeap] (6 EU countries, 2013–2016)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2838">'''Description'''
&lt;br&gt;
The Master of Arts in Theological Studies (MATS) satisfies a variety of broad academic and [[vocational]] purposes. It can be suited to the [[pastor]], [[layman]] or beginning academic as an entry level Master's Degree in [[theology]]. It is often geared toward individuals seeking an introductory [[graduate degree]] in religion for service in a supportive role in their local [[Local church|congregation]]. Depending upon the school, the program can vary from as little as 36 [[semester]]/54 quarter hours up to 48 [[semester]]/72 quarter hours typically. It may or may not include a [[thesis]], [http://edglossary.org/capstone-project/ capstone] or summation. Frequently, it is a classwork only degree.

'''Programs of Study'''
&lt;br&gt;
The degree may take several differing forms such as:
M.A.T.S. (General [[theology]] degree non-specified)
[[Biblical Studies]]
[[Systematic Theology]]
[[Old Testament]]
[[New Testament]]
[[Historical Theology]]
[[Christian Apologetics]]

'''[[Accreditation]]'''
&lt;br&gt;
The Master of Arts in Theological Studies is a degree recognized by [http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg6.html accrediting agencies] such as the [[Association of Theological Schools|ATS]] ([[Association of Theological Schools]]), [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools|TRACS]] ([[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools|the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]]), the [[Association for Biblical Higher Education|ABHE]] ([[Association for Biblical Higher Education]]) and other accrediting bodies. It is classified as a Category D: Basic Program Oriented Toward General Theological Studies&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.ats.edu/uploads/accrediting/documents/accrediting-standards-architecture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada|ATS]] ([[Association of Theological Schools]]).

'''Degree Status'''
&lt;br&gt;
While requiring only about 1/2 to 2/3 of the credit hours that are required of a [[Master of Divinity|M.Div]] ([[Master of Divinity]]), it is generally considered equal as a prerequisite for entering advanced degree programs such as for an [[Master of Sacred Theology|STM]] ([[Master of Sacred Theology]]) or [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral studies]]. However, the student will likely be required to know (or learn remedially) [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] or another [[modern language]] in order to enter an advanced degree program if they haven't learned these yet.

The '''Masters and Johnson Institute''' (1964–1994) was the clinical and research foundation of [[sexologist]] duo [[Masters and Johnson]]. Located in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]], the institute was established to study [[human sexuality]] with particular emphasis on the [[sexual anatomy|anatomy and physiology]] of [[human sexual response cycle|human sexual response]] and the diagnosis and treatment of [[sexual disorders|sexual dysfunctions]].

Founded as the '''Reproductive Biology Research Foundation''', the organization changed its name to the Masters and Johnson Institute in 1978; it closed in 1994.

==History==
After [[William H. Masters]] hired [[Virginia E. Johnson]] in 1957 as a research assistant on a project in human sexuality, they originally worked together in the Department of [[Obstetrics]] and [[Gynecology]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], before continuing to create an independent research institution at 4910 Forest Park Avenue in the Central Medical Building in St. Louis in 1964, deliberately named the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation (rather than using the word "sex" in its title) to keep their work out of the limelight. The foundation did, in fact, conduct studies of conception, contraception, and infertility, although the major focus of its work was on advancing the scientific study of human sexuality.

Their work, which pioneered human sexuality as a science, was primarily conducted at this institute.  They published books including ''{{no redirect|Human Sexual Response (book)|Human Sexual Response}}'' (1966; {{OCLC|318151909}}) and ''{{no redirect|Human Sexual Inadequacy}}'' (1970; {{OCLC|299881470}}).

Masters and Johnson married in 1971 and by 1978, at the urging of their board of directors, agreed to rename their foundation Masters &amp; Johnson Institute believing that the institutes's work might capitalize to a degree on their personal fame.

At the height of its operations, the institute included a multi-disciplinary staff of medical professionals (including specialists from the fields of obstetrics and gynecology, [[internal medicine]] and [[endocrinology]], [[psychiatry]], and [[nursing]]) as well as [[behavior therapy|behavioral clinician]]s (including [[clinical psychologist]]s, [[social worker]]s, [[theologian]]s, and pastoral counselors) and a dedicated [[biochemical]] and endocrine laboratory.

The institute conducted a wide range of workshop and seminar programs for health care professionals both in St. Louis and across the country and also ran a full-time training program for [[sex therapist]]s.  In addition to the research and educational work it conducted, and its world-renowned therapy program, the institute also spearheaded a drive during the 1970s to establish ethical guidelines for sex educators, therapists, and researchers.

The institute was closed when Masters retired in 1994.

==Popular culture==
The founders and their institute inspired the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] TV series ''[[Masters of Sex]]''.

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mental model''' is an explanation of someone's [[thought]] process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape [[behaviour]] and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal [[algorithm]]) and doing tasks.

A mental model is a kind of internal symbol or representation of external reality, hypothesized to play a major role in [[cognition]], [[reasoning]] and [[decision-making]]. [[Kenneth Craik]] suggested in 1943 that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to anticipate events.

[[Jay Wright Forrester]] defined general mental models as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In psychology, the term ''mental models'' is sometimes used to refer to [[mental representation]]s or mental simulation generally. At other times it is used to refer to {{§l||Mental models and reasoning}} and to the mental model theory of reasoning developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]].

==History==
The term ''mental model'' is believed to have originated with [[Kenneth Craik]] in his 1943 book ''The Nature of Explanation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J.|authorlink=Nancy_J._Nersessian|title=In the Theoretician's Laboratory: Thought Experimenting as Mental Modeling|journal=PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|date=1992|volume=1992|pages=291–301|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/aimosaic/faculty/nersessian/papers/in-the-theoreticians-laboratory.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014|quote=The contemporary notion that mental modelling plays a significant role in human reasoning was formulated, initially, by Kenneth Craik in 1943.|doi=10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192843}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staggers|first1=Nancy|last2=Norcio|first2=A.F.|title=Mental models: concepts for human-computer interaction research|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|date=1993|volume=38|issue=4|pages=587–605|doi=10.1006/imms.1993.1028|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~norcio/papers/1993/Staggers-MM-IJMMS.pdf|quote=Although Johnson-Laird (1989) is generally credited with coining the term mental model, the history of the concept may be traced to Craik's (1943) work entitled ''The Nature of Explanation''.|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Georges-Henri Luquet|Georges-Henri Luquet]] in ''Le dessin enfantin'' (Children's drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].

[[Philip Johnson-Laird]] published ''Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness'' in 1983. In the same year, [[Dedre Gentner]] and [[Albert Stevens]] edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled ''Mental Models''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm "Mental models"], report at www.lauradove.info.&lt;/ref&gt; The first line of their book explains the idea further: "One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people's views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task." (see the book: ''[[Mental Models (Gentner-Stevens book)|Mental Models]]'').

Since then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in [[human-computer interaction]] and [[usability]] by researchers including [[Donald Norman]] and Steve Krug (in his book ''[[Don't Make Me Think]]''). [[Walter Kintsch]] and [[Teun A. van Dijk]], using the term ''situation model'' (in their book ''Strategies of Discourse Comprehension'', 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of [[discourse]].

==Mental models and reasoning==&lt;!-- [[#Mental models and reasoning]] above links to this heading --&gt;
One view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the [[picture theory of language]] described by philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1922. [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] developed a theory of mental models which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

===Principles of mental models===
Mental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions ([[axiom]]s), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the [[psychology of reasoning]] (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of [[counterfactual conditionals]] and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

===Reasoning with mental models===
People infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).

===Criticisms===
Scientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal [[rules of inference]] (e.g., O'Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng &amp; Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).

==Mental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics==

===Characteristics===
A mental model is generally:
* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts
* '''[[Cognitive flexibility|flexible]]''' – is considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense
* an '''information filter''' – causes [[selective perception]], perception of only selected parts of [[information]]
* '''very limited''', compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a [[scientific modelling|scientific model]] is extensive and in accordance with a certain [[reality]] in the derivation of [[logical consequence]]s of it, it must take into account such restrictions as [[working memory]]; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, [[gestaltism]]s or failure of the principles of [[logic]], etc.
* dependent on sources of information, which one can not find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proverbs.cz/media/art/SM_ST.pdf |format=PDF |author=Šusta, Marek |title=Několik slov o systémové dynamice a systémovém myšlení |pages=3–9 |publisher=Proverbs, a.s. |language=Czech |accessdate= 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mild2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mildeova, S., Vojtko V. |title=Systémová dynamika |year=2003 |isbn=80-245-0626-2 |publisher=Oeconomica |location=Prague |pages=19–24 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forste1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/ford_sterman_elicit_1.pdf |format=PDF |author=Ford, David N., Sterman, John D. |title=Expert Knowledge Elicitation to Improve Mental and Formal Models |publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, US - Massachusetts Institute of Technology |pages=18–23 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as "deeply held images of thinking and acting".&lt;ref&gt;"Leading for a Change", Ralph Jacobson, 2000, Chapter 5, Page102&lt;/ref&gt; Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

===Expression of mental models of dynamic systems===
S.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:
* [[Causal loop diagram]]s – displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops
* System structure diagrams – another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system
* Stock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system
These methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Natalie A. |last2=Ross |first2=Helen |last3=Lynam |first3=Timothy |last4=Perez |first4=Pascal |last5=Leitch |first5=Anne |title=Mental Models:  An Interdisciplinary Synthesis of Theory and Methods |journal=Ecology and Society |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |doi=10.5751/ES-03802-160146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, "a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalmodeler.org/resources/Gray%20et%20al%20Mental%20Modeler%202013.pdf|title=Mental Modeler: A Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping Modeling Tool for Adaptive Environmental Management|author=|date=|website=mentalmodeler.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.

===Mental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking===
In the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome [[systemic thinking]] and [[system dynamics]].

These two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"/&gt;

* '''[[System dynamics]]''' – extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.
* '''[[Systemic thinking]]''' – seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.

===Single and double-loop learning===
After analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. [[Learning]] is a back-loop [[wikt:process|process]], and [[feedback]] loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.

====Single-loop learning====
Mental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.

====Double-loop learning====
{{Main|Double-loop learning}}
Double-loop learning (''see diagram below'') is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.&lt;ref name="mild2003"/&gt;

== Impact ==
NECTEC has used green technology in the field of printing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/gadget/288200/nectec-promotes-printing-future&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the foundation of  [[Thailand Organic and Printed Electronics Innovation Centre]] (TOPIC). NECTEC along with public and private sectors have researched the technical feasibility of using [[organic electronics]] in printing ink. It has successfully developed [[graphene]]-based conductive ink in 2011. The ink has five times more conductivity than a typical ink. It is also cheap, contains no contamination, and is suitable for various applications.
It has also developed a software called "Size-Thai"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sizethailand.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; that uses [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] body scan to measure the anatomical dimensions of Thai people. This makes Thailand the second nation in Asia to use such a software after Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationmultimedia.com/2009/03/03/technology/technology_30096958.php&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected to reduce wastage and help garment retailers to reduce losses. It also has business applications like "virtual-try on" and "made to measure".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1213">Originally used by Jesuits as a learning aid for students, '''painted enigmas''' are visual riddles - generally speaking, a picture with an easily understood superficial subject that contains a hidden meaning, usually one word.  This differed from similar visual riddles such as the [[emblem]] or hieroglyph ([[Horapollo]]'s "''Hieroglyphica''" for instance)which were simpler in design and intended to represent moral precepts. The emblem and painted enigma were similar in that each usually contained some clue that the composition contained a hidden meaning, usually a "written legend which might be a verbal riddle or rebus to be solved by the same word,or a simple epigrammatic motto such as constituted the 'soul' of the emblem." First developed at the Jesuit college Pont a Mousson in 1588, it developed into an erudite courtly entertainment by the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennifer Montagu]], “The Painted Enigma and French Seventeenth-Century Art,” Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 31 (1968), 307-309, 314&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest verifiable painted enigmas from this era were painted by [[Charles Le Brun]].

The '''Parable of the Invisible Gardener''' is a tale originally told by [[John Wisdom]]. It was later developed in the university debate by [[Antony Flew]], who made several important changes such as changing the gardeners to explorers and making original "long neglected garden" a clearing in the jungle. It is often used to illustrate the perceived differences between assertions based on [[faith]] and assertions based on [[scientific evidence]], and the problems associated with [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] beliefs. Flew's main claim in using the parable is that religious believers do not allow anybody to "falsify" their assertions, instead they simply change their beliefs to suit the questioner. Thus Flew concludes that religious believers cause God to "die the death of a thousand qualifications". In Flew's version, the tale runs as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once upon a time two explorers came upon a clearing in the jungle. In the clearing were growing many flowers and many weeds. One explorer says, "Some gardener must tend this plot." The other disagrees, "There is no gardener." So they pitch their tents and set a watch. No gardener is ever seen. "But perhaps he is an invisible gardener." So they set up a barbed-wire fence. They electrify it. They patrol with bloodhounds. (For they remember how H. G. Well's ''The Invisible Man'' could be both smelt and touched though he could not be seen.) But no shrieks ever suggest that some intruder has received a shock. No movements of the wire ever betray an invisible climber. The bloodhounds never give cry. Yet still the Believer is not convinced. "But there is a gardener, invisible, intangible, insensible, to electric shocks, a gardener who has no scent and makes no sound, a gardener who comes secretly to look after the garden which he loves. At last the Skeptic despairs, "But what remains of your original assertion? Just how does what you call an invisible, intangible, eternally elusive gardener differ from an imaginary gardener or even from no gardener at all?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/flew_falsification.html|title=Antony Flew "Theology and Falsification," 1950|website=www.stephenjaygould.org|access-date=2016-09-26}} {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Park Yun-Sun''' (December 11, 1905 - June 30, 1988) was a [[Korea]]n [[biblical scholar]] born in [[Cholsan County|Cholsan]], [[North Pyongan Province]]. After completing his undergraduate studies at [[Soongsil University]], he enrolled at [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] in the US. Then, he went on to [[Netherlands|Holland]] for further theological training (October 1953 - March 1954). In 1979, he completed his voluminous and historic scholarly work on the commentaries of all sixty-six books of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yunesunpark.pe.kr/|work=yunesunpark.pe.kr/|title=Yune Sun Park Official Site|accessdate=6 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322101346/http://www.yunesunpark.pe.kr/|archivedate=22 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Park has been considered to be the pre-eminent [[John Calvin|Calvin]] scholar in [[Korea]]. He taught at [[Kosin University]] (1946–1960), [[Chongshin University]] (1963–1974, 1979–1980), and [[Hapdong Theological Seminary]] (1980–1988).

The effect of POPs on human and environmental health was discussed, with intention to eliminate or severely restrict their production, by the international community at the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] in 2001.

Many POPs are currently or were in the past used as [[pesticide]]s, [[solvent]]s, [[pharmaceutical]]s, and industrial chemicals.&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt; Although some POPs arise naturally, for example volcanoes and various biosynthetic pathways, most are man-made&lt;ref name="El-Shahawi, M.S. 2010"&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010). An overview on the accumulation, distribution, transformations, toxicity and analytical methods for the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants. Talanta. 80, 1587–1597. {{doi|10.1016/j.talanta.2009.09.055}}.&lt;/ref&gt; via [[total synthesis]].

==Consequences of persistence==
POPs typically are halogenated organic compounds (see lists below) and as such exhibit high [[Lipophilicity|lipid solubility]].  For this reason, they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in [[Adipose tissue|fatty tissues]]. [[Halogenated]] compounds also exhibit great [[Chemical stability|stability]] reflecting the nonreactivity of C-Cl bonds toward [[hydrolysis]] and [[Photodissociation|photolytic degradation]].  The stability and lipophilicity of organic compounds often correlates with their halogen content, thus polyhalogenated organic compounds are of particular concern.  They exert their negative effects on the environment through two processes, long range transport, which allows them to travel far from their source, and bioaccumulation, which reconcentrates these chemical compounds to potentially dangerous levels.&lt;ref name="Walker, C.H. 2001"&gt;Walker, C.H., "Organic Pollutants: An Ecotoxicological Perspective" (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Compounds that make up POPs are also classed as [[Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances|PBTs]] ('''P'''ersistent, '''B'''ioaccumulative and '''T'''oxic) or TOMPs ('''T'''oxic '''O'''rganic '''M'''icro '''P'''ollutants).

=== Long-range transport ===
POPs enter the [[gas]] phase under certain environmental temperatures and [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatize]] from [[soil]]s, [[vegetation]], and [[bodies of water]] into the [[atmosphere]], resisting breakdown reactions in the air, to travel long distances before being re-deposited.&lt;ref name="Kelly, B.C. 2007"&gt;Kelly, B.C., Ikonomou, M.G., Blair, J.D., Morin, A.E., Gobas, F.A.P.C. (2007). Food Web-Specific Biomagnification of Persistent Organic Pollutants. ''Science''. 317, 236–239. {{doi|10.1126/science.1138275}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This results in accumulation of POPs in areas far from where they were used or emitted, specifically environments where POPs have never been introduced such as [[Antarctica]], and the [[Arctic circle]].&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, A., Mackay, D., Matthies, M., Wania, F., Webster, E. (2000). Assessing Long-Range Transport Potential of Persistent Organic Pollutants. Environmental Sciences &amp; Technology. 34(4), 699–703. {{doi|10.1021/es990207w}}.&lt;/ref&gt; POPs can be present as vapors in the atmosphere or bound to the surface of solid particles. POPs have low solubility in water but are easily captured by solid particles, and are soluble in organic fluids ([[oil]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[liquid fuel]]s). POPs are not easily degraded in the environment due to their stability and low [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] rates. Due to this capacity for long-range transport, POP environmental contamination is extensive, even in areas where POPs have never been used, and will remain in these environments years after restrictions implemented due to their resistance to degradation.&lt;ref name="Wania, F. 1996"&gt;Wania, F., [[Donald Mackay (scientist)|Mackay, D.]] (1996). Tracking the Distribution of Persistent Organic Pollutants. Environmental Science &amp; Technology. 30 (9), 390A–396A. {{doi|10.1021/es962399q}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Astoviza|first=Malena J.|title=Evaluación de la distribución de contaminantes orgánicos persistentes (COPs) en aire en la zona de la cuenca del Plata mediante muestreadores pasivos artificiales|date=15 April 2014|pages=160|language=Spanish|url=http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/34729|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioaccumulation ===
[[Bioaccumulation]] of POPs is typically associated with the compounds high lipid solubility and ability to accumulate in the [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] of living organisms for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Wania, F. 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vallack, H.W. 1998"&gt;Vallack, H.W., Bakker, D.J., Brandt, I., Broström-Ludén, E., Brouwer, A., Bull, K.R., Gough, C., Guardans, R., Holoubek, I., Jansson, B., Koch, R., Kuylenstierna, J., Lecloux, A., Mackay, D., McCutcheon, P., Mocarelli, P., Taalman, R.D.F. (1998). Controlling persistent organic pollutants – what next? Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology 6, 143–175. {{doi|10.1016/S1382-6689(98)00036-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent chemicals tend to have higher concentrations and are eliminated more slowly. Dietary accumulation or [[bioaccumulation]] is another hallmark characteristic of POPs, as POPs move up the food chain, they increase in concentration as they are processed and metabolized in certain tissues of organisms. The natural capacity for animals [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] concentrate ingested chemicals, along with poorly [[Metabolism|metabolized]] and [[hydrophobic]] nature of POPs makes such compounds highly susceptible to [[bioaccumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Yu, G.W.,, Laseter, J., Mylander, C. Persistent organic pollutants in serum and several different fat compartments in humans. J Environ Public Health. 2011;2011:417980. {{doi|10.1155/2011/417980}}. {{PMID|21647350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus POPs not only persist in the environment, but also as they are taken in by animals they bioaccumulate, increasing their concentration and toxicity in the environment.&lt;ref name="Kelly, B.C. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lohmanna, R., Breivikb, K., Dachsd, J., Muire, D. (2007). Global fate of POPs: Current and future research directions. 150, 150–165. {{doi|10.1016/j.envpol.2007.06.051}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants ==
[[File:Map of Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.svg|thumb|275px|State parties to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]]
{{Main|Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants}}

The Stockholm Convention was adopted and put into practice by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) on May 22, 2001. The UNEP decided that POP regulation needed to be addressed globally for the future. The purpose statement of the agreement is "to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants." As of 2014, there are 179 countries in compliance with the Stockholm convention. The convention and its participants have recognized the potential human and environmental toxicity of POPs. They recognize that POPs have the potential for long range transport and bioaccumulation and biomagnification. The convention seeks to study and then judge whether or not a number of chemicals that have been developed with advances in technology and science can be categorized as POPs or not. The initial meeting in 2001 made a preliminary list, termed the "dirty dozen," of chemicals that are classified as POPs. As of 2014, the [[United States of America]] has signed the Stockholm Convention but has not ratified it. There are a handful of other countries that have not ratified the convention but most countries in the world have ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;"STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS". pp. 1–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compounds on the Stockholm Convention list ===

In May 1995, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] Governing Council investigated POPs.&lt;ref name="thedirtydozen"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dirty Dozen|url=http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/import/29239_popspresentation.swf|publisher=United Nations Industrial Development Organization|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the Convention recognized only twelve POPs for their adverse effects on human health and the environment, placing a global ban on these particularly harmful and toxic compounds and requiring its parties to take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs in the environment.
&lt;ref name="El-Shahawi, M.S. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/convention_text/UNEP-POPS-COP-CONVTEXT-FULL.English.PDF| title=STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS| pages=1–43| accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://chm.pops.int/&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''[[Aldrin]]''', an insecticide used in soils to kill [[termite]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[Western corn rootworm]], and others, is also known to kill birds, fish, and humans. Humans are primarily exposed to aldrin through dairy products and animal meats.
#'''[[Chlordane]]''', an insecticide used to control termites and on a range of agricultural crops, is known to be lethal in various species of birds, including mallard ducks, bobwhite quail, and pink shrimp; it is a chemical that remains in the soil with a reported [[half-life]] of one year. Chlordane has been postulated to affect the human immune system and is classified as a possible human [[carcinogen]]. Chlordane air pollution is believed the primary route of humane exposure.
#'''[[Dieldrin]]''', a pesticide used to control termites, textile pests, insect-borne diseases and insects living in agricultural soils. In soil and insects, aldrin can be oxidized, resulting in rapid conversion to dieldrin. Dieldrin’s half-life is approximately five years. [[Dieldrin]] is highly toxic to fish and other aquatic animals, particularly frogs, whose embryos can develop spinal deformities after exposure to low levels. Dieldrin has been linked to [[Parkinson's disease]], [[breast cancer]], and classified as immunotoxic, neurotoxic, with endocrine disrupting capacity. Dieldrin residues have been found in air, water, soil, fish, birds, and mammals. Human exposure to dieldrin primarily derives from food.
#'''[[Endrin]]''', an insecticide sprayed on the leaves of crops, and used to control rodents. Animals can metabolize endrin, so fatty tissue accumulation is not an issue, however the chemical has a long half-life in soil for up to 12 years. Endrin is highly toxic to aquatic animals and humans as a neurotoxin. Human exposure results primarily through food.
#'''[[Heptachlor]]''', a [[pesticide]] primarily used to kill soil insects and termites, along with cotton insects, grasshoppers, other crop pests, and malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Heptachlor, even at every low doses has been associated with the decline of several wild bird populations – [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] and [[American kestrel]]s. In laboratory tests have shown high-dose heptachlor as lethal, with adverse behavioral changes and reduced reproductive success at low-doses, and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Human exposure primarily results from food.
#'''[[Hexachlorobenzene]] (HCB'''), was first introduced in 1945–59 to treat seeds because it can kill [[Fungicide|fungi]] on food crops. HCB-treated seed grain consumption is associated with photosensitive skin lesions, [[colic]], debilitation, and a [[Metabolic syndrome|metabolic disorder]] called porphyria turcica, which can be lethal. Mothers who pass HCB to their infants through the placenta and breast milk had limited reproductive success including infant death. Human exposure is primarily from food.
#'''[[Mirex]]''', an insecticide used against ants and termites or as a [[flame retardant]] in plastics, rubber, and electrical goods. Mirex is one of the most stable and persistent pesticides, with a half-life of up to 10 years.  Mirex is toxic to several plant, fish and [[crustacean]] species, with suggested carcinogenic capacity in humans. Humans are exposed primarily through animal meat, fish, and wild game.
#'''[[Toxaphene]]''', an insecticide used on cotton, cereal, grain, fruits, nuts, and vegetables, as well as for tick and mite control in livestock. Widespread toxaphene use in the US and chemical persistence, with a half-life of up to 12 years in soil, results in residual toxaphene in the environment. Toxaphene is highly toxic to fish, inducing dramatic weight loss and reduced egg viability. Human exposure primarily results from food. While human toxicity to direct toxaphene exposure is low, the compound is classified as a possible human carcinogen.
#'''[[Polychlorinated biphenyls]]''' (PCBs), used as [[Heat-transfer oil|heat exchange fluids]], in [[transformer|electrical transformers]], and [[capacitor]]s, and as additives in paint, carbonless copy paper, and plastics. Persistence varies with degree of [[halogenation]], an estimated half-life of 10 years. PCBs are toxic to fish at high doses, and associated with spawning failure at low doses. Human exposure occurs through food, and is associated with reproductive failure and immune suppression. Immediate effects of PCB exposure include pigmentation of nails and [[mucous membranes]] and swelling of the eyelids, along with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Effects are [[Transgenerational epigenetics|transgenerational]], as the chemical can persist in a mother’s body for up to 7 years, resulting in developmental delays and behavioral problems in her children. Food contamination has led to large scale PCB exposure.
#[[DDT|'''Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane''']] (DDT) is probably the most infamous POP. It was widely used as insecticide during WWII to protect against malaria and typhus. After the war, DDT was used as an agricultural insecticide. In 1962, the American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] published [[Silent Spring]], describing the impact of DDT spraying on the US environment and human health. DDT’s persistence in the soil for up to 10–15 years after application has resulted in widespread and persistent DDT residues throughout the world including the arctic, even though it has been banned or severely restricted in most of the world. DDT is toxic to many organisms including birds where it is detrimental to reproduction due to eggshell thinning. DDT can be detected in foods from all over the world and food-borne DDT remains the greatest source of human exposure. Short-term acute effects of DDT on humans are limited, however long-term exposure has been associated with chronic health effects including increased risk of cancer and diabetes, reduced reproductive success, and neurological disease.
#'''[[Dioxins]]''' are unintentional by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete combustion and pesticide production. Dioxins are typically emitted from the burning of hospital waste, municipal waste, and [[hazardous waste]], along with automobile emissions, peat, coal, and wood. Dioxins have been associated with several adverse effects in humans, including immune and enzyme disorders, [[chloracne]], and are classified as a possible human carcinogen. In laboratory studies of dioxin effects an increase in birth defects and stillbirths, and lethal exposure have been associated with the substances. Food, particularly from animals, is the principal source of human exposure to dioxins.
#'''[[Polychlorinated dibenzofurans]]''' are by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete [[combustion]] after [[Incineration|waste incineration]] or in automobiles, pesticide production, and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] production. Structurally similar to dioxins, the two compounds share toxic effects. Furans persist in the environment and classified as possible human carcinogens. Human exposure to furans primarily results from food, particularly animal products.

=== New POPs on the Stockholm Convention list ===
Since 2001, this list has been expanded to include some [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), [[brominated flame retardant]]s, and other compounds. Additions to the initial 2001 Stockholm Convention list are as following POPs:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Depositary notification | url = http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/download.aspx?d=UNEP-POPS-COP-NOTIF-DN-CN524-2009.English.pdf | publisher = Secretary-General of the United Nations | date = 26 August 2009 | accessdate = 2009-12-17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chlordecone]], a synthetic chlorinated organic compound,is primarily used as an agricultural pesticide, related to DDT and Mirex. Chlordecone is toxic to aquatic organisms, and classified as a possible human carcinogen. Many countries have banned chlordecone sale and use, or intend to phase out stockpiles and wastes.
*[[alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane|α-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (α-HCH) and [[beta-Hexachlorocyclohexane|β-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (β-HCH) are insecticides as well as by-products in the production of [[lindane]].  Large stockpiles of HCH isomers exist in the environment. α-HCH and β-HCH are highly persistent in the water of colder regions. α-HCH and β-HCH has been linked [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*[[Hexabromodiphenyl ether]] (hexaBDE) and [[heptabromodiphenyl ether]] (heptaBDE) are main components of commercial [[octabromodiphenyl ether]] (octaBDE). Commercial octaBDE is highly persistent in the environment, whose only degradation pathway is through debromination and the production of [[Bromodiphenylmethane|bromodiphenyl ethers]], which can increase toxicity.
*[[Lindane]] (γ-hexachlorocyclohexane), a pesticide used as a broad spectrum insecticide for seed, soil, leaf, tree and wood treatment, and against [[ectoparasite]]s in animals and humans (head lice and scabies). Lindane rapidly [[Bioconcentration|bioconcentrates]]. It is [[Immunotoxin|immunotoxic]], [[Neurotoxicity|neurotoxic]], [[carcinogenic]], linked to liver and kidney damage as well as adverse reproductive and developmental effects in laboratory animals and aquatic organisms. Production of lindane unintentionally produces two other POPs α-HCH and β-HCH.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*[[Pentachlorobenzene]] (PeCB), is a pesticide and unintentional byproduct. PeCB has also been used in PCB products, dyestuff carriers, as a fungicide, a flame retardant, and a chemical intermediate. PeCB is moderately toxic to humane, while highly toxic to aquatic organisms.
*[[Tetrabromodiphenyl ether]] (tetraBDE) and pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE) are industrial chemicals and the main components of commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE). PentaBDE has been detected in humans in all regions of the world.
*[[Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS) and its salts are used in the production of fluoropolymers. PFOS and related compounds are extremely persistent, bioaccumulating and [[Biomagnification|biomagnifying]].  The negative effects of trace levels of PFOS have not been established.
*[[Endosulfan]]s are insecticides to control pests on crops such coffee, cotton, rice and sorghum and soybeans, tsetse flies, ectoparasites of cattle. They are used as a [[Wood preservation|wood preservative]]. Global use and manufacturing of endosulfan has been banned under the Stockholm convention in 2011, although many countries had previously banned or introduced phase-outs of the chemical when the ban was announced. Toxic to humans and aquatic and terrestrial organisms, linked to congenital physical disorders, mental retardation, and death. Endosulfans' negative health effects are primarily liked to its endocrine disrupting capacity acting as an [[antiandrogen]].
*[[Hexabromocyclododecane]] (HBCD) is a [[brominated flame retardant]] primarily used in [[thermal insulation]] in the building industry. HBCD is persistent, toxic and [[Ecotoxicity|ecotoxic]], with [[bioaccumulative]] and long-range transport properties.

== Additive and synergistic effects ==
Evaluation of the effects of POPs on health is very challenging in the laboratory setting. For example, for organisms exposed to a mixture of POPs, the effects are assumed to be [[interaction|additive]].&lt;ref name="Harrad, S. 2010"&gt;ed. Harrad, S., "Persistent Organic Pollutants" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Mixtures of POPs can in principle produce [[interaction|synergistic effects]]. With synergistic effects, the toxicity of each compound is enhanced (or depressed) by the presence of other compounds in the mixture. When put together, the effects can far exceed the approximated additive effects of the POP compound mixture.&lt;ref name="Walker, C.H. 2001"/&gt;

== Health effects ==
POP exposure may cause developmental defects, chronic illnesses, and death. Some are carcinogens per [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], possibly including [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt; Many POPs are capable of [[endocrine disruption]] within the [[reproductive system]], the [[central nervous system]], or the [[immune system]]. People and animals are exposed to POPs mostly through their diet, occupationally, or while growing in the womb.&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt;  For humans not exposed to POPs through accidental or occupational means, over 90% of exposure comes from animal product foods due to bioaccumulation in fat tissues and bioaccumulate through the food chain. In general, POP serum levels increase with age and tend to be higher in females than males.&lt;ref name="Vallack, H.W. 1998"/&gt;

Studies have investigated the correlation between low level exposure of POPs and various diseases. In order to assess disease risk due to POPs in a particular location, government agencies may produce a [[human health risk assessment]] which takes into account the pollutants' [[bioavailability]] and their [[dose-response relationship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szabo DT, Loccisano AE |title= POPs and Human Health Risk Assessment|journal=Dioxins and Persistent Organic Pollutants |volume=3rd |pages= 579|editor= A. Schecter|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date= March 30, 2012| doi= 10.1002/9781118184141.ch19 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118184141.ch19/summary |isbn= 9781118184141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endocrine disruption ===
The majority of POPs are known to disrupt normal functioning of the endocrine system. Low level exposure to POPs during critical [[developmental biology|developmental]] periods of fetus, newborn and child can have a lasting effect throughout its lifespan. A 2002 study&lt;ref name="Damstra, T. 2002"&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465.&lt;/ref&gt; synthesizes data on endocrine disruption and health complications from exposure to POPs during critical developmental stages in an organism’s lifespan. The study aimed to answer the question whether or not chronic, low level exposure to POPs can have a health impact on the endocrine system and development of organisms from different species. The study found that exposure of POPs during a critical developmental time frame can produce a permanent changes in the organisms path of development. Exposure of POPs during non-critical developmental time frames may not lead to detectable diseases and health complications later in their life. In wildlife, the critical development time frames are [[in utero]], [[in ovo]], and during reproductive periods. In humans, the critical development timeframe is during [[prenatal development|fetal development]].&lt;ref&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproductive system ===
The same study in 2002&lt;ref name="Damstra, T. 2002"/&gt; with evidence of a link from POPs to [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disruption]] also linked low dose exposure of POPs to [[reproductive health]] effects. The study stated that POP exposure can lead to negative health effects especially in the [[human male reproductive system|male reproductive system]], such as decreased [[sperm]] quality and quantity, altered sex ratio and early [[puberty]] onset. For females exposed to POPs, altered [[human female reproductive system|reproductive tissues]] and [[pregnancy]] outcomes as well as [[endometriosis]] have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010). An overview on the accumulation, distribution, transformations, toxicity and analytical methods for the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants. Talanta. 80, 1587–1597&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gestational weight gain and newborn head circumference====
A Greek study from 2014 investigated the link between maternal weight gain during pregnancy, their [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-exposure level and PCB level in their newborn infants, their [[birth weight]], [[gestational age]], and head circumference. The lower the birth weight and head circumference of the infants was, the higher POP levels during [[prenatal development]] had been, but only if mothers had either excessive or inadequate weight gain during pregnancy. No correlation between POP exposure and gestational age was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vafeiadi|first=M|author2=Vrijheid M |author3=Fthenou E |author4=Chalkiadaki G |author5=Rantakokko P |author6=Kiviranta H |author7=Kyrtopoulos SA |author8=Chatzi L |author9=Kogevinas M  |title=Persistent organic pollutants exposure during pregnancy, maternal gestational weight gain, and birth outcomes in the mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece (RHEA study)|journal=Environ Int.|year=2014|volume=64|pages=116–123|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2013.12.015|pmid=24389008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 [[case-control study]] conducted 2009 in Indian mothers and their offspring showed prenatal exposure of two types of [[organochlorine pesticides]] ([[Hexachlorocyclohexane|HCH]], [[DDT]] and [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]]) impaired the growth of the [[fetus]], reduced the birth weight, length, head circumference and chest circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dewan|first=Jain V,|author2=Gupta P |author3=Banerjee BD. |title=Organochlorine pesticide residues in maternal blood, cord blood, placenta, and breastmilk and their relation to birth size|journal=Chemosphere|date=February 2013|volume=90|issue=5|pages=1704–1710|doi= 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.09.083|pmid=23141556|bibcode=2013Chmsp..90.1704D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465. {{PMID|12216998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In urban areas and indoor environments ==
Traditionally it was thought that human exposure to POPs occurred primarily through [[food]], however [[Indoor air quality|indoor pollution]] patterns that characterize certain POPs have challenged this notion. Recent studies of indoor [[dust]] and [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] have implicated indoor environments as a major sources for human exposure via inhalation and ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, C.H., "Organic Pollutants: An Ecotoxicological Perspective" (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, significant indoor POP pollution must be a major route of human POP exposure, considering the modern trend in spending larger proportions of life indoor. Several studies have shown that indoor (air and dust) POP levels to exceed outdoor (air and soil) POP concentrations.&lt;ref name="Harrad, S. 2010"/&gt;

== Control and removal in the environment ==
Current studies aimed at minimizing POPs in the environment are investigating their behavior in [[photocatalysis|photo catalytic oxidation reactions]].  POPs that are found in humans and in [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environments]] the most are the main subjects of these experiments. [[aromatic compound|Aromatic]] and [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] degradation products have been identified in these reactions. [[photocatalysis|Photochemical degradation]] is negligible compared to photocatalytic degradation.&lt;ref&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010). An overview on the accumulation, distribution, transformations, toxicity and analytical methods for the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants. Talanta. 80, 1587–1597. {{DOI|10.1016/j.talanta.2009.09.055}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method of removal of POPs from marine environments that has been explored is adsorption. It occurs when an absorbable solute comes into contact with a solid with a porous surface structure. This technique was investigated by Mohamed Nageeb Rashed of Aswan University, Egypt. &lt;ref&gt;Rashed, M.N. ''Organic pollutants - Monitoring, risk and treatment''. Intech. London (2013). Chapter 7 - Adsorption techniques for the removal of presistent organic pollutants from water and wastewater. &lt;/ref&gt; Current efforts are more focused on banning the use and production of POPs worldwide rather than removal of POPs.&lt;ref&gt;Vallack, H.W., Bakker, D.J., Brandt, I., Broström-Ludén, E., Brouwer, A., Bull, K.R., Gough, C., Guardans, R., Holoubek, I., Jansson, B., Koch, R., Kuylenstierna, J., Lecloux, A., Mackay, D., McCutcheon, P., Mocarelli, P., Taalman, R.D.F. (1998). Controlling persistent organic pollutants – what next? Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology 6, 143–175. {{DOI|10.1016/S1382-6689(98)00036-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1669">'''Psalmist movement''' is a term that covers a period of  mass musical education in Britain having its roots in the dissenting congregational church singing organisations of  late 18th century in regional Scotland and Northern England, which, by the mid-19th century, was to become a vibrant metropolitan cultural  institution, coinciding with radical developments in broader national schools policy, the latter owing much to the teaching methods used by the psalmist singing schools. It is sometimes also referred to as the 'choral revival'.
 
The names most often associated with the 'movement' in Britain are John [[Curwen]] (1816–1880),  [[Sarah Ann Glover]] (1785–1867) and [[John Pyke Hullah]] (1812–24), However it had its philosophical roots in Europe, particularly in the social idealism of [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]. In [[Bernarr Rainbow]]'s words 'As a result of the series of weekly massed singing classes introduced at [[Exeter Hall]] under government sanction, the people of London became more musically conscious between 1841 and 1843 than they had ever been.'&lt;ref&gt;Bernarr Rainbow 1970, ''The Choral Revival in the Anglican Church 1839-1872,'' (London), p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''rational planning model''' is a model of the planning process involving a number of rational actions or steps. Taylor (1998) outlines five steps, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Urban Planning Theory since 1945|last = Taylor|first = Nigel|publisher = Sage Publications|year = 1998|isbn = |location = London|pages = 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Definition of the problems and/or goals;
* Identification of alternative plans/policies;
* Evaluation of alternative plans/policies;
* Implementation of plans/policies;
* Monitoring of effects of plans/policies. 
The rational planning model is used in planning and designing neighborhoods, cities, and regions. It has been central in the development of modern [[urban planning]] and [[transportation planning]]. The model has many limitations, particularly the lack of guidance on involving stakeholders and the community affected by planning, and other models of planning, such as [[collaborative planning]], are now also widely used.

The very similar '''rational decision-making model''', as it is called in [[organizational behavior]], is a process for making logically sound decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Stephen P.|title=Organizational Behavior|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0132431569|edition=12th|pages=156–8|author2=Timothy A. Judge }}&lt;/ref&gt; This multi-step model and aims to be logical and follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution. Rational decision making is a multi-step process for making logically sound decisions that aims to follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution.

==Method==
Rational [[decision-making]] or [[planning]] follows a series of steps detailed below:

===Verify, define,detail the problem, give solution or alternative to the problem ===
Verifying, defining &amp; detailing the problem (problem definition, goal definition, information gathering).  This step includes recognizing the problem, defining an initial solution, and starting primary analysis.  Examples of this are creative devising, creative ideas, inspirations, breakthroughs, and [[Brainstorming|brainstorm]]s.

The very first step which is normally overlooked by the top level [[management]] is defining the exact problem. Though we think that the problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem.

===Generate all possible solutions===
This step encloses two to three final solutions to the problem and preliminary implementation to the site.  In planning, examples of this are Planned Units of Development and downtown revitalizations.

This activity is best done in groups, as different people may contribute different ideas or alternative solutions to the problem.  Without alternative solutions, there is a chance of arriving at a non-optimal or a rational decision. For exploring the alternatives it is necessary to gather information. Technology may help with gathering this information.

===Generate objective assessment criteria===
Evaluative criteria are measurements to determine success and failure of alternatives.  This step contains secondary and final analysis along with secondary solutions to the problem.  Examples of this are site suitability and site sensitivity analysis. After going thoroughly through the process of defining the problem, exploring for all the possible alternatives for that problem and gathering information this step says evaluate the information and the possible options to anticipate the consequences of each and every possible alternative that is thought of.  At this point optional criteria for measuring the success or failure of the decision taken needs to be considered.
The rational model of planning rest largely on objective assessment.

===Choose the best solution generated===
This step comprises a final solution and secondary implementation to the site.  At this point the process has developed into different strategies of how to apply the solutions to the site.

Based on the criteria of assessment and the analysis done in previous steps, choose the best solution generated.  These four steps form the core of the Rational Decision Making Model.

===Implement the preferred alternative===
This step includes final implementation to the site and preliminary monitoring of the outcome and results of the site.  This step is the building/renovations part of the process.

===Monitor and evaluate outcomes and results===
This step contains the secondary and final monitoring of the outcomes and results of the site.  This step takes place over a long period of time.

=== Feedback===
Modify future decisions and actions taken based on the above evaluation of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Michael P.|title=Planning Theory for Practitioners|year=2002|publisher=American Planning Association|location=Chicago|pages=175–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discourse of rational planning model used in policy making==
The rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simon, Herbert |title=[[Administrative Behavior]] |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |year=1976 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-684-83582-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions in order for it to work, such as:

*The model must be applied in a system that is stable,
*The government is a rational and unitary actor and that its actions are perceived as rational choices,
*The policy problem is unambiguous,
*There are no limitations of time or cost.

Indeed, some of the assumptions identified above are also pin pointed out in a study written by the historian H.A. Drake, as he states:

''In its purest form, the Rational Actor approach presumes that such a figure [as Constantine] has complete freedom of action to achieve goals that he or she has articulated through a careful process of rational analysis involving full and objective study of all pertinent information and alternatives. At the same time, it presumes that this central actor is so fully in control of the apparatus of government that a decision once made is as good as implemented. There are no  staffs on which to rely, no constituencies to placate, no generals or governors to cajole. By attributing all decision making to one central figure who is always fully in control and who acts only after carefully weighing all options, the Rational Actor method allows scholars to filter out extraneous details and focus attention on central issues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Drake, H.A. |title=Constantine and the Bishops: The Politics of Intolerance |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as we have seen, in the context of policy rational models are intended to achieve maximum social gain. For this purpose, Simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions. Ian Thomas describes Simon's steps as follows:

#Intelligence gathering— data and potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed.
#Identifying problems
#Assessing the consequences of all options
#Relating consequences to values— with all decisions and policies there will be a set of values which will be more relevant (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and which can be expressed as a set of criteria, against which performance (or consequences) of each option can be judged.
#Choosing the preferred option— given the full understanding of all the problems and opportunities, all the consequences and the criteria for judging options.&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite book |editor=Thomas, Ian |title=Environmental Policy: Australian Practice in the Context of Theory |publisher=Federation Press |location=Sydney |year=2007 |isbn=1-86287-603-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In similar lines, Wiktorowicz and Deber describe through their study on ‘Regulating biotechnology: a rational-political model of policy development’ the rational approach to policy development. The main steps involved in making a rational decision for these authors are the following:

#The comprehensive organization and analysis of the information
#The potential consequences of each option
#The probability that each potential outcome would materialize
#The value (or utility) placed on each potential outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wiktorowicz, Mary |author2=Deber, Raisa |title=Regulating biotechnology: a rational-political Model of policy development |journal=Health Policy Journal |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=115–138 |date=May 1997 |doi=10.1016/S0168-8510(96)00889-5 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V8X-3SWTKM6-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F1997&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_origin=browse&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=fff8e9fe6163caa0b6011b53c3aa37dd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach of Wiktorowicz and Deber is similar to Simon and they assert that the rational model tends to deal with “the facts” (data, probabilities) in steps 1 to 3, leaving the issue of assessing values to the final step. According to Wiktorowicz and Deber values are introduced in the final step of the rational model, where the utility of each policy option is assessed.

Many authors have attempted to interpret the above-mentioned steps, amongst others, Patton and Sawicki &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Patton, C., Sawicki, D. |title=Basic methods of policy analysis and planning |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=NJ |year=1986 |isbn=0-13-060948-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; who summarize the model as presented in the following figure (missing):

#Defining the problem by analyzing the data and the information gathered.
#Identifying the decision criteria that will be important in solving the problem. The decision maker must determine the relevant factors to take into account when making the decision.
#A brief list of the possible alternatives must be generated; these could succeed to resolve the problem.
#A critical analyses and evaluation of each criterion is brought through. For example, strength and weakness tables of each alternative are drawn and used for comparative basis.  The decision maker then weights the previously identified criteria in order to give the alternative policies a correct priority in the decision.
#The decision-maker evaluates each alternative against the criteria and selects the preferred alternative.
#The policy is brought through.

The model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, many criticisms of the model arise due to claim of the model being impractical and lying on unrealistic assumptions.  For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extra ordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings. This latter argument can be best illustrated by the words of Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, who wrote in his book `Understanding Public Policy´ the following passage:

''There is no better illustration of the dilemmas of rational policy making in America than in the field of health…the first obstacle to rationalism is defining the problem. Is our goal to have good health — that is, whether we live at all (infant mortality), how well we live (days lost to sickness), and how long we live (life spans and adult mortality)? Or is our goal to have good medical care — frequent visits to the doctor, wellequipped and accessible hospitals, and equal access to medical care by rich and poor alike?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dye, Thomas R. |title=Understanding Public Policy |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=12th |year=2007 |isbn=0-13-936948-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems faced when using the rational model arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1005469411776 |author1=Morgan M.G. |author2=Kandlikar M. |author3=Risbey J. |author4=Dowlatabadi H. |title=Why Conventional Tools for Policy Analysis Are Often Inadequate for Problems of Global Change |journal=Climatic Change |volume=41 |issue=3–4 |pages=271–281 |date=19 March 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real world context.

However, as Thomas states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.&lt;ref name=Thomas07/&gt;

===Decision criteria for policy analysis — Step 2===

As illustrated in Figure 1, rational policy analysis can be broken into 6 distinct stages of analysis. Step 2 highlights the need to understand which factors should be considered as part of the decision making process. At this part of the process, all the economic, social, and environmental factors that are important to the policy decision need to be identified and then expressed as policy decision criteria. For example, the decision criteria used in the analysis of environmental policy is often a mix of —

* [[Environmental impact assessment|Ecological impacts]] —  such as [[biodiversity]], [[water quality]], [[air quality]], [[Habitat conservation|habitat quality]], species [[population]], etc.
* [[Economic efficiency]] — commonly expressed as benefits and costs.
* [[Welfare economics|Distributional equity]] — how policy impacts are distributed amongst different demographics. Factors that can affect the distribution of impacts include location, ethnicity, income, and occupation.
* [[Cultural psychology|Social/Cultural acceptability]] — the extent to which the policy action may be opposed by current [[Norm (social)|social norms]] or [[Value theory|cultural values]].
* [[Implementation|Operational practicality]] — the capacity required to actually operationalize the policy.
* Legality — the potential for the policy to be implemented under current legislation versus the need to pass new legislation that accommodates the policy.
* Uncertainty — the degree to which the level of policy impacts can be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Loomis, John |author2=Helfand, Gloria |title=Environmental Policy Analysis for Decision Making |publisher=Kluwer Academic |year=2001 |isbn=0-7923-6500-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criteria, such as economic benefit, will be more easily measurable or definable, while others such as environmental quality will be harder to measure or express quantitatively. Ultimately though, the set of decision criteria needs to embody all of the policy goals, and overemphasising the more easily definable or measurable criteria, will have the undesirable impact of biasing the analysis towards a subset of the policy goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weimer|Vining|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of identifying a suitably comprehensive decision criteria set is also vulnerable to being skewed by pressures arising at the political interface. For example, decision makers may tend to give "''more weight to policy impacts that are concentrated, tangible, certain, and immediate than to impacts that are diffuse, intangible, uncertain, and delayed''."^8. For example, with a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions the net financial cost in the first five years of policy implementation is a far easier impact to conceptualise than the more diffuse and uncertain impact of a country's improved position to influence [[Post–Kyoto Protocol negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions|global negotiations on climate change action]].

===Decision methods for policy analysis — Step 5===

Displaying the impacts of policy alternatives can be done using a policy analysis matrix (PAM) such that shown in Table 1. As shown, a PAM provides a summary of the policy impacts for the various alternatives and examination of the matrix can reveal the tradeoffs associated with the different alternatives.

Table 1. Policy analysis matrix (PAM) for SO2 emissions control.

Once policy alternatives have been evaluated, the next step is to decide which policy alternative should be implemented. This is shown as step 5 in Figure 1. At one extreme, comparing the policy alternatives can be relatively simple if all the policy goals can be measured using a single metric and given equal weighting. In this case, the decision method is an exercise in benefit cost analysis (BCA).
 
At the other extreme, the numerous goals will require the policy impacts to be expressed using a variety of metrics that are not readily comparable. In such cases, the policy analyst may draw on the concept of utility to aggregate the various goals into a single score. With the utility concept, each impact is given a weighting such that 1 unit of each weighted impact is considered to be equally valuable (or desirable) with regards to the collective well-being.

Weimer and Vining also suggest that the "''go, no go''" rule can be a useful method for deciding amongst policy alternatives^8. Under this decision making regime, some or all policy impacts can be assigned thresholds which are used to eliminate at least some of the policy alternatives. In their example, one criterion "''is to minimize SO2 emissions''" and so a threshold might be a reduction SO2 emissions "of at least 8.0 million tons per year". As such, any policy alternative that does not meet this threshold can be removed from consideration. If only a single policy alternative satisfies all the impact thresholds then it is the one that is considered a "go" for each impact. Otherwise it might be that all but a few policy alternatives are eliminated and those that remain need to be more closely examined in terms of their trade-offs so that a decision can be made.

===Case study of rational policy analysis===

To demonstrate the rational analysis process as described above, let’s examine the policy paper “Stimulating the use of biofuels in the European Union: Implications for climate change policy” by Lisa Ryan where the substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels has been proposed in the European Union (EU) between 2005–2010 as part of a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from road transport, increase security of energy supply and support development of rural communities.

Considering the steps of Patton and Sawicki model as in Figure 1 above, this paper only follows components 1 to 5 of the rationalist policy analysis model:

# Defining The Problem – the report identifies transportation fuels pose two important challenges for the European Union (EU). First, under the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol to the Climate Change Convention, the EU has agreed to an absolute cap on greenhouse gas emissions; while, at the same time increased consumption of transportation fuels has resulted in a trend of increasing greenhouse gas emissions from this source. Second, the dependence upon oil imports from the politically volatile Middle East generates concern over price fluctuations and possible interruptions in supply. Alternative fuel sources need to be used &amp; substituted in place of fossil fuels to mitigate GHG emissions in the EU.
# Determine the Evaluation Criteria – this policy sets Environmental impacts/benefits (reduction of GHG’s as a measure to reducing climate change effects) and Economical efficiency (the costs of converting to biofuels as alternative to fossil fuels &amp; the costs of production of biofuels from its different potential sources)as its decision criteria.  However, this paper does not exactly talk about the social impacts, this policy may have. It also does not compare the operational challenges involved between the different categories of biofuels considered.
# Identifying Alternative Policies – The European Commission foresees that three alternative transport fuels: hydrogen, natural gas, and biofuels, will replace transport fossil fuels, each by 5% by 2020.
# Evaluating Alternative Policies – Biofuels are an alternative motor vehicle fuel produced from biological material and are promoted as a transitional step until more advanced technologies have matured. By modelling the efficiency of the biofuel options the authors compute the economic and environmental costs of each biofuel option as per the evaluation criteria mentioned above.
# Select The Preferred Policy – The authors suggest that the overall best biofuel comes from the sugarcane in Brazil after comparing the economic &amp; the environmental costs. The current cost of subsidising the price difference between European biofuels and fossil fuels per tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions saved is calculated to be €229–2000. If the production of European biofuels for transport is to be encouraged, exemption from excise duties is the instrument that incurs the least transactions costs, as no separate administrative or collection system needs to be established. A number of entrepreneurs are producing biofuels at the lower margin of the costs specified here profitably, once an excise duty rebate is given. It is likely that growth in the volume of the business will engender both economies of scale and innovation that will reduce costs substantially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2005.06.010 |author1=Ryan L. |author2=Convery F. |author3=Ferreira S. |title=Stimulating the use of biofuels in the European Union: Implications for climate change policy |journal=Energy Policy |volume=34 |issue=17 |pages=3184–94 |date=November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements and limitations==
However, there are a lot of assumptions, requirements without which the rational decision model is a failure. Therefore, they all have to be considered. 
The model assumes that we have or should or can obtain adequate information, both in terms of quality, quantity and accuracy. This applies to the situation as well as the alternative technical situations. It further assumes that you have or should or can obtain substantive knowledge of the cause and effect relationships relevant to the evaluation of the alternatives. In other words, it assumes that you have a thorough knowledge of all the alternatives and the consequences of the alternatives chosen. It further assumes that you can rank the alternatives and choose the best of it. 
The following are the limitations for the Rational Decision Making Model:

* requires a great deal of time
* requires great deal of information
* assumes rational, measurable criteria are available and agreed upon
* assumes accurate, stable and complete knowledge of all the alternatives, preferences, goals and consequences
* assumes a rational, reasonable, non – political world

==Current status==
While the rational planning model was innovative at its conception, the concepts are controversial and '''questionable processes today.''' The rational planning model has fallen out of mass use as of the last decade. Rather than conceptualising human agents as rational planners, [[Lucy Suchman]] argues, agents can better be understood as engaging in [[situated action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|title=Human-Machine Reconfigurations: Plans and Situation Action|year=2007|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going further, [[Guy Benveniste]] argued that the rational model could not be implemented without taking the political context into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benveniste|first=Guy|title=Mastering the Politics of Planning|year=1994|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ethnography'', Sept 2010, 11, 331-357&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it can be viewed as a landscape type in its own right, one forged from an interaction of urban and rural land uses.

== Definition ==

Its definition shifts depending on the global location, but typically in Europe, where urban areas are intensively managed to prevent [[urban sprawl]] and protect agricultural land, the urban fringe will be characterised by certain land uses which have either purposely moved away from the urban area, or require much larger tracts of land. As examples:

* Roads, especially motorways and bypasses
* Waste transfer stations, [[recycling]] facilities and landfill sites
* [[Park and ride]] sites
* Airports
* Large hospitals
* Power, water and sewerage facilities
* Factories
* Large out-of-town shopping facilities, e.g. large supermarkets

Despite these 'urban' uses, the fringe remains largely open, with the majority of the land agricultural, woodland or other rural use. However, the quality of the countryside around urban areas tends to be low, with severance between the area of open land and bad maintained woodlands and hedgerows.

In recent years there has been a growing interest in how the full environmental and social potential of the urban fringe can be unlocked. In England in 2005, the Countryside Agency (now part of [[Natural England]]) together with Groundwork, a community and environmental regeneration body, produced a vision for the 'countryside in and around towns' that sets out ten 'functions' for a multi-functional urban fringe.&lt;ref&gt;http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/105001  Green Infrastructure
and the Urban Fringe: Learning lessons from the Countryside in and Around Towns Programme (Countryside Agency and Groundwork UK, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The realisation of this vision would{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} provide a high-quality environment right on the urban doorstep and provide the adjacent town or city with a host of '[[ecosystem services]]'. It is estimated{{By whom|date=February 2010}} that within England the urban fringe covers as much as 20% of the land area. Such an extensive resource must be managed and used more intelligently and sustainably if the country as a whole is to develop and function sustainably.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the [[United States]] urban areas are defined as contiguous territory having a density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile, though in some areas the density may be as low as 500 per square mile. Urban areas also include the outlying territory of less density if it was connected to the core of the contiguous area by road and is within 2.5 road miles of that core, or within 5 road miles of the core but separated by water or other undevelopable territories. Other territory with a population density of fewer than 1,000 people per square mile is included in the urban fringe if it eliminates an enclave or closes an indentation in the boundary of the urbanized area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/fedreg/fedregv76n164.pdf| title=Urban Area Criteria for the 2010 Census; Notice| author=Department of Commerce - Census Bureau| work=Federal Register| publisher=National Archives and Records Administration| date=August 24, 2011| access-date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual assault''' is an act in which a person intentionally sexually touches another person without that person's [[consent]], or [[Coercion|coerces]] or physically forces a person to engage in a [[sexual act]] against their will.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Peter Cameron, George Jelinek, Anne-Maree Kelly, Anthony F.

&lt;!--Hidden because it sounds ridiculous to most people except maybe lawyers, who can rephrase this legalese better to say that sexual assault is of course an offense in all countries despite being defined differently in different countries and at different times: In legal terms, sexual assault is a [[statutory]] offense in various jurisdictions, including the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]], [[Ireland]], and [[Scotland]]. The legal definition of the crime of sexual assault is determined by each [[jurisdiction]]. Specific legal jurisdictions and research often use highly technical or detailed definitions of the term.--&gt;

== Definition ==
Generally, sexual assault is defined as unwanted sexual contact. The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] defines sexual assault as "unwanted sexual contact that stops short of rape or attempted rape. This includes sexual touching and fondling."&lt;ref name="RAINN" /&gt;

The National Center for Victims of Crime states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/dna-resource-center/sexual-assault-kit-backlog-reduction/about-sexual-assault#1 |title=The National Center for Victims of Crime – Library/Document Viewer |publisher=Ncvc.org |accessdate=9 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720051156/http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/dna-resource-center/sexual-assault-kit-backlog-reduction/about-sexual-assault#1 |archivedate=20 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Sexual assault takes many forms including attacks such as rape or attempted rape, as well as any unwanted sexual contact or threats. Usually a sexual assault occurs when someone touches any part of another person's body in a sexual way, even through clothes, without that person's consent.}}

In the [[United States]], the definition of sexual assault varies widely among the individual states. However, in most states sexual assault occurs when there is lack of consent from one of the individuals involved. Consent must take place between two adults who are not incapacitated and can change during any time during the sexual act.

Approximately 30 percent of the perpetrators are relatives of the child- most often brothers, fathers, mothers, sisters and uncles or cousins. Around 60 percent are other acquaintances such as friends of the family, babysitters, or neighbors. Strangers are the offenders in approximately 10 percent of child sexual abuse cases.&lt;ref name=Whealin /&gt;

Studies have shown that the psychological damage is particularly severe when sexual assault is committed by parents against children due to the incestuous nature of the assault.&lt;ref name="Courtois" /&gt; Incest between a child or adolescent and a related adult has been identified as the most widespread form of child sexual abuse with a huge capacity for damage to a child.&lt;ref name="Courtois" /&gt; Often, sexual assault on a child is not reported by the child for several of the following reasons:

*children are too young to recognize their victimization or put it into words
*they were threatened or bribed by the abuser
*they feel confused by fearing the abuser
*they are afraid no one will believe them
*they blame themselves or believe the abuse is a punishment

=== Domestic violence ===
{{Main|Domestic violence}}
Domestic violence is a crime of power and intimidation. It is strongly correlated with sexual assault. Not only can domestic abuse be emotional, physical, psychological and financial, but it can be sexual. Some of the signs of sexual abuse are similar to those of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=womensaidfederationofengland&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic_violence_topic.asp?section=0001000100220022&amp;item |title=Sexual Violence |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123718/http://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic_violence_topic.asp?section=0001000100220022&amp;item |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elderly sexual assault ===
{{Main|Elder abuse}}
Elderly sexual assault is [[victimization]] of persons over the age of 60, most of whom suffer from decreased functionality, frailty and weakness, and therefore are reliant on caretakers. Only 30 percent of people age 65 or older who are victimized report the assault to the police. The most common assailants are caretakers, adult children, spouses and fellow facility residents.
Signs that an elder is being assaulted include increased vaginal tearing, bleeding, bruising, infection, pelvic injury, soft tissue or bone injury. Also, an altered mood might be an indication of sexual assault. These symptoms include extreme agitation, post-traumatic stress disorder, withdrawal, panic attacks, STDs, exacerbation of existing illness, sleep disturbances and longer recovery times.&lt;ref name="pcar.org" /&gt;

=== Groping ===
{{Main|Groping}}
The term ''groping'' is used to define the touching or fondling of another person in a sexual way without the person's consent. Groping may occur under or over clothing.

=== Rape ===
{{Main|Rape}}

Outside of law, the term rape, "an [[assault]] by a person involving [[sexual intercourse]] with another person without that person's [[consent]]", is often used interchangeably with sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Victimology: Theories and Applications"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roberts, Albert R. |author2=Ann Wolbert Bergess |author3=CHERYL REGEHR |title=Victimology: Theories and Applications |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2009 |page=228 |isbn=978-0-7637-7210-9 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=erFiYbLL9McC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=definition+of+rape&amp;q=definition%20of%20rape |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Violence against women"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech.2004.022756 |title=Violence against women |year=2005 |last1=Krantz |first1=G. |journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health |volume=59 |issue=10 |pages=818–21 |pmid=16166351 |last2=Garcia-Moreno |first2=C |pmc=1732916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although closely related, the two terms are technically distinct in most jurisdictions.

=== Sexual harassment ===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is [[intimidation]], [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature. It may also be defined as the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paludi | first = Michele Antoinette | authorlink = |author2=Barickman, | title = Academic and Workplace Sexual Harassment | publisher = SUNY Press | year = 1991 | location = | pages = 2–5 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7914-0829-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, sexual harassment is a form of discrimination which violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The legal and social definition of what constitutes sexual harassment differ widely by culture. Sexual harassment includes a wide range of behaviors from seemingly mild transgressions to serious forms of abuse. Some forms of sexual harassment overlap with sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Dziech et al. 1990, Boland 2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC): "Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Sexual Harassment|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html|website=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=18 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711064654/https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html|archivedate=11 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=2002-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*79% of victims are women, 21% are men
** 51% are harassed by a supervisor
** Business, Trade, Banking, and Finance are the biggest industries where sexual harassment occurs
** 12% received threats of termination if they did not comply with their requests
* 26,000 people in the armed forces were assaulted in 2012&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[18]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
** 302 of the 2,558 cases pursued by victims were prosecuted
** 38% of the cases were committed by someone of a higher rank
* Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
** [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is a federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. It generally applies to employers with 15 or more employees, including federal, state, and local governments. Title VII also applies to private and public colleges and universities, employment agencies, and labor organizations.&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[19]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
** "It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer … to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Mass sexual assault ===
{{further|Mass sexual assault}}
Mass sexual assault takes place in public places and in crowds. It involves large groups of men surrounding and assaulting a woman, groping, manual penetration, and [[Non-penetrative sex#Frottage|frottage]], but usually stopping short of penile rape.

== Emotional effects ==
Aside from physical traumas, rape and other sexual assault often result in long-term emotional effects, particularly in child victims. These can include:
[[denial]], [[learned helplessness]], [[genophobia]], [[anger]], [[self-blame]], [[anxiety]], [[shame]], [[nightmare]]s, [[fear]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s, [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]], [[mood disorder|moodswings]], [[numbness]], [[promiscuity]], [[loneliness]], [[social anxiety]], difficulty trusting oneself or others, difficulty concentrating. Being the victim of sexual assault may lead to the development of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], [[addiction]], [[major depressive disorder]] or other [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]].
Family and friends experience emotional scarring including a strong desire for [[revenge]], a desire to "fix' the problem and/or move on, and a rationalization that "it wasn't that bad".&lt;ref name="pcar.org" /&gt;

== Physical effects ==
While sexual assault, including rape, can result in physical trauma, many people who experience sexual assault will not suffer any physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy KM, Heterogeneity of existing research relating to sexual violence, sexual assault and rape precludes meta-analysis of injury data. Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine. (2013), 20(5):447–459&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rape myths]] suggest that the stereotypical victim of sexual violence is a bruised and battered young woman. The central issue in many cases of rape or other sexual assault is whether or not both parties consented to the sexual activity or whether or not both parties had the capacity to do so. Thus, physical force resulting in visible physical injury is not always seen. This stereotype can be damaging because people who have experienced sexual assault but have no physical trauma may be less inclined to report to the authorities or to seek health care.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy KM, The relationship of victim injury to the progression of sexual crimes through the criminal justice system, Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine 2012:19(6):309-311&lt;/ref&gt; However, women who experienced rape or physical violence by a partner were more likely than people who had not experienced this violence to report frequent headaches, chronic pain, difficulty sleeping, activity limitation, poor physical health, and poor mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Dupain Mandi, Developing and Implementing a Sexual Assault Violence Prevention and Awareness Campaign at a State-Supported Regional University. American Journal of Health Studies. 29. 4. (2014). 264. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic effects ==
Due to rape or sexual assault, or the threat of, there are many resulting impacts on income and commerce at the macro level. Each sexual assault (excluding child abuse) costs $5,100 in tangible losses (lost productivity, medical and mental health care, police/fire services, and property damage) plus $81,400 in lost quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/victcost.pdf|title=Victim Costs and Consequences: A New Look|last=Miller, Cohen, &amp; Weirsema|first=|date=1996|website=|publisher=National Institute of Justice|access-date=September 1, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515043800/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/victcost.pdf|archivedate=15 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue has been addressed in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In his dissenting opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[U.S. v. Morrison]]'', Justice Souter explained that 75% of women never go to the movies alone at night and nearly 50% will not ride public transportation out of fear of rape or sexual assault. It also stated that less than 1% of victims collect damages and 50% of women lose their jobs or quit after the trauma. The court ruled in ''U.S. v. Morrison'' that Congress did not have the authority to enact part of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] because it did not have a direct impact on commerce. The [[Commerce Clause]] of Article I Section VII of the [[U.S. Constitution]] gives authority and jurisdiction to the Federal government in matters of interstate commerce. As a result, the victim was unable to sue her attacker in Federal Court.

Sexual assault also has adverse economic effects for survivors on the micro level. For instance, survivors of sexual assault often require time off from work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nij.gov/publications/pages/publication-detail.aspx?ncjnumber=210346|title=Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Rape Victimization: Findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey|last=Tjaden &amp; Thoennes|first=|date=2006|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs|access-date=2016-09-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916062148/http://www.nij.gov/publications/pages/publication-detail.aspx?ncjnumber=210346|archivedate=16 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and face increased rates of unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrne|first=Christina A.|last2=Resnick|first2=Heidi S.|last3=Kilpatrick|first3=Dean G.|last4=Best|first4=Connie L.|last5=Saunders|first5=Benjamin E.|title=The socioeconomic impact of interpersonal violence on women|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=67|issue=3|pages=362–366|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.67.3.362|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors of rape by an intimate partner lose an average of $69 per day due to unpaid time off from work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chrisler|first=Joan C.|last2=Ferguson|first2=Sheila|date=2006-11-01|title=Violence against Women as a Public Health Issue|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=1087|issue=1|pages=235–249|doi=10.1196/annals.1385.009|pmid=17189508|issn=1749-6632|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual assault is also associated with numerous negative employment consequences, including unpaid time off, diminished work performance, job loss, and inability to work, all of which can lead to lower earnings for survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loya|first=Rebecca M.|date=2015-10-01|title=Rape as an Economic Crime The Impact of Sexual Violence on Survivors' Employment and Economic Well-Being|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/30/16/2793|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|language=en|volume=30|issue=16|pages=2793–2813|doi=10.1177/0886260514554291|issn=0886-2605|pmid=25381269|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118035347/http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/30/16/2793|archivedate=18 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical and psychological treatment of victims ==
In the [[emergency room]], emergency [[contraceptive]] medications are offered to women raped by men because about 5% of such rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis&gt;{{cite book | author = Varcarolis, Elizabeth| year = 2013 | title = Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing | location = St. Louis | publisher = Elsevier | pages = 439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Preventative healthcare|Preventative]] medication against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s are given to victims of all types of sexual assault (especially for the most common diseases like [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[bacterial vaginosis]]) and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs (such as [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has also been proposed as a psychiatric treatment for victims of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Posmontier B, Dovydaitis T, Lipman K.

== Post-assault mistreatment of victims ==

{{Main|Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims}}

After the assault, victims may become the target of [[slut-shaming]] to [[cyberbullying]]. In addition, their credibility may be challenged. During criminal proceedings, [[publication ban]]s and [[rape shield laws]] may operate to protect victims from excessive public scrutiny. Negative social responses to victims’ disclosures of sexual assault have the potential to lead to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] symptoms. [[Social isolation]], following a sexual assault, can result in the victim experiencing a decrease in their [[self-esteem]] and likelihood of rejecting unwanted sexual advances in the future.&lt;ref&gt; Relyea, M., &amp; Ullman, S. E. (2013). "Unsupported or Turned Against. Psychology of Women Quarterly", 39(1), 37-52. doi:10.1177/0361684313512610&lt;/ref&gt;

Several research based rape prevention programs have been tested and verified through scientific studies. The rape prevention programs that have the strongest empirical data in the research literature include the following:

The Men's and Women's Programs, also known as the One in Four programs, were written by John Foubert.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Foubert |first=John |title=The Men's and Women's Programs: Ending Rape Through Peer Education |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-88105-0}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is focused on increasing empathy toward rape survivors and motivating people to intervene as bystanders in sexual assault situations. Published data shows that high-risk persons who saw the Men's and Women's Program committed 40% fewer acts of sexually coercive behavior than those who didn’t. They also committed acts of sexual coercion that were 8 times less severe than a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2202/1949-6605.1866 |title=Behavior Differences Seven Months Later: Effects of a Rape Prevention Program |year=2008 |last1=Foubert |first1=John D. |last2=Newberry |first2=Johnathan T |last3=Tatum |first3=Jerry |journal=Journal of Student Affairs Research and Practice |volume=44 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research also shows that people who saw the Men's and Women's Program reported more efficacy in intervening and greater willingness to help as a bystander after seeing the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1077801211409728 |title=The Men's Program: Does It Impact College Men's Self-Reported Bystander Efficacy and Willingness to Intervene? |year=2011 |last1=Langhinrichsen-Rohling |first1=J. |last2=Foubert |first2=J.

Bringing in the Bystander was written by Victoria Banyard. Its focus is on who bystanders are, when they have helped, and how to intervene as a bystander in risky situations. The program includes a brief empathy induction component and a pledge to intervene in the future. Several studies show strong evidence of favorable outcomes including increased bystander efficacy, increased willingness to intervene as a bystander, and decreased rape myth acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Moynihan &amp; Plante, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Plante &amp; Moynihan, 2004{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Ward, Cohn, Plante, Moorhead, &amp; Walsh, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MVP: Mentors in Violence Prevention was written by Jackson Katz. This program focuses on discussing a male bystander who didn't intervene when woman was in danger. An emphasis is placed on encouraging men to be active bystanders rather than standing by when they notice abuse. The bulk of the presentation is on processing hypothetical scenarios. Outcomes reported in research literature include lower levels of sexism and increased belief that participants could prevent violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;Cissner, 2009{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Dot program was written by Dorothy Edwards. This program includes both motivational speeches and peer education focused on bystander intervention. Outcomes show that program participation is associated with reductions in rape myth acceptance and increased bystander intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Coker, Cook-Craig, Williams, Fisher, Clear, Garcia &amp; Hegge, 2011{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Edmonton, Canada, initiated a public education campaign aimed at potential perpetrators. Posters in bar bathrooms and public transit centers reminded men that "It's not sex when she's wasted" and "It's not sex when he changes his mind". The campaign was so effective that it spread to other cities. "The number of reported sexual assaults fell by 10 per cent last year in Vancouver, after the ads were featured around the city. It was the first time in several years that there was a drop in sexual assault activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/01/edmonton-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign-dont-be-that-guy_n_2224228.html|title=Edmonton Sexual Assault Awareness Campaign: 'Don't Be That Guy' So Effective City Relaunches With New Posters (PHOTOS)|website=Huffingtonpost.ca|date=December 2012|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902053213/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/01/edmonton-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign-dont-be-that-guy_n_2224228.html|archivedate=2 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden introduced in September 2014 a nationwide campaign against sexual assault entitled "It's on us". The campaign includes tips against sexual assault, as well as broad scale of private and public pledges to change to provoke a cultural shift, with a focus on student activism, to achieve awareness and prevention nationwide. UC Berkeley, NCAA and Viacom have publicly announced their partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbott|first1=Katy|title=White House announces college-campus sexual assault awareness campaign|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/19/white-house-announces-campus-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign/|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921151622/http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/19/white-house-announces-campus-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign/|archivedate=21 September 2014|df=dmy-all|date=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''College'''
{{main|Campus sexual assault}}

In the United States, several studies since 1987 have indicated that one in four college women have experienced rape or attempted rape at some point in their lifetime. These studies are based on anonymous surveys of college women, not reports to the police, and the results are disputed.&lt;ref name="leaderu1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209074942/http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, nearly two thirds of students reported knowing victims of rape and over half reported knowing perpetrators of sexual assault. One in ten reported knowing a victim of rape when alcohol was not involved and 22.6% reported knowing a victim of alcohol-facilitated rape.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson SB, Joshi M, Sivitz E. Knowing a sexual assault victim or perpetrator: A stratified random sample of undergraduates at one university. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2014; 29: 394-416&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary ''The Hunting Ground'', the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses is brought to attention. The schools poor judicial systems are scrutinized for not helping the victims and trying to keep these issues from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c42646ae-b960-4c12-bf53-6795dad55875%40sessionmgr107&amp;vid=14&amp;hid=107 | title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Texas A&amp;M University]] professor Jason Lindo and his colleagues analyzed over two decades worth of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] data, noting that reports of rape increased 15-57% around the times of major [[American Football]] games at [[NCAA Division I|Division 1]] schools while attempting to find a link between campus rape and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/29/the-disturbing-truth-about-college-football-and-rape/|title=The disturbing truth about college football and rape|first=Danielle|last=Paquette|publisher=The Washington Post|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825194112/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/29/the-disturbing-truth-about-college-football-and-rape/|archivedate=25 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 report from the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] titled "The Sexual Victimization of College Women" reports that 3.1% of undergraduates survived rape or attempted rape during a 6–7 month academic year with an additional 10.1% surviving rape prior to college and an additional 10.9% surviving attempted rape prior to college. With no overlap between these groups, these percentages add to 24.1%, or "One in Four".&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Cullen &amp; Turner, 2006{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski published a study in 1987 where they interviewed approximately 6,000 college students on 32 college campuses nationwide. They asked several questions covering a wide range of behaviors. From this study 15% of college women answered "yes" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of rape. An additional 12% of women answered "yes" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of attempted rape, thus the statistic One in Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.55.2.162 |title=The scope of rape: Incidence and prevalence of sexual aggression and victimization in a national sample of higher education students |year=1987 |last1=Koss |first1=Mary P. |last2=Gidycz |first2=Christine A. |last3=Wisniewski |first3=Nadine |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=162–70 |pmid=3494755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A point of contention lies in the leading nature of the questions in the study conducted by Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski. Koss herself later admitted that the question that had garnered the largest "rape" result was flawed and ultimately rendered the study invalid. Most prominently the problem was that many respondents who had answered yes to several questions had their responses treated as having been raped. The issue being that these same respondents did not feel they had been victimized and never sought redress for grievances. The resultant change shows a prevalence of only 1 in 22 college women having been raped or attempted to be raped during their time at college.&lt;ref name="leaderu1" /&gt;

In 1995, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] replicated part of this study, however they examined rape only, and did not look at attempted rape. They used a two-stage cluster sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years. The first-stage sampling frame contained 2,919 primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of 2- and 4-year colleges and universities. The second sampling stage consisted of a random sample drawn from the primary sample unit frame enrolled in the 136 participating colleges and universities to increase the sample size to 4,609 undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years old with a representative sample demographic matching the national demographic. Differential sampling rates of the PSU were used to ensure sufficient numbers of male and female, black and Hispanic students in the total sample population. After differential sample weighting, female students represented 55.5% of the sample; white students represented 72.8% of the sample, black students 10.3%, Hispanic students 7.1%, and 9.9% were other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|title=Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance: National College Health Risk Behavior Survey -- United States, 1995|work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=14 November 1997|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619204741/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|archivedate=19 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that nationwide, 13.1% of college students reported that they had been forced to have sexual intercourse against their will during their lifetime. Female students were significantly more likely than male students to report they had ever been forced to have sexual intercourse; 20% of approximately 2500 females (55% of 4,609 samples) and 3.9% of males reported experiencing rape thus far in the course of their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07448489709595589 |title=Results from the 1995 National College Health Risk Behavior Survey |year=1997 |last1=Douglas |first1=Kathy A. |last2=Collins |first2=Janet L. |last3=Warren |first3=Charles |last4=Kann |first4=Laura |last5=Gold |first5=Robert |last6=Clayton |first6=Sonia |last7=Ross |first7=James G. |last8=Kolbe |first8=Lloyd J. |journal=Journal of American College Health |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=55–66 |pmid=9276349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies concerning the annual incidence of rape, some studies conclude an occurrence of 5%.

== By jurisdiction ==

=== Australia ===

Within Australia, the term sexual assault is used to describe a variation of sexual offences. This is due to a variety of definitions and use of terminology to describe sexual offences within territories and states as each territory and state have their own legislation to define rape, attempted rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual penetration or intercourse without consent and sexual violence.

In the State of New South Wales, sexual assault is a statutory offence punishable under s 61I of the [[Crimes Act 1900]]. The term "sexual assault" is equivalent to "rape" in ordinary parlance, while all other assaults of a sexual nature are termed "indecent assault".

To be liable for punishment under the [[Crimes Act 1900]], an offender must intend to commit an act of sexual intercourse as defined under s 61H(1) while having one of the states of knowledge of non-consent defined under s 61HA(3). But note that s 61HA(3) is an objective standard which only require the person has no reasonable grounds for believing the other person is consenting.&lt;ref&gt;See Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 61 HA (3)&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty for sexual assault is 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s 61H(1) Crimes Act 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggravated sexual assault is sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years under s 61J of the Crimes Act.

In the state of Victoria, rape is punishable under s 38 of the Crimes Act 1958, with a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1958 (VIC)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of South Australia, rape is punishable under s 48 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) with a maximum term of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of Western Australia, sexual penetration is punishable under s 325 the Criminal Code Act 1913 with a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1913 (WA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Northern Territory, offences of sexual intercourse and gross indecency without consent are punishable under s 192 of the Criminal Code Act 1983 and punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1983 (NT)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Queensland, rape and sexual assault are punishable under s 349, Chapter 32 of the Criminal Code Act 1899 with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1899 (QLD)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tasmania, rape is punishable under s 185 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 with a maximum punishment of 21 years under s389 of the Criminal Code Act 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code 1924 (TAS)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian Capital Territory, sexual assault is punishable under Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum punishment of 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual assault is considered a gendered crime which results in 85% of sexual assaults never coming to the attention of the criminal justice system according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2005). Personal Safety Survey. Canberra: ABS&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to low reporting rates, treatment of victims and distrust of the criminal justice system, difficulty in obtaining evidence and the belief in sexual assault myths.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, M. (2005). The law and sexual offences against adults in Australia (Issues No. 4). Melbourne: Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault&lt;/ref&gt;

However, once a person is charged, the public prosecutor will decide whether the case will proceed to trial based on whether there is sufficient evidence and whether a case is in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;Lievore, D. (2005). Prosecutorial decisions in adult sexual assault cases. Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice, 291, January. Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology&lt;/ref&gt; Once the matter has reached trial, the matter will generally be heard in the District Court. This is because sexually violent crimes are mostly categorised as indictable offences (serious offences), as opposed to summary offences (minor offences). Sexual offences can also be heard in the Supreme Court, but more generally if the matter is being heard as an appeal.

Once the matter is being heard, the prosecution must provide evidence which proves “beyond reasonable doubt” that the offence was committed by the defendant. The standard of proof is vital in checking the power of the State.&lt;ref name="aifs.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306040553/https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |archivedate=6 March 2017 |df=dmy-all |date=2011-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While as previously stated that each jurisdiction (State and Territory) has its own sexual offence legislation, there are many common elements to any criminal offence that advise on how the offence is defined and what must be proven by the prosecution in order to find the defendant guilty.&lt;ref name="aifs.gov.au"/&gt; These elements are known as Actus Reus which comprises the physical element (see Ryan v Regina [1967])&lt;ref&gt;Ryan v R [1967] HCA 2; 121 CLR 205&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mens Rea which comprises the mental element (see He Kaw Teh (1985)).&lt;ref&gt;He Kaw Teh v R (1985) 157 CLR 523&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable sexual assault cases which have resulted in convictions are Regina v Bilal Skaf [2005]&lt;ref&gt;R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297,16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and Regina v Mohommed Skaf [2005]&lt;ref&gt;R v Mohommed Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 298, 16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which were highly visible in New South Wales within the media the 2000s. These cases were closely watched by the media and led to legislative changes such as the passing of the Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62&lt;/ref&gt; which dramatically increased the sentences for ‘gang rapists’ by creating a new category of crime known as Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company. Changes were also made to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW&lt;/ref&gt; This change is known as the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3&lt;ref&gt;Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3&lt;/ref&gt; which expands the category of offences in respect of which a Local Court may receive and consider Victim Impact Statements to include some indictable offences which are usually dealt with summarily.

=== Canada ===
Sexual assault is defined as sexual contact with another person without that other person's consent. Consent is defined in section 273.1(1) as "''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''".

Section 265 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] defines the offences of [[assault]] and sexual assault.

Section 271 criminalizes "Sexual assault", section 272 criminalizes "Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm" and section 273 criminalizes "[[Aggravated sexual assault]]".

==== Consent ====
The absence of consent defines the crime of sexual assault. Section 273.1 (1) defines consent, section 273.1 (2) outlines certain circumstances where "no consent" is obtained, while section 273.1 (3) states that subsection (2) ''does not limit'' the circumstances where "no consent" is obtained (i.e. subsection (2) describes ''some'' circumstances which deem the act to be non-consensual, but other circumstances, not described in this section, can also deem the act as having been committed without consent). "No consent" to sexual assault is also subject to Section 265 (3), which also outlines several situations where the act is deemed non-consensual. In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[R. v. J.A.]]'' interpreted the provisions below to find that a person must have an active mind during the sexual activity in order to consent, and that they cannot give consent in advance.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |title=Criminal Code |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=9 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109205822/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman can't consent to sex while unconscious, Supreme Court rules |author=Mike Blanchfield |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612140715/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Meaning of “consent”''

''273.1'' (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), “consent” means, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, ''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''.

''Where no consent obtained''

(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where
(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;
(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;
(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;
(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity; or
(e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.

''Subsection (2) not limiting''

(3) Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the circumstances in which no consent is obtained.

*''Section 265(3)''

''Consent''

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of
(a) the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(b) threats or fear of the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(c) fraud; or
(d) the exercise of authority.

In accordance with 265 (4) an accused may use the defence that he or she believed that the complainant consented, but such a defence may be used only when "a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused's belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief"; furthermore according to section 273.2(b) the accused must show that he or she took reasonable steps in order to ascertain the complainant's consent, also 273.2(a) states that if the accused's belief steams from self-induced intoxication, or recklessness or wilful blindness than such belief is not a defence.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code" /&gt;

*''265 (4)''
''Accused’s belief as to consent''

(4) Where an accused alleges that he or she believed that the complainant consented to the conduct that is the subject-matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused’s belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.

*''Where belief in consent not a defence''

273.2 It is not a defence to a charge under section 271, 272 or 273 that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, where
(a) the accused’s belief arose from the accused’s

(i) self-induced intoxication, or

(ii) recklessness or wilful blindness; or
(b) the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.

=== Germany ===
Before 1997, the definition of rape was: "''Whoever compels a woman to have extramarital intercourse with him, or with a third person, by force or the threat of present danger to life or limb, shall be punished by not less than two years’ imprisonment''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/tjug/en/kun-tj010222e-4.htm|title=Kunarac, Vukovic and Kovac - Judgement - Part IV|website=Icty.org|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312233318/http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/tjug/en/kun-tj010222e-4.htm|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Section 177'''
:'''Sexual assault by use of force or threats; rape'''

#Whosoever coerces another person
##by force;
##by threat of imminent danger to life or limb; or
##by exploiting a situation in which the victim is unprotected and at the mercy of the offender,
#:to suffer sexual acts by the offender or a third person on their own person or to engage actively in sexual activity with the offender or a third person, shall be liable to imprisonment of not less than one year.
#In especially serious cases the penalty shall be imprisonment of not less than two years. An especially serious case typically occurs if
##the offender performs sexual intercourse with the victim or performs similar sexual acts with the victim, or allows them to be performed on himself by the victim, especially if they degrade the victim or if they entail penetration of the body (rape); or
##the offence is committed jointly by more than one person.

Subsections (3), (4) and (5) provide additional stipulations on sentencing depending on aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

Section 178 provides that "''If the offender through sexual assault or rape (section 177) causes the death of the victim at least by gross negligence the penalty shall be imprisonment for life or not less than ten years''."

=== Republic of Ireland ===
As in many other jurisdictions, the term sexual assault is generally used to describe non-penetrative sexual offences. Section 2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act of 1981 states that a man has committed rape if he has sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it, and at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she does or does not consent to it. Under Section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape Amendment) Act of 1990, rape means a sexual assault that includes penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis or penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person. The maximum penalty for rape in Ireland is imprisonment for life.&lt;ref&gt;National SATU Guidelines Development Group.

=== South Africa ===
The [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act]] created the offence of sexual assault, replacing a common-law offence of [[indecent assault]]. "Sexual assault" is defined as the unlawful and intentional sexual violation of another person without their consent. The Act's definition of "sexual violation" incorporates a number of sexual acts, including any genital contact that does not amount to penetration as well as any contact with the mouth designed to cause sexual arousal. Non-consensual acts that involve actual penetration are rape rather than sexual assault.

Unlawfully and intentionally inspiring the belief in another person that they will be sexually violated also amounts to sexual assault. The Act also created the offences of "compelled sexual assault", when a person forces a second person to commit an act of sexual violation with a third person; and "compelled self-sexual assault", when a person forces another person to masturbate or commit various other sexual acts on theirself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |title=Welcome to the official South African government online site! &amp;#124; South African Government |website=Info.gov.za |date=2016-08-11 |accessdate=2016-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081854/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

==== England and Wales ====
Sexual assault is a statutory offence in [[England and Wales]]. It is created by section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] which defines "sexual assault" as when a person (A)
{{quotation|
#intentionally touches another person (B),
#the touching is sexual,
#B does not consent to the touching, and
#A does not reasonably believe that B consents.}}
Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents.

Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section.

A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable—
#on [[Summary offence#United Kingdom|summary conviction]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or both;
#on [[Indictable offence|conviction on indictment]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/3|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015075433/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/3|archivedate=15 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Consent =====
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/74 Section 74] of the Sexual Offenses Act explains that "a person consents if he agrees by choice and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice".

[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/75 Section 75] clarifies what consent means

75 Evidential presumptions about consent

(1)If in proceedings for an offence to which this section applies it is proved—
(a)that the defendant did the relevant act,
(b)that any of the circumstances specified in subsection (2) existed, and
(c)that the defendant knew that those circumstances existed, the complainant is to be taken not to have consented to the relevant act unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he consented, and the defendant is to be taken not to have reasonably believed that the complainant consented unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he reasonably believed it.

(2)The circumstances are that—
(a)any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, using violence against the complainant or causing the complainant to fear that immediate violence would be used against him;
(b)any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, causing the complainant to fear that violence was being used, or that immediate violence would be used, against another person;
(c)the complainant was, and the defendant was not, unlawfully detained at the time of the relevant act;
(d)the complainant was asleep or otherwise unconscious at the time of the relevant act;
(e)because of the complainant’s physical disability, the complainant would not have been able at the time of the relevant act to communicate to the defendant whether the complainant consented;
(f)any person had administered to or caused to be taken by the complainant, without the complainant’s consent, a substance which, having regard to when it was administered or taken, was capable of causing or enabling the complainant to be stupefied or overpowered at the time of the relevant act.

(3)In subsection (2)(a) and (b), the reference to the time immediately before the relevant act began is, in the case of an act which is one of a continuous series of sexual activities, a reference to the time immediately before the first sexual activity began.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12411">The '''TenTen Corpus Family''' (also called '''TenTen corpora''') is a set of comparable web [[text corpora]], i.e. collections of texts that have been [[Web crawler|crawled]] from the [[World Wide Web]] and processed to match the same standards. These corpora are made available through the [[Sketch Engine]] corpus manager. There are TenTen corpora for more than 35 languages. Their target size is 10 billion (10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) words per language, which gave rise to the corpus family's name.&lt;ref name="tenten"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Jakubíček|first1=Miloš|last2=Kilgarriff|first2=Adam|author-link2=Adam Kilgarriff|last3=Kovář|first3=Vojtěch|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Suchomel|first5=Vít|date=July 2013|title=The Tenten Corpus Family|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/The_TenTen_Corpus_2013.pdf|conference=7th International Corpus Linguistics Conference CL|location=Lancaster, UK|publisher=Lancaster University|pages=125–127|access-date=13 June 2017|book-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation of the TenTen corpora, data crawled from the World Wide Web are processed with [[natural language processing]] tools developed by the Natural Language Processing Centre at the Faculty of Informatics at [[Masaryk University]] ([[Brno]], [[Czech Republic]]) and by the Lexical Computing company (developer of the Sketch Engine).

== Corpus linguistics ==

In [[corpus linguistics]], a [[text corpus]] is a large and structured collection of texts that are electronically stored and processed. It is used to do hypothesis testing about languages, validating linguistic rules or the frequency distribution of words ([[n-grams]]) within languages. 

Electronically processed corpora provide fast search. Text processing procedures such as [[Lexical_analysis#Tokenization|tokenization]], [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[word-sense disambiguation]] enrich corpus texts with detailed linguistic information. This enables to narrow the search to a particular [[Part of speech|parts of speech]], word sequences or a specific part of the corpus.

First text corpora were created in the 1960s, such as the 1-million-word [[Brown Corpus]] of [[American English]]. Over time, many further corpora were produced (such as the [[British National Corpus]] and the [[Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus|LOB Corpus]]) and work had begun also on corpora of larger sizes and covering other languages than English. This development was linked with the emergence of corpus creation tools that help achieve larger size, wider coverage, cleaner data etc.

== Production of TenTen corpora ==
The procedure by which TenTen corpora are produced is based on the creators' earlier research in preparing web corpora and the subsequent processing thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Baroni|first1=Marco|last2=Kilgarriff|first2=Adam|author-link2=Adam Kilgarriff|last3=Kovář|first3=Vojtěch|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Suchomel|first5=Vít|date=July 2013|title=Large linguistically-processed web corpora for multiple languages|url=http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/marco/publications/eacl2006/dewac_eacl.pdf|conference=11th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Posters &amp; Demonstrations.

== TenTen corpora data structure ==
TenTen corpora follow a specific metadata structure that is common to all of them. Metadata is contained in structural attributes that relate to individual documents and paragraphs in the corpus. Some TenTen corpora can feature additional specific attributes.

=== Document attributes ===

*[[top-level domain]] – domain at the highest level of the hierarchical [[Domain Name System]] (e.g. "com")
*[[website]] – identification string defining a realm of administrative autonomy within the Internet (e.g. "wikipedia.org")
*[[Domain name|web domain]] – collection of related web pages  (e.g. "la.wikipedia.org")
*crawl date – date when the document was downloaded from the Web
*url – the [[Uniform Resource Locator]] referring to the document's source
*wordcount – number of words in the document
*length – classification of the document into a range by its length measured in thousands of words

=== Paragraph attributes ===

*[[Headline|heading]] – a numeric attribute distinguishing [[Page header|headers]] and similar titles from ordinary [[body text]] (1 if the paragraph is a heading, 0 otherwise)

      <comment>The use of [sic] here is bizarre, and implies that the usage is incorrect when it is not.  Anyone who doesn't know the meanings of the verb "to bear" can look it up in a dictionary.  And why would it be marked with a [sic] in Mormon usage, but not in the reference to Quaker usage?</comment>

{{Evidence law}}
In [[law]] and in [[religion]], '''testimony''' is a solemn attestation as to the truth of a matter.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
The words "testimony" and "testify" both derive from the [[Latin]] word ''testis'', referring to the notion of a disinterested [[Third-party source|third-party]] witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=testify|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=testify |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=testimony|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=testimony |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

In the [[law]], testimony is a form of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that is obtained from a [[witness]] who makes a solemn statement or declaration of fact. Testimony may be oral or written, and it is usually made by [[oath]] or [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] under penalty of [[perjury]]. To be admissible in court and for maximum reliability and validity, written testimony is usually witnessed by one or more persons who swear or affirm its authenticity also under penalty of perjury. Unless a witness is testifying as an [[expert witness]], testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is generally limited to those opinions or inferences that are rationally based on the perceptions of the witness and are helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony. 

Legitimate expert witnesses with a genuine understanding of legal process and the inherent dangers of false or misleading testimony refrain from making statements of fact. They also recognize that they are in fact not witnesses to an alleged crime or other event in any way, shape or form. Their expertise is in the examination of evidence or relevant facts in the case. They should make no firm judgement or claim or accusation about any aspect of the case outside their narrow range of expertise. They also should not allege any fact they can't immediately and credibly prove scientifically.
 
For example, a hair sample from a crime scene entered as evidence by the prosecution should be described by an expert witness as "consistent with" a sample collected from the defendant, rather than being described as a "match". A wide range of factors make it physically impossible to prove for certain that two hair or tissue samples came from a common source.

Having not actually witnessed the defendant at the scene, the expert witness can not state for a fact that the sample is a match to the defendant, particularly when the samples were collected at different times and different places by different collectors using different collection methods. Ultimately, the testimony of expert witnesses is regarded as supportive of evidence rather than evidence in and of itself, and a good defense attorney will point out that the expert witness is not in fact a witness to anything, but rather an observer.

When a witness is asked a question, the opposing attorney can raise an [[Objection (law)|objection]], which is a legal move to disallow or prevent an improper question to others, preferably before the witness answers, and mentioning one of the standard reasons, including:
* argumentative
* asked and answered
* [[best evidence rule]]
* calls for speculation
* calls for a conclusion
* [[compound question]] or narrative
* [[hearsay]]
* inflammatory
* incompetent witness (e.g., child, mental or physical impairment, intoxicated)
* irrelevant, immaterial (the words "irrelevant" and "immaterial" have the same meaning under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Historically, irrelevant evidence referred to evidence that has no probative value, i.e., does not tend to prove any fact. Immaterial refers to evidence that is probative, but not as to any fact material to the case. See Black's Law Dictionary, 7th Ed.).
* lack of foundation
* [[leading question]]
* [[privilege (evidence)|privilege]]
* vague
* [[ultimate issue (law)|ultimate issue testimony]]
There may also be an objection to the answer, including:
* non-responsive

Up until the mid-20th century, in much of the [[United States]], an attorney often had to follow an objection with an '''exception''' to preserve the issue for appeal. If an attorney failed to "take an exception" immediately after the court's ruling on the objection, he waived his client's right to appeal the issue. Exceptions have since been abolished, due to the widespread recognition that forcing lawyers to take them was a waste of time.

When a party uses the testimony of a witness to show proof, the opposing party often attempts to [[Witness impeachment|impeach]] the witness. This may be done using [[cross-examination]], calling into question the witness's [[Competence (law)|competence]], or by attacking the [[Character evidence|character]] or [[Habit evidence|habit]] of the witness. So, for example, if a witness testifies that he remembers seeing a person at 2:00 pm on a Tuesday and his habit is to be at his desk job on Tuesday, then the opposing party would try to impeach his testimony related to that event.

==Religion==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fasting]] --&gt;
[[Christians]] in general, especially within the [[Evangelical]] tradition, use the term "to testify" or "to give one's testimony" to mean "to tell the story of how one became a Christian". Commonly it may refer to a specific event in a Christian's life in which they believe God did something deemed particularly worth sharing. Christians often give their testimony at their own [[baptism]] or at [[evangelistic]] events. Many Christians have also published their testimonies on the internet.

===Types===
Many [[Holiness movement|holiness]] churches devote a portion of their mid-week service to allow members to give a personal testimony about their faith and experiences in living the Christian life.

In the [[Religious Society of Friends]], the word ''testimony'' is used to refer to the ways in which [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] ''testify'' or ''bear witness'' to their beliefs in their everyday lives. In this context, the word ''testimony'' refers not to the underlying belief, but the committed action which arises out of their beliefs, which ''testifies'' to their beliefs. Common areas which modern [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] are said to testify are [[peace testimony|testimony towards peace]], [[testimony of simplicity|testimony to simplicity]], [[testimony of integrity|testimony to truth and integrity]], [[testimony of equality|testimony to equality]].

In some [[religion]]s (most notably [[Mormonism]] and [[Islam]]) many adherents testify as a profession of their [[faith]], often to a congregation of believers. In [[Mormonism]], testifying is also referred to as "bearing one's testimony," and often involves the sharing of personal experience—ranging from a simple anecdote to an account of [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)#Personal revelation|personal revelation]]—followed by a statement of belief that has been confirmed by this experience. Within [[Mormon]] [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|culture]], the word "testimony"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://lds.org/study/topics/testimony?lang=eng |contribution= Testimony |title= Gospel Study: Study by Topic |work= LDS.org |publisher= [[LDS Church]] |date= |accessdate= 2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become synonymous with "belief." Although testimony and belief are often used interchangeably, they are inherently different. Most Mormons believe that when faith is acted upon, individuals can receive a spiritual witness which solidifies belief into testimony. Mormons are taught that if the exercise of faith brings forth good works, they can know their religious principles are true. An individual who no longer believes in the religion is referred to as having "lost their testimony."

==Literature==
[[File:Bataan Death March Testimonies.jpg|thumb|[[Bataan Death March|Bataan Death March Testimonies]]]]
Some published [[oral history|oral]] or written [[autobiography|autobiographical]] [[narrative]]s are considered "testimonial [[literature]]" particularly when they present [[evidence (law)|evidence]] or [[first-person narrative|first person]] accounts of [[human rights]] abuses, [[violence]] and [[war]], and living under conditions of social [[oppression]]. This usage of the term comes originally from [[Latin America]] and the Spanish term ''"testimonio"'' when it emerged from human rights [[tribunal]]s,  [[truth commissions]], and other [[international human rights instruments]] in countries such as [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. One of the most famous, though controversial, of these works to be translated into English is ''[[I, Rigoberta Menchú]]''. The autobiographies of [[Frederick Douglass]] can be considered among the earliest significant English-language works in this [[genre]].

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], a testimony is known as statements that are based on personal experience or personal knowledge. A statement is accepted on the basis of person's testimony if his or her asserting it renders it acceptable. We can also, rationally accept a claim on the basis of another person's testimony unless at least one of the following is found to be true:
# The claim is implausible;
# The person or the source in which the [[Cause of action|claim]] is quoted lacks [[credibility]];
# The claim goes beyond what the person could know from his or her own [[experience]] and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A practical study of Argument|edition=6th|author=[[Trudy Govier]]|origyear=1985|year=2005|isbn=9780534605254}} For the notion of testimony in general, and especially after David Hume, see the seminal research by C. A. J. Coady, Testimony: A Philosophical Study, Oxford 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The work of The Hague Institute was organized around three programs - Conflict Prevention, Rule of Law, and Global Governance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=About_Us-Organization-Our_Work&amp;pid=147 |title=Our Work |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and covered a wide range of issues including [[R2P]], education and conflict, climate change, water diplomacy, cyber security, mass atrocities, illicit financial flows and the role of institutions and governance such as the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), [[transitional justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Programs&amp;pid=180 |title=Programs |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Institute's website, The Hague Institute provided policy-relevant research, practitioner training and convenes actors from various areas of expertise to facilitate dialogue and stimulate knowledge sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=About_Us-Organization-About_us&amp;pid=147 |title=Our Work |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projects===

====Commission on Global Security, Justice &amp; Governance====

The Hague Institute and the [[Stimson Center]], based in Washington, DC gathered "a select group of eminent statespersons and public intellectuals"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Programs-&amp;pid=180&amp;id=43&amp;progid=3&amp;fromHome=1 |title=Programs |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address global threats and challenges related to fragile states, climate change and the cyber-economy. The Commission, later renamed as the [[Albright-Gambari Commission]], convened consultations online and around the world to facilitate a report which complements the UN Post-2015 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] agenda, the UN Peacebuilding Architecture, the Fourth Global Conference on Cyberspace in The Hague, and the UN Conference on Parties on Climate Change in [[Paris]].

====The Hague Approach====

The Hague Approach was intended a flagship project of The Hague Institute. It comprises "six guiding principles for achieving sustainable peace in post-conflict situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Hague_Approach:__What_is_it&amp;pid=138&amp;id=121#.UkGfdsanovQ |title=The Hague Approach: What is it? &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, the Institute presented The Hague Approach Principles during the [[Peace Palace]] centenary to King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-News_Archives-The_Hague_Institute_Commemorates_Peace_Palace_Centenary&amp;pid=159&amp;id=124&amp;jaar=2013 |title=The Hague Institute Commemorates Peace Palace Centenary &amp;#124; News Archives |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Governance Reform Initiative====

The Global Governance Reform Initiative tackled issues in cyberspace, migration, and oceans. The initiative brings together stakeholders from different sectors (government, civil society, international organizations, and business) and geographical regions to address pressing issues in global governance collectively. A three-day conference titled ''The Future of Cyber Governance'' convened in May 2014 and launched the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Future_of_Cyber_Governance&amp;pid=138&amp;id=236 |title=The Future of Cyber Governance &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date=2014-05-19 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water Diplomacy Consortium (WDC)====

The Water Diplomacy Consortium combined expertise from five Netherlands-based organizations to serve as a “global hub” to exchange knowledge and experience in water technology and water governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/7134-stockholm-water-week-new-platform-addresses-conflicting-claims-over-fresh-water-use.html |title=Stockholm water week: New platform addresses conflicting claims over fresh water use |publisher=Dutchwatersector.com |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Institute served as the lead partner of the WDC which also includes [[Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael]], Water Governance Centre, [[UNESCO-IHE]] Institute for Water Education, and [[UPEACE]].

====Knowledge Platform Security &amp; Rule of Law====

Consisting of a network of experts and practitioners, the Knowledge Platform focused on building “security and rule of law” in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpsrl.org/about/our-work |title=Our Work|accessdate=September 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927124228/http://www.kpsrl.org/about/our-work |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was originally launched in late spring 2012 by [[Ben Knapen]], former Dutch State Secretary for European Affairs and International Cooperation. The Hague Institute served as the primary facilitator for the platform’s partners including the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands]].

===Public Discussions===

In November 2013, the Institute launched the "Distinguished Speaker Series." The lecture series invites high-level international experts to discuss topics affecting global progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Programs-&amp;pid=180&amp;id=33&amp;progid=4&amp;fromHome=1 |title=Programs |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers included [[Joschka Fischer]], [[Jim Stavridis]], [[Jan Peter Balkenende]], [[Edi Rama]] and [[Miroslav Lajčák]].

To "stimulate debate about the current course and future trajectory of Dutch foreign policy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Effectiveness_of_Dutch_Foreign_Policy:__Defense_and_Development&amp;pid=138&amp;id=204 |title=The Effectiveness of Dutch Foreign Policy: Defense and Development &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date=2014-03-25 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Institute gathered leading officials in Dutch government for a series of "Inside View" debates focused on the effectiveness of Dutch foreign policy. On September 10, 2013, the series launched with former Dutch political directors from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands]] exploring the Netherlands' role in international relations, within the EU and at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkingpolitics.org/2013/09/13/part-i-panel-discussion-on-the-effectiveness-of-dutch-foreign-policy/ |title=Part I: Herman Schaper: The loss of domestic consensus on foreign policy and its consequences |publisher=Thinkingpolitics.org |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series continued with former Permanent Representatives to the United Nations on October 24, 2013 and concluded on December 11, 2013 with former Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands addressing present and future challenges of Dutch international relations.

In June 2014, the Institute, in cooperation with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC and the National Security Archive at [[George Washington University]], convened 35 officials and eyewitnesses for a multi-day conference on the Rwanda Genocide. The event was based on the 'critical oral history' approach. Participants included [[Ibrahim Gambari]], [[Henry Kwami Anyidoho]], Lord [[David Hannay, Baron Hannay of Chiswick|David Hannay]], [[Prudence Bushnell]], [[Michael N. Barnett]] and Lieutenant-General [[Roméo Dallaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/world/africa/un-cables-reveal-a-turning-point-in-rwanda-crisis.html|title=UN cables Reveal a Turning Point in Rwanda Crisis|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Hague Institute's experts and programs produced a variety publications based on research and analysis on a scope of issues affecting global justice. These publications aimed to inform policymakers, academics, experts and the general public. In June 2014, the Institute launched a working paper series to complement its existing publication series of Policy Briefs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Publications&amp;pid=179#policybriefs |title=Publications |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Commentary&amp;pid=174 |title=Recent Commentary |doi=10.1017/S0020589314000438 |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working paper series aimed to "contribute original research of the highest quality to scholarly and policy debates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Publications&amp;pid=179 |title=Publications |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working papers addressed [[just war theory]], sanctions against [[Iran]] and the relationship between constitutional law and [[global governance]].

In August 2013, the Institute published ''The Hague Approach Principles,'' six principles for achieving sustainable peace in post-conflict situations, and a comparative study of rule of law efforts in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] titled, ''Promoting the Rule of Law in Peacebuilding: Lessons from Afghanistan and Iraq''. Both publications, based on empirical evidence, were presented at the centennial celebrations of the [[Peace Palace]] in The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Hague_Institute_Commemorates_Peace_Palace_Centenary&amp;pid=138&amp;id=124#.UjmtQsanovQ |title=The Hague Institute Commemorates Peace Palace Centenary &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Approach Principles have subsequently been endorsed by current and former UN and global leaders including San-Hyun Song, Judy Cheng-Hopkins and [[Jan Eliasson]].

The Hague Institute produced a biannual magazine called ''Intersections'', which highlighted activities of the Institute and featured columns from public figures working at the intersection of peace, security and global justice issues. Previous contributors to the magazine include, [[Madeleine Albright]], [[Michael Kirby (judge)]], [[Fatou Bensouda]] and [[Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert]]. The magazine was published biannually.

== Alleged mismanagement at The Hague Institute for Global Justice ==
On January 1, 2013 Abiodun Williams was appointed as the Institute's first president. He was preceded by Professor [[Willem van Genugten]] who served as Interim Dean of the Institute from September 2011 to December 2012. In an article by Dutch magazine [[De Groene Amsterdammer]] (4th April 2018), sources told the magazine that Williams insisted that the position of 'international dean' had to be restyled as 'president', in addition to a very high financial compensation package in order to lend him greater authority and benefits. &lt;ref name="groene"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.groene.nl/artikel/he-just-didn-t-seem-to-care|title=Hoe het Haagse Institute for Global Justice 20 miljoen subsidie verspeelde|work=De Groene Amsterdammer|access-date=2018-04-04|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch government granted up to 20 million Euros in subsidies for the Institute. According to staff members, Williams neglected fund raising, and spent considerable amounts of Institute funds on questionable expenses such as first class airfare, 5-star hotel rooms and long taxi rides not visibly related to the Institute's business, a claim confirmed by accounting firms. Furthermore, according to a reconstruction by Dutch newspaper ''[[de Volkskrant]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krant.volkskrant.nl/?code=ST-725912-lg2Pi2ZtUBH224zGAop3-caps.volkskrant.nl&amp;state=paperId(90247),zone(NL)#/paper|title=de Volkskrant Krant Online|website=krant.volkskrant.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Williams spent thousands of euros on expensive lunches at the nearby Carlton Ambassador hotel and first class flights since 'cattle class' was not good enough for him. A senior researcher quoted in the article indicates that there were many clashes between employees and Williams. According to the researcher citied, Williams distanced himself from staff whenever he felt challenged: 'Like it was beneath his dignity to talk to me directly. There was a culture clash. We academics are egalitarian. Though he was very focused on hierarchy and quickly felt criticized.'&lt;ref name="groene" /&gt; 

Reports claim his financial mismanagement eventually led to his departure in December 2016.  In 2013, for instance, Williams claimed 10,205.50 Euro for taxi rides, including a short trip of less than a kilometer from his home to the Dutch Parliament in The Hague, which amounted to 321 Euro. On 29 October he also took a cab to Groningen costing 722.25 Euro.&lt;ref&gt;Irene van der Linde and Tjitske Lingsma, "The Death of a White Elephant," International Justice Tribune, 6 April 2018, https://www.justicetribune.com/articles/death-white-elephant-hague&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, another organization based in The Hague, the Center for International Legal Cooperation, considered a 'structural cooperation' out of a sense of responsibility for the loss of the subsidized funds. After viewing the financial documents, the CILC was startled by the 'deplorable situation'. Allegedly, Williams was seen behind the paper shredder for hours before his departure, which documents in question were destroyed is unclear.&lt;ref name="vk1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/geldnood-nekt-prestigieuze-haagse-denktank-toezichthouder-greep-te-laat-in~a4588737/|title=Geldnood nekt prestigieuze Haagse denktank, toezichthouder greep te laat in|last=Koelé|first=Theo|website=De Volkskrant|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;Anton Nijssen, Williams' close associate for a long time, has been appointed by the Supervisory Board as' liquidator 'who has to take care of' the (financial) handling of cases'. There are numerous creditors, including the former landlord VNG and the Indisch Herinneringscentrum, which last year already moved into the spacious building in The Hague where the last researcher of the Hague Institute for Global Justice left just before Easter. Williams’ mismanagement is said to have been the main reason for the subsequent failure of the institute.&lt;ref name="vk1" /&gt;

Following the reports of the alleged mismanagement, the topic was raised in the Dutch parliament where several political parties posed questions to the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate, [[Eric Wiebes]]. Willem Moorlag from the Dutch socialist party [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]] asked the minister whether there is any judicial ground to recover the lost funds from Williams and/or the Supervisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/kamervragen/detail?id=2018Z06289&amp;did=2018D23370|title=De frauduleuze ondergang van het The Hague Institute for Global Justice|website=www.tweedekamer.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right-wing [[Forum for Democracy (Netherlands)|Forum voor Democratie]] (FvD) asked the minister why no action was undertaken against Williams when it was already clear after several months that he didn't fulfill his role as funds raiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kv-tk-2018Z06381.html|title=Het financiële fiasco rondom het Haagse Institute for Global Justice (IGJ)|last=Staten-Generaal|first=Tweede Kamer der|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Paternotte from the social liberal [[Democrats 66|D66]] asked the minister how it was possible that the Institute still received subsidies after a critical report by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|Price Waterhouse Coopers]] exposed the financial mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nu.nl/algemeen/5206955/d66-pvda-en-fvd-willen-opheldering-geldverkwisting-haagse-denktank.html|title=D66, PvdA en FvD willen opheldering over 'geldverkwisting' Haagse denktank {{!}} NU - Het laatste nieuws het eerst op NU.nl|website=www.nu.nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
In April 2018, The Hague Institute for Global Justice closed down after becoming insolvent, reportedly caused by poor leadership from President Abiodun Williams, serious mismanagement, and lack of proper oversight of President Williams by the Advisory Board led by Dick Benschop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2018/04/the-hague-global-justice-institute-closes-due-to-lack-of-funding/ The Hague global justice institute closes due to lack of funding]; Dutchnews.nl; 4 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12926">'''Vilhelm Peter Grønbech''' (14 June 1873 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1948) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] cultural historian. He was professor of the history of religion at the [[University of Copenhagen]] and also had a great influence on Danish intellectual life, especially during and after World War II.

==Life and career==
Grønbech was born in [[Allinge]], on [[Bornholm]]. His family moved to Copenhagen and beginning in 1890 he studied [[philology]] at the University of Copenhagen (Danish with Latin and English as secondary subjects),&lt;ref name=BioLex&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Historie/Religionshistoriker/Vilh._Gr%C3%B8nbech "Vilhelm Grønbech"], ''[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]'', retrieved 10 October 2014 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while working at the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Royal Library]] and as a schoolteacher. In 1902 he received his doctorate for a study of the historical phonetics of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], after which he began teaching at the university, first as a [[docent]] and then from 1908 to 1911 as a lecturer in English literature, while also working as a church organist. He published a book of poems and a study of the dialect of [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref name=Mitchell11&gt;P. M. Mitchell, ''Vilhelm Grønbech'', Twayne's World Authors Series 397, Boston: Hall-Twayne, 1978, {{ISBN|9780805763065}}, Chronology p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 the first volume of his work on [[Germanic paganism]], ''Vor Folkeætt i Oldtiden'' (English title ''The Culture of the Teutons'') was published, and in 1911 he became a docent in the history of religion. After the appearance of the remaining three volumes of ''Vor Folkeætt i Oldtiden'' in 1912 and of a related essay, "Religionsskiftet i Norden" on the [[christianization of Scandinavia|conversion of Scandinavia]] (1913), the [[University of Leipzig]] sought in 1914 to award him a professorship and in 1915 he was appointed professor of the history of religion at Copenhagen, a position which he held until 1943.&lt;ref name=SD&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Sprog,_religion_og_filosofi/Religion_og_mystik/Religionshistorikere/Vilhelm_Gr%C3%B8nbech "Vilhelm Grønbech"], ''[[Den Store Danske]]'', retrieved 8 October 2014 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitchell11/&gt; Early in his career he also taught at the state college of education and from 1918 to 1920 headed the Danish Society for Psychic Research.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt; 

During the [[German occupation of Denmark]] in World War II, Grønbech's lectures drew large audiences, and after the war he founded the periodical ''[[Frie Ord]]'' with the theologian [[Hal Koch]]. It ran from 1946 to 1948, with Grønbech the primary contributor, and was rapidly successful, with 6,000 subscribers within a few months of its founding.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 129&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of his articles published there were republished in posthumous collections; a 1943 lecture series at [[Borup's College]] in [[Copenhagen]] was published from shorthand transcriptions as ''Lyset fra Akropolis'' (The Light from the Acropolis, 1950).&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 115, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grønbech was nominated for the [[Nobel prize in literature]] eleven times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=3689 Nomination Database], Nobel Prize, retrieved 24 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the year of his retirement, Allinge awarded him honorary citizenship and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] awarded him a free residence at Lundehave in [[Helsingør]]; he died in Helsingør in 1948.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt;

Grønbech was married twice, in 1900 to Pauline Ramm, who died in 1946, and in August 1947 to [[Honorine Hermelin|Honorine Louise Hermelin]], [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the Swedish [[folk high school]] for women at Fogelstad in Sweden. His son Kaare Grønbech, born in 1901, was a specialist in Asian languages.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt; Grønbech ordered his papers destroyed,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Royal Library has a large archive.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt;&lt;ref name=revival&gt;Brigitte Larsen, [http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/kultur/gr%C3%B8nbech-i-understr%C3%B8mmen "Grønbech i understrømmen"], ''[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]'', 24 April 2002 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and views==
Although trained as a philologist, Grønbech's focus from his earliest major work, ''Vor Folkeætt i Oldtiden'', was on analysing key terms in order to apprehend the essence of a religion and hence of a culture.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 16&amp;ndash;17, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He later applied the same method to the study of Greek, medieval, and Indian mystics (''Mystikere i Europa og Indien'', 4 volumes, 1925, 1932, 1934, with the last volume being on 19th-century poets) and two studies of Greece and Hellenistic Rome, ''Hellenismen'' (1940; 2 volumes published, a projected third not completed) and ''Hellas'' (4 volumes, 1942, 1944, 1945). He was unusually capable of immersing himself in the system of thought he wished to depict,&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt; such that in the words of his English-language biographer he could "write about [it] as if he accepted its theses and principles", and "it is not possible to circumscribe accurately what his own religious&amp;mdash;not to mention political&amp;mdash;convictions must have been."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=19threview&gt;[[Basil Willey]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3720701 Review of ''Religious Currents in the 19th Century'' by Vilhelm Grønbech; translated by P. M. Mitchell, W. D. Paden], ''[[The Modern Language Review]]'' 60.3 (July 1965) 438&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; The admission of multiple realities (but only one actuality) is a [[leitmotiv]] in his work,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 112&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt; and he gave his second collection of poems, published in 1941, the title ''Solen har mange veje'' (The Sun Has Many Paths).&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Chronology, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with a much reprinted 1915 essay, "Primitiv Religion", he took a then revolutionary position with respect to "primitive" thought, rejecting the evolutionary hypothesis underlying works such as [[James George Frazer|Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Christian Aarslev, [http://www.religion.dk/viden/professoren-der-ville-g%C3%B8re-op-med-evolutionisme-i-religionsforskning "Professoren, der ville gøre op med evolutionisme i religionsforskning"], ''Kristeligt Dagblad'', 27 December 2011 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead holding that so-called 'primitive' religion is as complex as modern religion, differing from it in the direct relationship between 'primitive' people and their world; he argued that to label a culture 'primitive' said less about them than about "our own astonishment that people can be different from us".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 36&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt; This openness combined with his heavy use of paraphrase can make it hard to distinguish his own position from those of the thinkers he is depicting, for example in his presentation of [[Empedocles]]' thought in ''Hellas'', Volume 4.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grønbech did have a fundamental belief in the importance of "harmony", which he saw as the permeation of life by religion,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 35, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically as society constituting a "community of believers".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed emphasis on the individual as destructive to this and therefore criticised [[Kierkegaard]] in several of his works, once characterising him as "the last offshoot of medieval mysticism and its selfish concerns and the scholasticism which was identified with it".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 121, citing an essay on Kierkegaard and [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] reprinted in ''Kampen om Mennesket'' (1930), p.&amp;nbsp;190.&lt;/ref&gt; He was critical of [[Goethe]], on whom he wrote a two-volume book (1935, 1939), because while seeking harmony, he did not appreciate the need for a community of believers.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast he appears to have felt a kinship with [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and was ahead of literary fashion in his appreciation of both [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]] and [[William Blake|Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 76, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general Grønbech was suspicious of mystics as he regarded the mystical experience as inherently selfish; he reached this conclusion after an early mystical experience of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; He made exceptions for, for example, [[Wordsworth]], whom he regarded as a mystic who had achieved harmony;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 44, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; in an entire volume of his work on mystics devoted to [[Teresa of Ávila|St Teresa]], he writes about her with "ironic humo[u]r" but characterises her as having "undermined the authority she was appealing to", contributing to the revolution in thought that "drew the human being out of his church's commonality".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view as set out in his second major work, ''Religiøse strømninger i det nittende aarhundrede'' (Religious Currents of the Nineteenth Century, 1922; translated edition ''Religious Currents in the 19th Century'', 1964&lt;ref name=19threview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompsonreview&gt;[[Lawrence S. Thompson]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27714919 Review of ''Religious Currents in the Nineteenth Century'' by Vilhelm Grønbech, translated P. M. Mitchell, W. D. Paden], ''[[The Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]'' 65.3 (July 1966) 574&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref name=Mitchell11/&gt; that revolution that ushered in the modern age of crisis in Western religion began not in the Sixteenth Century with the [[Protestant Reformation]] but around 1770 with the development of [[Romanticism]],&lt;ref name=Thompsonreview/&gt; and the [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]ian theory of evolution restored faith in a universe of laws and was the basis for a new religious harmony.&lt;ref name=19threview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 40&amp;ndash;41, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; He also regarded the book as a vital means of uniting modern people in shared experience, "lift[ing] modern man out of his lonely imprisonment".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grønbech's book on Hellenism was an outgrowth of his work on a three-volume analysis of early Christianity, ''Jesus, menneskesønnen'' (Jesus, the Son of Man, 1935), ''Paulus'' (St Paul, 1940) and ''Kristus'' (Christ, 1941). He interpreted Jesus as "an agitator in the world of the spirit" who attempted to create the Kingdom of God on earth; the first book, ''Jesus'', is more simply written than other works of his and provoked negative responses, but became his most-read book.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 82&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer of ''Jesus'' noted that a theme of Grønbech's, which he saw in Jesus, was the commandment to simply live, rather than to analyse morality.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Bachmann, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40077612 Review of ''Jesus: Menneskessønnen'' by Vilhelm Grønbech], ''[[Books Abroad]]'' 10.4 (Autumn 1936) 425&amp;ndash;26.&lt;/ref&gt; The other two volumes, and the work on Hellenism, appeared only after Denmark was under occupation, and his treatment of Hellenistic Rome can often be read as applicable to his own period.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Grønbech's ideas were influential in Denmark, and reached a broad popular audience.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 21, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; His writings and in particular ''Frie Ord'' have often been said to have been the impetus for the establishment of ''[[Heretica]]'', an influential literary journal published from 1948 to 1953;&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; the third issue contains three articles written in tribute to him following his death, of which that by the poet and co-editor [[Thorkild Bjørnvig]] is titled "The Heretic".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 14, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Grønbech Society was formed in Copenhagen in 1994.&lt;ref name=SD/&gt;&lt;ref name=revival/&gt;
