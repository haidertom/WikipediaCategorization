      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6655">'''Arizona Financial Text System (AZFinText)''' is a textual-based quantitative financial prediction system written by [[Robert P. Schumaker]] of [[University of Texas at Tyler]] and [[Hsinchun Chen]] of the [[University Of Arizona|University of Arizona]]. 

==System==
This system differs from other systems in that it uses financial text as one of its key means of predicting stock price movement. This reduces the information lag-time problem evident in many similar systems where new information must be transcribed (e.g., such as losing a costly court battle or having a product recall), before the quant can react appropriately. AZFinText overcomes these limitations by utilizing the terms used in financial news articles to predict future stock prices twenty minutes after the news article has been released.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R., (2006). [http://www.robschumaker.com/publications/AMCIS%20-%20Textual%20Analysis%20of%20Stock%20Market%20Prediction%20Using%20Financial%20News%20Articles.pdf Textual Analysis of Stock Market Prediction Using Financial News Articles]. ''12th Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS-2006)'', Aug 2006. Acapulco, Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is believed that certain article terms can move stocks more than others.  Terms such as ''factory exploded'' or ''workers strike'' will have a depressing effect on stock prices whereas terms such as ''earnings rose'' will tend to increase stock prices.  

When a human trading expert sees certain terms, they will react in a somewhat predictable fashion.  AZFinText capitalizes on the arbitrage opportunities that exist when investment experts over and under-react to certain news stories. By analyzing breaking financial news articles and focusing on specific parts of speech, portfolio selection, term weighting and even article sentiment, the AZFinText system becomes a powerful tool and is a radically different way of looking at stock market prediction.

== Overview of research ==
The foundation of AZFinText can be found in the ACM TOIS article.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R. and Chen H., (2009). [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1462198.1462204 Textual Analysis of Stock Market Prediction Using Breaking Financial News]. ''Association for Computing Machinery Transactions on Information Systems'', 27(2).&lt;/ref&gt; Within this paper, the authors tested several different prediction models and linguistic textual representations.  From this work, it was found that using the article terms and the price of the stock at the time the article was released was the most effective model and using proper nouns was the most effective textual representation technique.  Combining the two, AZFinText netted a 2.84% trading return over the five-week study period.

AZFinText was then extended to study what combination of peer organizations help to best train the system.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R. and Chen, H., (2009). [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1570564 A Quantitative Stock Prediction System based on Financial News]. ''Information Processing and Management'', 45(5): 571-583.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the premise that [[IBM]] has more in common with [[Microsoft]] than [[General Motors|GM]], AZFinText studied the effect of varying peer-based training sets.  To do this, AZFinText trained on the various levels of [[Global Industry Classification Standard|GICS]] and evaluated the results.  It was found that sector-based training was most effective, netting an 8.50% trading return, outperforming [[Jim Cramer]], Jim Jubak and DayTraders.com during the study period.  AZFinText was also compared against the top 10 quantitative systems and outperformed 6 of them.

A third study investigated the role of portfolio building in a textual financial prediction system.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R. and Chen, H., (2008). [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1331274 Evaluating a News-Aware Quantitative Trader: The Effects of Momentum and Contrarian Stock Selection Strategies]. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'', 59(2): 247-255.&lt;/ref&gt; From this study, Momentum and Contrarian stock portfolios were created and tested.  Using the premise that past winning stocks will continue to win and past losing stocks will continue to lose, AZFinText netted a 20.79% return during the study period.  It was also noted that traders were generally overreacting to news events, creating the opportunity of abnormal returns. 

A fourth study looked into using author sentiment as an added predictive variable.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R., Zhang, Y. and Huang, C., (2008). [http://www.robschumaker.com/publications/IIMA%20-%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20of%20Financial%20News%20Articles.pdf Sentiment Analysis of Financial News Articles]. ''20th Annual Conference of International Information Management Association'', Oct. 2009.  Houston, TX.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the premise that an author can unwittingly influence market trades simply by the terms they use, AZFinText was tested using tone and polarity features.  It was found that Contrarian activity was occurring within the market, where articles of a positive tone would decrease in price and articles of a negative tone would increase in price.

A further study investigated what article verbs have the most influence on stock price movement.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R., (2010). [http://www.robschumaker.com/publications/SM%20-%20An%20Analysis%20of%20Verbs%20in%20Financial%20News%20Articles%20and%20their%20Impact%20on%20Stock%20Price.pdf  An Analysis of Verbs in Financial News Articles and their Impact on Stock Price]. ''NAACL Workshop on Social Media and Computational Linguistics'', June 2010. Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; From this work, it was found that ''planted'', ''announcing'', ''front'', ''smaller'' and ''crude'' had the highest positive impact on stock price.

== Notable publicity ==
AZFinText has been the topic of discussion by numerous media outlets.  Some of the more notable ones include the [[Wall Street Journal]], [[Slashdot]], [[Technology Review|MIT's Technology Review]], [[Motley Fool]], Crossing Wall Street, [[WBIR]] in Knoxville, TN and Motherboard TV.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4573">'''Acrotomophilia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀκρότομος "having the top cut off" (from ἄκρον ''akron'' "extremity" and -τομος ''-tomos'' from τέμνω ''temno'' "I cut") and φιλία ''philia'' "love") is a [[paraphilia]] in which an individual expresses strong sexual interest in [[amputee]]s. It is a counterpart to ''[[apotemnophilia]]'', the sexual interest in ''being'' an amputee.

==Overview==
Acrotomophiles may be attracted to [[amputee]]s because they like the way they look or they may view the amputee’s stump as a [[phallic]] object which can be used for [[sexual pleasure]]. Acrotomophiles may enjoy the idea of dominating the amputee during couples play and they may also become aroused with the thought of having to take care of an [[amputee]].

==Interests and behaviours==
In a survey of acrotomophiles, leg amputations were preferred over arm amputations, amputations of a single limb over double amputations, and amputations that left a stump over amputations that left no stump.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, D. (1983). An erotic attraction to amputees. ''Sexuality and Disability, 6,'' 3–19.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Solvang (2007), “Devotees adhere to standard conceptions of attractiveness in all other matters outside of amputations.”&lt;ref&gt;Solvang, P. (2007). The amputee body desired: Beauty destabilized? Disability re-valued? ''Sexuality and Disability, 25,'' 51–64.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Jung]]ian explanation for the fetish is that it stems from a desire to resolve discontinuities in the collective subconscious by means of distorting the geometric representation of man, which traditionally involves five points, six when focusing on male sexuality, and seven when discussing incarnations of the Logos from certain religious cultures.

==Ethical issues==
Some people question whether amputating one's own body parts or operating on a partner for the sake of sexual pleasure is ethical. For some, modifying the body is a private ritual of self-ownership and freedom of choice. Psychiatrists may make a diagnosis of [[Body integrity identity disorder]] (B.I.I.D.).&lt;ref&gt;Robin Marantz Henig. (March 22, 2005) [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/22/health/psychology/22ampu.html At War With Their Bodies, They Seek to Sever Limbs]. [[The New York Times]]. Retrieved: 2008.02.08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;fleshbot.com (March 22, 2005) [http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/found/devotees-pretenders-and-wannabes-036808.php Devotees, Pretenders and Wannabes.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223070910/http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/found/devotees-pretenders-and-wannabes-036808.php |date=February 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The term ''amelotatism'' has also been used to describe acrotomophilia.  The sexual interest in ''being'' an amputee is ''[[apotemnophilia]]''.&lt;ref name=money&gt;[[John Money]], Kent W. Simcoe. 1984. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/k731445740p1g7q8/ Sexuality and Disability Journal. "Acrotomophilia, sex and disability: New concepts and case report".]  Springer Netherlands. ISSN 0146-1044 (Print) 1573-6717 (Online).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Janice M. Irvine]]. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&amp;pg=PA4 Disorders of Desire: Sexuality And Gender In Modern American Sexology]. {{ISBN|1-59213-151-4}}. (p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; John Money (1977) used the terms ''autoapotemnophilia'' and ''alloapotemnophilia'' to describe the erotic interest of wanting to be or appear as an amputee versus wanting amputees as sexual partners;&lt;ref&gt;Money, J., Jobaris, R., &amp; Furth, G. (1977). Apotemnophilia: Two cases of self demand amputation as a sexual preference. ''The Journal of Sex Research, 13'', 115–124.&lt;/ref&gt; neither term has been widely used since. The term ''teratophilia'' is used to describe arousal from deformed or monstrous people.&lt;ref name = Aggrawal2008&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=Teratophilia&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Teratophilia | title=Forensic and Medico-Legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | last=Aggrawal | first=Anil | authorlink=Anil Aggrawal | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | year=2008 | ISBN=1-4200-4308-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6391">'''Adenylylation''',&lt;ref name="pmid1582530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garrett"/&gt; now known as '''AMPylation''', is a process in which [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP) molecule is covalently attached to a [[protein]] side chain, altering the function of the protein.&lt;ref name= "Itzen"/&gt; This covalent addition of AMP to a hydroxyl side chain of the protein is [[posttranslational modification]] that is stable and reversible.&lt;ref name= "Woolery"/&gt; Adenylylation involves a [[phosphodiester bond]] between a hydroxyl group of the molecule undergoing adenylylation and the phosphate group of the [[adenosine monophosphate]] [[nucleotide]] (i.e. adenylic acid). This process can occur to molecules such as [[tyrosine]] residues. [[Enzyme|Enzymes ]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;that are capable of catalyzing this process are called AMPylators.

== Function ==

Similar to [[serine]], [[threonine]] or [[tyrosine]] [[phosphorylation]], AMPylation regulates the activity of some proteins, such as [[glutamine synthetase]].&lt;ref name="Stadtman"/&gt; Additionally, AMPylation aids in allowing thermodynamically unfavorable overall reactions to take place by generating a leaving group in chemical mechanisms that indirectly use energy from [[ATP hydrolysis]].&lt;ref name="Schmelz"/&gt; Unstable carboxylate-phosphate mixed anhydrides or of phosphoramidates are generated in this transient adenylyation reaction&lt;ref name="Itzen"/&gt;

The degree of adenylylation depends on the ratio of [[glutamine]] to [[α-ketoglutarate]]: The higher this ratio the more monomers are adenylylated, thereby producing lower activity of glutamine synthetase; the lower the ratio the less monomers are adenylated and the higher activity of glutamine synthetase. A high ratio is a sign of cellular nitrogen sufficiency, whereas a low ratio is evidence of a limited nitrogen and the need for ammonia fixation by glutamine synthetase.&lt;ref name="Garrett"/&gt;

== AMPylators ==

AMPylators are enzymes that catalyze AMPylation. These enzymes have been shown to be comparable to kinases due to their ATP hydrolysis activity and reversible transfer of the metabolite to a hydroxyl side chain of the protein substrate. To date, the AMPylators that have been identified are bacterial proteins. Two [[Protein domains|domains]], the Fic and adenylyl transferase domains, are the currently known AMPylators that have been shown to be involved in [[pathogenicity]] of bacterial species and metabolic regulation. Fic domains are evolutionarily conserved domains in [[prokaryotes]] and [[eukaryotes]] that belong to the Fido domain superfamily, whereas the adenylyl transferase domains are part of the larger [[nucleotidyl transferase]] protein family&lt;ref name="Woolery"/&gt;

[[GTPases]] are common targets of AMPylators. [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]], [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab]], and [[ADP ribosylation factor|Arf]] [[GTPase]] families are involved in [[actin]] [[cytoskeleton]] dynamics and vesicular trafficking. They also play roles in cellular control mechanisms such as [[phagocytosis]] in the host cell, in which the [[pathogen]] enhances or prevents its internalization by either inducing or inhibiting host cell phagocytosis&lt;ref name="Woolery"/&gt;

== AMPylation and pathogenicity ==

Bacteria proteins, also known as effectors, have been shown to use AMPylation. Effectors such as VopS, IbpA, and DrrA, have been shown to AMPylate host GTPases and cause actin cytoskeleton changes.

''[[Vibrio parahaemolyticus]]'' or VopS is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes food poisoning as a result of raw or undercooked seafood consumption in humans.&lt;ref name="Luong"/&gt;  VopS contains a Fic domain that has a conserved HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif that contains a histidine residue essential for AMPylation. VopS blocks actin assembly by modifying threonine residue in the switch 1 region of Rho GTPases. The transfer of an AMP moiety using ATP to the threonine residue results in steric hindrance, and thus prevents Rho GTPases from interacting with downstream effectors. As a result, the host cell’s actin cytoskeleton control is disabled, leading to cell rounding.&lt;ref name=Woolery /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luong"/&gt;

IbpA is secreted into eukaryotic cells from ''H. somni'', a Gram-negative bacterium in cattle that causes respiratory epithelium infection. This effector contains two Fic domains at the C-terminal region. AMPylation of the IbpA Fic domain of Rho family GTPases is responsible for its cytotoxicity. The AMPylation on a tyrosine residue of the switch 1 region blocks the interaction of the GTPases with downstream substrates such as PAK.

== De-AMPylation ==

GS-ATasE (GlnE) is an AMPylator that has been shown to catalyze de-AMPylation of glutamine synthetase by removing the covalent linkage between AMP and a hydroxyl residue of a protein. It contains two adenylyl transferase domains that are involved in the addition and removal of AMP to glutamine synthetase. De-AMPylation occurs at the N-terminus of the domain. Following the removal of AMP from glutamine synthetase, GS-ATase forms ADP and unmodified glutamine synthetase.&lt;ref name="Woolery"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8475">'''Asynchronous conferencing''' is the formal term used in [[science]], in particular in [[computer-mediated communication]], [[Computer-supported collaboration|collaboration]] and [[Web-based training|learning]], to describe technologies where there is a delay in interaction between contributors. It is used in contrast to [[synchronous conferencing]], which refers to various "chat" systems in which users communicate simultaneously in "real time".&lt;br /&gt;
Specially  in computer-meditated communication, it is emerging as a tool that can create opportunities for collaboration and support the inquiry process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sloffer|first=Susan J.|author2=Dueber, B.|author3=Duffy, T.M.|title=Using Asynchronous Conferencing to Promote Critical Thinking: Two  Implementations in Higher Education|year=1999|page=1|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=772807|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this form of communication, face-to-face conversation is not required and the conversation can last for long time.

==Tools==

Asynchronous conferencing has been practiced for many years now in various forms. A variety of means for supporting this form of communication are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Karen D.|title=Comparison of Social Presence in Voice-based and Text-based Asynchronous Computer Conferencing|year=2008|publisher=UMI Microform|location=https://books.google.com|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B11jGzd6_HcC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=asynchronous+conferencing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PjJVUeywLNHyrQfGoICACw&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kokemuller|first=Neil|title=Advantages of Asynchronous Conferencing|url=http://work.chron.com/advantages-asynchronous-conferencing-3364.html|publisher=The Houston Chronicle|accessdate=29 March 2013|location=http://work.chron.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inglis|first=Alistair|title=Delivering Digitally: Managing the Transition to the New Knowledge Media|year=2002|publisher=Biddles Limited|location=Great Britain|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JK89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=asynchronous+conferencing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PjJVUeywLNHyrQfGoICACw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=asynchronous%20conferencing&amp;f=false|edition=2nd|author2=Ling, P.|author3=Joosten, V.|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

:Asynchronous conferencing allows for the participants to have flexibility and control over the time they spend on any topic. It can allow anonymous participation, encouraging reluctant members/learners to share their viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inglis|first=Alistair|title=Delivering Digitally: Managing the Transition to the New Knowledge Media|year=2002|publisher=Biddles Limited|location=Great Britain|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JK89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=asynchronous+conferencing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PjJVUeywLNHyrQfGoICACw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=asynchronous%20conferencing&amp;f=false|edition=2nd|author2=Ling, P.|author3=Joosten, V.|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it allows all the participants to contribute and communicate simultaneously on different topics. However, due to this time constraint, there is a delay between the message exchange. This delay can lead to loss of interest and affects the contextual structure and coherence of the discussion. Sometimes there might be too many posts made in a small amount time, making it hard to figure out the outcome of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Lynn Anderson, Terry|title=Online conferences professional development for a networked era|year=2010|publisher=Information Age Pub.|location=Charlotte, NC|isbn=9781617351402|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpA7WSc3gEYC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=asynchronous+conferencing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PjJVUeywLNHyrQfGoICACw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=asynchronous%20conferencing&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:This form of communication provides more convenience. The user can participate from anywhere, as long as there is connection to the conference. This is an advantage for people who work from home, work in different geographical regions or travel on business. Also the topic can be accessed at any time and this gives the participant time to think and reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kokemuller|first=Neil|title=Advantages of Asynchronous Conferencing|url=http://work.chron.com/advantages-asynchronous-conferencing-3364.html|publisher=The Houston Chronicle|accessdate=29 March 2013|location=http://work.chron.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a lack of physical and social presence in this form of communication. Especially, in asynchronous text-based conferencing, the lack of presence amounts in a huge difference in the progress and outcome of the discussion. It lacks emotions and is more prone to interpretation error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Lynn Anderson, Terry|title=Online conferences professional development for a networked era|year=2010|publisher=Information Age Pub.|location=Charlotte, NC|isbn=9781617351402|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpA7WSc3gEYC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=asynchronous+conferencing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PjJVUeywLNHyrQfGoICACw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=asynchronous%20conferencing&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:One of the more controversial topics about asynchronous conferencing is that the discussion thread might get deleted. This can happen either due to technical failure or from avoidance and loss of interest from the participants. As most threads are managed according to their access time, those threads with older access time might be replaced by ones with new access time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hewitt|first=Jim|title=Toward an Understanding of How Threads Die in Asynchronous Computer Conferences|year=2005|pages=570–572|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/stkerr/Hewitt%20Threads%20die%202005.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2013|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Asynchronous conferencing is basically divided up into these following types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Karen D.|title=Comparison of Social Presence in Voice-based and Text-based Asynchronous Computer Conferencing|year=2008|publisher=UMI Microform|location=United States of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B11jGzd6_HcC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=asynchronous+conferencing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PjJVUeywLNHyrQfGoICACw&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Text/Image based conferencing
* Voice based conferencing
* Video based conferencing

==Uses==
This type of conferencing is mostly useful for business and/or learning purpose. Many of the universities are adopting online learning methods and using asynchronous conferencing to manage course-works and discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonk|first=Curtis Jay|title=Electronic collaborators : learner-centered technologies for literacy, apprenticeship, and discourse|year=1998|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=080582796X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFDJBo14v54C&amp;pg=PT35&amp;dq=asynchronous+conferencing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PjJVUeywLNHyrQfGoICACw&amp;redir_esc=y|author2=King, Kira S.|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joosten|first=Alistair Inglis; Peter Ling &amp; Vera|title=Delivering digitally : managing the transition to the knowledge media|year=2002|publisher=Kogan Page [u.a.]|location=London|isbn=0749434716|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JK89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=asynchronous+conferencing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PjJVUeywLNHyrQfGoICACw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=asynchronous%20conferencing&amp;f=false|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in public opinion sharing or voting through blogs, wiki pages, SMS texting and social networking sites.

'''Baroque architecture''' is the building style of the [[Baroque]] era, begun in late 16th-century Italy, that took the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] vocabulary of [[Renaissance architecture]] and used it in a new rhetorical and theatrical fashion, often to express the triumph of the [[Catholic Church]]. It was characterized by new explorations of form, light and shadow, and dramatic intensity.  Common features of Baroque architecture included gigantism of proportions; a large open central space where everyone could see the altar;  twisting columns, theatrical effects, including light coming from a cupola above;  dramatic interior effects created with bronze and gilding; clusters of sculpted angels and other figures high overhead;  and an extensive use of [[trompe-l'oeil]], also called "quadratura,"  with painted architectural details and figures on the walls and ceiling, to increase the dramatic and theatrical effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), Flammarion, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the Renaissance drew on the wealth and power of the Italian courts and was a blend of secular and religious forces, the Baroque was, initially at least, directly linked to the Counter-Reformation, a movement within the Catholic Church to reform itself in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) is usually given as the beginning of the Counter-Reformation.&lt;/ref&gt; Baroque architecture and its embellishments were on the one hand more accessible to the emotions and on the other hand, a visible statement of the wealth and power of the Catholic Church. The new style manifested itself in particular in the context of the new religious orders, like the [[Theatines]] and the [[Jesuits]] who aimed to improve popular piety.

[[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]], such as the example of [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] (1726-1743), developed as a confessional marker of identity, in response to the [[Iconoclastic Fury|Great Iconoclasm]] of [[Calvinist]]s.&lt;ref name="2018Heal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/reformation-lutheran-baroque/|title=The Reformation and Lutheran baroque|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=20 February 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|accessdate=1 May 2018|quote=However, the writings of theologians can go only so far towards explaining the evolution of confessional consciousness and the shaping of religious identity. Lutheran attachment to religious images was a result not only of Luther’s own cautious endorsement of their use, but also of the particular religious and political context in which his Reformation unfolded. After the reformer’s death in 1546, the image question was fiercely contested once again. But as Calvinism, with its iconoclastic tendencies, spread, Germany’s Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images. In 1615, Berlin’s Lutheran citizens even rioted when their Calvinist rulers removed images from the city’s Cathedral.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heal2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=1 December 2011|title=‘Better Papist than Calvinist’: Art and Identity in Later Lutheran Germany|journal=German History|publisher=German History Society|volume=29|issue=4|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of the High Roman Baroque can be assigned to the papal reigns of [[Urban VIII]], [[Innocent X]] and [[Alexander VII]], spanning from 1623 to 1667. The three principal architects of this period were the sculptor [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], [[Francesco Borromini]] and the painter [[Pietro da Cortona]] and each evolved his own distinctively individual architectural expression.

Dissemination of Baroque architecture to the south of Italy resulted in regional variations such as [[Sicilian Baroque]] architecture or that of [[Naples]] and [[Lecce]]. To the north, the Theatine architect [[Camillo-Guarino Guarini]], [[Bernardo Vittone]] and Sicilian born [[Filippo Juvarra]] contributed Baroque buildings to the city of [[Turin]] and the [[Piedmont]] region.

A synthesis of Bernini, Borromini and Cortona’s architecture can be seen in the late Baroque architecture of northern Europe which paved the way for the more decorative [[Rococo]] style.

By the middle of the 17th century, the Baroque style had found its secular expression in the form of grand palaces, first in France—with the [[Château de Maisons]] (1642) near Paris by [[François Mansart]]—and then throughout Europe.

During the 17th century, Baroque architecture spread through Europe and Latin America, where it was particularly promoted by the Jesuits.

== Precursors and features of Baroque architecture ==
[[Michelangelo]]'s late Roman buildings, particularly [[St. Peter's Basilica]], may be considered precursors to Baroque architecture. His pupil [[Giacomo della Porta]] continued this work in Rome, particularly in the façade of the Jesuit church [[Il Gesù]], which leads directly to the most important church façade of the early Baroque, [[Santa Susanna]] (1603), by [[Carlo Maderno]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Maderno’s facade, see Wittkower R., ''Art &amp; Architecture in Italy 1600–1750'', 1985 edn, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinctive features of Baroque architecture can include:
* 	in churches, broader naves and sometimes given oval forms
*	fragmentary or deliberately incomplete architectural elements
*	dramatic use of light; either strong light-and-shade contrasts (''[[chiaroscuro]]'' effects) as at the church of [[Weltenburg Abbey]], or uniform lighting by means of several windows (e.g. church of [[Weingarten Abbey]])
*	opulent use of colour and ornaments (''putti'' or figures made of wood (often gilded), plaster or stucco, marble or faux finishing)
*	large-scale ceiling frescoes
*	an external façade often characterized by a dramatic central projection
*	the interior is a shell for painting, sculpture and stucco (especially in the late Baroque)
*	illusory effects like [[trompe l'oeil]] (an art technique involving extremely realistic imagery in order to create the optical illusion that the depicted objects appear in three dimensions.) and the blending of [[painting]] and [[architecture]]
*	pear-shaped domes in the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Czech Baroque architecture|Czech]], [[Baroque in Poland|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian Baroque]]
*	Ornate detail is key in identifying Baroque architecture ex, [[Palace of Versailles]]

=== Baroque and colonialism ===
[[File:Church of Immaculate Conception, Panjim 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|During the Portuguese colonization of [[Goa]], India brought about many churches with baroque architecture ([[Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church, Goa|Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church]]).]]

Though the tendency has been to see Baroque architecture as a European phenomenon, it coincided with, and is integrally enmeshed with, the rise of European [[colonialism]]. Colonialism required the development of centralized and powerful governments with Spain and France, the first to move in this direction.&lt;ref&gt;Though there is a vast literature on the subject, a succinct overview can be found in: Francis Ching, [[Mark Jarzombek]], Vikram Prakash, ''A Global History of Architecture'', Wiley Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonialism brought in huge amounts of wealth, not only in the silver that was extracted from the mines in Bolivia, Mexico and elsewhere, but also in the resultant trade in commodities, such as sugar and tobacco. The need to control trade routes, monopolies, and slavery, which lay primarily in the hands of the French during the 17th century, created an almost endless cycle of wars between the colonial powers: the [[French religious wars]], the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618 and 1648), [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Franco–Spanish War]] (1653), the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–1678), and so on. The initial mismanagement of colonial wealth by the Spaniards bankrupted them in the 16th century (1557 and 1560), recovering only slowly in the following century. This explains why the Baroque style, though enthusiastically developed throughout the [[Spanish Empire]], was to a large extent, in Spain, an architecture of surfaces and façades, unlike in France and Austria where we see the construction of numerous huge palaces and monasteries. In contrast to Spain, the French, under [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] (1619–1683), the minister of finance, had begun to industrialize their economy, and thus, were able to become, initially at least, the benefactors of the flow of wealth. While this was good for the building industries and the arts, the new wealth created an inflation, the likes of which had never been experienced before. Rome was known just as much for its new sumptuous churches as for its vagabonds.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pater. ''Renaissance Rome''.  (University of California Press, 1976) pp.70–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italy ==
{{Main article|Italian Baroque|Italian Baroque architecture}}

=== Rome and Southern Italy ===
{{See also|Sicilian Baroque}} A number of ecclesiastical buildings of the Baroque period in Rome had plans based on the Italian paradigm of the basilica with a crossed dome and nave, but the treatment of the architecture was very different from what had been carried out previously. One of the first Roman structures to break with the [[Mannerist]] conventions exemplified in the Gesù, was the church of Santa Susanna, designed by Carlo Maderno. The dynamic rhythm of columns and pilasters, central massing, and the protrusion and condensed central decoration add complexity to the structure. There is an incipient playfulness with the rules of classic design, but it still maintains rigor.

The same concerns with plasticity, massing, dramatic effects and shadow and light is evident in the architectural work of [[Pietro da Cortona]], illustrated by his design of [[Santi Luca e Martina]] (construction began in 1635) with what was probably the first curved Baroque church façade in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, Anthony. ''Borromini'', 1979, 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are even more evident in his reworking of [[Santa Maria della Pace]] (1656–68). The façade with its [[chiaroscuro]] half-domed portico and concave side wings, closely resembles a theatrical stage set and the church façade projects forward so that it substantially fills the tiny trapezoidal piazza. Other Roman ensembles of the Baroque and Late Baroque period are likewise suffused with theatricality and, as urban theatres, provide points of focus within their locality in the surrounding cityscape.

Probably the most well known example of such an approach is [[Saint Peter's Square]], which has been praised as a masterstroke of Baroque theatre. The piazza, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, is formed principally by two colonnades of free standing columns centred on an Egyptian [[obelisk]]. Bernini's own favourite design was his oval church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] decorated with polychome marbles and an ornate gold dome. His secular architecture included the [[Palazzo Barberini]] based on plans by Maderno and the [[Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi]] (1664), both in Rome.

[[File:RomaSIvoSapienzaCupola.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]] by [[Francesco Borromini]]]]

Bernini's rival, the architect [[Francesco Borromini]], produced designs that deviated dramatically from the regular compositions of the ancient world and Renaissance. His building plans were based on complex geometric figures, his architectural forms were unusual and inventive and he employed multi-layered symbolism in his architectural designs. Borromini's architectural spaces seem to expand and contract when needed, showing some affinity with the late style of Michelangelo. His iconic masterpiece is the diminutive church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]], distinguished by a complicated plan arrangement that is partly oval and partly a cross and so has complex convex-concave wall rhythms. A later work, the church of [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]], displays the same playful inventiveness and antipathy to the flat surface, epitomized by an unusual "corkscrew" lantern above the dome.

Following the death of Bernini in 1680, [[Carlo Fontana]] emerged as the most influential architect working in Rome. His early style is exemplified by the slightly concave façade of [[San Marcello al Corso]]. Fontana's academic approach, though lacking the dazzling inventiveness of his Roman predecessors, exerted substantial influence on Baroque architecture both through his prolific writings and through a number of architects he trained, who would disseminate the Baroque idioms throughout 18th-century Europe.

The 18th century saw the capital of Europe's architectural world transferred from Rome to Paris. The Italian [[Rococo]], which flourished in Rome from the 1720s onward, was profoundly influenced by the ideas of Borromini. The most talented architects active in Rome—[[Francesco de Sanctis (architect)|Francesco de Sanctis]] ([[Spanish Steps]], 1723) and [[Filippo Raguzzini]] ([[Piazza Sant'Ignazio]], 1727)—had little influence outside their native country, as did numerous practitioners of the [[Sicilian Baroque]], including [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]], [[Andrea Palma]], and [[Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia]].

[[File:Mg-k Basilica Superga2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Basilica di Superga]] near [[Turin]] by [[Filippo Juvarra]]]]

The last phase of Baroque architecture in Italy is exemplified by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]]'s [[Caserta Palace]], reputedly the largest building erected in Europe in the 18th century. Indebted to contemporary French and Spanish models, the palace is skillfully related to the landscape. At Naples and Caserta, Vanvitelli practiced a sober and classicizing academic style, with equal attention to [[aesthetics]] and engineering, a style that would make an easy transition to [[Neoclassicism]].

=== Northern Italy ===
In the north of Italy, the monarchs from the [[House of Savoy]] were particularly receptive to the new style. They employed a brilliant triad of architects&amp;mdash;[[Guarino Guarini]], [[Filippo Juvarra]], and [[Bernardo Vittone]]&amp;mdash;to illustrate the grandiose political ambitions and the newly acquired royal status of their dynasty.

Guarini was a peripatetic monk who combined many traditions (including that of [[Gothic architecture]]) to create irregular structures remarkable for their oval columns and unconventional façades. Building upon the findings of contemporary geometry and [[solid geometry|stereometry]], Guarini elaborated the concept of ''architectura obliqua'', which approximated Borromini's style in both theoretical and structural audacity. Guarini's [[Palazzo Carignano]] (1679) may have been the most flamboyant application of the Baroque style to the design of a private house in the 17th century.

Fluid forms, weightless details, and the airy prospects of Juvarra's architecture anticipated the art of [[Rococo]]. Although his practice ranged well beyond [[Turin]], Juvarra's most arresting designs were created for [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia]]. The visual impact of his [[Basilica di Superga]] (1717) derives from its soaring roof-line and masterful placement on a hill above Turin. The rustic ambiance encouraged a freer articulation of architectural form at the royal hunting lodge of the [[Palazzina di Stupinigi]] (1729). Juvarra finished his short but eventful career in Madrid, where he worked on the royal palaces at [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] and [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]].

Among the many who were profoundly influenced by the brilliance and diversity of Juvarra and Guarini, none was more important than [[Bernardo Vittone]]. This Piedmontese architect is remembered for an outcrop of flamboyant [[Rococo]] churches, quatrefoil in plan and delicate in detailing. His sophisticated designs often feature multiple vaults, structures within structures and domes within domes.

[[File:Wignacourt Arch 2016-05-08.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the [[Wignacourt Arch]], one of the earliest Baroque structures in Malta]]

The Baroque style was introduced in Malta in the early 17th century, possibly by the Bolognese architect and engineer [[Bontadino de Bontadini]], who was responsible for the construction of the [[Wignacourt Aqueduct]] between 1612 and 1615. The earliest Baroque structures in Malta were the decorative elements within the aqueduct, such as the [[Wignacourt Arch]] and [[Wignacourt Aqueduct#Fountains|several fountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonello|first1=Giovanni|authorlink1=Giovanni Bonello|title=Histories of Malta – Convictions and Conjectures|date=2003|publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti|location=[[Malta]]|isbn=9789993210276|pages=44–61|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Histories_of_Malta.html?id=SB4jAQAAIAAJ|chapter=Bontadino de Bontadini – The Murder of the First Baroque Architect in Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque architecture became popular after [[Francesco Bounamici]] designed the [[Church of the Jesuits]] in [[Valletta]] in 1635. In the subsequent decades, many churches, public buildings, city gates, palaces and other structures were constructed or rebuilt in this style. New churches were built in the Baroque style, while older ones were rebuilt or redecorated.&lt;ref name="culturemalta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baroque Architecture|url=http://culturemalta.org/48/47/Baroque-Architecture|website=Culture Malta|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630172716/http://culturemalta.org/48/47/Baroque-Architecture|archivedate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the interior of [[Saint John's Co-Cathedral]], which was completely redesigned by [[Mattia Preti]] in the 1660s, and the [[Our Lady of Victories Church, Valletta|Church of Our Lady of Victories]], which had its façade rebuilt in 1752.

The architect [[Lorenzo Gafà]] designed many Baroque churches between the 1660s and the 1700s, including the [[Saint Lawrence's Church, Vittoriosa|Church of St. Lawrence]] in [[Birgu]] (1681–97), [[St. Paul's Cathedral, Mdina|St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[Mdina]] (1696–1705) and the [[Cathedral of the Assumption, Gozo|Cathedral of the Assumption]] in [[Victoria, Gozo]] (1697–1711).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies Vol. II G-Z|date=2009|publisher=Pubblikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]]|isbn=9789993291329|pages=851–852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auberge de Castille.jpeg|thumb|[[Auberge de Castille]]]]

The most monumental Baroque building in Malta is [[Auberge de Castille]], which was rebuilt in 1741–45 by [[Andrea Belli]].&lt;ref name="culturemalta"/&gt; Other examples of secular Baroque architecture in Malta include [[Hostel de Verdelin]] ({{circa}} 1650s), parts of [[Fort Manoel]] (1723–33), the [[Mdina Gate]] (1724) and the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] (1757–60).

The Baroque style remained popular in Malta until the late 18th and early 19th century, when the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style was introduced. However, traditional Maltese architecture continued to have significant Baroque influences.&lt;ref name="culturemalta"/&gt;

As Italian Baroque influences penetrated across the [[Pyrenees]], they gradually superseded in popularity the restrained classicizing approach of [[Juan de Herrera]], which had been in vogue since the late 16th century. As early as 1667, the façades of [[Granada Cathedral]] (by [[Alonso Cano]]) and [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén Cathedral]] (by [[Eufrasio López de Rojas]]) suggest the artists' fluency in interpreting traditional motifs of Spanish cathedral architecture in the Baroque aesthetic idiom.
[[File:Santiago GDFL catedral 050318 43.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The most impressive display of Churrigueresque spatial decoration may be found in the west façade of the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]).]]
In contrast to the art of Northern Europe, the Spanish art of the period appealed to the emotions rather than seeking to please the intellect. The [[Churriguera]] family, which specialized in designing altars and retables, revolted against the sobriety of the Herreresque classicism and promoted an intricate, exaggerated, almost capricious style of surface decoration known as the [[Churrigueresque]]. Within half a century, they transformed [[Salamanca]] into an exemplary Churrigueresque city. Among the highlights of the style, the interiors of the [[Granada Charterhouse]] offer some of the most impressive combinations of space and light in 18th-century Europe. Integrating sculpture and architecture even more radically, Narciso Tomé achieved striking [[chiaroscuro]] effects in his ''Transparente'' for the [[Toledo Cathedral]].
[[File:Universidad de Valladolid. Fachada.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|[[Facade of the University of Valladolid]] (1716-1718).]]
The development of the style passed through three phases. Between 1680 and 1720, the Churriguera popularized [[Guarino Guarini|Guarini]]'s blend of [[Solomonic column]]s and [[composite order]], known as the "supreme order". Between 1720 and 1760, the Churrigueresque column, or estipite, in the shape of an inverted cone or obelisk, was established as a central element of ornamental decoration. The years from 1760 to 1780 saw a gradual shift of interest away from twisted movement and excessive ornamentation toward a neoclassical balance and sobriety.

Two of the most eye-catching creations of Spanish Baroque are the energetic façades of the [[University of Valladolid]] (Diego Tomé, 1716-1718) and [[Hospicio de San Fernando]] in [[Madrid]] (Pedro de Ribera, 1722), whose curvilinear extravagance seems to herald [[Antonio Gaudí]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. In this case as in many others, the design involves a play of tectonic and decorative elements with little relation to structure and function. The focus of the florid ornamentation is an elaborately sculptured surround to a main doorway. If we remove the intricate maze of broken pediments, undulating cornices, stucco shells, inverted tapers, and garlands from the rather plain wall it is set against, the building's form would not be affected in the slightest.

{{main article|New Spanish Baroque|Andean Baroque|Churrigueresque}}
[[File:Catedral de México.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana]], [[Mexico City]], started in 1573]]
The combination of the Native American and Moorish decorative influences with an extremely expressive interpretation of the Churrigueresque idiom may account for the full-bodied and varied character of the Baroque in the American colonies of Spain. Even more than its Spanish counterpart, American Baroque developed as a style of stucco decoration. Twin-towered façades of many American cathedrals of the 17th century had medieval roots and the full-fledged Baroque did not appear until 1664, when a Jesuit shrine on Plaza des Armas in [[Cusco]] was built. Even then, the new style hardly affected the structure of churches.

To the north, the richest province of 18th-century [[New Spain]]&amp;mdash;Mexico&amp;mdash;produced some fantastically extravagant and visually frenetic architecture known as Mexican Churrigueresque. This ultra-Baroque approach culminates in the works of Lorenzo Rodriguez, whose masterpiece is the [[Sagrario Metropolitano]] in [[Mexico City]]. Other fine examples of the style may be found in remote silver-mining towns. For instance, the Sanctuary at [[Ocotlán, Tlaxcala|Ocotlán]] (begun in 1745) is a top-notch Baroque cathedral surfaced in bright red tiles, which contrast delightfully with a plethora of compressed ornament lavishly applied to the main entrance and the slender flanking towers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.college.emory.edu/culpeper/BAKEWELL/images/ocotlan-ch.jpg Exterior] and [http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/bevans/Art454L-58-Tlaxcala/F00006.JPG Interior]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:St. Augustine Church - Paoay, Ilocos Norte.jpg|thumb|[[Paoay Church]] in the Philippines is a fine example of [[Earthquake Baroque]].]]
The true capital of Mexican Baroque is [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], where a ready supply of hand-painted ceramics ([[talavera (pottery)|talavera]]) and vernacular gray stone led to its evolving further into a personalised and highly localised art form with a pronounced Indian flavour. There are about sixty churches whose façades and domes display glazed tiles of many colours, often arranged in Arabic designs. The interiors are densely saturated with elaborate gold leaf ornamentation. In the 18th century, local artisans developed a distinctive brand of white stucco decoration, named "alfenique" after a Pueblan candy made from egg whites and sugar.

The Peruvian Baroque was particularly lavish, as evidenced by the [[Monastery of San Francisco, Lima|monastery of San Francisco]] at [[Lima]] (1673). While the rural Baroque of the [[Jesuit Block and Estancias of Córdoba]] in [[Córdoba, Argentina]], followed the model of Il Gesu, provincial "mestizo" (crossbred) styles emerged in [[Arequipa]], [[Potosí]], and [[La Paz]]. In the 18th century, architects of the region turned for inspiration to the [[Mudéjar]] art of medieval Spain. The late Baroque type of Peruvian façade first appears in the Church of Our Lady of La Merced in Lima. Similarly, the Church of La Compañia in [[Quito]] suggests a carved altarpiece with its richly sculpted façade and a surfeit of spiral [[salomónica]].

Earthquake Baroque is a style of Baroque architecture found in the [[Philippines]], which suffered destructive [[earthquake]]s during the 17th century and 18th century, where large public buildings, such as [[Church (building)|churches]], were rebuilt in a [[Baroque]] style. Similar events led to the [[Pombaline Downtown|Pombaline]] architecture in [[Lisbon]] following the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] and [[Sicilian Baroque]] in [[Sicily]] following the [[1693 Sicily earthquake|1693 earthquake]].

Nothwithstanding a prodigality of sensually rich surface decoration associated with Baroque architecture of the Iberian Peninsula, the royal courts of [[Madrid]] and [[Lisbon]] generally favoured a more sober architectural vocabulary distilled from 17th-century Italy. The [[Royal Palace of Madrid|royal palaces of Madrid]], [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]], [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]] and [[Convent of Mafra|Mafra]] were designed by architects under strong influence of Bernini and Juvarra. In the realm of church architecture, Guarini's design for Santa Maria della Divina Providenza in Lisbon was a pace-setter for structural audacity in the region (even though it was never built).

In Portugal, the first fully Baroque church was the [[Church of Santa Engrácia]], in Lisbon, designed by royal architect [[João Antunes]], which has a Greek cross floorplan and curved facades. Antunes also designed churches in which the inner space is rectangular but with curved corners (like the Menino de Deus Church in Lisbon), a scheme that is found in several 18th-century churches in Portugal and Brazil. The court of John V, on the other hand, favoured Roman baroque models, as attested by the work of royal architect [[Ludovice]], a German who designed the [[Convent of Mafra|Royal Palace of Mafra]], built after 1715.

By the mid-18th century, northern Portuguese architects had absorbed the concepts of Italian Baroque to revel in the plasticity of local granite in such projects as the surging 75-metre-high [[Torre dos Clérigos]] in [[Porto]]. The foremost centre of the national Baroque tradition was [[Braga]], whose buildings encompass virtually every important feature of Portuguese architecture and design. The Baroque shrines and palaces of Braga are noted for polychrome ornamental patterns, undulating roof-lines, and irregularly shaped window surrounds.

Brazilian architects also explored plasticity in form and decoration, though they rarely surpassed their continental peers in ostentation. The churches of Mariana and the Rosario at Ouro Preto are based on Borromini's vision of interlocking elliptical spaces. At São Pedro dos Clérigos, Recife), a conventional stucco-and-stone façade is enlivened by "a high scrolled gable squeezed tightly between the towers".

Even after the Baroque conventions passed out of fashion in Europe, the style was long practised in Brazil by [[Aleijadinho]], a brilliant and prolific architect in whose designs hints of Rococo could be discerned. His church of Bom Jesus de Matozinhos at Congonhas is distinguished by a picturesque silhouette and dark ornamental detail on a light stuccoed façade. Although Aleijadinho was originally commissioned to design São Francisco de Assis at São João del Rei, his designs were rejected, and were displaced to the [[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi (Ouro Preto)|church of São Francisco]] in Ouro Preto instead.

[[File:Gyoribencestemplom.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Széchenyi Square of [[Győr]], [[Hungary]]]]
In the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the first great Baroque building was the Jesuit Church of [[Trnava]] (today in [[Slovakia]]) built by Pietro Spozzo in 1629–37, modelling the [[Church of the Gesu]] in Rome. [[Jesuits]] were the main propagators of the new style with their churches in [[Győr]] (1634–1641), [[Košice]] (1671–1684), [[Eger]] (1731–1733) and [[Székesfehérvár]] (1745–1751). The reconstruction of the territories devastated by the [[Ottoman Empire]] was carried out in Baroque style in the 18th century. Intact Baroque townscapes can be found in [[Győr]], [[Székesfehérvár]], [[Eger]], [[Veszprém]], [[Esztergom]] and the [[Castle District, Buda|Castle District]] of [[Buda]]. The most important Baroque palaces in Hungary were the [[Buda Castle|Royal Palace]] in Buda, [[Grassalkovich Palace]] in [[Gödöllő]], and [[Eszterháza|Esterházy Palace]] in [[Fertőd]]. Smaller Baroque edifices of the Hungarian aristocracy are scattered all over the country. Hungarian Baroque shows the double influence of Austrian and Italian artistic tendencies as many German and Italian architects worked in the country. The main characteristics of the local version of the style were modesty, lack of excessive decoration, and some "rural" flavour, especially in the works of the local masters. Important architects of the Hungarian Baroque were Andreas Mayerhoffer, Ignác Oraschek and Márton Wittwer. Franz Anton Pilgram also worked in the Kingdom of Hungary, for example on the great [[Premonstratensian]] monastery of [[Jászó|Jasov]] (today in [[Slovakia]]). In the last decades of the 18th century Neo-Classical tendencies became dominant. The two most important architects of that period were Melchior Hefele and [[Jakab Fellner]].

By the time Hungarian varieties of Baroque architecture appeared with several types of forms, shapes and decorations. Those that have become famous and nice, have been copied. That's why the Hungarian baroque edifices make groups based on similarities. The major kinds of buildings are the following: Eszterháza-type, Széchenyi-type, Gödöllő-type, religious (ecclesiastical) baroque, houses, and others (castles, peasant houses).

[[File:Château de Maisons-Laffitte 001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Château de Maisons]] near Paris by [[François Mansart]] (1642)]]

The centre of Baroque secular architecture was France, where the open three-wing layout of the palace was established as the canonical solution as early as the 16th century. But it was the [[Palais du Luxembourg]] by [[Salomon de Brosse]] that determined the sober and classicizing direction that French Baroque architecture was to take. For the first time, the [[corps de logis]] was emphasized as the representative main part of the building, while the side wings were treated as hierarchically inferior and appropriately scaled down. The medieval tower has been completely replaced by the central projection in the shape of a monumental three-storey gateway.

De Brosse's melding of traditional French elements (e.g. lofty [[mansard roof]]s and a complex roof-line) with extensive Italianate quotations (e.g. ubiquitous rustication, derived from [[Palazzo Pitti]] in [[Florence]]) came to characterize the [[Louis XIII style]]. Probably the most accomplished formulator of the new manner was [[François Mansart]], a tireless perfectionist credited with introducing the full Baroque to France. In his design for [[Château de Maisons]] (1642), Mansart succeeded in reconciling academic and Baroque approaches, while demonstrating respect for the gothic-inherited idiosyncrasies of the French tradition.

[[File:Versailles Chapel - July 2006 edit.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|&lt;center&gt;Versailles's chapel as seen from the ''tribune royale'', an outstanding example of French Baroque&lt;/center&gt;]]

The Château of Maisons demonstrates the ongoing transition from the post-medieval [[chateau]]x of the 16th century to the villa-like country houses of the 18th. The structure is strictly symmetrical, with an order applied to each storey, mostly in [[pilaster]] form. The frontispiece, crowned with a separate aggrandized roof, is infused with remarkable plasticity and the ensemble reads like a three-dimensional whole. Mansart's structures are stripped of overblown decorative effects, so typical of contemporary Rome. Italian Baroque influence is muted and relegated to the field of decorative ornamentation.

The next step in the development of European residential architecture involved the integration of the gardens in the composition of the palace, as is exemplified by [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]]), where the architect [[Louis Le Vau]], the designer [[Charles Le Brun]] and the gardener [[André Le Nôtre]] complemented one another. From the main cornice to a low plinth, the miniature palace is clothed in the so-called "colossal order", which makes the structure look more impressive. The creative collaboration of Le Vau and Le Nôtre marked the arrival of the "Magnificent Manner" which allowed to extend Baroque architecture outside the palace walls and transform the surrounding landscape into an immaculate mosaic of expansive vistas.

[[File:Les Invalides in Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Les Invalides]] in Paris by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] (1676)]]

The same three artists scaled this concept to monumental proportions in the royal hunting lodge and later main [[Palace of Versailles|residence at Versailles]]. On a far grander scale, the palace is an exaggerated and somewhat repetitive version of Vaux-le-Vicomte. It was both the most grandiose and the most imitated residential building of the 17th century. [[Mannheim]], [[Nordkirchen]] and [[Drottningholm Palace|Drottningholm]] were among many foreign residences for which Versailles provided a model.

The final expansion of Versailles was superintended by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], whose key design is the [[Dome des Invalides]], generally regarded as the most important French church of the century. Hardouin-Mansart profited from his uncle's instruction and plans to instill the edifice with an imperial grandeur unprecedented in the countries north of Italy. The majestic hemispherical dome balances the vigorous vertical thrust of the orders, which do not accurately convey the structure of the interior. The younger architect not only revived the harmony and balance associated with the work of the elder Mansart but also set the tone for Late Baroque French architecture, with its grand ponderousness and increasing concessions to [[academicism]].

The reign of [[Louis XV]] saw a reaction against the official [[Louis XIV Style]] in the shape of a more delicate and intimate manner, known as [[Rococo]]. The style was pioneered by [[Nicolas Pineau]], who collaborated with Hardouin-Mansart on the interiors of the royal [[Château de Marly]]. Further elaborated by [[Pierre Lepautre (1652–1716)|Pierre Le Pautre]] and [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonier]], the "''genre pittoresque''" culminated in the interiors of the [[Château de Chantilly|Petit Château at Chantilly]] (c. 1722) and [[Hôtel de Soubise]] in Paris (c. 1732), where a fashionable emphasis on the curvilinear went beyond all reasonable measure, while sculpture, paintings, furniture, and porcelain tended to overshadow architectural divisions of the interior.

==The Low Countries==

===Flanders and Belgium===
[[File:Leuven Sint-Michielskerk.jpg|thumb|Church of St. Michel in [[Leuven]], Belgium by [[Willem Hesius]] (1650)]]

Baroque architecture in the south, [[Flanders and Belgium]] developed rather differently from in the Protestant . After the [[Twelve Years' Truce]], the Southern Netherlands remained in Catholic hands, ruled by the Spanish [[Habsburg]] Kings. Important architectural projects were set up in the spirit of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. In them, florid decorative detailing was more tightly knit to the structure, thus precluding concerns of superfluity. A remarkable convergence of Spanish, French, and Dutch Baroque aesthetics may be seen in the [[Abbey of Averbode]] (1667). Another characteristic example is the Church of St. Michel at [[Leuven|Louvain]], with its exuberant two-storey façade, clusters of half-columns, and the complex aggregation of French-inspired sculptural detailing.

Six decades later, a [[Flanders|Flemish]] architect, Jaime Borty Milia, was the first to introduce [[Rococo]] to Spain ([[Cathedral of Murcia]], west façade, 1733). The greatest practitioner of the Spanish Rococo style was a native master, [[Ventura Rodríguez]], responsible for the dazzling interior of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar]] in [[Zaragoza]] (1750).

Some Flemish architects such as [[Wenceslas Cobergher]] were trained in Italy and their works were inspired by architects such as [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]]. Cobergher's most major project was the Basilica of Our Lady of [[Scherpenheuvel-Zichem|Scherpenheuvel]] which he designed as the center of a new town in the form of a [[heptagon]].

The influence of the painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]] on architecture was very important. With his book "I [[Palazzi di Genova]]" he introduced novel Italian models for the conception of profane buildings and decoration in the Southern Netherlands. The courtyard and portico of his own house in Antwerp ([[Rubenshuis]]) are good examples of his architectural activity. He also took part in the decoration of the Antwerp Jesuit Church (now [[Carolus Borromeuskerk]]) where he introduced a lavish Baroque decoration, integrating sculpture and painting in the architectural program.

===Northern Netherlands===
{{main article|Dutch Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Koninklijk Paleis Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Amsterdam City Hall]] by [[Jacob van Campen]] (1646)]]
There is little Baroque about Dutch architecture of the 17th century. The architecture of the first republic in Northern Europe was meant to reflect democratic values by quoting extensively from classical antiquity. Like contemporary developments in England, Dutch [[Palladianism]] is marked by sobriety and restraint. Two leading architects, [[Jacob van Campen]] and [[Pieter Post]], used such eclectic elements as giant-order pilasters, gable roofs, central pediments, and vigorous steeples in a coherent combination that anticipated Wren's Classicism.

The most ambitious constructions of the period included the [[town hall|seats of self-government]] in [[Amsterdam]] (1646) and [[Maastricht]] (1658), designed by Campen and Post, respectively. On the other hand, the residences of the [[House of Orange]] are closer to a typical burgher mansion than to a royal palace. Two of these, [[Huis ten Bosch]] and [[Mauritshuis]], are symmetrical blocks with large windows, stripped of ostentatious Baroque flourishes and mannerisms. The same austerely geometrical effect is achieved without great cost or pretentious effects at the Stadholder's summer residence of [[Het Loo]].

The [[Dutch Republic]] was one of the [[great powers]] of 17th-century Europe and its influence on European architecture was by no means negligible. Dutch architects were employed on important projects in Northern Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, disseminating their ideas in those countries. The Dutch colonial architecture, once flourishing in the [[Hudson River]] Valley and associated primarily with red-brick gabled houses, may still be seen in [[Willemstad]], [[Curaçao]].

== England ==
{{Main article|English Baroque|Edwardian Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Greenwich Hospital from Thames.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]] by Sir [[Christopher Wren]] (1694)]]

Baroque aesthetics, whose influence was so potent in mid-17th-century France, made little impact in England during [[the Protectorate]] and the first [[English Restoration|Restoration years]]. For a decade between the death of [[Inigo Jones]] in 1652 and [[Christopher Wren]]'s visit to Paris in 1665 there was no English architect of the accepted premier class. Unsurprisingly, general interest in European architectural developments was slight.

It was Wren who presided over the genesis of the English Baroque manner, which differed from the continental models by a clarity of design and a subtle taste for classicism. Following the [[Great Fire of London]], Wren rebuilt fifty-three churches, where Baroque aesthetics are apparent primarily in dynamic structure and multiple changing views. His most ambitious work was [[St Paul's Cathedral]], which bears comparison with the most effulgent domed churches of Italy and France. In this majestically proportioned edifice, the [[Palladian]] tradition of Inigo Jones is fused with contemporary continental sensibilities in masterly equilibrium. Less influential were straightforward attempts to engraft the Berniniesque vision onto British church architecture (e.g. by [[Thomas Archer]] in [[St. John's, Smith Square]], 1728).
[[File:England1 144.jpg|thumb|left|[[Castle Howard]], [[North Yorkshire]]]]

Although Wren was also active in secular architecture, the first truly Baroque [[English country houses|country house]] in England was built to a design by [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] at [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]], starting in 1687. The culmination of Baroque architectural forms comes with Sir [[John Vanbrugh]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]. Each was capable of a fully developed architectural statement, yet they preferred to work in tandem, most notably at [[Castle Howard]] (1699) and [[Blenheim Palace]] (1705).

Although these two palaces may appear somewhat ponderous or turgid to Italian eyes, their heavy embellishment and overpowering mass captivated the British public, albeit for a short while. Castle Howard is a flamboyant assembly of restless masses dominated by a cylindrical domed tower which would not be out of place in [[Dresden]] or [[Munich]]. Blenheim is a more solid construction, where the massed stone of the arched gates and the huge solid portico becomes the main ornament. Vanbrugh's final work was [[Seaton Delaval Hall]] (1718), a comparatively modest mansion yet unique in the structural audacity of its style. It was at Seaton Delaval that Vanbrugh, a skillful playwright, achieved the peak of Restoration drama, once again highlighting a parallel between Baroque architecture and contemporary theatre. Despite his efforts, Baroque was never truly to the English taste and well before his death in 1724, the style had lost currency in Britain.

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Baroque period began somewhat later. Although the [[Augsburg]] architect [[Elias Holl]] (1573–1646) and some theoretists, including [[Joseph Furttenbach the Elder]] already practiced the Baroque style, they remained without successors due to the ravages of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. From about 1650 on, construction work resumed, and secular and ecclesiastical architecture were of equal importance. During an initial phase, master-masons from southern Switzerland and northern Italy, the so-called ''magistri Grigioni'' and the Lombard master-masons, particularly the [[Carlone]] family from Val d'Intelvi, dominated the field. However, Austria came soon to develop its own characteristic Baroque style during the last third of the 17th century. [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]] was impressed by [[Bernini]]. He forged a new ''Imperial'' style by compiling architectural motifs from the entire history, most prominently seen in his [[Karlskirche]] in Vienna. [[Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt]] also had an Italian training. He developed a highly decorative style, particularly in façade architecture, which exerted strong influences on southern Germany.

[[File:Karlskirche Vienna June 2006 475.jpg|thumb|right|250|[[Karlskirche]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]]]
Frequently, the Southern German Baroque is distinguished from the Northern German Baroque, which is more properly the distinction between the Catholic and the Protestant Baroque. In the Catholic South, the Jesuit church of [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|St. Michael]] in [[Munich]] was the first to bring Italian style across the Alps. However, its influence on the further development of church architecture was rather limited. A much more practical and more adaptable model of church architecture was provided by the Jesuit church in [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]]): the wall-pillar church, a [[barrel-vault]]ed nave accompanied by large open chapels separated by wall-pillars. As opposed to St. Michael's in Munich, the chapels almost reach the height of the nave in the wall-pillar church, and their vault (usually transverse barrel-vaults) springs from the same level as the main vault of the nave. The chapels provide ample lighting; seen from the entrance of the church, the wall-pillars form a theatrical setting for the side altars. The wall-pillar church was further developed by the [[Vorarlberg]] school, as well as the master-masons of [[Bavaria]]. This new church also integrated well with the [[hall church]] model of the German late Gothic age. The wall-pillar church continued to be used throughout the 18th century (e.g. even in the early neo-classical church of [[Rot an der Rot Abbey]]), and early wall-pillar churches could easily be refurbished by re-decoration without any structural changes, such as the church at Dillingen.

[[File:Vierzehnheiligen-Basilika3-Asio.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.95|Interior of [[Vierzehnheiligen]] church in [[Bavaria]]]]
However, the Catholic South also received influences from other sources, such as the so-called ''radical Baroque'' of [[Bohemia]]. The radical Baroque of [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]] and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]], both residing at [[Prague]], was inspired by examples from northern Italy, particularly by the works of [[Guarino Guarini]]. It is characterized by the curvature of walls and intersection of oval spaces. While some Bohemian influence is visible in Bavaria's most prominent architect of the period, [[Johann Michael Fischer]] (the curved balconies of some of his earlier wall-pillar churches), the works of [[Balthasar Neumann]], in particular the [[Basilica of the Vierzehnheiligen]], are generally considered to be the final synthesis of Bohemian and German traditions.

In the [[Slovene Lands]], especially in [[Carniola]], Baroque arrived in the first half of the 17th century mostly through Italian influences. [[Ljubljana]] emerged as an important regional center of Baroque architecture in the early 18th century, mostly with the work of northern Italian artists such as [[Andrea Pozzo]], [[Francesco Robba]], [[Carlo Martinuzzi]] and [[Domenico Rossi (architect)|Domenico Rossi]]. Their work in the today's [[Slovenia]]'s capital incoporated many northern, especially Bohemian and Austrian elements, yet Slovenian baroque maintains a recognizably Italian touch to it.
[[Lower Styria]] was more influenced by various Austrian schools, especially [[Joseph Hueber]] and his pupils who built a number of manors in what is now eastern Slovenia.

[[File:Praha 2005-09-15 St Nicholas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[St. Nicholas Church (Prague)|Church of St Nicholas]], [[Lesser Town]], the most famous Baroque church in [[Prague]]]]
Protestant sacred architecture was of lesser importance during the Baroque, and produced only a few works of prime importance, particularly the [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in [[Dresden]]. Architectural theory was more lively in the north than in the south of Germany, with [[Leonhard Christoph Sturm]]'s edition of [[Nikolaus Goldmann]], but Sturm's theoretical considerations (e.g. on Protestant church architecture) never really made it to practical application. In the south, theory essentially reduced to the use of buildings and elements from illustrated books and engravings as a prototype.

Palace architecture was equally important both in the Catholic South and the Protestant North. After an initial phase when Italian architects and influences dominated ([[Vienna]], [[Rastatt]]), French influence prevailed from the second decade of the 18th century onwards. The French model is characterized by the horseshoe-like layout enclosing a cour d'honneur (courtyard) on the town side (chateau entre cour et jardin), whereas the Italian (and also Austrian) scheme presents a block-like villa. The principal achievements of German Palace architecture, often worked out in close collaboration of several architects, provide a synthesis of Austro-Italian and French models. The most outstanding palace which blends Austro-Italian and French influences into a completely new type of building is the [[Würzburg Residence]]. While its general layout is the horseshoe-like French plan, it encloses interior courtyards. Its façades combine Lucas von Hildebrandt's love of decoration with French-style classical orders in two superimposed stories; its interior features the famous Austrian "imperial staircase", but also a French-type [[Enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of rooms on the garden side, inspired by the "apartement semi-double" layout of French castles.

By the end of the century, Polish Baroque influences crossed the [[Dnieper]] river into the [[Cossack Hetmanate]], where it gave birth to a particular style of architecture, known as the ''[[Cossack Baroque]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nicholas L.

Notable buildings of Vilnian Baroque in other places are [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Polotsk]], Belarus (rebuilt between 1738 and 1765), [[Carmelite]] church in [[Hlybokaye]], Belarus and the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Berezovichi, Belarus (built in 1776, and 1960s-1970s).

[[Ukrainian Baroque]] is an architectural style that emerged in Ukraine during the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] era, in the 17th and 18th centuries. Ukrainian Baroque is distinct from the Western European Baroque in having more moderate ornamentation and simpler forms, and as such was considered more constructivist. One of the unique features of the Ukrainian baroque, were [[Onion dome|bud and pear-shaped domes]], that were later borrowed by the similar [[Naryshkin baroque]].&lt;ref&gt;Власов В.Г. Большой энциклопедический словарь изобразительного искусства В 8т. [http://cih.ru/ae/af41.html  Нарышкинский стиль]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Ukrainian Baroque buildings have been preserved, including several buildings in [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] and the [[Vydubychi Monastery]].
The best examples of [[Baroque painting]] are the church paintings in the [[Church of the Trinity (Pechersk Lavra)|Holy Trinity Church]] of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. Rapid development in engraving techniques occurred during the Ukrainian Baroque period. Advances utilized a complex system of [[symbol]]ism, allegories, heraldic signs, and sumptuous ornamentation.

In Russia, Baroque architecture passed through three stages—the early [[Naryshkin Baroque|Moscow Baroque]], with elegant white decorations on red-brick walls of rather traditional churches, the mature [[Petrine Baroque]], mostly imported from the Low Countries, and the late [[Rastrelli|Rastrelliesque Baroque]], which was, in the words of William Brumfield, "extravagant in design and execution, yet ordered by the rhythmic insistence of massed columns and Baroque statuary."

The first baroque churches were built in the estates of the [[Naryshkin]] family of Moscow [[boyar]]s. It was the family of [[Nataliya Kyrillovna Naryshkina|Natalia Naryshkina]], [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s mother. Most notable in this category of small suburban churches were the [[Church of the Intercession at Fili|Intercession in Fili]] (1693–96), the Holy Tritity church in Troitse-Lykovo (1690–1695) and the Saviour in Ubory (1694–97). They were built in red [[brick]] with profuse detailed decoration in white stone. The [[Bell tower|belfry]] was not any more placed beside the church as was common in the 17th century, but on the [[facade]] itself, usually surmounting the octagonal central church and producing daring vertical compositions. As the style gradually spread around [[Russia]], many monasteries were remodeled after the latest fashion. The most delightful of these were the [[Novodevichy Convent]] and the [[Donskoy Monastery]] in Moscow, as well as [[Krutitsy]] [[metochion]] and Solotcha Cloister near [[Riazan]]. Civic architecture also sought to conform to the baroque aesthetics, e.g., the [[Sukharev Tower]] in [[Moscow]] and there is also a neo-form of this style like the [[State Historical Museum|Principal Medicine Store]] on [[Red Square]]. The most important architects associated with the Naryshkin Baroque were [[Yakov Bukhvostov]] and [[Peter Potapov]].

[[Petrine Baroque]] is a name applied by art historians to a style of Baroque architecture and decoration favoured by [[Peter the Great]] and employed to design buildings in the newly founded Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], under this monarch and his immediate successors. Unlike contemporaneous [[Naryshkin Baroque]], favoured in [[Moscow]], the Petrine Baroque represented a drastic rupture with Byzantine traditions that had dominated [[Russian architecture]] for almost a millennium. Its chief practitioners—[[Domenico Trezzini]], [[Andreas Schlüter]], and [[Mikhail Zemtsov]]—drew inspiration from a rather modest Dutch, Danish, and Swedish architecture of the time. Extant examples of the style in St Petersburg are the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]], the [[Twelve Colleges]], the [[Kunstkamera]], [[Kikin Hall]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].The Petrine Baroque structures outside St Petersburg are scarce; they include the [[Menshikov Tower]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[Kadriorg Palace]] in [[Tallinn]].

[[File:Copenhagen amalienborg seen from opera house.jpg|thumb|[[Amalienborg Palace]], a Baroque quarter in the center of [[Copenhagen]]]]

During the golden age of the [[Swedish Empire]], the architecture of Nordic countries was dominated by the Swedish court architect [[Nicodemus Tessin the Elder]] and his son [[Nicodemus Tessin the Younger]]. Their aesthetic was readily adopted across the Baltic, in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Saint Petersburg]].

Born in Germany, Tessin the Elder endowed Sweden with a truly national style, a well-balanced mixture of contemporary French and medieval Hanseatic elements. His designs for the royal manor of [[Drottningholm Palace|Drottningholm]] seasoned French prototypes with Italian elements, while retaining some peculiarly Nordic features, such as the [[hip roof|hipped roof]] (''säteritak'').

Tessin the Younger shared his father's enthusiasm for discrete palace façades. His design for the [[Stockholm Palace]] draws so heavily on Bernini's unexecuted plans for the [[Louvre]] that one could well imagine it standing in Naples, Vienna, or Saint Petersburg. Another example of the so-called International Baroque, based on Roman models with little concern for national specifics, is the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]. The same approach is manifested is Tessin's polychrome domeless [[:File:Kalmarer Dom aussen.jpg|Kalmar Cathedral]], a skillful pastiche of early Italian Baroque, clothed in a giant order of paired Ionic pilasters.

It was not until the mid-18th century that Danish and Russian architecture were emancipated from Swedish influence. A milestone of this late period is [[Nicolai Eigtved]]'s design for a new district of [[Copenhagen]] centred on the [[Amalienborg Palace]]. The palace is composed of four rectangular mansions, originally owned by four of Denmark's greatest noble families, arranged across the angles of an octagonal square. The restrained façades of the mansions hark back to French antecedents, while their interiors contain some of the finest Rococo decoration in Northern Europe. Amalienborg Palace has served as the residence of the [[Danish royal family]] since the late 18th century.

[[Istanbul]], once the capital of the Ottoman Empire, hosts many different varieties of Baroque architecture.
As reforms and innovations to modernize the country came out in 18th and 19th century, various architecture styles were used in Turkey, one of them was the Baroque Style. As [[Ottoman architecture|Turkish architecture]] (which is also a combination of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and [[Byzantine architecture]]) combined with Baroque, a new style called Ottoman Baroque appeared.
Baroque architecture is mostly seen in mosques and palaces built in this centuries. The [[Ortaköy Mosque]], is one of the best examples of the Ottoman Baroque architecture.

The [[Tanzimat]] Era caused more architectural development. The architectural change continued with [[Sultan Mahmud II]], one of the most reformist sultans in Turkish History. One of his sons, [[Sultan Abdülmecid]] and his family left the [[Topkapı Palace]] and moved to the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] which is the first European-style palace in the country.

Baroque architecture in Istanbul was mostly used in palaces near the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Golden Horn]]. [[Beyoğlu]] was one of the places that Baroque and other European style architecture buildings were largely used. The famous streets called [[Istiklal Avenue]], [[Nişantaşı]], [[Bankalar Caddesi]] consist of these architecture style apartments.
The Ottoman flavour gives it its unique atmosphere, which also distinguishes it from the later "colonial" Baroque styles, largely used in the Middle East, especially [[Lebanon]].
Later and more mature Baroque forms in Istanbul can be found in the gates of the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] which also has a very "eastern" flavour, combining Baroque, Romantic, and Oriental architecture.

'''Behavioral strategy''' refers to the study of corporate or business strategies from a [[Microfoundations|micro-foundations perspective]]. This area of study is emerging in the field of [[management]] and [[economics]]. It considers the role of conscious and unconscious [[Bias|biases]] of executives, managers, teams, and organizations in strategic [[Decision theory|decision making]]. The field is emerging following similar developments in the fields of [[behavioral economics]] and [[behavioral finance]].

'''Blackman's theorem''' is a general procedure for calculating the change in an impedance due to feedback in a circuit. It was published by [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]] in 1943,&lt;ref name ="Blackman"/&gt; was connected to [[Signal-flow graph|signal-flow analysis]] by [[John Choma (professor)|John Choma]], and was made popular in the [[extra element theorem]] by [[R. D. Middlebrook]] and the [[asymptotic gain model]] of [[Solomon Rosenstark]].&lt;ref name=Feucht/&gt;&lt;ref name=Choma/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middlebrook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenstark/&gt; Blackman's approach leads to the formula for the impedance ''Z'' between two selected terminals of a negative feedback amplifier as '''Blackman's formula''':
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_D \frac {1+T_{SC}}{1+T_{OC}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''Z&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' = impedance with the feedback disabled, ''T&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'' = loop transmission with a small-signal short across the selected terminal pair, and ''T&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'' = loop transmission with an open circuit across the terminal pair.&lt;ref name=Palumbo/&gt; The loop transmission also is referred to as the [[return ratio]].&lt;ref name=Hurst/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicolic/&gt; Blackman's formula can be compared with Middlebrook's result for the input impedance ''Z&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a circuit based upon the extra-element theorem:&lt;ref name=Middlebrook/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeuchtD/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeuchtD1/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{in} = Z^{\infty}_{in} \left[ \frac{1+Z^0_{e}/Z}{1+ Z^{\infty}_{e}/Z}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;Z\ &lt;/math&gt; is the impedance of the extra element; &lt;math&gt;Z^{\infty}_{in}&lt;/math&gt; is the input impedance with &lt;math&gt;Z\ &lt;/math&gt; removed (or made infinite); &lt;math&gt;Z^0_{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance seen by the extra element &lt;math&gt;Z\ &lt;/math&gt; with the input shorted (or made zero); &lt;math&gt;Z^{\infty}_{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance seen by the extra element &lt;math&gt;Z\ &lt;/math&gt; with the input open (or made infinite).

Blackman's formula also can be compared with Choma's signal-flow result:&lt;ref name=Choma1/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{SS}=Z_{S0}\left[\frac{1+T_I}{1+T_Z}\right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_{S0}\ &lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;Z_{SS}\ &lt;/math&gt; under the condition that a selected parameter ''P'' is set to zero, return ratio &lt;math&gt;T_Z\ &lt;/math&gt; is evaluated with zero excitation and &lt;math&gt;T_I\ &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_Z\ &lt;/math&gt; for the case of short-circuited source resistance. As with the extra-element result, differences are in the perspective leading to the formula.&lt;ref name=FeuchtD1/&gt;

'''Corrected speed''' is the [[Rotational speed|speed]] a component would rotate at if the inlet temperature corresponded to ambient conditions at [[sea level]], on a standard day (i.e. 288.15&amp;nbsp;K).

Corrected speed '''&lt;math&gt;N/\sqrt{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;''' can be calculated as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;N/\sqrt{\theta} = N/\sqrt{T/288.15}.&lt;/math&gt;

Corrected speed is often abbreviated to &lt;math&gt;N_c&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; (for '''referred speed''').

So-called '''non-dimensional speed''' &lt;math&gt;N/\sqrt{T}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to corrected speed:

:&lt;math&gt;N/\sqrt{T}= (N/\sqrt{\theta}) / \sqrt{288.15}&lt;/math&gt;

Nomenclature:

*&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; – stagnation (or total) temperature (in [[kelvin]]s),
*&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; – real shaft speed,
*&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; – referred temperature.

In relative form, corrected speed, referred speed and non-dimensional speed are all measures of peripheral [[Mach number]].

The '''Cronulla Fisheries Centre''' or '''Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre''' is a heritage-listed former [[fisheries science|fisheries research centre]] and now public reserve and marine rescue base located at the Southern end of Nicholson Parade, [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]], [[Sutherland Shire]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was built from 1904. It is also known as '''The Cronulla Fisheries Centre and Hungry Point Reserve'''; '''NSW Fisheries Research Institute'''; '''CSIRO Fisheries Division''' and the '''CSIRO Division of Fisheries &amp; Oceanography'''. The property is owned by the [[Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales)|NSW Department of Primary Industries]], a [[government department|department]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The site has heritage listed buildings and several [[Australian Aboriginal]] sites.&lt;ref name=cfrc-history/&gt; It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Following a long history of internationally recognised research&lt;ref name=SMH-20111014/&gt; in 2011 a decision was made by the [[Government of New South Wales]] to decentralise the Centre's functions and staff to regional centres at [[Coffs Harbour]], [[Port Stephens (New South Wales)|Port Stephens]] and [[Nowra]].&lt;ref name="main page"/&gt; The decision created a degree of controversy&lt;ref name=SMH-20120910/&gt; as it was announced without any staff consultation, or a cost-benefit analysis. A Parliamentary Inquiry was held during 2012, and its chairman, [[Fred Nile]] MLC, reported that:&lt;ref name="enquiry-final report-media release"/&gt;
{{blockquote|"... [there was] an overwhelming case to retain the scientific staff, facilities and support personnel at the Centre ....".|}} 

In December 2012 the Government rejected the inquiry's recommendation,&lt;ref name=close2012/&gt; and in 2013 the Centre was closed. In 2014 the Government committed itself to keeping the site in public ownership. The '''Hungry Point Reserve Trust''' was created to manage the Crown land, and existing facilities are used by [[Marine Rescue NSW]], the [[New South Wales Police Force#Marine Area Command|Water Police]] and [[Roads and Maritime Services]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1548/&gt;

== Location ==
The former fisheries centre, and now Hungry Point Reserve, occupies an area of 3-hectares located at 202 Nicholson Parade at the southern-most tip of Cronulla Pensinsula overlooking Salmon Haul Bay and [[Gunnamatta Bay]] on [[Port Hacking]]. It is also opposite [[Bundeena]] in the [[Royal National Park]].&lt;ref name=cfrc-contact/&gt;. It is bound on the north by Darook Park, residential properties fronting Nicholson Parade and Cowra Place, and Salmon Haul Reserve on the north east of the site.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;

== History ==
===Indigenous history===
The Gwiyaga ([[Gweagal]]), a clan of the [[Tharawal|Dharawal]] tribe of indigenous Australians, are traditional custodians of the southern areas of [[Sydney]]. The Gweagal hunted and fished in the swamps between [[Botany Bay]] and Port Hacking. They spoke the Dharawal language. Radiocarbon dating indicates that Aborigines were using areas of the Royal National Park at least 7,500 years ago. Midden deposits are present along the entire foreshore with minor concentrations associated with rock shelters and extensive midden deposits visible beneath building foundations.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1531/&gt;

The area would have provided rich marine resources for inhabitants, in terms of both food resources and shelter. Shellfish and fish such as Sydney rock whelk and Sydney rock oyster were integral to the diet of coastal Aboriginal tribes, as were snapper and bream. Both men and women spent considerable time fishing. The diet of Dharawal people could also have included rhizomes of bracken fern, seeds of the wattle, fruit of the geebung (snotty gobbles) and the terminal buds of the cabbage tree palm.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Frank Cridland in his book ''The Story of Port Hacking, Cronulla and the Sutherland Shire'' (1924) spoke of Darook Park, and particularly the [[Wahgunyah]] Cliffs, immediately north of the Fisheries site, lamenting that the evidence of occupation of the area by the Aboriginal people was in danger of destruction by modern development. He commissioned surveyor and recorder of engraving sites, W.D.Campbell, to record the engravings visible (at the time) in the Cronulla area, including the vicinity of the Fisheries site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In the early 1960s archaeologist Ian Sim recorded engravings in the Darook Park area, along Darook Park Road (adjacent to the Wahgunyah Cliffs). Some of these engravings may still exist, but are now on private property.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1533/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

===Colonial history===
The earliest description of the area from a European perspective was given by explorer Matthew [[Flinders, New South Wales|Flinders]], who in April 1814 spent time navigating the shores of Port Hacking.
Explorers George Bass and Matthew Flinders camped adjacent to the "Fisheries Site" at (presumably) Salmon Haul Bay in 1776. They liaised with two of the local native people, a very early example of friendly relations between Europeans and members of the local native population.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Surveyor [[Robert Dixon (explorer)|Robert Dixon]] worked here in 1827-8, naming the beaches. At the south end of [[Bate Bay]] and north of the entrance to Port Hacking, John Connell was the first European settler, receiving a 380-acre grant in 1835. The suburb's name is from the Aboriginal word "kurranulla" meaning the place of pink seashells. In 1840 the beach was known as Kurranulla. In 1895 the area was subdivided and land offered for sale at 10 pounds per acre; in 1899 the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] named the area Gunnamatta (meaning sandy hills) but on 26/2/1908 it was officially changed to Cronulla, and Gunnamatta became the name of the beautiful bay on the Port Hacking side of this suburb.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

After the railway came to [[Sutherland, New South Wales|Sutherland]] in 1884, the area became popular for picnics - for which Cronulla has two assets: a fine ocean surfing beach, and on its southern side beautiful Gunnamatta Bay, an arm of Port Hacking. Before Cronulla was linked to Sydney by rail in 1939, it was necessary to travel to Sutherland and transfer to a steam tram which chuffed its way through sandy, sometimes bushland areas to the beach. An official post office opened in 1891, known as [[Cronulla Beach]] post office as at the time most of the settlement was on the beach side. It closed in 1893, reopened in 1907 and in 1929 its name changed officially to Cronulla. The first public school opened in 1910. Today there are two public schools and a high school, as well as convent schools.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1532&gt;Pollen &amp; Healy, 1988, 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

===Development of the Fisheries Research Centre===
====Hungry Point area and the evolution of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre (CFRC)====
Scientific fisheries research has been carried out at the Cronulla location for more than 110 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/history |publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industries |date=March 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406041117/http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/history |archivedate=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1800s and early 1900s the NSW Government was concerned at serious depletion of fish stocks in estuaries as a result of illegal overfishing and gross chemical pollution of Sydney harbour emanating from measures to combat the rat plague. The plan of the Fisheries Commissioners at the time was to employ aquaculture to supplement stocks of local species and also to improve the quality of the seafood available by importing live fish from the northern hemisphere for culture and release into local waters.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In 1881 the NSW Commissioners of Fisheries were appointed under the Fisheries Act 1881.&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; In 1895 Hungry Point was reserved for defence purposes.&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Hungry Point site now occupied by the CFRC was held as a reserve for defence purposes from 1895 until 1902, when an area of 1.37 ha on the Gunnamatta Bay side of the site was transferred from the Commonwealth for use by the NSW Government for the purpose of fish culture. The NSW Government was determined to appoint a fisheries expert of world repute, and in 1902 selected a 31 year old Norwegian, Harald Dannevig, who had constructed the Dunbar and [[Aberdeen, New South Wales|Aberdeen]] Marine Fish Hatcheries, and supervised their operation for 9 years. He had extensive knowledge of the commercial fishing industry in the North Sea, based on early training with his father, Gunder Dannevig, regarded as a world leader in fisheries stocking. In 1902 Harald Dannevig began duties in Sydney in the newly created position of Superintendent of Fisheries Investigations and Marine Hatcheries. He transported adult fish from the UK to Sydney, to supplement stocks in depleted NSW estuaries. He carefully selected the Cronulla site for the new hatchery and supervised construction and operation. All aspects of a potential fishing industry, both fresh and marine water, were investigated and extensive plans formulated by Dannevig. His plans were always based on expert practical work in the field and extensive discussions with fishers. He was called on by Government Commissions looking into fishing and food industries as well as giving advice to other Australian states.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Cronulla hatchery, experimental pool and laboratory were built in 1904, commissioned in 1905 and became fully operational in early 1906. Initial stocks of the hatchery included whiting, red bream, flathead, trevally and crayfish. Later snapper and other finfish were introduced. These all flourished in the pond but did not spawn. Dannevig had more success with flounder from [[Tasmania]], resulting in the liberation of 20 million young fish into Port Hacking, Botany Bay, [[Middle Harbour]] and [[Brisbane Water]]. The hatchering continued to culture finfish and shellfish species but more emphasis was placed on investigations into the biology of local species by hatchery staff and staff from Sydney University. The hatchery was closed in 1914, and the NSW Government embarked on other fisheries related projects including developing a commercial ocean trawl fishery.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Commonwealth Government appointed Dannevig to the position of founding Director of Fisheries for Australia in 1908. He designed and supervised construction of Australia's first marine research vessel, and went on to conduct the first investigations of fish resources off Australia until his death (aged 43), when the Commonwealth research ship FIV Endeavour was lost in extreme gale conditions off Macquarie Island in 1914. With the vast disruption of [[World War I]], the absence of Dannevig's leadership and insight, fisheries research and development did not progress in Australia until creation of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR, later CSIRO) in 1926. The CSIR's brief included initiation and conduct of research in connection with promotion of primary and secondary industries, training research workers, making grants for pure research and supervision of testing of scientific apparatus and standardisation. In 1929 the saltwater pool was used for experiments on the effect of electrical fields on sharks by Swedish engineer Dr E.O.Moller.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1537&gt;Harley, 2012, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In 1937 Dr Harold Thompson was appointed as the first Officer in Charge of the Fisheries Investigations Section of CSIR, which was renamed the CSIRO Division of Fisheries and Oceanography in 1956.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; The NSW Government's part holding of the Hungry Point site was transferred back to the Commonwealth in 1938 to accommodate the newly established CSIR Fisheries Division, and provision was made to also house the NSW Fish Biology Branch and students from Sydney University. Programmes were quickly developed in a wide range of research areas, initially related to tuna, whales and dolphins, coastal and estuarine hydrology, fish preservation, mullet and oysters. Subsequent decades saw the rapid expansion of research programmes in physical and chemical oceanography, fish biology, population dynamics and plankton research.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; The CSIRO Fisheries main building (Building 1) was completed in 1938.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1537/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

==== Cronulla Migrant Hostel (1949-1967) ====
In 1949 a [[Post-war immigration to Australia#Migrant reception and training centres|migrant hostel]] was built on the eastern half of the site to accommodate [[Post-war immigration to Australia|post-war migrants]] from Eastern Europe, many of whom were "[[Forced displacement|Displaced Persons]]".&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2016-Masterplan"/&gt; 

The new buildings were added to existing ex-naval huts built in the 1940s and used for the CSIR Fisheries School between 1946-1947. Altogether the Cronulla Migrant Hostel precinct included eighteen buildings.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt; The buildings were constructed of weatherboard and built on brick piers. The gabled roofs were made of corrugated sheet metal, which also clad the narrow verandahs.

The Government Gazette of 22 April 1949 announced acceptance of tenders for construction of accommodation for 200 migrants. Construction continued into 1950 when a carpenters strike threatened to delay completion of the hostel. The dispute was due to the communist-controlled Building Workers' Industrial Union opposing the immigration of refugees from communist-occupied Baltic countries.&lt;ref name="communist"/&gt; The hostel was sometimes called "Balt Camp" after the number of Baltic families housed there,&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1537"/&gt; though migrants came from other Eastern European countries.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;

The hostel temporarily closed in 1964 but was reopened in early 1966 to accommodate 102 migrants, mainly of British nationality.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt;

In 1967 the Cronulla Migrant Hostel was closed.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt; All but two of the hostels and associated buildings were demolished in the 1970. These two weatherboard buildings, located within a precinct with views over Port Hacking, have high heritage significance, being "rare examples of Postwar Migrant Hostel accommodation"&lt;ref name="2016-Masterplan"/&gt; and "the remaining site layout, buildings and landscape elements provide rare physical evidence of the first phase of the migration experience, accommodation in camps and the compulsory work obligation for men".&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;

==== Research ====
[[File:Examining a fish and crustaceans at the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre.jpg|thumb|Examining a fish and crustaceans at the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre, 1947]]

Until 2012 projects conducted at the Centre included research into [[bull shark]]s, [[Barotrauma]], [[giant cuttlefish]], prawns, [[Recreational fishery|recreational fishing]], [[commercial fisheries]], fish biology, the effects of climate change in NSW, threats to [[marine biodiversity]] in NSW, resource assessment and monitoring, and research surveys in estuaries.&lt;ref name=save-cfrc-research&gt;{{cite web| title=Current Research Projects| url=http://www.savecronullafisheries.net/research-projects.html| publisher=savecronullafisheries.net| accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cfrc-key-research&gt;{{cite web|title=Key research of Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence| url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/key-research| publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industries| accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DPI-Current research"&gt;{{cite web| title=Current Research Projects|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/184931/Current-Project-Summaries-for-Web_WILD-FISH_UPDATED-6-FEB12.pdf| work= Wild Fisheries | publisher=dpi.nsw.gov.au| accessdate=21 November 2012| pages=68| date=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 the CSIRO Building 16 fisheries laboratories and offices were completed.&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1537" /&gt; The CSIRO Marine Laboratories were transferred to [[Hobart]] in 1984 after 47 years of research at the Hungry Point site. These decades of research were of enormous importance in establishing the basis for oceanographic and fisheries research in Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The facilities at Cronulla were transferred back to the NSW Government in 1985 for the purposes of fisheries research, and research staff of the Fisheries Division of NSW Department of Agriculture moved to the site in July 1985, when the facility was renamed the NSW Fisheries Research Institute. Research carried out since then included investigations into the dynamics of trawl fish, estuarine fish and invertebrate populations. There have been research projects to investigate the effects of impounding waterways, the impact of the Deep-Water Ocean Outfalls, the ecological impact of the third runway at [[Sydney Airport]], the effects of fishing over seagrass and estimation of the level of catch in recreational fisheries.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1541&gt;Harley, 2012, 8-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Commonwealth government retained land title for the eastern part of {{convert|1.54|ha}} of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre site until 1988, following an agreement in 1984 between the Federal and State Governments.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; In 2004 NSW Fisheries was amalgamated with other departments to form the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1541/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; In 2005 the centenary of aquatic research at the Cronulla Marine Laboratories was celebrated.

Prior to its closure, as at March 2011 the {{convert|25|ha|adj=on}} Centre had 152 staff which included 18 research and eleven management professional staff. The Centre supported 22 postgraduate students, two overseas projects and two consultancies. The Centre had conducted{{clarify|date=November 2018|in what time period?}} 56 workshops/meetings, 182 field days, and 51 publications.&lt;ref name="main page"/&gt;

An inquiry into the closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence was instigated and a committee established by a [[New South Wales Legislative Council|NSW Legislative Council]] resolution, to report by 23 October 2012. The committee's resolutions included that the NSW Government reverse the decision to close the CFRC and not proceed with the closure. The NSW government responded in December 2012, stating it did not support their recommendation to reverse the decision to close the centre. The NSW Department of Primary Industries Director-General issued terms of reference to recommend future uses of the site. In November David Harley AM prepared a report, making 25 recommendations for the future use of the site. One was that a Management Trust be established to manage the site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1542&gt;Architectural Projects, 2016, 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parliamentary inquiry ===

====2012 Parliamentary speeches touching on the site's history====
The CFRC is an important part of Australian history. It should be held in the same reverence as the Elizabeth MacArthur Agricultural Institute, as the starting point for the Agriculture Industry in Australia. Under various names, the now Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre was the site from which fisheries resources of Australia were explored and the fishing industry developed. It was the first fisheries research centre in Australia and probably the southern hemisphere. Its buildings date back to 1902, these being purpose built at the time for fisheries research.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Since that time the site has housed fisheries scientists from either NSW or Commonwealth government agencies. It is the site which based the first chief scientist of fisheries in Australia, Harald Dannevig. From this base he surveyed the fish resources of eastern Australia to as far south as Macquarie Island and westwards in to Bass Strait as far as [[Western Australia]]. Amongst many gifted fisheries scientists and oceanographers, it has housed the first oceanographic scientists in Australia, the Chair of the International Whaling Commission and scientists who advised that body, who discovered deepwater resources and surveyed the prawn resources of the Gulf of Carpentaria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In addition, the site has indigenous cultural significance. CFRC is strewn with indigenous middens three of which are recognised under the Heritage Act as being worthy of conservation and protection. As part of the high school education program at the CFRC indigenous leaders take great pride in talking to students about how their people lived on this land and the importance of this land to them.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1543&gt;Montgomery, in NSW [[Parliament of New South Wales|Parliament]]. [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], 2012, 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The site has associations with a number of notable scientists including Harald Dannevig (as noted above), Dr Geoffrey Kesteven, John McIntosh, David Tranter, Baughan Wisely, David Rochford and Ian Munro. Through these scientists working together they produced the earliest science for Australia as well as New South Wales in fisheries knowledge.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

There is (also) a very important gentleman who was at Cronulla until CSIRO moved to Hobart. His name is Dr Keith Sainsbury. He is one of only two Australians to have been created a laureate and receive the [[Japan Prize]], the highest prize in science. He still works internationally, nationally and in New South Wales as an expert in fisheries management and most importantly he helps in the annual assessment process for determining the New South Wales take of the highly prized abalone and lobster fisheries.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1544&gt;Gerrard, in NSW Parliament, Legislative Council, 2012, 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation had utilised the site from 1949 until it transferred to Hobart in 1985. At that time, the Department of Agriculture's Division of Fisheries returned to the Cronulla site. 'The Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre is unique in Australia, and the site was handed over from the Commonwealth to the NSW Government in1984 in good faith that the site and buildings would continue to be used for marine research purposes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1545&gt;Reid, in NSW Parliament, Legislative Council, 2012, 70-71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Former hatchery building
Fish hatchery was established in {{circa|1904}}. Building constructed prior to 1914, probably {{circa|1904}}-1907. It was originally a laboratory wing (with open verandah on both sides) and a hatchery hall comprising a single open space containing fish tanks. It was thought to be vacant {{circa|1920}}-1930. The Commonwealth Scientific &amp; Industrial Research (later ... Organisation) CSIR/CSIRO operations post-1938 were in this building. The hall remained open until 1950.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Boat shed
Constructed between 1904 and 1914. Re-clad {{circa|1970}}s. Restoration work to cladding and windows repplaced in 2002. Originally had wharf at western side. Engine room at east probably re-clad but original structure. Used to house boats and marine equipment.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Fish pond
Constructed as part of the hatchery complex between 1904 and 1914. Complex established by (Commonwealth) Superintendent of Fisheries, Harald Dannevig.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

==== Findings and recommendations ====

The Chairman of the 'Select Committee on the Closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence', Fred Nile, said:&lt;ref name="enquiry-final report-media release"&gt;{{cite media release| last=Chung| first=C| title= Upper House Committee Reports on the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre Closure (Pre-amble) | url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/b6d8ac60c3700e46ca257aa00015215f/$FILE/Media%20Release%20&amp;%20Recommendations.pdf| publisher=Select Committee on Cronulla Fisheries Closures| accessdate=21 November 2012| pages=14| format=PDF| date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|"The Committee has concluded that there is an overwhelming case to retain the scientific staff, facilities and support personnel at the Centre and we have recommended that the Government reverse its decision. "

"Overall we have concluded that the closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence has been an example of how not to undertake decentralisation. The Government's failure to conduct any kind of economic appraisal before deciding to close the Centre is unacceptable. "

"The Committee was disappointed that the decision had been made with no stakeholder consultation, in particular, the Government did not consult then Chief Scientist of the [[New South Wales Department of Primary Industries|Department of Primary Industries]], and Director of the Centre, Professor [[Steve Kennelly]]. " }}

The Committees report made 13 recommendations, the first of which is:

{{Blockquote|"That the NSW Government reverse the decision to close the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence and not proceed with the closure.

"The Committee is working on the expectation that the NSW Government will accept Recommendation 1 based on the evidence of this report. In the event that the Government does not accept Recommendation 1, the Committee believes that the Government should consider the following recommendations.

Josephine Tovey in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that: "The inquiry,&amp;nbsp;... found the decision to close the centre and decentralise its activities to several coastal towns was made without any economic analysis, in conflict with the Government's own policies, and was never presented to cabinet.

==== Government response and outcomes ====
In September/October 2011, the [[O'Farrell ministry|O'Farrell Government]] announced closure of the centre and regional disbursement of the positions. Staff mounted an industrial and community campaign, including a website.&lt;ref name=close2012&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savecronullafisheries.net/|title=Cronulla fisheries to be closed and destroyed|last=|first=|date=16 November 2012|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210130316/http://www.savecronullafisheries.net/|archive-date=10 January 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Minister for Primary Industries, Katrina Hodgkinson, together with Minister [[Andrew Stoner]], the [[Deputy Premier of New South Wales|Deputy Premier]], announced on 8 September 2011 that the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence at Hungry Point, known as the Cronulla Fisheries site, was to be closed and its roles and functions were to be decentralised to regional coastal locations. Associate Professor David Harley {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} was appointed by the Department of Primary Industries director general to assess the future usages of the site under specific terms of reference.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1546&gt;NSW Parliamentary Hansard, 21/2/2013, 17540&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Select Committee Inquiry into the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre closure was published on 23 October 2012. On 22 November 2012, employees were advised that all further decommissioning of the site at Cronulla would be placed on hold until such time the Government responds to the recommendations made by the Committee's report and that no individual would be forced to make a decision, including to transfer or exit. However, where a staff member has already agreed to relocate, the Government has a duty of care to support them in their move at this time, and is therefore unable to simply cease offering this support. Similarly, the Government remains committed to a Decade of Decentralisation and recruitment for positions in regional locations needs to continue irrespective of the Government's response to the Committee's report. The Deputy Premier and Minister for Primary Industries announced the Government response on 14 December 2012.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1547&gt;Katrina Hodgkinson, MInister for Primary Industries, in NSW Parliamentary Hansard, 21/2/2013, 17535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; On 23 October 2012, the committee required the government to provide a response by 23 April 2014. Fred Nile claimed success at a rally to save the Fisheries Centre when the closure was "put on hold" on 21 November 2012. The NSW Government agreed to temporarily halt the closure until it could respond to the committees report,&lt;ref name="Nile-closureon hold"/&gt; but in December 2012 the Government rejected the main recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry and pressed ahead with closing the Centre.&lt;ref name=leader-close&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theleader.com.au/story/1186909/its-official-cronulla-fisheries-research-centre-will-close/ |title=It’s official: Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre will close |work=[[St George and Sutherland Shire Leader]] |date=14 December 2012 |accessdate=22 October 2014 |first=Murray |last=Trembath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoner and Hodgkinson gave a commitment that the site would remain in public ownership, with increased access to the public. On 4 April 2013 the Hungry Point Reserve Trust Board appointments were announced, to manage the area of the former Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre.&lt;ref name=dpi-pr-trust&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/462885/130401-med-rel-AS-Fisheries-Trust.pdf |title=TRUST BOARD TO MANAGE EX-FISHERIES RESEARCH SITE |publisher=NSW Government |date=2 April 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust manages the [[Crown land|Crown Reserve land]], the volunteer [[Marine Rescue NSW]] partly occupied the site (buildings 1, 3, 5, 9 and 22) by license,&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1548&gt;Architectural Projects, 2016, 18&lt;/ref&gt; NSW Water Police and [[Roads and Maritime Services]] took up other existing facilities on site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1548/&gt;&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=leader-safe&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theleader.com.au/story/1406972/fisheries-site-safe/?cs=1507 |title=Fisheries site safe |work=St George and Sutherland Shire Leader |date=5 April 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2014 |last=Trembath |first=Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence (CFRC) is a purpose built research facility on approximately three hectares on a headland in the Sydney suburb of Cronulla.1 It was the first fisheries research centre in Australia having been identified for the purpose by Harald Dannevig in 1895.2 The site as a whole is heritage listed, as are several individual aspects, these include the former hatchery building, the boat [[shed]] and the aquaria.3 There are three Aboriginal middens on the site that are also heritage listed. The CFRC site is wholly owned by the NSW Government.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1549&gt;Parliament of NSW. Legislative Council, 2012, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

=== Elements of the site include ===

;Former hatchery building
An L-shaped brick building with two wings, located on a flat (benched) area slightly above a boat shed and fish ponds at the western side of Hungry Point. Web-fired single skin [[brickwork]] walls with original single back [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and additional recent brick piers and [[buttress]]es to southern wing. New colourbond [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] roof. Interior of northern wing adapted for office use; southern [[veranda]]h of other wing infilled. Original features include door and window joinery.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Boat shed
Weatherboard wall, new colourbond corrugated iron [[gable]] roof. Located on eroded sea wall at edge of Port Hacking on western side of Hungry Point. Recent roller door on east side. Doors at west provide evidence of location of former wharf.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Fish pond
Concrete pool measuring {{convert|30|x|12|x|2|m}}, featuring more recent concrete sea wall, mesh sunshades and filter units.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Aboriginal middens
# Rockshelter with midden deposits which extend downslope for a distance of at least five metres below the shelter.
# Small area of midden down near holding pens on western side of complex.
# Large area of midden along the southeastern edge of the flat area at the top of the complex between building 15 and the fuel store beyond.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The area would have provided rich marine resources for Aboriginal inhabitants, in terms of both food resources and shelter. Shellfish and fish such as Sydney rock whelk and Sydney rock oyster were integral to the diet of coastal tribes, as were snapper and bream.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1550&gt;Attenbrow, 2010, 63: Therin, 2005, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women spent considerable time fishing from bark canoes with hooks made from ground Turban shell, and line made from twine from the cabbage tree palm leaf.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1551&gt;Dallas, 2004, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Shell middens result from Aboriginal exploitation and consumption of shellfish or mammal bone, stone artefacts, hearths, charcoal and occasionally, burials. They are usuaully located on elevated dry ground close to the aquatic environment from which the shellfish was exploited and where fresh water resources were available.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Littoral Rainforest Remnant
A remnant patch of forest survives on the site in Darook Park. This remnant is of a listed endangered ecological community in NSW, Littoral Rainforest overlooking Port Hacking. Port Jackson figs (Ficus rubiginosa) and other tree, shrubs such as endangered species, Prostanthera densa (villous mint bush) and groundcover species make up the community.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

=== Condition ===

As at 24 November 2000, Aboriginal middens have archaeological potential, subject to greater need of preservation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

=== Further information ===

Future management of these structures will aim to conserve all the original fabrics to maintain evidence and allow for the interpretation of their past uses. Consideration will be given to removing detracting elements from the exterior of the former hatchery building if structural investigation is permitted and a maintenance schedule, including painting of timber joinery in period colours may be instigated for three original structures.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In September/October 1911, the [[O'Farrell ministry|O'Farrell Government]] announces closure of the centre and regional disbursement of the positions. Staff mounted an industrial and community campaign.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
As at 31 March 2010, the Cronulla Fisheries Centre site as a whole is of national and state heritage significance because it is the first marine investigation establishment in Australia, commencing in 1904. It has had continual association with NSW and Commonwealth Government Fisheries investigations since then. The complex is associated with the work of the first Director of NSW and Commonwealth fisheries investigations, Harald Dannevig. Three original structures still exist on the site and are considered as a group to have State significance.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1552&gt;NSW Fisheries s.170 Register p81&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronulla Fisheries Centre was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

'''Dance science''' is the scientific study of [[dance]] and dancers, as well as the practical application of scientific principles to dance. Its aims are the enhancement of [[performance]], the reduction of [[injury]], and the improvement of [[well-being]] and [[health]].

[[Dance and health|Dance medicine and science]] as a field of study developed in the 1970s and 80s out of the field of [[sports medicine]]. In the early 1980s, the American Dance Festival (ADF) started including dance medicine courses in their course work for dancers. When ADF moved to Duke University, physicians from Duke University Hospital became interested in dancers. Then, in 1990, the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science ([[IADMS]])  was formed by an international group of dance medicine practitioners, dance educators, dance scientists, and dancers. Membership of IADMS began with 48 members in 1991, and has grown to over 900 members in 35 countries as of 2016.&lt;ref name=IADMSabout&gt;{{cite web|author=International Association for Dance Medicine &amp; Science |url=http://www.iadms.org/?page=A8 |title=About IADMS |publisher=iadms.org |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance science as an academic discipline has been evolving over the past 20 years.{{when|date=November 2018}} In the United Kingdom, three degrees (at master's level) now exist: one at the University of Bedfordshire,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beds.ac.uk/howtoapply/courses/postgraduate/next-year/dance-science University of Bedfordshire]&lt;/ref&gt; one at the [[University of Wolverhampton]], and one at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London. With regards to dance science research, another UK institution which has staff and students active in the area is [[the University of Birmingham]].   Some undergraduate degrees in dance, or other dance courses, also include one or several modules in dance science, with the aim of promoting healthy dance practices. These include the [[University of Wolverhampton]], the [[Royal Academy of Dance]], and [[Bird College]].

Several universities in the United States also offer dance science courses as part of their dance curriculum, accommodating both undergraduate and graduate level students. These include, but are not limited to: Cornish College of the Arts, Columbia College of Chicago, California State - Long Beach, Elon University, Florida State University, [[Goucher College]], Long Island University - Brooklyn Campus, Ohio State University, Ohio University, UCLA - Irvine, University of Colorado, University of Illinois - Urbana Champagne, and the University of Oregon.

Typically, the subject areas within dance science are similar to those studied in "[[sports science]]", though naturally with a focus on dance and the special considerations that this involves. They include: [[physiology]], [[anatomy]], [[kinesiology]], [[psychology]], [[biomechanics]], [[nutrition]], and similar. However, unlike sports science, dance science sometimes also studies related topics such as [[creativity]] and somatic techniques, including the practices of [[Pilates]], [[yoga]], [[Alexander technique]], [[Feldenkrais method]], etc.

Some dance companies employ dance scientists to provide support services, such as physiological testing, psychological support, conditioning and nutritional counseling. Such professionals include physical therapists, nutritionists, pilates instructors, massage therapists, and dance medicine physicians. Dancers that are not employed by a dance company that offers rehabilitation benefits on-site can sometimes have access to such facilities within their city of residence. Dancers in New York City have access to The Harkness Center for Dance Injuries, located at the NYU-Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, which offers many subsidized and free services for the dance community. These services include "clinics staffed by orthopedists and dance physical therapists; state-of-the art research and rehabilitation technology and free injury prevention screenings and lectures."  Westside Physical Therapy, directed and founded by Marika Molnar - the first physical therapist hired by the New York City Ballet - is another example of a physical therapy clinic in New York City that offers specialized care to dancers (as well as to non-dancers).

The largest organization promoting dance science internationally is the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science ([[IADMS]]). As well as producing a scientific peer-reviewed journal, ''Journal of Dance Medicine and Science'', it also holds an annual conference. The Performing Arts Medicine Association (PAMA), which holds its annual symposium in Aspen-Snowmass, Colorado, is a unique organization that concerns itself with the injuries and health issues of musicians as well as dancers. In the UK, DanceUK is perhaps the foremost proponent of dance science and healthy dance practice more generally. A conference entitled "From Cognition to Conditioning" was held at [[Middlesex University]] in February 2007.

== Early life ==
Daud Rahbar grew up in [[Model Town, Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] between 1929 and 1949. The town was the first cooperative society in the Indian subcontinent, a suburb based on the design of a Hindu architect, Divan Khem Chand. The town was autonomous from Lahore City's jurisdiction, and sectioned into blocks. Each block was populated by either [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]] or [[Hindus]] (where the Hindus constitute the largest community). He remarked that his close association with Hindus "made the love of Hindu communities a natural condition of [his] soul."{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=87}} His childhood was spent writing poetry (he took the pen name 'Rahbar' at the age of eight), gardening and walking with his father while discussing [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] and [[Persian literature]]. He was an excellent tennis player.

== Family ==
Rahbar's father, Dr. Muhammad Iqbal (1894–1948), was named after [[Sir Muhammad Iqbal]].&lt;ref name="other_iqbal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jang.com.pk/thenews/jul2011-weekly/nos-31-07-2011/lit.htm#3 |title=The other Iqbal |publisher=The News International |author=Mohyeddin, Zia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620235743/http://jang.com.pk/thenews/jul2011-weekly/nos-31-07-2011/lit.htm#3 |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with an [[Master of Arts|M.A]] in [[Arabic]] and was the recipient of a State scholarship from the [[University of Cambridge]]. He studied under Arabist professors [[Edward G. Browne]], [[Reynold A. Nicholson|R.A. Nicholson]] and [[Anthony Ashley Bevan]]. After receiving his PhD, Iqbal was appointed Professor of [[Persian language]] at the [[University of the Punjab]] in 1922 and remained for 26 years. He was later appointed President of [[Oriental College, Lahore]].

Rahbar had five siblings. Rahbar married Sabiha Ahmed on 9 April 1950. The couple had two daughters, Sameera and Anisa. Sabiha's father Aga Ghiassudin Ahmed, was a lawyer and botanist and President of Agricultural College in [[Faisalabad|Lyallpur]] (now [[University of Agriculture, Faisalabad]]). Sabiha was a poet as well, although she never received recognition.

His first cousin, [[Zia Mohyeddin]],&lt;ref name="other_iqbal" /&gt; is a well-known media personality and artist from [[Pakistan]], who played the lead role in ''[[Passage to India]] on Broadway'' and in several British television specials and movies.

== Education ==
Rahbar graduated from the [[Government College, Lahore]] with an M.A in Arabic in 1947. He received the McLeod Research Scholarship and was hired on to teach [[Arabic literature]] at [[Oriental College, Lahore]], where his father was President. In 1949, Rahbar went to [[Cambridge University]] and completed his PhD dissertation entitled ''Studies in the Ethical Doctrine of the Qur'an'' under the supervision of [[Reuben Levy]]. After a short time in [[Lahore]], Rahbar accepted the position of Senior Teaching Fellow at [[McGill University]], Canada, in 1954, at the invitation of [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]]. In 1956 he was appointed to the chair of Urdu and [[Pakistan studies]] at [[Ankara University]], Turkey, where he stayed until 1959. In 1959, he began lecturing in [[Islamic studies]] as well as enrolling in [[Christian theology]] seminars at the [[Hartford Seminary Foundation]], Connecticut, USA.

In 1962, he was appointed Visiting Professor of Urdu and Pakistan studies at [[Hartford Seminary Foundation]] and was awarded tenure from 1962 to 1966. In 1964, he took a two-year leave to teach at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], where he began a systematic study of Indian and Western classical music, concentrating on achieving mastery of Indian classical vocal genres. In that same period, he began writing English poetry with the encouragement of [[David McCord]] and [[Louis Untermeyer]].

In 1967, Rahbar joined the faculty of [[Boston University]] where he taught until his retirement in 1991: initially at the School of Theology and from 1975 onwards at the Department of Religion in the College of Liberal Arts, where he was one of the department's most popular teachers, his courses on eastern religions enrolling hundreds of students each semester.

== Lahore International Islamic Colloquium ==
On 2 January 1958, he presented a paper to the International Islamic Colloquium in Lahore,&lt;ref name="colloquium_lhr"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1958.tb02570.x/abstract | title=The International Islamic Colloquium | author=Dodge, Bayard | journal=The Muslim World | year=1958 | doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1958.tb02570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second of its kind that brought scholars of Islamic subjects together from across the world. Rahbar's paper, entitled ''The Challenge of Muslim Ideas and Social Values to Muslim Society'' produced criticism from conference attendees, to the point that he was not allowed to return to the platform to explain his points. Rahbar maintains that it was "an innocent and mild statement" that he did not perceive to be "radically unorthodox."{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=303}} The opposing members of the conference asked the paper to be withdrawn later that day, but eventually agreed that an amended edition should be written. In the October 1958 issue of ''The Muslim World'',&lt;ref name="colloquium_lhr" /&gt; the paper was published with an introductory note outlining the objections of the council and the amendments made thereafter. In his introductory note, Rahbar explained that much of the controversy was due to the inherent brevity of the statements. Therefore, he hoped that the expanded treatment would clarify those objections raised at the colloquium.

== Contributor to inter-civilizational and interfaith dialogue ==
Rahbar was raised as Muslim but converted to Christianity as a professor at [[Ankara University]]. He records in his memoir that he was baptised as a Christian by a Protestant United States Air Force Chaplain, Meredith Smith, in Ankara, on 6 July 1959.{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=385}} Rahbar noted that his conversion was not a result of the 1958 Colloquium, but was more closely related to the memories of [[Partition of India]] and the then environment in Turkey. He stated that the "categorical mercy" of the [[New Testament]] and the "Christian world seemed to...offer a spiritual home"{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=343}} from his growing pessimism. A couple of months later, Rahbar wrote ''A letter to Christian and Muslim Friends'' as a confession of faith.

This confession, however, was not fully accepted by some Muslim intellectuals. [[Khaled Ahmed (journalist)|Khaled Ahmed]], a Pakistani political and cultural analyst, stated that Rahbar's supposed conversion to Christianity was nothing more than a "myth created in Lahore"&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Khaled. "Tracking Down Daud Rahbar," in ''The Friday Times'' vol 12, no. 18, 30 June – 6 July 2000. Khaled Ahmed has republished this article in his book ''Pakistan: Behind the Ideological Mask (Facts about Great Men we don't want to know)'', p. 176-186. Lahore: Vanguard, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; by those who did not fully understand "what he really stood for."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ahmed, Khaled. 30 June – 6 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained  that Rahbar's "entire career has been a defence of Islam"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and that "anyone who has read his ''Kalchar Kay Ruhani Anasir'' (Spiritual Elements of Culture)"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; will no longer need to question his faith, but rather realise that "he is tolerant of all faiths because he known the essence of them all."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; His continued respect and appreciation for the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and [[Islam]] is demonstrated in his published writings.&lt;ref&gt;Rahbar, Daud. "Muhammad and All Men." In {{cite book|author=John Robert Nelson|title=No man is alien: Essays on the Unity of Mankind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdEUAAAAIAAJ|pp=64–84|year=1971|publisher=Brill Archive|id=GGKEY:P577BDY9T76 |location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the published version of his dissertation, ''God of Justice: A Study in the Ethical Doctrine of the Qur'an'' published by E. J. Brill in 1960, Rahbar advanced the position that God's mercy is always subordinate to justice, so mercy is only available to believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God, Muhammad and the unbelievers: a Qur'anic study |last=Marshall |first=David |pages=79–85 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-7007-1086-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions to poetry and classical music theory &amp; composition ==
Throughout his academic career, Rahbar continued to make significant contributions to [[Urdu literature]] and music. He performed in concerts and poetry readings both in the United States and Pakistan. His love was for classical South Asian music, particularly the Agra School. His flair for poetic expression is infused throughout his autobiography, ''Memories and Meanings.'' "Music has been my solace for the last forty years," he wrote. "Without it I perhaps could not have been a friend to myself and to others. Music and poetry have made life easier for me everywhere and at every stage of my adult life.".{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=454}} His published works in the field of [[Urdu literature]] include:

* ''Salaam o Payaam.'' Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 1996 – Letters to his friends and associates. Subsequent volumes were published in 2004 and 2009.

== Death ==
Daud Rahbar died at a nursing home in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]] on 5 October 2013.&lt;ref name="ppf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pakistanpressfoundation.org/obituaries/73245/scholar-writer-daud-rahbar-passes-away-in-us/ | title=Scholar, writer Daud Rahbar passes away in US | publisher=Pakistan Press Foundation | accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deflagration to detonation transition''' (DDT) refers to a phenomenon in [[Combustion|ignitable]] mixtures of a [[flammable]] gas and [[air]] (or [[oxygen]]) when a sudden transition takes place from a [[deflagration]] type of [[combustion]] to a [[detonation]] type of explosion.

==Description==
A [[deflagration]] is characterized by a [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] flame [[propagation velocity]], typically far below {{convert|100|m/s|mph}}, and relatively modest [[overpressure]]s, say below {{convert|0.5|bar|psi}}. The main mechanism of combustion propagation is of a flame front that moves forward through the gas mixture - in technical terms the reaction zone (chemical combustion) progresses through the medium by processes of [[diffusion]] of [[mass transfer|heat and mass]]. In its most benign form, a deflagration may simply be a [[flash fire]].

In contrast, a [[detonation]] is characterized by [[supersonic]] flame propagation velocities, perhaps up to {{convert|2000|m/s|mph}}, and substantial overpressures, up to {{convert|20|bar|psi}}. The main mechanism of detonation propagation is of a powerful [[pressure]] wave that compresses the unburnt gas ahead of the wave to a [[temperature]] above the [[autoignition]] temperature. In technical terms, the reaction zone (chemical combustion) is a self-driven [[shock wave]] where the reaction zone and the shock are coincident, and the chemical reaction is initiated by the [[Compression heating ignition|compressive heating]] caused by the shock wave. The process is similar to ignition in a [[Diesel engine]], but much more sudden and violent.

Under certain conditions, mainly in terms of geometrical conditions (such as partial confinement and many obstacles in the flame path that cause turbulent flame [[eddy current]]s), a subsonic flame may accelerate to supersonic speed, transitioning from deflagration to detonation. The exact mechanism is not fully understood,&lt;ref name=GexCon&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 6: Detonation |url= http://www.gexcon.com/index.php?src=handbook/GEXHBchap6.htm |website=Gexcon AS |archivedate=October 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004174240/http://www.gexcon.com/handbook/GEXHBchap6.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and while existing theories are able to explain and model both deflagrations and detonations, there is no theory at present which can predict the transition phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Examples==
A deflagration to detonation transition has been a feature of several major [[industrial accident]]s:
* [[1970 Propane vapour cloud explosion in Port Hudson]]
* [[Flixborough disaster]]
* [[Phillips disaster of 1989]] in Pasadena, Texas
* Damage observed in the [[Buncefield fire]]

==Applications==
The phenomenon is exploited in [[pulse detonation engine]]s, because a detonation produces a more efficient combustion of the reactants than a deflagration does, i.e. giving a higher yields. Such engines typically employ a [[Shchelkin spiral]] in the [[combustion chamber]] to facilitate the deflagration to detonation transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = TH | last = New | authorlink = |author2=PK Panicker |author3=FK Lu |author4=H M Tsai | year = 2006| title = Experimental Investigations on DDT Enhancements by Schelkin Spirals in a PDE | conference = 44th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit 9–12 January 2006, Reno, Nevada | url = http://arc.uta.edu/publications/cp_files/aiaa-2006-7958.pdf | format = | accessdate = | doi = | id = | oclc =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = E | last = Schultz | authorlink = |author2=E Wintenberger |author3=J Shepherd  | year = 1999 | title = Investigation of Deflagration to Detonation Transition for Application to Pulse Detonation Engine Ignition Systems | conference = Proceedings of the 16th JANNAF Propulsion Symposium | url = http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/EDL/publications/reprints/jannaf99_paper.pdf | format = | accessdate = | doi = | id = | oclc =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism has also found military use in [[thermobaric weapon]]s.

==Related phenomena==
An analogous deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) has also been proposed for thermonuclear reactions responsible for [[supernovae]] initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Vadim N. | last = Gamezo | authorlink = |author2=Oran ES | year = 2008 | title = Mechanisms for Detonation Initiation in Type Ia Supernovae | conference = American Astronomical Society, AAS Meeting #211, #162.08 | bibcode = 2008AAS...21116208G | format = | accessdate = | doi = | id = | oclc =}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process has been called a "[[carbon detonation]]".

'''Developmentally appropriate practice''' (or DAP) is a perspective within [[early childhood education]] whereby a [[teacher]] or child caregiver nurtures a child's social/emotional, physical, and cognitive development by basing all practices and decisions on (1) theories of [[child development]], (2) individually identified strengths and needs of each child uncovered through [[authentic assessment]], and (3) the child's cultural background as defined by his [[community]], [[family history]], and [[types of family|family structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bredekamp, V.S.|author2=Copple, C.|last-author-amp=yes  |date=1997 |title=Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Early Childhood Programs |publisher=Washington, DC: NAEYC |url=http://sales.naeyc.org/Itemdetail.aspx?Stock_No=2349&amp;Category= |accessdate=2007-01-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228050845/http://sales.naeyc.org/Itemdetail.aspx?Stock_No=2349&amp;Category= |archivedate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

'''Developmentally Appropriate Practice''' (DAP) is the practice of an excellent educator who knows and changes his/her teaching practices to meet the students where they are developmentally. In order to adjust teaching practices to meet these students' needs, the teacher must research and be educated on child development and a variety of approaches in order to teach the children. Every approach or teaching strategy should be appropriate for the students in the classroom. Teachers can use multiple strategies in one lesson to ensure all children are learning. To ensure each students' needs are being met the educator must know each student and know where he/she is developmentally and what works for him/her. Meeting the students' needs and adjusting the way a skill or concept is being taught does not mean the educator makes the task easier for the student. Instead, the educator challenges the student by setting a goal that is attainable without frustrating the student. Along with adjusting to meet the students where they are developmentally the educator must take into consideration the students' cultural and social contexts. These practices and this knowledge base are a foundation or a starting point for educators as they make decisions in their classrooms.[1]

==Position Statement==

'''The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)''' wrote a position statement to outline best practices for teachers and educators of all kinds. The position statement was adopted in 2009 and is written solely based on research about child development, child learning, and effective educational practices. Educators have the responsibility to narrow the achievement gap for students who come from all kinds of backgrounds and give them learning opportunities they may not have the ability to experience outside of the school. Giving the child experiences that are both led by them and led by the teacher are important for the child's development and learning. Child-led experiences can come from play, which is an extremely important way to learn and spend time as a child. Children may not have the opportunity at home to have well developed or engaging play where they will learn social skills, cognitive skills, or emotional skills. These are very important skills for children to develop. Teacher-led experiences should be well developed, well thought out, consist of a variety of approaches and be completely focused on the children. This position statement gives educators and teachers guidance and principles to keep in mind in decision making, classroom community, enhancing planning curriculum for development, assessing child development and building relationships with families.[2]

==Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Preschool Years (3-5)==

Children ages 3-5 are referred to as preschoolers. The preschool years are a vitally important period of learning and development in all areas of human functioning- physical, social and emotional, cognitive (including perception, reasoning, memory, and other aspects of academic and intellectual development), and language. It is also established that best development and learning during these years is most likely to occur when children establish positive and caring relationships with adults and other children; receive carefully planned, intentional adult guidance and assistance; and explore interesting environments with many things to do and learn.

Early childhood teachers, in collaboration with families, are responsible for ensuring that that program promotes the development and enhances the learning of each individual child served; in other words, professionals must ensure that the program is developmentally appropriate. Ensuring this requires that teachers have a great deal of knowledge, skill, and training. Children entering preschool vary significantly in what they know and can do.

Considerable growth and change occur in children during the preschool years in all areas of development. To function most effectively, preschool teachers need to know about the goals, sequences, and trajectories of development in all of those areas- to avoid a scaled-down version of curriculum intended for older children and to understand the importance of communicating with kindergarten and other teachers and aligning the curriculum accordingly.

Three-year-olds are no longer toddlers, but they behave like toddlers at times, and they are not steady in their gains. Children's social skills are still uncertain, they are still working on how to regulate and appropriately express their emotions, and they are not yet able to communicate their ideas and feelings in skilled, complex ways. They believe in fairies and monsters and have trouble with logical sequences that seem basic to adults- which is why adults tend to underestimate their abilities. Yet at other times, their language ability, motor skills, reasoning abilities, and other behaviors make them seem older than they are.

The challenge for the preschool teacher is to maintain appropriate expectations, providing each child with the right amount of challenge, support, sensitivity, and stimulation that promotes development and learning- all of which can only happen within the context of a close, nurturing teacher-child relationship.

Preschoolers revel in their increasing coordination, using their bodies cheerfully and enthusiastically. They thrive in environments that encourage them to experiment with new materials, roles, and ideas through various projects and especially through play. They have great interest in feelings and are better able to express and label their emotions and identify others' emotions. They make some important gains in cognition, allowing them the pleasure of representing their world in pretend play, symbols, objects, drawings, and words. And, given a rich language environment, they show impressive gains in language skills.

Preschoolers are an enchanting, enthusiastic, curious, and inherently playful and imaginative bunch, providing the adults who work with them entry to a world of great charm and delight!

==Developmentally Appropriate Practice in the Kindergarten Year (5-6 y/o)==

In the Kindergarten Year, children are 5-6 years old, learning through play, community, and social interaction with peers. As a kindergarten teacher it is developmentally appropriate to be modeling positive social interactions in the classroom, fostering positive relationships between students of different cultures and ethnicities, give children leadership roles in the classroom, and teach in whole and small group settings, with peer interaction during instruction. It is important in this year that children spend the majority of the day moving, with little time sitting down and still. They should be working and developing their fine and gross motor skills through this daily movement. Children should also be spending time playing outside everyday, with a regular physical education schedule.

In kindergarten children should be learning body and spatial awareness, as well as key movements like balancing, jumping and catching objects of varied size. Children should have time daily to exercise their fine motor skills, such as through writing with utensils of varied size, using scissors, play dough, puzzles, etc. Along with physical development, kindergarten is a time when students should be developing self-help skills, which should be promoted by teachers through giving students daily activities that teach them to care for themselves. These activities would look like washing their hands, putting on jackets and cleaning up after their own classroom activity.

Teachers should be giving regular time in the classroom for students to be conversing with others, and working in small groups on projects that teach communication, listening and understanding skills. Teachers should provide opportunities for students to verbally respond to questions, describe scenarios, retell stories, and give directions. It is important that English Second Language students are integrated and involved in these discussions and peer work time, in order to develop their listening, speaking and understanding skills.

Academically students should be introducing phonological and phonemic awareness by implementing songs, poems, books, etc. Students should have books read to them on a daily basis. Books should be available in a classroom library at all times and contain a variety of story types. It is appropriate at this age that students be taught the sounds of letters, and writing should be encouraged throughout. Math is taught through manipulatives, block play, games, etc., and at this age it is natural for students to begin to try and make sense of the world through mathematics. Science is based off students natural curiosity and experiences. Science should be a hands on activity.

Technology should be integrated into the classroom through computers, and any other available technology in the classroom, but should foster problem solving and thinking, and by teachers to document children.

==Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Primary Grades (6-8)==

During the early grades, children gain increasing mastery in every area, both in their development and their learning. The exploring, problem solving, communicating, etc. that children do during this time period enthuses and interests them, which teachers can use at this age to create a lifelong love for learning. In order for primary children to prosper, they need warm and sensitive teaching, integrated learning, authentic assessment, and a mix of child and teacher-guided activities.

During the primary grades, it is essential for children to learn how to read. It, however, is equally important that the children develop the desire to read. This sets the tone for almost everything in the classroom and, most often times, determines what type of student the child will be. Teacher's build such enthusiasm by showing interest in each individual child's needs and show genuine excitement for their learning. Teachers should provide a variety of ways for students to learn being that every individual learns in their own way. This will encourage student effort, despite the type of learner the child is.

Physically, children in the primary grades grow around 2-3 inches in height, with their face maturing a good bit as well. It is during this time that the child's face starts to elongate to accommodate permanent teeth. The child's major gross motor skills have typically developed by this time. As far as fine motor skills, some children have started to develop them by this age, while some are still refining these skills.

Socially, primary aged children need an atmosphere characterized by good conversation, laughter, and excitement over accomplishments. It is important that a teacher creates this type of atmosphere in the classroom in order to promote what is developmentally appropriate for these grade levels.

As far as emotionally, children in the primary grades are largely guided by their emotions and they are the main force guiding behavior as well as learning from infancy through adulthood. The ability to infer other's thoughts, feelings, and intentions is a key component to help kids develop and maintain relationships. It is during the primary grades that students become increasingly able to consider the feelings and emotions of others.

Cognitively, primary aged children are making great strides. A significant, yet gradual, change occurs in most children between the ages of five and seven. This being because they become able to think about things more dimensionally, which allows them to solve a wider range of problems. Due to this cognitive growth, children in the primary grades enjoy challenges that test their growing skills. That is, as long as they are able to experience success following these challenges. This is something that teachers should keep in mind in the primary grades when they are creating material.

As far as language goes, children experience a drastic growth in the primary grades following the already substantial growth that happens in the preschool years. It is during this time period that children start to develop actual writing and reading skills, as opposed to the preschool and kindergarten years where listening, speaking, and reading skills are only just emerging.

[[File:CYP2C9 1OG2.png|230px|thumb|[[Cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s are important enzymes in [[xenobiotic]] metabolism.]]
'''Drug metabolism''' is the [[metabolism|metabolic breakdown]] of [[drug]]s by living [[organism]]s, usually through specialized [[enzyme|enzymatic]] systems. More generally, '''xenobiotic metabolism''' (from the Greek [[xenos (Greek)|xenos]] "stranger"  and biotic "related to living beings") is the set of [[metabolic pathway]]s that modify the chemical structure of [[xenobiotic]]s, which are compounds foreign to an organism's normal biochemistry, such as any [[drug]] or [[poison]]. These pathways are a form of [[biotransformation]] present in all major groups of organisms, and are considered to be of ancient origin. These reactions often act to [[detoxification|detoxify]] poisonous compounds (although in some cases the intermediates in xenobiotic metabolism can themselves cause toxic effects). The study of drug metabolism is called [[pharmacokinetics]].

The metabolism of [[pharmaceutical drug]]s is an important aspect of [[pharmacology]] and [[medicine]]. For example, the rate of metabolism determines the duration and intensity of a drug's pharmacologic action. Drug metabolism also affects [[multidrug resistance]] in [[infectious disease]]s and in [[chemotherapy]] for [[cancer]], and the actions of some drugs as [[substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] or [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]] of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are a common reason for hazardous [[drug interaction]]s. These pathways are also important in [[environmental science]], with the xenobiotic metabolism of [[microorganism]]s determining whether a pollutant will be broken down during [[bioremediation]], or [[persistent organic pollutant|persist]] in the environment. The enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism, particularly the [[glutathione S-transferase]]s are also important in agriculture, since they may produce resistance to [[pesticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s.

Drug metabolism is divided into three phases. In phase I, enzymes such as [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s introduce reactive or polar groups into xenobiotics. These modified compounds are then conjugated to polar compounds in phase II reactions. These reactions are catalysed by [[transferase]] enzymes such as [[glutathione S-transferase]]s. Finally, in phase III, the conjugated xenobiotics may be further processed, before being recognised by [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux transporters]] and pumped out of cells. Drug metabolism often converts [[lipophilic]] compounds into [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] products that are more readily [[excretion|excreted]].

== Permeability barriers and detoxification ==

The exact compounds an organism is exposed to will be largely unpredictable, and may differ widely over time; these are major characteristics of xenobiotic toxic stress.&lt;ref name=Jakoby/&gt; The major challenge faced by xenobiotic detoxification systems is that they must be able to remove the almost-limitless number of xenobiotic compounds from the complex mixture of chemicals involved in normal [[metabolism]]. The solution that has evolved to address this problem is an elegant combination of physical barriers and low-specificity [[enzyme|enzymatic]] systems.

All organisms use [[cell membrane]]s as hydrophobic permeability barriers to control access to their internal environment. Polar compounds cannot diffuse across these [[cell membrane]]s, and the uptake of useful molecules is mediated through [[transport protein]]s that specifically select substrates from the extracellular mixture. This selective uptake means that most [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] molecules cannot enter cells, since they are not recognised by any specific transporters.&lt;ref name="pmid12869659"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mizuno N, Niwa T, Yotsumoto Y, Sugiyama Y | title = Impact of drug transporter studies on drug discovery and development | journal = Pharmacol. Rev. | volume = 55 | issue = 3 | pages = 425–61 |date=September 2003 | pmid = 12869659 | doi = 10.1124/pr.55.3.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the diffusion of [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] compounds across these barriers cannot be controlled, and organisms, therefore, cannot exclude [[lipid]]-soluble xenobiotics using membrane barriers.

However, the existence of a permeability barrier means that organisms were able to evolve detoxification systems that exploit the hydrophobicity common to membrane-permeable xenobiotics. These systems therefore solve the specificity problem by possessing such broad substrate specificities that they metabolise almost any non-polar compound.&lt;ref name=Jakoby/&gt; Useful metabolites are excluded since they are polar, and in general contain one or more charged groups.

The detoxification of the reactive by-products of normal metabolism cannot be achieved by the systems outlined above, because these species are derived from normal cellular constituents and usually share their polar characteristics. However, since these compounds are few in number, specific enzymes can recognize and remove them. Examples of these specific detoxification systems are the [[glyoxalase system]], which removes the reactive [[aldehyde]] methylglyoxal,&lt;ref name="pmid2198020"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thornalley PJ | title = The glyoxalase system: new developments towards functional characterization of a metabolic pathway fundamental to biological life | journal = Biochem.

== {{anchor|Phases}} Phases of detoxification ==

[[File:Xenobiotic metabolism.png|thumb|350px|right|Phases I and II of the metabolism of a lipophilic xenobiotic.]]
The metabolism of xenobiotics is often divided into three phases:- modification, conjugation, and excretion. These reactions act in concert to detoxify xenobiotics and remove them from cells.

=== Phase I – modification ===

In phase I, a variety of enzymes act to introduce reactive and polar groups into their substrates. One of the most common modifications is hydroxylation catalysed by the [[cytochrome P450|cytochrome P-450-dependent mixed-function oxidase system]]. These enzyme complexes act to incorporate an atom of oxygen into nonactivated hydrocarbons, which can result in either the introduction of hydroxyl groups or N-, O- and S-dealkylation of substrates.&lt;ref name="pmid11409933"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guengerich FP | title = Common and uncommon cytochrome P450 reactions related to metabolism and chemical toxicity | journal = Chem. Res. Toxicol. | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 611–50 |date=June 2001 | pmid = 11409933 | doi = 10.1021/tx0002583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction mechanism of the P-450 oxidases proceeds through the reduction of cytochrome-bound oxygen and the generation of a highly-reactive oxyferryl species, according to the following scheme:&lt;ref name="pmid10698731"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schlichting I, Berendzen J, Chu K, Stock AM, Maves SA, Benson DE, Sweet RM, Ringe D, Petsko GA, Sligar SG | title = The catalytic pathway of cytochrome p450cam at atomic resolution | journal = Science | volume = 287 | issue = 5458 | pages = 1615–22 |date=March 2000 | pmid = 10698731 | doi = 10.1126/science.287.5458.1615 | bibcode = 2000Sci...287.1615S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NADPH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + RH → NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ROH

Phase I reactions (also termed nonsynthetic reactions) may occur by [[oxidation]], [[Redox|reduction]], [[hydrolysis]], [[cyclization]], [[decyclization]], and addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen, carried out by mixed function oxidases, often in the liver. These oxidative reactions typically involve a [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] monooxygenase (often abbreviated CYP), NADPH and oxygen. The classes of pharmaceutical drugs that utilize this method for their metabolism include [[phenothiazine]]s, [[Paracetamol#Metabolism|paracetamol]], and steroids. If the metabolites of phase I reactions are sufficiently polar, they may be readily excreted at this point. However, many phase I products are not eliminated rapidly and undergo a subsequent reaction in which an [[endogenous]] [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly [[polar conjugate]].

A common Phase I oxidation involves conversion of a C-H bond to a C-OH. This reaction sometimes converts a pharmacologically inactive compound (a [[prodrug]]) to a pharmacologically active one. By the same token, Phase I can turn a nontoxic molecule into a poisonous one ([[toxification]]). Simple hydrolysis in the stomach is normally an innocuous reaction, however there are exceptions. For example, phase I metabolism converts [[acetonitrile]] to HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN, which rapidly dissociates into [[formaldehyde]] and [[hydrogen cyanide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc154.htm|title=Acetonitrile (EHC 154, 1993)|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase I metabolism of drug candidates can be simulated in the laboratory using non-enzyme catalysts.&lt;ref name="pmid19039354"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akagah B, Lormier AT, Fournet A, Figadère B | title = Oxidation of antiparasitic 2-substituted quinolines using metalloporphyrin catalysts: scale-up of a biomimetic reaction for metabolite production of drug candidates | journal = Org. Biomol. Chem. | volume = 6 | issue = 24 | pages = 4494–7 |date=December 2008 | pmid = 19039354 | doi = 10.1039/b815963g }}&lt;/ref&gt; This example of a [[biomimetic]] reaction tends to give products that often contains the Phase I metabolites. As an example, the major metabolite of the pharmaceutical [[trimebutine]], desmethyltrimebutine (nor-trimebutine), can be efficiently produced by in vitro oxidation of the commercially available drug.  Hydroxylation of an N-methyl group leads to expulsion of a molecule of [[formaldehyde]], while oxidation of the O-methyl groups takes place to a lesser extent.

==== Oxidation ====

* [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system]]
* [[Flavin-containing monooxygenase system]]
* [[Alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]]
* [[Monoamine oxidase]]
* Co-oxidation by [[peroxidase]]s

==== Reduction ====

* [[Cytochrome P450 reductase|NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase]]
Cytochrome P450 reductase, also known as NADPH:ferrihemoprotein oxidoreductase, NADPH:hemoprotein oxidoreductase, NADPH:P450 oxidoreductase, P450 reductase, POR, CPR, CYPOR, is a membrane-bound enzyme required for electron transfer to cytochrome P450 in the microsome of the eukaryotic cell from a FAD- and FMN-containing enzyme NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase
The general scheme of electron flow in the POR/P450 system is:
NADPH	
→
FAD
→
FMN
→
P450
→
O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Cytochrome P450 reductase|Reduced (ferrous) cytochrome P450]]

During reduction reactions, a chemical can enter ''futile cycling'', in which it gains a free-radical electron, then promptly loses it to [[oxygen]] (to form a [[superoxide anion]]).

==== Hydrolysis ====

* [[Esterase]]s and [[amidase]]
* [[Epoxide hydrolase]]

=== Phase II – conjugation {{anchor|Conjugation}} ===

In subsequent phase II reactions, these activated xenobiotic metabolites are [[Biotransformation#Phase .D0.86 reaction|conjugated]] with charged species such as [[glutathione]] (GSH), [[sulfate]], [[glycine]], or [[glucuronic acid]]. Sites on drugs where conjugation reactions occur include [[carboxyl]] (-COOH), [[hydroxyl]] (-OH), [[amino]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[sulfhydryl]] (-SH) groups. Products of conjugation reactions have increased  molecular weight and tend to be less active than their substrates, unlike Phase I reactions which often produce [[active metabolites]]. The addition of large anionic groups (such as GSH) detoxifies reactive [[electrophile]]s and produces more polar metabolites that cannot diffuse across membranes, and may, therefore, be actively transported.

These reactions are catalysed by a large group of broad-specificity transferases, which in combination can metabolise almost any hydrophobic compound that contains nucleophilic or electrophilic groups.&lt;ref name=Jakoby&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jakoby WB, Ziegler DM | title = The enzymes of detoxication | journal = J.

=== Phase III – further modification and excretion ===

After phase II reactions, the xenobiotic conjugates may be further metabolised. A common example is the processing of glutathione conjugates to [[acetylcysteine]] (mercapturic acid) conjugates.&lt;ref name="pmid4892500"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyland E, Chasseaud LF | title = The role of glutathione and glutathione S-transferases in mercapturic acid biosynthesis | journal = Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

In the final step, the [[cystine]] residue in the conjugate is [[acetylated]].

Conjugates and their metabolites can be excreted from cells in phase III of their metabolism, with the anionic groups acting as affinity tags for a variety of membrane transporters of the [[P-glycoprotein|multidrug resistance protein]] (MRP) family.&lt;ref name="pmid12897433"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Homolya L, Váradi A, Sarkadi B | title = Multidrug resistance-associated proteins: Export pumps for conjugates with glutathione, glucuronate or sulfate | journal = BioFactors | volume = 17 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 103–14 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12897433 | doi = 10.1002/biof.5520170111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins are members of the family of [[ATP-binding cassette transporter]]s and can catalyse the ATP-dependent transport of a huge variety of hydrophobic anions,&lt;ref name="pmid10581368"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=König J, Nies AT, Cui Y, Leier I, Keppler D | title = Conjugate export pumps of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family: localization, substrate specificity, and MRP2-mediated drug resistance | journal = Biochim.

== Endogenous toxins ==

The detoxification of endogenous reactive metabolites such as [[peroxide]]s and reactive [[aldehyde]]s often cannot be achieved by the system described above. This is the result of these species' being derived from normal cellular constituents and usually sharing their polar characteristics. However, since these compounds are few in number, it is possible for enzymatic systems to utilize specific molecular recognition to recognize and remove them. The similarity of these molecules to useful metabolites therefore means that different detoxification enzymes are usually required for the metabolism of each group of endogenous toxins. Examples of these specific detoxification systems are the [[glyoxalase system]], which acts to dispose of the reactive aldehyde [[methylglyoxal]], and the various [[antioxidant]] systems that remove [[reactive oxygen species]].

== Sites ==

Quantitatively, the [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] of the [[liver]] cell is the principal organ of drug metabolism, although every [[biological tissue]] has some ability to metabolize drugs.
Factors responsible for the liver's contribution to drug metabolism include that it is a large organ, that it is the first organ perfused by chemicals absorbed in the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]], and that there are very high concentrations of most drug-metabolizing enzyme systems relative to other organs.
If a drug is taken into the GI tract, where it enters hepatic circulation through the portal vein, it becomes well-metabolized and is said to show the ''[[first pass effect]]''.

Other sites of drug metabolism include [[epithelial cell]]s of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], [[lung]]s, [[kidney]]s, and the [[skin]].
These sites are usually responsible for localized toxicity reactions.

== Factors that affect drug metabolism ==

The duration and intensity of pharmacological action of most lipophilic drugs are determined by the rate they are metabolized to inactive products.
The [[Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system]] is the most important pathway in this regard.
In general, anything that ''increases'' the rate of metabolism (''e.g.'', [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|enzyme induction]]) of a pharmacologically active metabolite will ''decrease'' the duration and intensity of the drug action.
The opposite is also true (''e.g.'', [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|enzyme inhibition]]). However, in cases where an enzyme is responsible for metabolizing a pro-drug into a drug, enzyme induction can speed up this conversion and increase drug levels, potentially causing toxicity.

Various ''physiological'' and ''pathological'' factors can also affect drug metabolism.
Physiological factors that can influence drug metabolism include age, individual variation (''e.g.'', [[pharmacogenetics]]), [[enterohepatic circulation]], [[nutrition]], [[intestinal flora]], or [[sex difference]]s.

In general, drugs are metabolized more slowly in [[fetal]], [[neonatal]] and [[elderly]] [[human]]s and [[animal]]s than in [[adult]]s.

Genetic variation ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]) accounts for some of the variability in the effect of drugs.
With N-acetyltransferases (involved in ''Phase II'' reactions), individual variation creates a group of people who acetylate slowly (''slow acetylators'') and those who acetylate quickly, split roughly 50:50 in the population of [[Canada]].
This variation may have dramatic consequences, as the [[slow acetylators]] are more prone to dose-dependent toxicity.

[[Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system]] enzymes can also vary across individuals, with deficiencies occurring in 1 – 30% of people, depending on their ethnic background.

Dose, frequency, route of administration, tissue distribution and protein binding of the drug affect its metabolism.

''Pathological factors'' can also influence drug metabolism, including [[liver]], [[kidney]], or [[heart]] diseases.

''In silico'' modelling and simulation methods allow drug metabolism to be predicted in virtual patient populations prior to performing clinical studies in human subjects.&lt;ref name="pmid17268485"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rostami-Hodjegan A, Tucker GT | title = Simulation and prediction of in vivo drug metabolism in human populations from ''in vitro'' data | journal = Nat Rev Drug Discov | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 140–8 |date=February 2007 | pmid = 17268485 | doi = 10.1038/nrd2173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be used to identify individuals most at risk from adverse reaction.

== History ==

Studies on how people transform the substances that they ingest began in the mid-nineteenth century, with chemists discovering that organic chemicals such as [[benzaldehyde]] could be oxidized and conjugated to amino acids in the human body.&lt;ref name="pmid11353742"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Murphy PJ | title = Xenobiotic metabolism: a look from the past to the future | journal = Drug Metab.

In the early twentieth century, work moved on to the investigation of the enzymes and pathways that were responsible for the production of these metabolites. This field became defined as a separate area of study with the publication by [[Richard Tecwyn Williams|Richard Williams]] of the book ''Detoxication mechanisms'' in 1947.&lt;ref name="pmid6347595"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Neuberger A, Smith RL | title = Richard Tecwyn Williams: the man, his work, his impact | journal = Drug Metab.

'''Ecodesign''' is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle.  In a [[life cycle assessment]], the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.

Ecodesign is a growing responsibility and understanding of our [[ecological footprint]] on the planet. Green awareness, [[overpopulation]], [[industrialization]] and an increased environmental population have led to the questioning of consumer values. It is imperative to search for new building solutions that are [[environmentally friendly]] and lead to a reduction in the consumption of materials and [[energy consumption|energy]].

==Overview==
[[File:Stainless Steel Talbe with FSC Eucalyptus wood Ecodesign.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Stainless steel]] table with [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] Teca wood - [[Brazil]] ecodesign]]
As the whole product's life cycle should be regarded in an integrated perspective, representatives from advance development, design, production, marketing, purchasing, and project management should work together on the Ecodesign of a further developed or new product.  Together, they have the best chance to predict the holistic effects of changes of the product and their environmental impact.

An eco-design product has a [[cradle-to-cradle]] life cycle ensuring zero waste is created in the whole process. By mimicking life cycles in nature, eco-design is a fundamental concept in achieving a truly [[circular economy]].

Environmental aspects which ought to be analysed for every stage of the life cycle are:

* Consumption of resources (energy, materials, water or land area)
* Emissions to air, water, and the ground (our Earth) as being relevant for the environment and human health
* Miscellaneous (e.g. noise and vibration)

Waste (hazardous waste and other waste defined in environmental legislation) is only an intermediate step and the final emissions to the environment (e.g. methane and leaching from landfills) are inventoried. All consumables, materials and parts used in the life cycle phases are accounted for, and all indirect environmental aspects linked to their production.

The environmental aspects of the phases of the life cycle are evaluated according to their environmental impact on the basis of a number of parameters, such as extent of environmental impact, potential for improvement, or potential of change.

According to this ranking the recommended changes are carried out and reviewed after a certain time.

==Environmental effect analysis==
[[File:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Interior design|decoration]] [[fair]]. The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among [[designers]] in [[Brazil]].]]

One instrument to identify the factors that are important for the reduction of the environmental impact during all lifecycle stages is the environmental effect analysis (EEA).

For an EEA the following are taken into account:

* Customers' wishes
* Legal requirements, market requirements (competitors)
* Data concerning the product and the manufacturing process

==Applications in design==
Ecodesign concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design; the impact of [[global warming]] and an increase in CO₂ emissions have led companies to consider a more environmentally conscious approach to their design thinking and process.
In building design and construction, designers are taking on the concept of Ecodesign throughout the design process, from the choice of materials to the type of energy that is being consumed and the disposal of waste.

With respect to these concepts, [[online]] platforms dealing in only Ecodesign products are emerging, with the additional sustainable purpose of eliminating all unnecessary distribution steps between the designer and the final customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nupe.co.uk/an-interview-with-sustainable-design-company-moorbi/ Kamran Assadi for Nupè April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoMaterials''', such as the use of local raw materials, are less costly and reduce the environmental costs of shipping, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions generated from transportation. Certified green building materials, such as wood from sustainably managed forest plantations, with accreditations from companies such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), or the Pan-European Forest Certification Council (PEFCC), can be used.

Several other types of components and materials can be used in sustainable buildings. Recyclable and recycled materials are commonly used in construction, but it is important that they don’t generate any waste during manufacture or after their life cycle ends. Reclaimed materials such as timber at a construction site or junkyard can be given a second life by reusing them as support beams in a new building or as furniture. Stones from an excavation can be used in a retaining wall. The reuse of these items means that less energy is consumed in making new products and a new natural aesthetic quality is achieved.

'''[[Water recycling]]''' systems such as rainwater tanks that harvest water for multiple purposes. Reusing [[grey water]] generated by households are a useful way of not wasting drinking water.

'''Off-grid homes''' only use clean electric power. They are completely separated and disconnected from the conventional electricity grid and receive their power supply by harnessing active or passive energy systems.

==Active system==
These systems use the principle of harnessing the power generated from renewable and inexhaustible sources of energy, for example; solar, wind, thermal, biomass, and geothermal energy.

'''[[Solar power]]''' is a widely known and used renewable energy source. An increase in technology has allowed solar power to be used in a wide variety of applications. Two types of solar panels generate heat into electricity. Thermal solar panels reduce or eliminate the consumption of gas and diesel, and reduce CO₂ emissions. Photovoltaic panels convert solar radiation into an electric current which can power any appliance. However, this is a more complex technology and is generally more expensive to manufacture than thermal panels.

'''[[Biomass]]''' is the energy source created from organic materials generated through a forced or spontaneous biological process.

'''[[Geothermal energy]]''' is obtained by harnessing heat from the ground. This type of energy can be used to heat and cool homes. It eliminates dependence on external energy and generates minimum waste. It is also hidden from view as it is placed underground, making it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to incorporate in a design.

'''Wind turbines''' are a useful application for areas without immediate conventional power sources, e.g., rural areas with schools and hospitals that need more power. Wind turbines can provide up to 30% of the energy consumed by a household but they are subject to regulations and technical specifications, such as the maximum distance at which the facility is located from the place of consumption and the power required and permitted for each property.

==Passive systems==
Buildings that integrate passive energy systems ([[bioclimatic buildings]]) are heated using non-mechanical methods, thereby optimizing natural resources. The use of optimal daylight plays an integral role in passive energy systems. This involves the positioning and location of a building to allow and make use of sunlight throughout the whole year. By using the sun's rays, thermal mass is stored into the building materials such as concrete and can generate enough heat for a room.

A '''[[green roof]]''' is a roof partially or completely covered with plants or other vegetation. This creates insulation that helps regulate the building's temperature. It also retains water, providing a water recycling system. It also provides soundproofing.

==In art and decorating==
Recycling has been used in art since the early part of the 20th century, when cubist artist [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973) and [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963) created collages from newsprints, packaging and other found materials. The "Outside Art" movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form, and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them.  The same principle can be used inside the home, where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon.

There is a huge demand in Western countries to decorate homes in a "green" style. A lot of effort is placed into recycled product design and the creation of a natural look. This ideal is also a part of developing countries, although their use of recycled and natural products is often based in necessity and wanting to get maximum use out of materials.

This article gives an overview of '''[[Esotericism|esoteric movements]] in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]''' between 1880 and 1945, presenting [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]] and [[Ariosophy]], among others, against the influences of earlier European esotericism.

==Influences from before 1880==

===Knights Templar and occultism===
The original [[Knights Templar]], founded around 1119, had been a crusading military order, that, at some time, had established financial networks across the whole of Christendom. In 1307, King [[Philip IV of France]] mounted a "slanderous campaign"&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 60&lt;/ref&gt; to strip the Order of its economic and political influence. The Templars were accused of Satanic practices, perversions and blasphemy and ruthlessly suppressed; Its leaders were burned on March 18, 1314. The circumstances of their suppression gave rise to [[Knights Templar legends|legends surrounding the Knights Templar]]. In Germany, "where the growth of deviant Masonic rites was greatest,"&lt;ref name=G-C61&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 61&lt;/ref&gt; the Templar heritage was adopted for irregular Freemasonry. ([[Freemasonry]] had been officially founded in England in 1717.)

The idea of chivalric Freemasonry first occurred ca. 1737 in France.&lt;ref name=G-C61&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1775 Baron Gotthelf von Hund (1722–76) founded the [[Rite of Strict Observance|Order of Strict Observance]], claiming the possession of secret Templar documents which allegedly prove that his order represented the legal Templar succession.&lt;ref name=G-C61&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosicrucianism===
In the 17th century and 18th century, [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian ideas]] flourished in varying degrees. Rosicrucianism goes back to the beginning of the 17th century, when three works by [[Johannes Valentinus Andreae|Johann Valentin Andreae]] were printed at [[Kassel]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 58, 59&lt;/ref&gt; One of these works, the ''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz|Chymische Hochzeit]]'', appears to be an [[Alchemy|alchemical]] tract, while the other two (for which the authorship of Valentin Andreae is not finally proven) announce the existence of the ''Rosicrucian Order'', which desires an "universal and general reformation of the whole world". Putatively this order was founded by Christian Rosenkreutz, who is supposed to have lived from 1378 to 1484.

In either 1747 or 1757 a quasi-masonic Rosicrucian order of the name ''Gold- und Rosenkreuz'' was founded in Berlin, having a 9-grade hierarchy based on the [[Kabbalah|cabalistic]] [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]; This organisation included King [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] and [[Johann Christoph von Wöllner]]&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Johann Christoph von Wöllner|Johann Christoph von Wöllner]]&lt;/ref&gt; as members.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 59"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==German occult revival, 1880–1910==

{{quote|The modern German occult revival owes its inception to the popularity of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] in the Anglo-Saxon world during the 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Theosophy===
The first German Theosophical Society was established in July 1884, under the presidency of [[Wilhelm Hübbe-Schleiden]],&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Wilhelm von Hübbe-Schleiden]]&lt;/ref&gt; a conservative German nationalist turned spiritual seeker who sought to establish Theosophy on a "scientific" basis.&lt;ref name=Treitel&gt;Corinna Treitel, ''A Science for the Soul'', {{ISBN|0-8018-7812-8}}, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1886 and 1895 Hübbe-Schleiden published the monthly periodical ''Die Sphinx''.&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Sphinx (Zeitschrift)|Sphinx magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austheos.org.au/indices/SPHINXHU.HTM  Table of contents to the Sphinx magazine&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vienna]], a theosophical society was founded in 1887, its president was [[Friedrich Eckstein]].&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Friedrich Eckstein]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his circle at this time [[Franz Hartmann]], a leader of theosophical work who emphasized personal spiritual experience,&lt;ref name= Treitel/&gt; and the young [[Rudolf Steiner]] were members.&lt;ref name = "Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28"/&gt;  A ''German Theosophical Society'', as a branch of the ''International Theosophical Brotherhood'', then was established in 1896 when the American theosophists around [[William Quan Judge]], [[Katherine Tingley]], ''E. T. Hargrove'' and ''C. F. Wright'' travelled through Europe.&lt;ref name = "GC25-6"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 25, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Its president was Franz Hartmann, who also founded a theosophical lay-monastery at [[Ascona]] in 1889.&lt;ref name = "GC24-5"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 24, 25&lt;/ref&gt;  His periodical [[Lotusblüten (magazine)|Lotusblüten]] (''Lotus Blossoms'', 1892–1900) was the first German publication to use the theosophical [[swastika]] on its cover.&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt;

Hartmann's example provided the impetus for [[Paul Zillmann]] to found the ''Metaphysische Rundschau'' (''Metaphysical Review'') in 1896.&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt;

[[Image:Lucifer-gnosis-1904.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Cover of the June 1904 edition of Lucifer-Gnosis]]

[[Rudolf Steiner]] was made general secretary of the ''German Theosophical Society'' in 1902.&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt;  Steiner, who was seeking to develop an [[esoteric]] path suitable for the modern era, and professed commitment to [[scientific method]]ology, was yet oriented towards awakening spiritual experiences in each individual rather than depending upon authorities or [[guru]]s.&lt;ref name=Treitel/&gt; He published ''Luzifer'' at Berlin from 1903 to 1908.

In Vienna, there also existed an ''Association for Occultism'', connected to a person called ''Philipp Maschlufsky''.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28"/&gt; From 1903 he published a periodical called ''Die Gnosis'', that was later absorbed by ''Rudolf Steiner's'' periodical ''Luzifer'', and renamed ''Lucifer-Gnosis''.&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Lucifer-Gnosis]]&lt;/ref&gt;

"It may have been a desire to counter Steiner's influence in the occult subculture which led Hartmann to encourage the publication of several new periodicals."&lt;ref name= "Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27&lt;/ref&gt;  A Theosophical Publishing House was established by ''Hugo Vollrath'' in [[Leipzig]] in 1906. Among the magazines published there was ''Prana'' (1909–19), initially edited by ''Karl Brandler-Pracht'' and later edited by [[Johannes Balzli]]. Before that, a publisher with the name Wilhelm Friedrich had already published the works of Hartmann and Hübbe-Schleiden, as well as translations of the English theosophists at Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27, 51, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm Friedrich had also published the occult works of Max Ferdinand Sebaldt von Werth (1859–1916). Initially, this author had collaborated with Moritz von Egidy&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Moritz von Egidy|Moritz von Egidy]]&lt;/ref&gt; on the periodical ''Das angewande Christentum'' (''Applied Christianity''), but later he wrote volumes on "the sexual-religion of the Aryans", thus, in the opinion of Goodrick-Clarke, anticipating Ariososophy.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthroposophy===
From 1907 (at latest), tensions between [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society]] grew steadily.  In 1912, Rudolf Steiner broke away to found [[anthroposophy]].  There were two causes of the break; Steiner's [[Europe]]an and [[Christian]] orientation had long been distinct from the [[Hinduism|hinduistic]] interest of the theosophists under the leadership of [[Annie Besant]].&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt; More immediately, Steiner publicly distanced himself from Besant's promotion of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as a supposed new [[messiah]]. Steiner and a group of prominent German theosophists officially founded the [[Anthroposophical Society]] in December 1913, the vast majority of the German membership of the Theosophical Society following them into the new group; the breakaways were excluded from the Theosophical Society in January 1914.

===Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels===
{{Further|Ariosophy}}
Living in Vienna, [[Guido von List|Guido (von) List]] (1848–1919) had been active as journalist and writer. After he turned to esotericism, he became the first popular author to combine [[völkisch]] ideology and occultism into the type of esoteric doctrine that is now collectively labelled [[Ariosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1903 the occult periodical ''Die Gnosis'' (see above) included an article by List, in which he, referring Sebaldt von Werth, started to articulate "a Germanic occult religion".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 41, 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decade, List continued to work on this topic, also making references to the works of [[Madame Blavatsky]] and [[William Scott-Elliot]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In his concept of Armanism, the religion of the theocratic elite in his image of the ancient Germanic past, List borrowed material from Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Since his manuscript, proposing the research into the runes by the "means of occult insight", was rejected from the Imperial Academie of Sciences in Vienna, the supporters of List formed  a List Society (''Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft'') to finance his research. The Society was founded officially on 2 March 1908. Its members included völkisch authors as well as occultists (for example Franz Hartmann and the complete membership of the Vienna Theosophical Society). Some inner members of the List Society participated in the activities of the ''Hoher Armanen-Orden'' (''High Armanen-Order'').&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This order, however, achieved no significance as a lodge-like organisation.

[[Lanz von Liebenfels|Jörg Lanz (von Liebenfels)]] (1874–1954) had been a [[Cistercians|cistercian monk]] between 1893 and 1899. In 1903 he published a long article "Anthropozoon biblicum" in the ''Vierteljahrsschrift für Bibelkunde'', a periodical for biblical research.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 93, 275&lt;/ref&gt; By 1905 his studies in this direction had cumulated into the book ''Theozoologie'', a "strange amalgam" of traditional Judaeo-Christian sources and contemporary life-sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 94&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, Lanz proposed a "frequently obscene and always radical" interpretation of the Bible, according to which it had been the purpose of the [[Old Testament]] to warn the [[Aryan race]] against interbreeding with [[Pygmies]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 94, 96&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Lanz also established his own magazine, [[Ostara (magazine)|Ostara]]. One of the few other contributors to this magazine beside Lanz himself was the theosophist Harald Grävell von Jostenoode (1856–1932), who also edited one number of [[Lotusblüten (magazine)|Lotusblüten]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrology===
Among the theosophists, [[astrology]] enjoyed a revival.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 84, 103&lt;/ref&gt; Astrological texts by Karl Brandler-Pracht, Otto Pöllner, Ernst Tiede, and Albert Knief appeared at the Theosophical Publishing House at [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 103&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karl Brandler-Pracht'' had also founded the ''First Viennese Astrological Society'' in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Jan Hanussen]], who later would become the most famous [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] in Germany and Austria, gave his first occult session with ''E.&amp;nbsp;K. Hermann'' in Vienna in 1911.&lt;ref name="TP-Hanussen"&gt;Markus Kompa (with the collaboration of Wilfried Kugel): [http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/27/27562/1.html Erik Jan Hanussen - Hokus-Pokus-Tausendsassa]; {{de icon}} [[Telepolis]], 24 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other developments===
The German and Vienna occult subculture was well developed before the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27"/&gt; Aside from the developments mentioned above, there are some more of interest:

"The [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO) originated in the irregular masonic activities of [[Theodor Reuss]], [[Franz Hartmann]], and [[Carl Kellner (mystic)|Karl Kellner]] between 1895 and 1906."&lt;ref name="G-C61"/&gt; Theodor Reuss had been in contact with [[William Wynn Westcott|William Wescott]], a founding member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 59"/&gt;

[[Ernst Wachler (author)|Ernst Wachler]] was a völkisch author (he supported the ''Guido von List Society'') who had founded an open-air Germanic theatre in the [[Harz]] mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 43&lt;/ref&gt; This theatre, called ''Green Stage'' (''Grüne Bühne''), was closed in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Bergtheater Thale|Bergtheater Thale]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germanische Glaubens-Gemeinschaft]], founded in 1907, is claimed by current [[Germanic Neopaganism]] groups as predecessor. It was founded and led by the painter [[Ludwig Fahrenkrog]]. Since 1908, the group used the [[swastika]] as its symbol. After 1938 the use of the swastika became prohibited and the group was no longer allowed to hold public meetings. However, unlike many other esoteric groups in Nazi Germany, the GGG was not forced to disband, partly "because of Fahrenkrog's international status as an artist."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Wolff, "Ludwig Fahrenkrog and the Germanic Faith Community: Wodan Triumphant" in [[Tyr (journal)|Tyr: Myth—Culture—Tradition]], Ultra 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interbellum (Weimar Republic)==

===Ariosophy, ''Ordo Novi Templi'', and Lumenclub===
Lanz had coined the term [[ariosophy]], meaning occult wisdom concerning the Aryans, in 1915. In the 1920s he then used this label for his doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1926 he published: ''Das Buch der Psalmen teutsch: das Gebetbuch der Ariosophen, Rassenmystiker, und Antisemiten''. (''The book of psalms, German: The book of prayer of the Ariosophists, Race mystics, and Antisemites'') This is the only book of Lanz von Liebenfels that was later found in [[Hitler]]'s personal library. (Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 198, 275)&lt;/ref&gt; Both List and Lanz greeted [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] as a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 86 (List), 103 (Lanz)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guido von List]] wrote his research reports on the "Aryo-Germanics" (Ario-Germanen) between 1908 and 1913, but in 1917 two later articles written by him appeared in ''Prana''. He died 1919 in Berlin. The List Society was continued after his death, but not much is known of its activities.
By contrast, an organisation founded around 1907&lt;ref&gt;Lanz von Liebenfels has claimed that the founding of the ONT occurred on [[Christmas]] Day 1900, but Goodrick-Clarke does not consider this statement reliable. Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 245.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Lanz von Liebenfels]] achieved more significance: the "new Templar lodge", called ''Ordo Novi Templi'' (ONT) (German: [[:de:Neutempler-Orden|Neutempler-Orden]]).

On 11 November 1932, influenced by Ariosophy, an industrialist with the name Johann Walthari Wölfl also founded an association called the Lumenclub in Vienna, which overlapped in membership with the ONT.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 118, 119&lt;/ref&gt; The ideological sympathy of the Lumenclub to [[Nazism]] is beyond question, as it acted as growth centre for the Nazi party that was illegal in Austria since 1934.&lt;ref name=GC119&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 119&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they were later suppressed like other esoteric groups. After the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in 1938, Lanz von Liebenfels had his writings banned.&lt;ref name="Bramwell 1985: 42"&gt;Bramwell 1985: 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lumenclub and the ONT were suppressed by the [[Gestapo]] in March 1942, following the party edict of December 1938 that applied to many sectarian groups.&lt;ref name=GC119/&gt;

''Werner von Bülow'' and ''Herbert Reichstein'' had applauded the advent of the third reich in their esoteric magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 192&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rune occultism====
Influenced by Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels (see: [[Ariosophy]]), a new "Aryan occultist movement"&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 155&lt;/ref&gt; was started after 1918 in Germany by [[Rudolf John Gorsleben]].

Since the esoteric importance of the runes (that first had been developed by [[Guido von List]], see [[Armanen runes]]) was central to his world-view,&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 157&lt;/ref&gt; Goodrick-Clarke speaks in this context of "rune occultism".

Here two authors stand out, as they engaged the runes in "a less explicitly [[Aryan race|Aryan racist]] context". [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]] and [[Siegfried Adolf Kummer]] focused more on the practical side of rune occultism. In 1936 Friedrich Bernhard Marby was arrested and sent to a [[concentration camp]] (''Flossenbürg'' and later [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]).&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 161&lt;/ref&gt; He survived and resumed his occult research after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 161; Friedrich Bernhard Marby, 1975, ''Sonne und Planeten im Tierkreis'', p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Responsible for his incarceration might have been [[Karl Maria Wiligut]], who was Himmler's counsellor on the occult. (see: [[Nazi occultism]]) Willigut was of the opinion that Marby (and also Kummer) were bringing "the holy [[Aryan]] heritage into disrepute and ridicule".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 161; Weisthor (Willigut) to Himmler, letter dated 2 May 1934, [[Bundesarchiv]], ''Koblenz'', Himmler Nachlass 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiligut also had identified [[Irminism]] as the true ancestral religion, claiming that [[Guido von List]]'s ''Wotanism'' and runic row was a schismatic false religion, but this does seem to be unconnected to the arrest of Marby.

Other measures against esoteric groups were most probably the result of the general Nazi policy of suppressing lodge organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other developments===
In the years following the military defeat, there was a burgeoning occult movement in Germany and Austria. Significant figures in this milieu were [[Gustav Meyring]], [[Franz Spunda]] and [[Peryt Shou]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Esotericism in Nazi Germany==
{{Further|Nazism and occultism||Esoteric Nazism|religious aspects of Nazism|Ariosophy}}

===German Faith Movement===
{{main|German Faith Movement}}
The [[German Faith Movement]] led by [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer]] during 1933-1945 propagated a move away from Christianity towards an "Aryan-Nordic religion", partly [[Hinduism in the West|inspired by Hinduism]].

===Suppression of Freemasonry and esotericism===
{{further|Friedrich Hielscher}}
The [[suppression of Freemasonry]] in Nazi Germany also reached the level of outright [[persecution]]. It is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were murdered under the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="holocaust"&gt;Christopher Hodapp. 2005. Freemasons for Dummies, Wiley Publishing Inc., Indianapolis, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; The lodge [[Liberté chérie]] was founded in a concentration camp. Freemasons, who were sent to concentration camps, were sent there as political prisoners, and consequently forced to wear an inverted red triangle. (see: [[Nazi concentration camp badges]])

Within the Nazi ideology it was alleged that Freemasonry was part of "the Jewish conspiracy". Since many esoteric groups emulated the lodge structure of Freemasonry, they were "caught in the National Socialist anti-Masonic law of 1935".&lt;ref name=Bramwell50&gt;Bramwell 1985: 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Even "the German Order of Druids" was closed down, "protesting to the last that they were not Freemasons but good, German Druids."&lt;ref name=Bramwell50&gt;Bramwell 1985: 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In her biography of [[Richard Walther Darré]], the historian Anna Bramwell also remarks that a secret society called the Skald Order "was banned by the Nazis after 1933 because of its allegedly masonic nature."&lt;ref&gt;Bramwell 1985: 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the Skald held office in the Third Reich, including Dr [[Ludolf Haase]] (a founder member of the Skald), [[Herbert Backe]] and [[Theo Gross]]; all came under covert investigation, though Backe is said to have been cleared of disloyalty by Heydrich from his deathbed.&lt;ref&gt;Bramwell 1985: 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the Nazi ideology had a special view concerning the various esoteric doctrines (aside from confusing them with Freemasonry) is not clear. Concerning [[Anthroposophy]], a book whose title denounced [[Rudolf Steiner]] as a fraud (''Schwindler'') and a false prophet had been published by Gregor Schwartz-Bostunitsch in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schwartz-Bostunitsch. 1930. ''"Doktor Steiner - ein Schwindler wie keiner"''. Ein Kapital über Anthroposophie und die geistige Arbeit der 'Falschen Propheten'. Munich. See: Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 284 (Bibliography).&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz-Bostunitsch had been an "enthusiastic Anthroposophist" from 1923, but was disaffected by 1929 and later joined the SS.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrology was officially interdicted in Nazi Germany after 1938.&lt;ref name="DLF"&gt;[http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/dasfeature/774541/ Nostradamus und die Nazis] {{de icon}} - A 'Feature' of [[Deutschlandfunk]] (German national radio) that was aired on September 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Nazis had sympathizing astrologers write favourable interpretations of [[Nostradamus]] for [[psychological warfare]],&lt;ref name="DLF"/&gt; and as late as 1936 Hitler personally sent a greetings telegram to an international astrologer's congress that was taking place in [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref name="DLF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://images.google.com/hosted/life/b1ed1d8761e1ae4a.html Telegram from Hitler to Dr. Korsch, President of the International Astrological Congress.] Image obtained by Life magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full focus of the state was not aimed at religious groups until 9 June 1941&lt;ref&gt;Bramwell 1985: 178.&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the head of the security police, banned lodge organizations and esoteric groups in the wake of the flight to Scotland by [[Rudolf Hess]], who had been attracted and influenced by the [[Biodynamic agriculture|organic farming]] theories of [[Rudolf Steiner]] and Anthroposophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 175, 177. When organic farmers and their supporters &amp;mdash; and even [[nudist]]s &amp;mdash; were arrested, Agriculture Minister [[Richard Walther Darré]] protested to Himmler and Heydrich, "despite a letter from [[Martin Bormann|Bormann]], warning Darré that Hitler was behind the arrests" (''ibid.'', 178).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the suppression of esoteric organisations began very soon after the Nazis acquired governmental power. Dr. Anna Bramwell points out that "occultist racialists were banned as early as 1934."&lt;ref name="Bramwell 1985: 42"/&gt;

Allegedly the [[Magic (illusion)|stage magician]] and [[occult]]ist [[Franz Bardon]] had attracted the notice of Adolf Hitler ''"like other workers for the Light"'' and was incarcerated in a concentration camp for three and a half months in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Merkur Publishing: [http://www.merkurpublishing.com/franz_bardon_bio.htm Franz Bardon Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002181045/http://www.merkurpublishing.com/franz_bardon_bio.htm |date=2007-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move away from earlier Nazi esotericism===
The [[Thule Society]] was dissolved still in the 1920s, well before Hitler's rise to power, and the anti-Masonic legislation of 1935 closed down esoteric organisations including ''völkisch'' occultist ones.

[[Karl Maria Wiligut]], the chief occultist influence on the Nazi establishment, retired in 1939. [[Alfred Rosenberg]],  whose 1930 ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century|Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' had been important in the foundation of Nazi racist ideology, and [[Heinrich Himmler]], who added a number of occultist "design elements" to the [[Schutzstaffel]], did remain high ranking party members throughout the war. Himmler's mystic tendencies can be seen in the [[Ahnenerbe]] organization and the [[Wewelsburg]] castle.

According to their private writings,&lt;ref&gt;''Hitler's Table Talk'', page 61, translated by Norman Cameron and R.H. Stevens, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mein Kampf'', chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; the leaders of the [[Nazism|Nazi Party]] in Germany did not wish to encourage forms of paganism which did not serve to further their goals of promoting pan-Germanic ethnic consciousness.

Already in 1927, Hitler had fired the [[Gauleiter]] of [[Thuringia|Thüringen]], [[Artur Dinter]], from his post because he wanted too much to make a religion of Aryan racial purity. In 1928, Dinter was expelled from the party when he publicly attacked Hitler about this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|d/dinter_a|band=18|autor=Andreas Schulz and [[Matthias Wolfes]]|artikel=Dinter, Artur|spalten=350-360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf von Sebottendorff]] had been involved in the [[Thule Society]]. In January 1933 he published ''Bevor Hitler kam: Urkundlich aus der Frühzeit der Nationalsozialistischen Bewegung'' (Before Hitler Came: Documents from the Early Days of the National Socialist Movement). Nazi authorities  disliked the book, which was banned in the following year. Sebottendorff was arrested but managed to flee to [[Turkey]].

==After 1945==
Other than popular [[Western astrology]], there is also a school of thought regarding [[Germanic Runic Astrology]] and its usage in divination within the northern tradition of [[Odinism]].

The work of [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]] was continued by Rudolf Arnold Spieth, who also published one of his works posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Gugenberger: [http://logo.at/artikel.dws?ffitem=435&amp;TEMPLATE=NEWS&amp;TID=DWBCDJAREGLBBQ Friedrich Bernhard Marby] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928123708/http://logo.at/artikel.dws?ffitem=435&amp;TEMPLATE=NEWS&amp;TID=DWBCDJAREGLBBQ |date=2007-09-28 }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival of [[Neopaganism in German-speaking Europe|Neopaganism in Germany and Austria]] began in the 1970s.
Since the 1980s, mainstream esotericism in German-speaking Europe has been dominated by generic [[New Age]] syncretism as it developed in the [[United States]].

The '''European University Institute''' ('''EUI''') in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], is an international [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] and [[postdoctoral research|post-doctoral]] teaching and research institute established by [[European Union]] [[European Union member states|member states]] to contribute to cultural and scientific development in the social sciences, in a European perspective.

==History and member states==
The European University Institute (EUI) has been founded in 1972 by the Member States of the European Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/servizi/stranieri/opportunita/progetti-speciali/istitut_europeo_firenze.html
|title=European University Institute|publisher=Farnesina|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was born out of an atmosphere of cooperation, with notable advocacy for a European institute at the Hague Conference in 1948 and the European Cultural Conference the following year.

Other priorities persisted however until the 1955 Messina Conference; a series of constructive talks responding to the widening of Europe. With all six members of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) were present, the German Secretary of State Walter Hallstein took the opportunity to call for a training centre for nuclear sciences. This was proposed under the Euratom Treaty which had established Europe's atomic energy community; Hallstein's vision would create an instrument of integration and move away from the nationalism of the past.

The Italian government was enthusiastic and, recognising an academic need to study Europe, made determined action along with the European Commission and the European Parliament. However it was not until over a decade later that the idea began to bear fruit, when in 1969 leaders met in The Hague and resolved to fund a European University Institute (EUI) in Florence. By this point the idea had evolved from a centre for nuclear sciences to one focused on the human sciences, promoting a cultural exchange between member states.

Plans were put into motion with conferences in Florence and Rome in 1970 and 1971, when it was decided that the institute would be reserved for post-graduate studies and not directly a Community institution.

The six member states – Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands – signed a convention in 1972 which cemented their commitment to creating the EUI as a pillar for research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1436893428665&amp;uri=CELEX:41976A0209(01)|title= Convention setting up a European University Institute|year=1976 |accessdate=|journal=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|volume=С|number=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the Community and became involved in founding the Institution.

The EUI opened its doors to its first 70 researchers in 1976. The mission, laid down in the 1970s, is to “foster the advancement of learning in fields which are of particular interest for the development of Europe”.

{{as of|2018|June}}, the EUI Member States are:

==Departments and centres==
===Department of Economics===
The Economics Department provides teaching and supervision to PhD students. The research activities of the Department reflect the interests of the faculty and are concentrated in micro, macro and econometrics. Weekly research seminars are given by scholars from around the world. The teaching in the doctoral programme is based on formal coursework at a level which will allow researchers to pursue academic careers in universities or to follow professional opportunities in international organisations. In their third and fourth years researchers work on their thesis projects under the guidance of their supervisor while attending research workshops and seminars.

===Department of History and Civilization===
The Department of History and Civilization (HEC) offers a programme of transnational and comparative European history. The doctoral programme studies the construction of Europe's boundaries and the diversity and complexity of experiences within them.

The department's central concerns are the interlinking of European societies since the Renaissance and the complex cultural legacies that have shaped contemporary Europe. The HEC community is also committed to exploring the place of Europe in the world through the study of empires, global processes and institutions.

The variety of research approaches and themes, as well as the broad background of its professors, enable the Department to recruit high-quality Ph.D. candidates and to host outstanding research fellows.

===Department of Law===
The Department of Law is European and international in character. It is committed to the study of law in a comparative and contextual manner, with a special focus on European and international law.

Courses and seminars are interactive, research-oriented and designed to cover the main subject areas of the Department's work. Researchers gain experience in presenting their work, and are encouraged to participate in conferences, workshops and the Department's Working Groups.

Within the department, the Academy of European Law (AEL) offers advanced-level summer courses in Human Rights Law and EU Law. It also manages research projects and runs a publications programme.

The EUI Law Department also jointly hosts, with Harvard Law School, the Summer School on Law and Logic.  This summer school was launched in 2012 and is also sponsored by CIRSFID-University of Bologna (Italy), the University of Groningen (the Netherlands), the European Academy of Legal Theory, and a grant from the Erasmus Lifelong Learning Programme.

===Department of Political and Social Sciences===
The research programme of the Department of Political and Social Sciences (SPS) places emphasis on political and social change within Europe at the national, sub-national and transnational level.
The research interests of the Department range across the four sub-disciplines of comparative politics, sociology, international relations, and social and political theory.
 
Courses in both quantitative and qualitative methods are available as options in the first and second year, while field work and data collection normally take place in the second and third year.

===Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies===
The Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies was launched by the European University Institute in 1993 building up on the experience of an already existing Policy Unit, created by [[Joseph Weiler]]. It is named for [[Robert Schuman]]. The first Director of the newly established Centre was {{illm|Yves Mény|fr||it}} (1993-2001), followed by [[Helen Wallace]] (2001-2006), {{ill|Stefano Bartolini|de}} (2006-2013) and Brigid Laffan (2013-). The initial set up was rather modest: one director, one assistant and two secretaries, but over the years the Centre has grown into a large research centre pursuing interdisciplinary research into the key political challenges facing Europe and the EU today and bringing together academics and practitioners, in both policy dialogues and executive training. The Centre's mission is to “contribute to research on the major issues facing contemporary European society, including questions associated with the construction of Europe.”
The Centre has several main programmes.

====Global Governance Programme====
The Global Governance Programme brings together academics, diplomats, public officers and officials from international organisations to connect the worlds of research and policy-making. It tackles a wide range of issues, including human rights, international trade, development, climate change, internet governance and regional integration.

The programme hosts a series of events, including High-Level Policy Seminars, where participants can exchange ideas.

====Florence School of Regulation====
The [http://fsr.eui.eu/ '''Florence School of Regulation'''] (FSR) is a centre of excellence for independent research, training and policy dialogue. The FSR has been founded in 2004 as a partnership between the EUI's Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, the Council of the European Energy Regulators (CEER) and the Independent Regulators Group (IRG). The school also works closely with the [[European Commission]].

The FSR organises '''policy events''' dealing with key regulatory issues, provides academic '''training for practitioners''', produces regulation '''research''' and promotes networking and the exchange of ideas in the areas of:

Policy and business decision-makers, regulators, regulated companies and academics from different countries are encouraged to share their experiences through the school.

====European Union Democracy Observatory====
The European Union Democracy Observatory (EUDO), launched in 2006, is an independent and interdisciplinary academic organisation whose goal is to produce an assessment of democratic practices within the EU. EUDO gathers documentation and data, provides basic and applied research reports for EU institutions, and fosters dialogue between policy-makers, academics and EU citizens.

====Migration Policy Centre====
The Migration Policy Centre has been founded in January 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-is-new/news/news/2012/20120625_en
|title=New Migration Policy Centre|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conducts advanced policy-oriented research on global migration, asylum and mobility. It serves governance needs at European and global levels, from developing, implementing and monitoring migration-related policies to assessing their impact on the wider economy and society.

====Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom====
The Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom (CMPF) was set up to raise awareness of media diversity and freedom issues in Europe. Co-financed by the European Union, it is composed of experts in legal studies, new media policies, media markets and economics, political science and political communications. 
Through its programme of research, debate, training and dissemination of results, the CMPF works with academics, policy makers, regulators, market stakeholders, journalists and others interested in the debate.

== Historical Archives of EU ==

The [[Historical Archives of the European Union]] (HAEU) preserves and makes accessible the documents produced by the European Union's institutions according to the thirty year rule governing public access to archival material. The HAEU was established following decisions of the European Coal and Steel Community's (ECSC) and the Council in 1983 to open their historical archives to the public. An agreement between the European Commission and the European University Institute in 1984 led to the creation of the HAEU. The Archives are administered by the EUI and are operative in Florence since 1986.

==Doctoral and master programmes==

===[http://www.eui.eu/Phd/ Doctoral Programme]===
The EUI prepares researchers for developing and defending a doctoral thesis in the fields of economics, history and civilization, law, and political and social sciences. Around 150-160 research grants are awarded annually by the EU Member States and other European national authorities to successful candidates. A Ph.D. from the European University Institute is an internationally recognised qualification.

While each department structures its own four-year programme, in all researchers are involved in seminars and other events where they are encouraged to participate and present their work. During their Ph.D. students may travel within the EU and further afield to conduct research, while there are also exchange opportunities.

====Grants and fees====
There are  funding options available to researchers, with the majority of EU member states offering grants which cover living costs and tuition fees. There are additional agreements with non-EU member states, while the Italian and Spanish ministries of foreign affairs provide grants to a number of countries. Academics not covered by grants pay €12,000 each year in tuition fees and be able to guarantee at least €1,200 monthly to cover living costs, although fees may be reduced or waived for candidates from developing countries.

===[https://www.eui.eu/ServicesAndAdmin/AcademicService/MasterofLaws/LL.M.Programme Masters Programme in Law]===
Since 1984 the European University Institute has offered law students a one-year programme leading to the degree of '''Master in Comparative, European and International Law''' ([[LL.M.]] degree level).

===Languages===
The majority of students and professors are multilingual; all are required to have a good knowledge of English although French and Italian are also regular working languages and the Institute is committed to accommodating other languages where possible.

==Postdoctoral fellowships==
The EUI has several post-doctoral fellowships in the [[social sciences]]

===Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellowships===

The Max Weber Programme is Europe's largest postdoctoral programme in the social sciences and is funded by the European Commission.

Max Weber Fellowships are designed for junior post-docs who would like to pursue an academic career, concentrate on their own research and enhance their academic practice in a multidisciplinary environment. Max Weber Fellowships are for one or two years and are open to candidates who have received a doctorate in the social sciences (economics, law, political science, sociology, history and related fields) within the last five years.

===Jean Monnet Fellowships===
Through its Jean Monnet Fellowship Programme the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies offers fellowships to mid- and late-career scholars (while previously the Jean Monnet was a post-doctoral fellowship, it is now available only to those who received their PhD at least five years prior). During their stay at the RSCAS, fellows work on a research topic that fits well in the overall research profile of the RSCAS and participate in the academic life of the Centre and of the EUI. Jean Monnet Fellowships have a duration of one or two years and are open to candidates who have received a doctorate more than five years prior.

===Fernand Braudel Senior Fellowships===
Fernand Braudel Senior Fellowships provide a framework for established academics with an international reputation to pursue their research at the EUI. Fellowships last for up to ten months in one of the EUI's four Departments which in turn invite fellows to participate in departmental activities (seminars, workshops, colloquia, etc.).

===Marie Curie Fellowships===
The EUI (the Departments and the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies) acts as a host institution for Marie Curie Fellowships which are awarded by the European Commission.

===Canon Foundation Fellowships===
The Canon Foundation and the EUI jointly award one Canon Foundation Fellowship each year for post-doctoral research at the EUI. The fellowship is open to candidates of Japanese nationality or permanent residents of Japan.

===Academy of Finland Fellowships===
The Academy of Finland awards fellowships for post-doctoral research at the EUI. A project to be funded shall serve Finnish research and society or international collaboration.

===Australian European University Institute Fellowships Association Inc===
The Australian European University Institute Fellowships Association Inc awards annually one six-month Postdoctoral Fellowship for the period January–June. The Postdoctoral Fellowship is available to those who have graduated with a PhD qualification within the last five years, and is open only to Australian citizens or residents employed in Australian universities.

==Rankings==
The EUI is one of the leading [[social science]] research institutions in Europe, and with around 1,000 researchers at various levels in their careers also one of the largest [[graduate schools]]. The EUI Political and Social Science department was ranked first in Europe and fifth worldwide in the Hix ranking of such departments (which was published in 2004 and covered the period 1998–2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicalstudies.org/pdf/psr/hix.pdf Simon Hix (2004) 'A Global Ranking of Political Science Departments', Political Studies Review 2(3) 293-313.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041221043317/http://www.politicalstudies.org/pdf/psr/hix.pdf |date=December 21, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, the same department was included in the ''[[Die Zeit]]'' &lt;nowiki&gt;'CHE Excellence Ranking'&lt;/nowiki&gt; for political science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.excellenceranking.org/eusid/EUSID CHE Excellence Ranking 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fact''' is something that is consistent with objective [[reality]] or that can be proven with [[evidence]]. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to [[experience]]. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. [[Science|Scientific]] facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by [[experiments]] or other means.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word "fact" derives from the Latin ''factum'', and was first used in English with the same meaning: ''a thing done or performed'' a meaning now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact". OED_2d_Ed_1989, (but note the conventional uses: ''after the fact'' and ''before the fact'').&lt;/ref&gt;  The common usage of "something that has really occurred or is the case" dates from the middle of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (1a). OED_2d_Ed_1989 Joye ''Exp. Dan.'' xi. Z vij b, ''Let emprours and kinges know this godly kynges fact. 1545''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact is sometimes used synonymously with ''[[truth]]'', as distinct from opinions, falsehoods, or matters of taste.  This use is found in such phrases as, "''It is a fact that the cup is blue"'' or "''Matter of fact"'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (4a) OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; and "...&amp;nbsp;not history, nor fact, but imagination." Filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] distinguishes between the two, claiming that "Fact creates norms, and truth illumination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |title=Werner Herzog Film: Statements / Texts |publisher=Wernerherzog.com |date=1999-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715011254/http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact also indicates a ''matter under discussion'' deemed to be true or correct, such as to emphasize a point or prove a disputed issue; (e.g., "...&amp;nbsp;the ''fact'' of the matter is ...").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6c). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(See also "Matter" (2,6). Compact_OED)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, ''fact'' may also indicate an ''allegation or stipulation'' of something that may or may not be a ''true fact'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (5). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., "the author's facts are not trustworthy"). This alternate usage, although contested by some, has a long history in standard English.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', "Fact has a long history of usage in the sense 'allegation'" AHD_4th_Ed. The OED dates this use to 1729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact may also indicate findings derived through a ''process of evaluation'', including review of testimony, direct observation, or otherwise; as distinguishable from matters of inference or speculation.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6a). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; This use is reflected in the terms "fact-find" and "fact-finder" (e.g., "set up a [[fact-finding]] commission").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (8). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be checked by reason, experiment, personal experience, or may be argued from authority.  [[Roger Bacon]] wrote "If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bacon, translated by Robert Burke ''Opus Majus'', Book I, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==

In [[philosophy]], the concept ''fact'' is considered in [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]. Questions of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and truth are closely associated with questions of fact. A "fact" can be defined as something that is the case—that is, a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;"A fact, it might be said, is a state of affairs that is the case or obtains." – [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/states-of-affairs/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. ''States of Affairs'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Wittgenstein, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]],'' Proposition 2: What is the case -- a fact -- is the existence of states of affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be understood as information that makes a true sentence true.&lt;ref&gt;"A fact is, traditionally, the worldly correlate of a true proposition, a state of affairs whose obtaining makes that proposition true." – ''Fact'' in The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Facts may also be understood as those things to which a true sentence refers. The statement "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system" is ''about'' the fact Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Oliver, ''Fact'', in {{cite book
| title     = Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy
| first     = Edward
| last      = Craig
| publisher = Routledge, Oxford
| year      = 2005
| isbn        = 0-415-32495-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondence and the slingshot argument===

[[Pascal Engel|Pascal Engel's]] version of the [[correspondence theory of truth]] explains that what makes a sentence true is that it ''corresponds'' to a fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Truth
| first     = Pascal
| last      = Engel
| publisher = McGill-Queen's Press- MQUP
| year      = 2002
| isbn        = 0-7735-2462-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory presupposes the existence of an objective world.

The [[Slingshot argument]] claims to show that all true statements stand for the same thing - the [[truth value]] ''true''. If this argument holds, and facts are taken to be what true statements stand for, then we reach the counter-intuitive conclusion that there is only one fact - ''the truth''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument is presented in many places, but see for example [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], ''Truth and Meaning'', in {{cite book
| title     = Truth and Interpretation
| first     = Donald
| last      = Davidson
| publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford
| year      = 1984
| isbn        = 0-19-824617-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound facts===

Any non-trivial true statement about [[reality]] is necessarily an abstraction composed of a complex of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] and [[property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[logic of relatives|relations]].&lt;ref&gt;"Facts possess internal structure, being complexes of objects and properties or relations" Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fact described by the true statement "[[Paris]] is the capital city of [[France]]" implies that there is such a place as Paris, there is such a place as France, there are such things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that there is such a thing as a ''place'' or a ''government'', and so on.  The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact that Paris is the capital of France.

Difficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts.&lt;ref&gt;''Fact'', in ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Ted Honderich, editor. (Oxford, 1995) {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact–value distinction===
{{main|Fact–value distinction}}
Moral philosophers since [[David Hume#Ethics|David Hume]] have debated whether values are objective, and thus factual. In ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what ''ought'' to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what ''is'' the case. Those who insist there is a logical gulf between [[Fact-value distinction|facts and values]], such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values from facts, include [[G. E. Moore]], who called attempting to do so the [[naturalistic fallacy]].

===Factual–counterfactual distinction===
{{main|Counterfactual conditional}}

Factuality—what has occurred—can also be contrasted with counterfactuality:
what ''might have'' occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or subjunctive conditional is a conditional (or "if-then") statement indicating what ''would be'' the case if events had been other than they were. For example, "If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome." This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what ''is'' (in fact) the case if its antecedent ''is'' (in fact) true—for example, "If you drink this, it will make you well."

Such sentences are important to [[modal logic]], especially since the development of [[possible world]] semantics.

==In science==
{{further|scientific method|philosophy of science}}

In science, a ''fact'' is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called [[empirical evidence]].  Facts are central to building [[scientific theories]].  Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the [[scientific method]], and the scope and validity of [[Philosophy of science|scientific reasoning]].

In the most basic sense, a scientific ''fact'' is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a ''[[hypothesis]]'' or ''[[theory]]'', which is intended to explain or interpret facts.&lt;ref name="Gower000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction
| first     = Barry
| last      = Gower
| publisher = Routledge
| year      = 1997
| isbn        = 0-415-12282-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[scholars]] have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation.  Scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) ''states of affairs'' in the external world and 2) ''assertions'' of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems
| first     = Jerome Raymond
| last      = Ravetz
| publisher = Transaction Publishers
| year      = 1996
| isbn        = 1-56000-851-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact.&lt;ref&gt;(Gower 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:
* the process by which "established fact" becomes recognized and accepted as such;&lt;ref&gt;(see e.g., Ravetz, p. 182 fn. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* whether and to what extent "fact" and "theoretic explanation" can be considered truly independent and separable from one another;&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"&gt;Gower, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;
* to what extent "facts" are influenced by the mere act of observation;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"/&gt; and
* to what extent factual conclusions are influenced by history and consensus, rather than a strictly systematic methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with the idea of [[confirmation holism]], some scholars assert "fact" to be necessarily "theory-laden" to some degree. [[Thomas Kuhn]] points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of [[fossils]] is based on [[radiometric dating]], which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a [[Poisson process]] rather than a [[Bernoulli process]]. Similarly, [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] is credited with the methodological position known as operationalism, which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined by the means and assumptions used to measure them.

=== The scientific method ===
Apart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz p. 181 et. seq. (Chapter Six: "Facts and their evolution")&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.&lt;ref name="The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine"&gt;Cassell, Eric J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1kjFYrliTMC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;ots=3V6-UmUFmP&amp;dq=%22scientific+fact&amp;sig=YtQTgNbisFSQ1QfV-JNkmW7D0n4#PPA181,M1 The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine] ''[[Oxford University Press]]''. Retrieved 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to these considerations, there are the social and institutional measures, such as peer review and accreditation, that are intended to promote ''factual accuracy'' (among other interests) in scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;(Ravetz 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In history ==
{{further|Historiography}}

A common rhetorical cliché states, "[[History is written by the winners]]." This phrase suggests but does not examine the use of facts in the writing of history.

[[E. H. Carr]] in his 1961 volume ''[[What is History?]]'' argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] [[idealistic]] and impossible. Facts are, "like fish in the Ocean," of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean's surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding - all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past - and that one's methods of fact gathering should be openly examined.  Historical truth and facts therefore change over time, and reflect only the present consensus (if that).

==In law==

=== Legal pleadings ===
{{main|Pleading}}
A party to a civil suit generally must clearly state all relevant allegations of fact that form the basis of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading.&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. McDonald, ''Alternative Pleading in the United States: I'' Columbia Law Review, Vol. 52, No. 4 (Apr., 1952), pp. 443-478&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of facts that (when considered together) may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This (seemingly) logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies (such as ''[[res judicata]]'') that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts.&lt;ref&gt;(McDonald 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

It comprises 32 diagnostic characteristics, divided into four sub-scales.  The four sub-scales are Social Interaction, Restricted Patterns of Behaviour, Cognitive Patterns, and Pragmatic Skills.  An optional additional sub-scale of eight items, Early Development, can also be included.&lt;ref name=SoodOswald /&gt;

The rating scores on each of the sub-scales are combined by simple summation to form an overall score, the '''Asperger's disorder quotient'''.&lt;ref name=SoodOswald /&gt;

Administering the test takes 10 minutes.&lt;ref name=VVvdE /&gt;  The scale is available in forms for teachers as well as parents, and like the [[Gilliam Autism Rating Scale]] it is comparatively less complicated to administer and score than other tests such as the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] or the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised|Autism Diagnostic Interview — Revised]] (although both of these more complex tests are increasingly used in research).&lt;ref name=Wilmshurst /&gt;

This page provides a '''glossary of plant morphology'''. Botanists and other biologists who study [[plant morphology]] use a number of different terms to classify and identify [[plant]] organs and parts that can be observed using no more than a handheld magnifying lens. This page provides help in understanding the numerous other pages describing plants by their various [[taxa]]. The accompanying page, [[Plant morphology]], provides an overview of the science of the external form of plants. There is also an alphabetical list, [[Glossary of botanical terms]]. In contrast, this page deals with botanical terms in a [[Systematics|systematic]] manner, with some illustrations, and organized by [[Plant anatomy]] and function in [[Plant physiology]].{{sfn|Rudall|2007}}

This glossary primarily includes terms that deal with [[vascular plants]] ([[ferns]], [[gymnosperms]] and angiosperms), particularly [[flowering plants]] (angiosperms). Non-vascular plants ([[bryophytes]]), with their different evolutionary background, tend to have separate terminology. Although plant morphology (the external form) is integrated with plant anatomy (the internal form), the former became the basis of the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] description of plants that exists today, due to the few tools required to observe.{{sfn|Radford et al.|1974}}{{sfn|Bell|1991}}

Many of these terms date back to the earliest [[herbalists]] and [[botanist]]s, including [[Theophrastus]]. Thus, they usually have [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] or [[Latin]] roots. These terms have been modified and added to over the years, and different authorities may not always use them the same way.{{sfn|Radford et al.|1974}}{{sfn|Bell|1991}} 

This page has two parts: The first deals with general plant terms, and the second with specific plant structures or parts.

== General plant terms ==
* [[Abaxial]]  –  located on the side facing away from the axis.
* [[Adaxial]] – located on the side facing towards the axis.
* [[Dehiscent]] – opening at maturity
* [[Gall]] – outgrowth on the surface caused by invasion by other lifeforms, such as parasites
* [[Indehiscent]] – not opening at maturity
* [[Reticulate]] – web-like or network-like
* [[:wikt:striated|Striated]] – marked by a series of lines, grooves, or ridges
* [[Tesselate]] – marked by a pattern of polygons, usually rectangles
* [[Wing (plant)]] – any flat surfaced structure emerging from the side or summit of an organ; seeds, stems.

=== Plant habit ===
[[Habit (biology)|Plant habit]] refers to the overall shape of a plant, and it describes a number of components such as stem length and development, branching pattern, and texture. While many plants fit neatly into some main categories, such as [[grasses]], [[vines]], [[shrubs]], or [[trees]], others can be more difficult to categorise. The habit of a plant provides important information about its [[ecology]]: that is, how it has adapted to its environment. Each habit indicates a different adaptive strategy. Habit is also associated with the development of the plant. As such, it may change as the plant grows and is more properly called its growth habit. In addition to shape, habit indicates plant structure; for instance, whether the plant is [[herbaceous]] or [[Woody plant|woody]].

Each plant commences its growth as a herbaceous plant. Plants that remain herbaceous are shorter and seasonal, dying back at the end of their growth season. Woody plants (such as trees, shrubs and woody vines ([[lianas]]) will gradually acquire woody (lignaceous) tissues, which provide strength and protection for the [[Vascular tissue|vascular system]],{{sfn|Judd et al.|2007|loc= Chapter 4. Structural and Biochemical Characters}} and they tend to be tall and relatively long lived. The formation of woody tissue is an example of [[secondary growth]], a change in existing tissues, in contrast to primary growth that creates new tissues, such as the elongating tip of a plant shoot. The process of wood formation ([[lignification]]) is commonest in the [[Spermatophytes]] (seed bearing plants) and has evolved independently a number of times. The roots may also lignify, aiding in the role of supporting and anchoring tall plants, and may be part of a descriptor of the plant's habit.

Plant habit can also refer to whether the plant possesses any [[Storage organ|specialised systems for the storage]] of [[carbohydrates]] or water, allowing the plant to renew its growth after an unfavourable period. Where the amount of water stored is relatively high, the plant is referred to as a [[succulent]]. Such specialised plant parts may arise from the stems or roots. Examples include plants growing in unfavourable climates, very dry climates where storage is intermittent depending on climatic conditions, and those adapted to surviving fires and regrowing from the soil afterwards.

Some types of plant habit include:
* '''Herbaceous plants''' (also called Herbs): A plant whose structures above the surface of the soil, vegetative or reproductive, die back at the end of the annual growing season, and never become woody. While these structures are annual in nature, the plant itself may be [[Annual plant|annual]], [[Biennial plant|biannual]], or [[perennial]]. Herbaceous plants that survive for more than one season possess underground storage organs, and thus are referred to as geophytes.

Terms used in describing plant habit, include:

Plant structures or organs fulfil specific functions, and those functions determine the structures that perform them. Among terrestrial (land) plants, the [[Vascular plants|vascular]] and [[non-vascular plants]] (Bryophytes) evolved independently in terms of their adaptation to terrestrial life and are treated separately here (see [[#Bryophytes|Bryophytes]]).{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC&amp;pg=PA364  Flowers p.&amp;nbsp;364]}}

==== Life cycle ====
Common structural elements are present in the [[#Embryonic development|embryonic]] part of the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], which is the [[diploid]] [[multicellular]] phase. The '''embryo''' develops into the '''[[sporophyte]]''', which at maturity produces haploid '''[[spores]]''', which germinate to produce the gametophyte, the [[haploid]] multicellular phase. The haploid gametophyte then produces [[gametes]], which may fuse to form a diploid [[zygote]], and finally an embryo. This phenomenon of alternating diploid and haploid multicellular phases is common to the [[embryophytes]] (land plants) and is referred to as the [[alternation of generations]]. A major difference between vascular and non-vascular plants is that in the latter the haploid gametophyte is the more visible and longer-lived stage. In vascular plants, the diploid sporophyte has [[evolution|evolved]] as the dominant and visible phase of the life cycle. In seed plants and some other groups of vascular plants the gametophyte phases are strongly reduced in size and contained within the '''[[pollen]]''' and '''[[ovules]]'''. The female gametophyte is entirely contained within the sporophyte's tissues, while the male gametophyte in its pollen grain is released and transferred by wind or animal vectors to fertilize the ovules.{{sfn|Rudall|2007}}

==== Morphology ====
Amongst the vascular plants, the structures and functions of the [[Pteridophyta]] (ferns), which reproduce seedlessly, are also sufficiently different to justify separate treatment, as here (see [[#Pteridophytes|Pteridophytes]]). The remainder of the vascular plant sections address the higher plants ([[Spermatophytes]] or '''[[Seed]]''' Plants, i.e. [[Gymnosperms]] and [[Angiosperms]] or flowering plants). In the higher plants, the terrestrial sporophyte has evolved specialised parts. In essence, they have a lower, underground component and an upper, aerial component. The underground part develops '''[[root]]s''' that seek water and nourishment from the soil, while the upper component, or '''[[shoot]]''', grows toward the light and develops a '''[[plant stem]]''', '''[[leaves]]''' and specialised [[Plant reproduction|reproductive]] structures ('''[[sporangia]]'''). In angiosperms, the sporangia are located in the '''[[stamen]]''' '''[[anthers]]''' (microsporangia) and '''[[ovules]]''' (megasporangia). The specialised sporangia bearing stem is the '''[[flower]]'''. In angiosperms, if the female sporangium is [[Double fertilisation|fertilised]], it becomes the '''[[fruit]]''', a mechanism for dispersing the seeds produced from the embryo.
{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC&amp;pg=PA364  Flowers p.&amp;nbsp;364]}}

===== Vegetative structures =====
Thus, the terrestrial sporophyte has two growth centres, the stem growing upwards while the roots grow downwards. New growth occurs at the tips (apices) of both the shoot and roots, where the undifferentiated cells of the [[meristem]] divide. Branching occurs to form new apical meristems. Growth of the stem is '''[[Indeterminate growth|indeterminate]]''' in pattern (not pre-determined to stop at a particular point).{{sfn|Rudall|2007}} The functions of the '''stem''' are to raise and support the leaves and reproductive organs above the level of the soil, to facilitate absorption of light for [[photosynthesis]], gas exchange, water exchange ([[transpiration]]), [[pollination]], and [[seed dispersal]]. The stem also serves as a conduit, from roots to overhead structures, for water and other growth-enhancing substances. These conduits consist of specialised tissues known as [[vascular bundles]], which give the name "vascular plants" to the angiosperms. The point of insertion, on the stem, of leaves or buds is a '''[[#Node|node]]''', and the space between two successive nodes, an '''[[#Internode|internode]]'''.

The [[leaves]], which emerge from the shoot, are specialised structures that carry out photosynthesis, and gas ([[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]) and water exchange. They are sheathed by an outer layer or '''[[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]''' that is coated with a waxy waterproof protective layer, which is punctuated by specialised pores, known as '''[[stomata]]''', which regulate gas and water exchange. The leaves also possess vascular bundles, which are generally visible as '''[[Leaf#Veins|veins]]''', whose patterns are called '''[[#Venation|venation]]'''. Leaves tend to have a shorter life span than the stems or branches that bear them, and when they fall, an area at the attachment zone, called the '''[[abscission zone]]''' leaves a scar on the stem.

In the angle ('''adaxial''') between the leaf and the stem, is the '''[[axil]]'''. Here can be found '''[[buds]]''' ([[axillary buds]]), which are miniature and often dormant branches with their own apical meristem. They are often covered by leaves.

===== Floral structure =====

}}
The flower, which is one of the defining features of angiosperms, is essentially a stem whose leaf primordia become specialised, following which the apical meristem stops growing: a '''[[determinate growth]]''' pattern, in contrast to vegetative stems.{{sfn|Rudall|2007}}{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC&amp;pg=PA364  Flowers p.&amp;nbsp;364]}} The flower stem is known as a '''[[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]''', and those flowers with such a stem are called pedicellate, while those without are called '''[[Sessility (botany)|sessile]]'''.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC&amp;pg=PA364  Flower parts p.&amp;nbsp;364]}} In the angiosperms, the flowers are arranged on a flower stem as an '''[[inflorescence]]'''. Just beneath (subtended) the flower there may be a modified, and usually reduced, leaf, called a '''[[bract]]'''. A secondary smaller bract is a '''[[bracteole]]''' (bractlet, prophyll, prophyllum), often on the side of the pedicel, and generally paired. A series of bracts subtending the calyx (see below) is an '''epicalyx'''. Angiosperms are dealt with in more detail here; these structures are very different in gymnosperms.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC&amp;pg=PA364  Flower parts p.&amp;nbsp;364]}}

In angiosperms, the specialised leaves that play a part in reproduction are arranged around the stem in an ordered fashion, from the base to the apex of the flower. The floral parts are arranged at the end of a stem without any internodes. The '''[[receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]''' (also called the [[floral axis]], or thalamus) is generally very small. Some flower parts are solitary, while others may form a tight spiral, or '''[[Whorl (botany)|whorl]]''', around the flower stem. First, at the base, are those non-reproductive structures involved in protecting the flower when it is still a bud, the '''[[sepals]]''', then are those parts that play a role in attracting [[pollinators]] and are typically coloured, the '''[[petals]]''', which together with the sepals make up the '''[[perianth]]''' (perigon, perigonium). If the perianth is differentiated, the outer whorl of sepals forms the '''calyx''', and the inner whorl of petals, the '''[[Corolla (perianth)|corolla]]'''. If the perianth is not differentiated into sepals and petals, they are collectively known as '''[[tepals]]'''. In some flowers, a tube or cup-like '''[[hypanthium]]''' (floral tube) is formed above or around the '''[[Ovary (botany)|ovary]]''' and  bears the sepals, petals, and '''[[stamens]]'''. There may also be a '''[[nectary]]''' producing nectar. Nectaries may develop on or in the perianth, receptacle, '''[[androecium]]''' (stamens), or '''[[gynoecium]]'''. In some flowers nectar may be produced on nectariferous disks. '''[[#Disk|Disks]]''' may arise from the receptable and are doughnut- or disk-shaped. They may also surround the stamens (extrastaminal), be at the stamen bases (staminal), or be inside the stamina (intrastaminal).{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC&amp;pg=PA365  Flower parts p.&amp;nbsp;365]}}

===== Reproductive structures =====
{{Main article|Plant reproductive morphology}}
Finally, the actual reproductive parts form the innermost layers of the flower. These leaf primordia become specialised as '''[[sporophylls]]''', leaves that form areas called '''[[sporangia]]''', which produce spores, and cavitate internally. The sporangia on the sporophytes of pteridophytes are visible, but those of gymnosperms and angiosperms are not. In the angiosperms there are two types. Some form male organs ('''[[stamens]]'''), the male sporangia ('''[[microsporangia]]''') producing '''[[microspores]]'''. Others form female organs ('''[[Gynoecium#Carpels|carpels]]'''), the female sporangia ('''[[megasporangia]]''') producing a single large '''[[megaspore]]'''.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC&amp;pg=PA365  Flower parts p.&amp;nbsp;365]}} These in turn produce the male gametophytes and female gametophytes

These two components are the '''[[androecium]]''' and '''[[gynoecium]]''', respectively. The Androecium (literally, men's house) is a collective term for the male organs (stamens or microsporophylls). While sometimes leaflike (laminar), more commonly they consist of a long thread-like column, the '''[[#Filament|filament]]''', surmounted by a pollen bearing '''[[#Anther|anther]]'''. The anther usually consists of two fused '''[[thecae]]'''. A theca is two microspoorangia. The gynoecium (women's house) is the collective term for the female organs (carpels). A carpel is a modified megasporophyll consisting of two or more '''[[ovules]]''', which develop conduplicatively (folded along the line). The carpels may be single, or collected together, to form an ovary, and contain the ovules. Another term, '''[[Gynoecium#Pistils|pistil]]''', refers to the ovary as its expanded base, the '''[[Stigma (botany)#Style|style]]''', a column arising from the ovary, and an expanded tip, the '''[[Stigma (botany)|stigma]]'''.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC&amp;pg=PA365  Flower parts p.&amp;nbsp;365]}}

Within the stamen, the microsporangium forms grains of '''[[pollen]]''', surrounded by a protective microspore, which form the male gametophyte. Within the carpel the megasporangium form the '''[[ovules]]''', with its protective layers ('''[[integument]]''') in the megaspore, and the female gametophyte. Unlike the male gametophyte, which is transported in the pollen, the female gametophyte remains within the ovule.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC&amp;pg=PA365  Flower parts p.&amp;nbsp;365]}}

Most flowers have both male and female organs, and hence are considered bisexual (perfect), which is thought to be the ancestral state. However, others have either one or the other and are therefore unisexual, or imperfect. In which case they may be either male (staminate) or female (pistillate). Plants may bear either all bisexual flowers ([[hermaphroditic]]), both male and female flowers (monoecious), or only one sex (dioecious), in which case separate plants are either male or female flower-bearing. Where both bisexual and unisexual flowers exist on the same plant, it is called polygamous. Polygamous plants may have bisexual and staminate flowers (andromonoecious), bisexual and pistillate flowers (gynomonoecious), or both (trimonoecious). Other combinations include the presence of bisexual flowers on some individual plants and staminate on others (androdioecious), or bisexual and pistillate (gynodioecious). Finally, trioecious plants have bisexual, staminate, or pistillate flowers on different individuals. Arrangements other than hermaphroditic help to ensure [[outcrossing]].{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC&amp;pg=PA365  Flower sex and plant sex p.&amp;nbsp;365]}}

===== Fertilisation and embryogenesis =====
The development of the embryo and gametophytes is called embryology. The study of pollens which persist in soil for many years is called [[palynology]]. Reproduction occurs when male and female gametophytes interact. This generally requires an external agent such as wind or insects to carry the pollen from the stamen to the vicinity of the ovule. This process is called pollination. In gymnosperms (literally ''naked seed'') pollen comes into direct contact with the exposed ovule. In angiosperms the ovule is enclosed in the carpel, requiring a specialised structure, the '''[[Stigma (botany)|stigma]]''', to receive the pollen. On the surface of the stigma, the pollen [[germinates]]; that is, the male gametophyte penetrates the pollen wall into the stigma, and a '''[[pollen tube]]''', an extension of the pollen grain, extends towards the carpel, carrying with it the sperm cells (male '''[[gametes]]''') until they encounter the ovule, where they gain access through a pore in the ovule's integument ('''[[Micropyle (botany)|micropyle]]'''), allowing [[fertilisation]] to occur. Once the ovule has been fertilised, a new sporophyte, protected and nurtured by the female gametophyte, develops and becomes an embryo. When development stops, the embryo becomes dormant, as a seed. Within the embryo are the primordial shoot and root.

In angiosperms, as the seed develops after fertilisation, so does the surrounding carpel, its walls thickening or hardening, developing colours or nutrients that attract animals or birds. This new entity with its dormant seeds is the '''[[fruit]]''', whose functions are protecting the seed and dispersing it. In some cases, androecium and gynaecium may be fused. The resulting structure is a '''gynandrium''' (gynostegium, [[gynostemium]], or column), which is supported by an androgynosphore.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC&amp;pg=PA365  Flower parts p.&amp;nbsp;365]}}

=== Vegetative morphology ===
* Ptyxis – the way in which an individual leaf is folded within an unopened bud.
* [[Vernation]] – the arrangement of leaves in an unopened bud.

==== [[Root]]s ====
Plants, with regard to identification and classification, are not often characterized by their roots, which are important in determining plant duration. However, in some groups, including the grasses, roots are important for proper identification.
* [[Adventitiousness|Adventitious]] – roots that form from other than the hypocotyl or from other roots. Roots forming on the stem are adventitious.
* Aerial – roots growing in the air.
* [[Root crown|(Root) crown]] – the place where the roots and stem meet, which may or may not be clearly visible.{{sfn|FEIS|2015}}
* Fibrous – describes roots that are thread-like and normally tough.
* Fleshy – describes roots that are relatively thick and soft, normally made up of storage tissue. Roots are typically long and thick but not thickly rounded in shape.
* [[Haustorium|Haustorial]] – specialized roots that invade other plants and absorb nutrients from those plants.
* [[Lignotuber]] – root tissue that allows plants to regenerate after fire or other damage.
* Primary – root that develop from the [[radicle]] of the embryo, and is normally the first root to emerge from the seed as it germinates.
* Root Hairs – very small roots, often one cell wide, that do most of the water and nutrient absorption.
* Secondary – roots forming off of the primary root; often called branch roots.
* [[Taproot]] – a primary root that more-or-less enlarges and grows downward into the soil.
* [[Tuber]]ous – roots that are thick and soft with storage tissue, and are typically thick and round in shape.

===== Root structure terms =====
* Epiblema – Outermost (epidermal) layer of rootlets. Normally 1-cell-layer thick (uniseriate). Normally do not have a cuticle, and permit water conduction. 
* [[Quiescent centre]] – a small region inside the root's apical region that has a slower division rate. 
* Root Cap – a cover or cap-like structure that protects the tip of root. 
** Multiple root caps - several layers of root caps on a single root apex; seen in ''[[Pandanus]]'' sp.
** Root Pocket – a cap-like structure on the root-apex of some aquatic plants, which, unlike root-caps, doesn't reappear if removed somehow.   
* Root hair – fine cellular appendages from cells of epiblema. They are unicellular, which means one root hair and corresponding cell of epiblema comprise only 1 cell. By contrast, stem and leaf hairs can be unicellular or multicellular. Root hairs of older portions of roots are destroyed over time, and only at a certain region near a growing apex (called the '''root-hair-region''') are root hairs seen. Although microscopic, root-hairs can be observed by the unaided eye in chili and ''Brassica'' seedlings.

===== Terms classifying roots and their modifications =====
* '''Tap-Root-System''':
** Storage roots:  
*** Conical root – Storage root that is broad at its base (upper portion) and gradually tapers to its apex (lower portion): e.g., [[Carrot]]. 
*** Fusiform root – Storage root that is swollen in the centre and tapers towards both apex and base: e.g., radish ([[Raphanus Sativus|Raphanus sativus]]).
*** Napiform root – Root whose upper (basal) portion is heavily swollen but whose lower (apical) portion is narrow and tapering: e.g., [[beet]], [[turnip]]. 
*** Tuberous or tubercular tap-root – In its narrow sense, a tap-root that is thick and fleshy (due to storage) but that does not conform to the fusiform, conical, napiform shape: ''Mirabilis jalapa''. In its broader sense, a tap-root that is thick and fleshy (due to storage); i.e. when tuberation take place in a tap-root. 
** Pneumatophores (respiratory roots) – Part of tap-root system as respiratory roots; found in many [[mangrove]] trees. They arise from the thick, mature branches of tap-root systems, and grow upwards. The inner tissue of respiratory roots is full of hollow, airy, tube-like dead cells, giving it a spongy texture. The outer surface of pneumatophores contains tiny pores or openings, which are called pneumathodes: e.g., ''[[Heritiera fomes]]'', [[Rhizophora mucronata]]. Pneumatophores can be unbranched or sparingly branched.
** Vivipary – This is a feature of many mangrove trees, where the seed germinates when the seed (and fruit) remain joined to the mother plant until the radicle and hypocotyl grow, reach the ground, and establish there.&lt;ref&gt;College Botany, VOL-1, By HC Gangulee, KS Das, CT Dutta, revised by S Sen, published by New Central Book Agency Kolkata&lt;/ref&gt;

(See also: seeds and germination related sections and articles)

* '''Adventitious root systems'''
** Fibrous root – Originate from the base of a young stem and replace the primary root (and also from the stem nodes, and sometimes internodes), and emanate as a parallel cluster or bunch from around the node. The adventitious roots of monocots are usually of this type. Replacement of a tap root system by a fibrous root is seen in onions, tuberose (''Polyanthes tuberosa''), grasses, etc.  Fibrous roots from normal-stem nodes are seen in grasses like maize, sugarcane, bamboo, etc. Fibrous roots from nodes help in the survival of the plant and thus in vegetative reproduction, when the plant's base is damaged or cut inside the stem axis. 
**Many dicots, too, release adventitious toots from stem-nodes, especially those that can regenerate vegetatively (''Hibiscus rosa-sinensis'', ''Coleus'', etc.) and those that have a week stem with creeping habit (''Centella asiatica'', ''Bacopa monnieri'', etc.). These roots are called adventitious, not fibrous, roots.   
** Adventitious storage roots – similar function as storage-taproots.
*** Tuberous roots or root tubers – Narrow sense, those storage roots that do not conform to a specific shape, such as fasciculated, nodulose moniliform, annulated, etc.: e.g. sweet potato (''Ipomoea batatas''), whose edible part is a root of this type. Broader sense, adventitious roots swollen due to their storage function.  
*** Fasciculated root – When several tubercular roots grow as a parallel bunch or bundle. Seen in ''Dahlia'' sp., ''Ruellia tuberosa'', ''Asparagus racemosus'', etc.  ''Orchis maculata'' have a pair of bulbous storage-roots.
*** Nodulose root – Not to be confused with [[Root nodule|root-nodules]]. Storage pattern is a root axis swollen near the apical portion, thus forming a bulbous or tuberous structure at or near the root tip. It is commonly seen associated with a rhizomatous stem. It is seen in ''Costus speciosus'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A textbook of BOTANY , Vol-2, by Bhattacharya, Hait and Ghosh, NCBA Kolkata&lt;/ref&gt;''Curcuma amada'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;BOTANY For Degree Students, 6th edition, by AC Datta, Revised by TC Datta, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; ''Curcuma domestica'', ''Asparagus sprengeri'', Arrowroot (''Maranta''), etc.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and some species of ''Calathea''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  
*** Moniliform or Beaded root – When more than one swelling, or nodule-like, structures occur at intervals along the root axis. Such an alternating swollen-and-constricted pattern is seen in ''Cyperus'' sp., ''Dioscorea alata'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ''Vitis trifolia'',  ''Portulaca'' sp. , ''Basella'' sp., ''Momordica'' sp. and some grasses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
*** Annulated root – Like moniliform roots, annulated roots also contain alternating swollen and constricted regions; but here the length of constricted regions is so short that the root appears as a stack of discs. It is seen in ''Cephalis ipecacuanha'' (Rubiaceae).
** Floating or Aquatic-respiratory root – The upright, spongy structures helps the plant to float.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Seen in ''Jussiaea repens''. 
** Epiphytic root – This type of root seen in epiphytic orchids. The thick root hangs from the plant's base directly into air. The root is covered with a special, usually 4- to 5-cell layer thick,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; spongy tissue (called [[Velamen]]), which helps the plant to absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Epiphytic orchid have another sort of root, called clinging roots, that help the orchid plant cling to the substratum (host). Since a similar function is seen in many other plants' adventitious roots, it is being mentioned in more general terms in the mechanical advancements section. 
** Parasitic root or Haustoria –  
** Assimilatory or Photosynthetic roots – 
** Mechanical advancements –
*** Prop-roots – In some dome-shaped (deliquescent) trees, from the mature horizontal boughs (stem-branches) some quite thick (millimeters to centimeters) roots come down. After growing and reaching the ground, they establish more elaborate root branches as well as show massive secondary thickening. Thus, they start to resemble the main trunk. Besides carrying the weight of horizontal boughs, when the main trunk is destroyed due to ageing or accident, the established prop-roots support the remaining plant-body, thus helping in vegetative reproduction. E.g. ''Ficus benghalensis''. [[The Great Banyan]] Tree at [[Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden|IBG Kolkata]] is an example how prop-roots help in vegetative reproduction. 
*** Stilt roots – From upright (erect) trunks, some hard, thick, almost straight roots come-out obliquely and penetrate the ground. Thus they act like a [[Tripod (photography)|camera]]-[[tripod]]. They increase balance and support as well as, when these roots penetrates the ground, they increase soil grip. 
*** Root-Buttress or Plank Buttress or Buttress-Root – 
*** Climbing roots – 
*** Clinging roots – 
*** Contractile-roots or Pull-roots – 
*** [[Haptera]] – root-like projections found in [[macroalgae]] or [[lichen]]s that anchor the organism to a rocky substrate.
**Protective functions – 
*** Root-thorns – 
** Reproductive roots – These roots contain root-buds and actively take part in shoot-regeneration, and thus in vegetative reproduction. This is an unusual feature because roots normally do not contain buds.

Certain words have been suggested to be inherently funny. [[Vaudeville]] tradition holds that words with the letter ''k'' are funny. A 2015 study at the [[University of Alberta]] suggested that the humor of certain [[nonsense word]]s can be explained by whether they seem rude, and by the property of [[entropy]] – the improbability of certain letters being used together in a word. The philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] posited that [[humor]] is a product of one's expectations being violated. (Realisation)

==Funny words in English==

[[Vaudeville]] words can be found in [[Neil Simon]]'s 1972 play ''[[The Sunshine Boys]]'', in which an aging comedian gives a lesson to his nephew on comedy, saying that words with ''k'' sounds are funny:{{refn|name=Chaffee}}

{{blockquote|Fifty-seven years in this business, you learn a few things. You know what words are funny and which words are not funny. Alka Seltzer is funny. You say 'Alka Seltzer' you get a laugh ... Words with 'k' in them are funny. Casey Stengel, that's a funny name. Robert Taylor is not funny. Cupcake is funny. Tomato is not funny. Cookie is funny. Cucumber is funny. Car keys. Cleveland ... Cleveland is funny. Maryland is not funny. Then, there's chicken. Chicken is funny. Pickle is funny. Cab is funny. Cockroach is funny – not if you get 'em, only if you say 'em.{{refn|name=Helitzer}}{{refn|name=Franzini}}}}

[[Richard Wiseman]], a professor of the public understanding of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Hertfordshire]], conducted a small experiment to determine whether words with a ''k'' sound were actually considered funnier than others for English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg19426070-700-quacked-humour/ |first=Ivan |last=Berger |title=Quacked humour |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=6 June 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[LaughLab]] tested the degree of funniness among a family of jokes based on animal sounds; the joke rated the funniest was also the one with the most ''k'' sounds:

{{blockquote|Two ducks were sitting in a pond. One of the ducks said: "Quack". The other duck said: "I was going to say that!"&lt;ref name=Wiseman&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/apr/21/weekendmagazine |title=The truth about lying and laughing |first=Richard |last=Wiseman |authorlink=Richard Wiseman |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 April 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robert Beard, a [[professor emeritus]] of [[linguistics]] at [[Bucknell University]], told an interviewer that "The first thing people always write in [to his website] about is funny words".{{refn|name=Ask the Experts}} Beard's first book was ''The 100 Funniest Words in English'',{{refn|name=Ask the Experts}} and among his selected words are "absquatulate", "bowyangs", "collywobbles", "fartlek", "filibuster", "gongoozle", "hemidemisemiquaver", and "snollygoster".{{refn|name=Beard}}

==Rudeness and entropy==

A 2015 study published in the ''Journal of Memory and Language'' examined the humor of [[nonsense word]]s.{{refn|name=Alberta}}{{refn|name=Lewis}} The study used a computer program to generate pronounceable nonsense words that followed typical English spelling conventions and tested them for their perceived funniness to [[human test subject]]s.&lt;ref name=SoundFunny/&gt;

The funniest nonsense words tended to be those that reminded people of real words that are considered rude or offensive.&lt;ref name=SoundFunny/&gt;{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}} This category included four of the top-six nonsense words that were rated the funniest in the experiment: "whong", "dongl", "shart", and "focky".&lt;ref name=SoundFunny&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rd.com/magazine/funny-words/ |title=This is why some words just sound funny – and others don't |work=[[Reader's Digest]] |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain why these words seemed funny, the study's author said "The expectation that you've read or uttered a rude word is raised – and then violated, because in fact it's harmless nonsense. There's a sense of relief – of getting away with it."{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}}

After removing from consideration the words that seemed rude, another factor was suggested to also be significant. The study's lead author, Chris Westbury from the [[University of Alberta]], suggests that the humor of certain invented words can be explained by the property of [[entropy]].{{refn|name=Alberta}} Entropy (specifically [[Shannon entropy]]) here expresses how unlikely the letter combinations in certain nonsense words are: the more unlikely the letters are to be used together in English, the more funny the combination is likely to be found. Nonsense words such as "rumbus", "skritz", and "yuzz-a-ma-tuzz", which were created by children's book author and illustrator [[Dr. Seuss]], were found to have less probable letter combinations and to seem funnier than most ordinary English words.{{refn|name=Kaplan}}{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}} According to Westbury, "there's actually a consistent relationship between how funny [non{{nbh}}words] are and how weird they are".{{refn|name=Lewis}}

The entropy explanation also supports the notion that words with a 'k' in them tend to be more funny, as the letter 'k' is one of the least [[Letter frequency|frequently used letters]] in the English language.&lt;ref name=SoundFunny/&gt;

The idea that humor can be predicted by a word's entropy corresponds to the work of 19th-century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who posited that humor is a product of one's expectations being violated.{{refn|name=Lewis}}{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}} According to Westbury, "One reason puns are funny is that they violate our expectation that a word has one meaning".{{refn|name=Alberta}} Violating expectations corresponds mathematically to having a low probability combination of letters, which also makes the word seem particularly funny, according to Westbury.{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}}

To provide a possible evolutionary explanation of these phenomena, the authors of the study said that unusual occurrences may be experienced as indicating the presence of potential threats, and that humor may be a way of signalling to others that one has realized that a perceived threat is actually harmless. Westbury said "Strange as it may seem, that same mechanism may be activated when you see an unlikely looking word or a highly taboo one – you experience relief as you recognize that it's completely harmless – just a joke."{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}}

The '''interactive acculturation model''' ('''IAM''') seeks to integrate within a common theoretical framework the following components of [[immigrants]] and host community relations in [[multicultural]] settings:
# [[acculturation]] orientations adopted by immigrant groups in the host community;
# acculturation orientations adopted by the host community towards special groups of immigrants;
# interpersonal and intergroup relational outcomes that are the product of combinations of immigrant and host community acculturation orientations.
The framework of these established among a structural political/governmental environment. Ultimately, the goal of the model is to present a [[indeterminism|non-determinist]], more dynamic account of immigrant and host [[community acculturation]] in multicultural settings.&lt;ref&gt;Bourhuis et al., 1996.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially the model takes both sides of immigration (host and immigrant) and compares the values and desire to hold on to historical and cultural ties of the immigrant population versus the desire or degree to which the host population is willing to accommodate the immigrant influx. Examples of questions posed to the host population include:
# Do you find it acceptable that immigrants maintain their cultural [[Cultural heritage|heritage]]?
# Do you accept that immigrants adopt the culture of your host community?
The model derives two important pieces of data:
# the level to which the immigrant population is willing maintain its historical and cultural roots against;
# its desire (or lack thereof) to integrate and adopt the history and cultural traits of the host society.
The model essentially categorizes the population, based on the responses, as being in favor of [[social integration|integration]], [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or separation. When cross compared with the level of accommodation the host society is willing to provide, the model predicts whether the immigrant population will become fully assimilated, marginalized, or even isolated from the host society.&lt;ref name="Bourhis 377"&gt;Bourhis 377.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|It is unclear which entry this is in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State attitudes to immigration and acculturation==
In the past, [[acculturation]] has been described in both a macro level where there is emphasis on processes and effects on [[populations]] and at a micro level where it describes the [[psychological]] effect on individuals. Bourhis et al., reference the earlier work of both Graves and Berry&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; in the identification of individual psychological change that the immigrant experiences during their integration into a host culture. These changes are observed in the individual who is influenced by the new culture as well as participating and interacting within the new culture. To further understand the social and psychological effects of immigrant acculturation, the Bourhis team starts their model with an analysis of structural policies that address immigration, particularly in host nations.

===State policies===

The Bourhis et al. article delineates first the [[ideologies]] that make up the basis of the policies that are present in the host state. The study very much accepts the notion that these policies are very influential in the dynamics and the eventual [[acculturation]] process that goes on by the host and immigrant people. The Bourhis team categorized the host nation policies in the manner of Breton&lt;ref name="Breton, 1988"&gt;Breton, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; into state immigration policies that spell out quantities, type and origin of allowed immigrants, conditions and rules and then go on further to define the living rules that immigrants must live by in the host country such as work permits, ability to naturalize, etc. In addition we also have identified state integration policies that addressed mechanisms to help immigrants with joining into the host culture as well as measures to aid in host country acceptance of immigrants. These two types of policies may be symbiotic or at odds with each other in terms of goals and focus. The Bourhis team was primarily concerned with Western countries and noticed that in these nations, the policies, research, implementation and responsibility for both immigration and integration often resided in one sole governmental agency. This agency was often chartered with duties of writing statues, enforcing [[immigration]] laws and very possibly may be the governmental focus for assimilation and [[social integration|integration]] policy. Based on international conventions and referencing previous work by Kaplan,&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; sovereign countries possess the right and responsibility to define the limits and scope of nationality. Each country is presumed to have the right to decide who is a national and what does it take to be a national of that nation. Nations will derive their immigration policies based on a multitude of factors but in the context of state and national attitudes toward the [[immigrant populations]]. These policies define not only numbers and bureaucratic processes but also address the illegal immigration and the methods of countering it. As with all state policy, the laws enacted reflect both the majority host nation attitudes as well as help form these attitudes. The Bourhis model is premised on the adaptation of four groupings for state policies.&lt;ref name="Breton, 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drieger, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helly, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The state integration policies are not exclusive and permanent to a particular host country. The ideologies exist as a combination of the state policies and the surrounding public support that it is deemed were the basis of these policies. The state policies are usually not codified into constitutional form and are modified over time to reflect the changing circumstances and attitudes of both the people and the government. The following are described by Bourhis in the explanation of the IAM:

===Pluralist ideologies===

A construct based on the idea that the host nation expects immigrant populations to adhere and adopt host nation public values such as democracy and individual freedom but are free to maintain individual and native cultural values as long as they are within the wide confines and boundaries of host laws (native language use is OK but [[polygamy]] would not be acceptable). The policies adopted by the state would reflect a positive view of immigrants maintaining their diverse cultures and would support these differences not only socially but possibly financially. It is this last detail of financial support or government enactment of positive policy that differentiates this from a more civic ideology and state policy. Some Scandinavian countries as well as other western democracies have at times leaned this way to encourage cultural diversity and set acculturation as a state goal.

===Civic ideologies===

These policies would also maintain the premise that immigrants adopt host nation public values and that individual values are not to be dictated or regulated by the host government. But in [[civic ideologies]], there is no public financial support for these private values or for the continuation and flourishing of the particular culture. The cultural identities and values are allowed but not promoted by the host nation in a government policy of non-intervention. Many European countries and various Latin American countries espouse a civic ideology to some extent. These countries often witness flourishing immigrant populations that maintain a cultural identity and sometimes language.

===Assimilation ideology===

These are the set of beliefs and policies that support both the adoption of public values by the immigrant population but also of some private values of host nation dominant culture. We would expect these policies to dictate such aspects like a single language in the schools and encourage voluntary (sometimes mandatory) cultural integration at all levels to homogenize the expressions of the immigrant population with that of the host nation. This could not only be voluntary but encouraged or mandated and expected to happen over time. The US had essentially assimilation policies until the great influx of immigrants during the last half of the past century at which time the country has softened its attitudes and policies toward a more civic ideology. A variant to the assimilation ideology is the [[Republican ideology]] similar to that expressed in France as far back as the revolution that supposes a "[[universal man]]" that is able to suppress less desired, backward, cultural traits and require a "leveling out" in order to fully participate as an equal in the society.

===Ethnist ideology===

This is basically the idea that the state can mandate the whole of public and private values and make them a precondition to full [[citizenship]]. It occasionally is manifested in the mandatory taking of host country values as necessary by the immigrant populations or more often this ideology is expressed in a requirement to be part of an ethnicity, religion or race to be accepted as a citizen. Governments may enact blood relations requirement or parentage to conditions for citizenship. Witness countries like Switzerland, Israel and Japan where immigrants are not accepted as they lack the ethnic blood to become full members of the citizenry and can only be allowed a lesser status such as guest worker or second class citizen.

==Immigrant population attitudes==
The attitudes of immigrant populations that shape their acculturation and level of assimilation into the host society vary widely. One attitude in particular that has been explored is the concept of [[biculturalism]]. Under Gordon's (1964) proposal, he identifies a unidimensional model of acculturation that immigrant groups undergo over time as they strive to maintain equilibrium between their own culture/heritage against those of their adoptive host state. This equilibrium is essentially biculturalism, where the immigrant population retains features of their heritage culture while adopting key elements of the host’s culture. Biculturalism is transitory however,&lt;ref&gt;Goldlust, Richmond, 1974.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaFromboise, Coleman, &amp; Gerton, 19993.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over time, the immigrant population eventually assimilates into the culture of the host nation and becomes a "rightful member" of the majority, to fit into the existing social structure of the host society.&lt;ref&gt;Woldemikael, 1987. &lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

Critics of the unidimensional model cite the influx of technologically and culturally advanced European powers into less developed societies into the new world that in essence assimilated the host society. The unidimensional model fails to account for the fact that the host majority is also changed by the presence of culturally distinctive immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bidimensional model of acculturation===

Efforts to explain further acculturation and assimilation among immigrant populations led to the formulation of the Bidimensional model of acculturation. Under this model, more importance is placed in viewing the importance immigrant populations identify with the aspects of their own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 1980.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Berry’s model of acculturation, immigrant’s attitudes are described as being focused on two points; 1) "Is it considered to be of value to maintain cultural identity and characteristics?" and 2) "Is it considered to be of value to maintain relationships with other groups?"

Various studies among Portuguese, Hungarian, Korean, and Lebanese immigrant in Canada and Indian Immigrants in the US found that the majority of these groups desired "integration" versus marginalization.&lt;ref name="Bourhis 377"/&gt; Further results off the study would go on to show that these groups who desired integration suffered less from "acculturation stress" than others. According to Berry,&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 1990b&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fact that integration was the most widely preferred mode of acculturation in his studies suggests that pluralism [where a state expects immigrants will adopt the public values of the host country (democratic ideals and [[Penal code|criminal codes]]) but has mandate defining private value s] may constitute the ideology that best reflects the orientation of many [[first-generation immigrant]]s in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Bourhis 373.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|It is unclear which entry this is in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can thus be argued that immigrants desire to hold on to elements of their own culture but also assimilate aspects of their host culture, thus becoming "integrated" into their host society.

Lean LaunchPad is an [[entrepreneurship]] [[methodology]] created by [[Steve Blank]] to test and develop business models based on querying and learning from customers. It is based on the scientific method and combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful [[lean startup]]:  Alexander Osterwalder's "[[Business Model Canvas]]", [[Steve Blank]]'s "[[Customer Development]] Model, and [[Agile software development|Agile Engineering]].

Students of Lean LaunchPad propose and immediately test business hypotheses. They get out of the building to talk with prospective customers and partners, using this customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service; ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem; and validate that they have created a repeatable, scalable business model.

== Methodology ==

Lean LaunchPad pedagogy combines three elements: a [[Flipped Classroom]], [[Experiential learning]] and [[Team-based learning]]. During the course, students interview potential customers in order to validate or invalidate their hypotheses, as expressed in the Business Model Canvas. Students listen to recorded lectures and presentations before each class, and use class time to present what they learned from customer interviews the previous week. Students present their findings which creates the basis for discussion, critiques, and brain-storming by both professors and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=The Center for Teaching and Learning|first1=.|title=Team Teaching: Benefits and Challenges.|date=July 10, 2016|url=https://web.stanford.edu/dept/CTL/Newsletter/teamteaching.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As of 2016, the Lean LaunchPad is taught in more than 200 universities worldwide and more than 300,000 people have signed up for a free online version of the class{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}.

'''''Les Caquets de l'accouchée''''' is an anonymous French [[satire]] composed of several quires published in 1622. They were reunited in 1623 under the title « ''Recueil général des Caquets de l'Accouchée'' ».&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title refers to the custom, documented by the middle of the fifteenth, of Parisian bourgeoises to visit when one of them is layered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrator introduces himself as a convalescing [[History of Paris|Parisian]] to whom a doctor has prescribed to recuperate through entertainment and goes {{Interlanguage link multi|rue Quincampoix|fr}} to listen to gossip with her cousin who has just given birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=xv-xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Antoine Le Roux de Lincy]], this book, which details various aspects of Parisian life and specifically quotes the personalities of the time covering topics such as politics and religion can be "now classified as historical works, faithful echoes of prejudices and opinions of a period".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=xxxii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[graduate degree]] that  typically requires two to three years of [[postgraduate]] study after a [[bachelor's degree]], though the term of study varies by country or university. The MFA is a terminal degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/standards-and-guidelines/guidelines/mfa|title=CAA Guidelines -  Standards &amp; Guidelines -  CAA|first=College Art|last=Association|date=|website=www.collegeart.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105011817/http://www.collegeart.org/standards-and-guidelines/guidelines/mfa|archivedate=5 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coursework is primarily of an applied or performing nature with the program often culminating in a major work or [[performance]].

==Requirements==
Entry to an MFA program generally requires a [[bachelor's degree]] prior to admission, but many institutions do not require that an [[undergraduate]] major be exactly the same as the MFA field of study. The most important admissions requirement has often been a sample [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] of artworks or a performance [[audition]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Comparison with related degrees==
The Master of Fine Arts differs from the [[Master of Arts]] in that the MFA, while still an academic program, centers around professional artistic practice in the particular field, whereas programs leading to the MA usually center on the scholarly, academic, or critical study of the field. Additionally, in the United States, an MFA is typically recognized as a [[terminal degree]] for practitioners of visual art, design, dance, photography, theatre, film/video, new media, and creative writing—meaning that it is considered the highest degree in its field, and is the qualification to become a professor at the university level in these disciplines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="716">An '''Measured Environmental Concentration (MEC)''' relates to a chemical substance found in an environmental sample. The concentration of the compound may result from direct contamination, transformation and/or metabolization of a different chemical contaminant, natural origin or a combination of these sources. 

MEC is to be used as a reference in the context of [[Chemical Safety Assessment]]s (CSA) and should be compared with the respective [[Predicted Environmental Concentration]] (PEC) and  [[Predicted No-Effect Concentration]] (PNEC) in order to decide whether exposure model is valid and the compound related risk is controlled.

Most [[chemical element]]s that are [[ingestion|ingested]] by organisms are in the form of simple compounds. Plants absorb dissolved elements in soils, which are subsequently ingested by the [[herbivore]]s and [[omnivore]]s that eat them, and the elements move up the [[food chain]]. Larger organisms may also consume soil ([[geophagia]]) or use mineral resources, such as [[salt lick]]s, to obtain limited minerals unavailable through other dietary sources.

Bacteria and fungi play an essential role in the weathering of primary elements that results in the release of nutrients for their own nutrition and for the nutrition of other species in the ecological [[food chain]]. One element, [[cobalt]], is available for use by animals only after having been processed into complex molecules (e.g., [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]]) by bacteria. Minerals are used by animals and [[microorganisms]] for the process of mineralizing structures, called "[[biomineralization]]", used to construct bones, [[seashells]], [[eggshell]]s, [[exoskeleton]]s and [[mollusc shell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris, Ph.D.|first1=Edward D.|title=Minerals in Food Nutrition, Metabolism, Bioactivity (chapter 3.4)|date=1 January 2014|publisher=DEStech Publications, Inc.|location=Lancaster, PA|isbn=978-1-932078-97-8|page=378|edition=1st|url=http://www.destechpub.com/product/minerals-food-2/|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blood concentrations of minerals==

Minerals are present in a healthy human being's blood at certain mass and molar concentrations. The figure below presents the concentrations of each of the chemical elements discussed in this article, from center-right to the right. Depending on the concentrations, some are in upper part of the picture, while others are in the lower part. The figure includes the relative values of other constituents of blood such as hormones. In the figure, minerals are color highlighted in &lt;span style="background:#AB82FF;"&gt;purple&lt;/span&gt;.

{{Blood Values}}

==Dietary nutrition==
[[Dietitian]]s may recommend that minerals are best supplied by ingesting specific foods rich with the chemical element(s) of interest.  The elements may be naturally present in the food (e.g., calcium in dairy milk) or added to the food (e.g., orange juice [[Food fortification|fortified]] with calcium; [[iodised salt|iodized salt]] fortified with [[iodine]]).  [[Dietary supplement]]s can be formulated to contain several different chemical elements (as compounds), a combination of [[vitamin]]s and/or other chemical compounds, or a single element (as a compound or mixture of compounds), such as [[calcium]] ([[calcium carbonate]], [[calcium citrate]]) or [[magnesium]] ([[magnesium oxide]]), or iron (ferrous sulfate, iron bis-glycinate).

The dietary focus on chemical elements derives from an interest in supporting the [[chemical reaction|biochemical reaction]]s of [[metabolism]] with the required elemental components.&lt;ref name=lipp&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = University Science Books | isbn = 0-935702-72-5 | pages = 411 | last = Lippard | first = SJ | author2=Berg JM | title = Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | year=1994 | location=Mill Valley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate intake levels of certain chemical elements have been demonstrated to be required to maintain optimal health. Diet can meet all the body's chemical element requirements, although supplements can be used when some recommendations are not adequately met by the diet. An example would be a diet low in dairy products, and hence not meeting the recommendation for calcium.

==Elements considered possibly essential but not confirmed==
Many [[ultratrace element]]s have been suggested as essential, but such claims have usually not been confirmed.  Definitive evidence for efficacy comes from the characterization of a biomolecule containing the element with an identifiable and testable function.&lt;ref name=hnf2016a/&gt;  One problem with identifying efficacy is that some elements are innocuous at low concentrations and are pervasive (examples: silicon and nickel in solid and dust), so proof of efficacy is lacking because deficiencies are difficult to reproduce.&lt;ref name=lipp/&gt; [[Ultratrace element]]s of some minerals such as [[silicon]] and [[boron]] are known to have a role but the exact biochemical nature is unknown, and others such as [[arsenic]] are suspected to have a role in health, but with weaker evidence.&lt;ref name=hnf2016a/&gt;

{{Burmese characters}}
The '''Mingun Bell''' ({{lang-my-Mymr|မင်းကွန်းခေါင်းလောင်းတော်ကြီး}} {{IPA-my|mɪ́ɴɡʊ́ɴ kʰáʊɴláʊɴ dɔ̀ dʑí|}}) is a [[bell (instrument)|bell]] located in [[Mingun]], [[Sagaing Region]], [[Myanmar]]. It is located approximately {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Mandalay]] on the western bank of the [[Irrawaddy River]]. It was the heaviest functioning bell in the world at several times in history. 

==Description==
The weight of the bell is 55,555 [[Burmese units of measurement#Mass|viss]] ({{convert|90,718|kg|lb|0|disp=or}}). This number is conveniently remembered by many people in Myanmar as a mnemonic "''Min Hpyu Hman Hman Pyaw''" ({{lang-my-Mymr|မင်းဖြူမှန်မှန်ပြော}}), with the consonants representing the number 5 in Burmese astronomy and numerology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-museum/largest-ringing-bell.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909082625/http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-museum/largest-ringing-bell.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-09 |title=The Mingun Bell |publisher=Myanmar's Net Inc. |accessdate=2008-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-travel/myanmar-mandalay/mingun.htm|title=Mingun|publisher=Myanmar's Net Inc.|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of the bell and its mnemonic words are written on the surface of the bell in white.

The outer diameter of the rim of the bell is {{convert|16|ft|3|in|m|2}}. The height of the bell is {{convert|12.0|ft|m|2}} on the exterior and {{convert|11.5|ft|m|2}} in the interior. The outside circumference at the rim is {{convert|50.75|ft|m|3}}. The bell is {{convert|6|to(-)|12|in|cm|0}} thick and stands {{convert|20.7|ft|m|2}} high from the rim to the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/8-2001/min.htm|title=The Mingun Bell|publisher=Ni Ni Myint, (www.myanmar.gov.mm)|accessdate=2008-04-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706051545/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/8-2001/min.htm|archivedate=2008-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bell is uncracked and in good ringing condition. The bell does not have a clanger but is rung by striking the outer edge.&lt;ref name=bird/&gt;

==History==
{{multiple image|right|direction=vertical|image1=Mingun Bell 1873.jpg|width=200|image2=Mingun Bell 1896.jpg|footer=Mingun Bell in 1873 (top) and 1896}}
Casting of the bell started in 1808 and was finished by 1810. King [[Bodawpaya]] (r. 1782–1819) had this gigantic bell cast to go with his huge [[stupa]], [[Mingun Pahtodawgyi]]. The bell was said to have been cast on the opposite side of the river and was transported by using two boats, which after crossing the river, proceeded up two specially built canals. The canals were then dammed and the bell was lifted by raising the water level by the addition of earth into the blocked canal. In this way the bell was originally suspended.&lt;ref name=bird/&gt;

The Mingun Bell was knocked off its supports as a result of a large [[earthquake]] on 23 March 1839. It was resuspended by the [[Irrawaddy Flotilla Company]] in March 1896 using screw jacks and levers using funds from public subscription. The party to celebrate was attended by many and an hourly boat was required to take visitors from nearby [[Mandalay]].&lt;ref name=bird&gt;Bird, George W (1897). [http://dlxs.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=sea&amp;cc=sea&amp;idno=sea282&amp;node=sea282%3A29&amp;frm=frameset&amp;view=image&amp;seq=466''Wanderings in Burma''], pages 318–319. London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co., Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felice Beato]] captured a photograph of the bell prior to its resuspension.

==Current status==
At 90 tons, the Mingun Bell reigned as the largest ringing bell in the world until 2000, when it was eclipsed by the 116-ton [[Bell of Good Luck]] at the [[Foquan Temple]], [[Pingdingshan]], [[Henan]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kungfuhome.net/Htmls/Scenic/Scenic_308.shtml Fodushan Scenic Area]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and legal issues==
''[[The Guardian]]'' has described MMS as "extremely nasty stuff, and the medical advice given is that anyone who has this product should stop using it immediately and throw it away. In Canada it was banned after causing a life-threatening reaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Martin | last = Robbins | title = The man who encourages the sick and dying to drink industrial bleach | date = 2010-09-15 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/sep/15/miracle-mineral-solutions-mms-bleach | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, a Mexican woman travelling with her American husband on their yacht in [[Vanuatu]] took MMS as a preventative for malaria. Within 15 minutes she was ill, and within twelve hours she was dead. The island nation's public prosecutor, Kayleen Tavoa, did not press any charges as there were no specific laws banning the importation of MMS, but advised, "While every case is assessed on its own merits, I advise that any person who misuses MMS in Vanuatu in the future would be likely to face prosecution for potentially serious criminal offences. No person should ever give MMS to another person to drink without advising them of what it is they are drinking and of the serious risks to health that may arise if they decide to drink the mixture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Gibson |first= Joel |publication-date= January 9, 2010 |title= Death in paradise |newspaper= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issn= 0312-6315 |url= http://www.smh.com.au/national/death-in-paradise-20100108-lyxv.html |accessdate= February 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214180619/http://www.smh.com.au/national/death-in-paradise-20100108-lyxv.html |archivedate=December 14, 2013 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

When taken as directed it could cause severe [[nausea]], vomiting and [[diarrhea]], potentially leading to [[dehydration]] and [[hypotension|reduced blood pressure]]. If the solution is diluted less than instructed, it could cause damage to the gut and red blood cells, potentially resulting in [[respiratory failure]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Food Standards Agency has since reiterated their warning on MMS and extended it to include CDS.&lt;ref name="FSAcds" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/04/government-warning-internet-remedies|title=Bleach-based cure-all online remedies could kill, warns government|first=Rebecca|last=Smithers|date=4 July 2012|publisher=|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sellers attribute the vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea to the product working, but it is simply the product's toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://moh.gov.ms/?p=803 |title= Product Warning: Miracle Mineral Solution |publisher= Ministry of Health |location= Montserrat |accessdate= December 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, an alert was issued by the Belgian Poison Control Centre to the [[European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists]]. In response, an evaluation was performed by the French "Comité de coordination de toxicovigilance" in March 2010, warning about a dose dependent irritation and possible toxic effects. They also warned that patients affected by serious diseases could be tempted to stop their treatments in favour of this alternative treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

A similar notice was released in July 2010 by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] warning that the instructions for preparing the solution by mixing it with an acidic solution, or even orange juice, would produce [[chlorine dioxide]], "a potent bleach used for stripping textiles and industrial water treatment." Because of reports including nausea, vomiting, and dangerously [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] as a result of dehydration following instructed use, the FDA has advised consumers to dispose of the product immediately.&lt;ref name="fda.gov" /&gt;

MMS is not approved for the treatment of any disease and according to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], chronic exposure to small doses of chlorine dioxide could cause reproductive and neurodevelopmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Investigations==
In 2015, BBC London conducted an undercover investigation into MMS, with a reporter posing as a family member of a person with [[autism]].  The BBC reporter was sold two bottles containing [[sodium chlorite]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] by a self-styled "reverend" named Leon Edwards linked to the Genesis II Church in the United States.  Edwards told the reporter that the solutions would cure nearly all illnesses and conditions, including cancer, HIV, malaria, autism and Alzheimer's.  He recommended 27 drops per day for a baby.  Laboratory analysis later showed that the concentration of both bottled solutions was stronger than advertised.  Edwards told the reporter:

: "I put it in my eyes, my nose, my ears, bathe in it, drunk it, breathed it in my lungs. I got injected in my butt with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-33079776|title='Miracle autism cure' seller exposed by BBC investigation|date=11 June 2015|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyewitness News and ABC News investigated the MMS phenomenon in 2016, and uncovered an "underground network" centred around southern California which was promoting the substance as a cure for conditions including cancer, [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and childhood autism.&lt;ref name=ne&amp;ya&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/parents-making-children-drink-bleach-160057178.html|title=Parents Are Making Their Children Drink Bleach to 'Cure' Them of Autism|date=28 January 2018|publisher=Newsweek/Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in January 2018 that at least six police forces have investigated the use of MMS in the UK, where it continues to be available.  Spokespersons for the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the [[Food Standards Agency]] have repeatedly warned of the dangers of using such a product.&lt;ref name=ne&amp;ya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brit-kids-forced-drink-bleach-11924623|title=Desperate parents forcing kids to drink bleach as autistic children become victims of sick US cult|date=27 January 2018|publisher=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgments==
Former Chicagoan Kerri Rivera, who now resides in Mexico, was required by the [[Illinois Attorney General]] to sign a document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assurance of Voluntary Compliance - Kerri Rivera|url=http://media.nbcchicago.com/documents/Rivera+Fully+Executed+AVC.pdf|website=[[NBC Chicago]]|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that she would no longer promote the use of toxic chlorine dioxide, or "CD," in the state of Illinois. The agreement, which Rivera signed, says, "Respondent [Rivera] makes unsubstantiated health and medical claims regarding the use of chlorine dioxide in the treatment of autism. In truth and fact, Respondent lacks competent and reliable scientific evidence to support her claims that chlorine dioxide can treat autism. Respondent's act of promoting unsubstantiated health and medical claims regarding the use of chlorine dioxide in the treatment of autism constitutes a violation of Section 2 of the Consumer Fraud Act." The agreement continued to bar Rivera from speaking at seminars and selling chlorine dioxide or similar substances for the treatment of autism. However, Rivera operates a Facebook page&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kerri Rivera's CD Autism Group on Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/AutismCD|website=Facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CD Autism dot org|url=http://cdautism.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; that promote injecting autistic children with a toxic chlorine dioxide formula via enema, and claims that the intestinal lining and membranes children expel as a result are parasites, which is patently false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warning Against Chlorine Dioxide Use|url=https://www.autism.com/statement_mms|website=[[Autism Research Institute]]|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-Attorney General [[Lisa Madigan]] described the case by saying, "You have a situation where there are people, complete quacks, that are out there promoting a very dangerous chemical being given to young children... Ingesting what amounts to a toxic chemical - bleach - is not going to cure your child."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Takes Action Against "Miracle Treatment" for Children With Autism|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/investigations/illinois-attorney-general-lisa-madigan-miracle-mineral-solution-autism-309703521.html|website=NBC Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera advocates treating infants and toddlers, as well as older children, with chlorine dioxide enemas, requiring that children also drink the solution and bathe in it.

MMS was a cure touted by an Australian couple targeting the Seattle area.

A woman from the city of [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] in Australia, without qualifications to practice, charged up to [[Australian dollar|A$]]2,000 to inject patients with MMS in her garage which lacked proper facilities for sterilization, and went as far as advising a person to avoid chemotherapy while "dishonestly promoting its benefits with no scientific basis for her claims". The [[Queensland]] Office of Fair Trading handed down a court order prohibiting her from "making any claims she is able to treat, cure, or benefit any person suffering from cancer" and she was charged court costs of A$12,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publication-date= April 23, 2009 |title= Woman told to stop selling cancer 'miracle drug' |work= ABC News |publication-place= Australia |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-04-23/woman-told-to-stop-selling-cancer-miracle-drug/1660170 |accessdate= February 12, 2012 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

On May 28, 2015, a US federal jury found Louis Daniel Smith guilty of conspiracy, smuggling, selling misbranded drugs and defrauding the United States in relation to the sale of MMS. According to the evidence presented at trial, Smith created phony “water purification” and “wastewater treatment” businesses in order to obtain sodium chlorite and ship Miracle Mineral Supplement without being detected by the government &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seller of "Miracle Mineral Solution" Convicted for Marketing Toxic Chemical as a Miracle Cure|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seller-miracle-mineral-solution-convicted-marketing-toxic-chemical-miracle-cure|accessdate=30 May 2015|agency=[[United States Department of Justice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Despite Smith's sentence the Genesis II Church of Health &amp; Healing continue to promote the sale and use of MMS in many countries including the US. In a Washington Post article Floyd Jerred, a bishop in the Genesis II Church of Health &amp; Healing was quoted as saying of MMS “As long as I’m just telling you about it, it’s just education,” and of Smith's conviction “And if they do lock me up, I know how to do out-of-body travel.

'''Neuropsychiatry''' is a branch of [[medicine]] that deals with [[mental disorders]] attributable to diseases of the [[nervous system]]. It preceded the current disciplines of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]], which had common training,&lt;ref name=YH2002&gt;

Nevertheless, neuropsychiatry has become a growing subspecialty of [[psychiatry]] and it is also closely related to the fields of [[neuropsychology]] and [[behavioral neurology]].

Most of this work argues for a rapprochement of neurology and psychiatry, forming a specialty above and beyond a subspecialty of psychiatry. For example, Professor [[Joseph B. Martin]], former Dean of [[Harvard Medical School]] and a [[neurologist]] by training, has summarized the argument for reunion: "the separation of the two categories is arbitrary, often influenced by beliefs rather than proven scientific observations. And the fact that the brain and mind are one makes the separation artificial anyway."&lt;ref name="M2002"/&gt; These points and some of the other major arguments are detailed below.

===Mind/brain monism===
Neurologists have focused objectively on [[organic (model)|organic]] nervous system [[pathology]], especially of the [[brain]], whereas psychiatrists have laid claim to illnesses of the [[mind]]. This [[:wikt:antipodal|antipodal]] distinction between brain and mind as two different entities has characterized many of the differences between the two specialties. However, it has been argued that this division is fictional; evidence from the last century of research has shown that our mental life has its roots in the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=M2002/&gt; Brain and mind have been argued not to be discrete entities but just different ways of looking at the same system (Marr, 1982). It has been argued that embracing this mind/brain [[monism]] may be useful for several reasons. First, rejecting dualism implies that all mentation is biological, which provides a common research framework in which understanding and treatment of mental disorders can be advanced. Second, it mitigates widespread confusion about the legitimacy of mental illness by suggesting that all disorders should have a footprint in the brain.

In sum, a reason for the division between [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] was the distinction between mind or first-person experience and the brain. That this difference is taken to be artificial by proponents of mind/brain monism supports a merge between these specialties.

===Causal pluralism===
One of the reasons for the divide is that [[neurology]] traditionally looks at the causes of disorders from an "inside-the-skin" perspective ([[neuropathology]], [[genetics]]) whereas [[psychiatry]] looks at "outside-the-skin" [[Causality|causation]] (personal, interpersonal, cultural).&lt;ref name=K2005/&gt; This dichotomy is argued not to be instructive and authors have argued that it is better conceptualized as two ends of a causal continuum.&lt;ref name=K2005/&gt; The benefits of this position are: firstly, understanding of [[etiology]] will be enriched, in particular between [[brain]] and [[social environment|environment]]. One example is [[eating disorders]], which have been found to have some neuropathology (Uher and Treasure, 2005) but also show increased incidence in rural Fijian school girls after exposure to [[television]] (Becker, 2004). Another example is [[schizophrenia]], the risk for which may be considerably reduced in a healthy family environment (Tienari et al., 2004).

It is also argued that this augmented understanding of etiology will lead to better remediation and rehabilitation strategies through an understanding of the different levels in the causal process where one can intervene. It may be that non-organic interventions, like [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), better attenuate disorders alone or in conjunction with drugs. Linden's (2006) demonstration of how [[psychotherapy]] has neurobiological commonalities with [[pharmacotherapy]] is a pertinent example of this and is encouraging from a patient perspective as the potentiality for pernicious side effects is decreased while self-efficacy is increased.

In sum, the argument is that an understanding of the mental disorders must not only have a specific knowledge of brain constituents and genetics (inside-the-skin) but also the context (outside-the-skin) in which these parts operate (Koch and Laurent, 1999). Only by joining neurology and psychiatry, it is argued, can this nexus be used to reduce human suffering.

===Organic basis===
To further sketch psychiatry's history shows a departure from structural neuropathology, relying more upon [[ideology]] (Sabshin, 1990). A good example of this is [[Tourette syndrome]], which Ferenczi (1921), although never having seen a patient with Tourette syndrome, suggested was the symbolic expression of [[masturbation]] caused by sexual repression. However, starting with the efficacy of neuroleptic drugs in attenuating symptoms (Shapiro, Shapiro and Wayne, 1973) the syndrome has gained pathophysiological support (e.g. Singer, 1997) and is hypothesized to have a genetic basis too, based on its high inheritability (Robertson, 2000). This trend can be seen for many hitherto traditionally psychiatric disorders (see table) and is argued to support reuniting [[neurology]] and [[psychiatry]] because both are dealing with disorders of the same system.

===Improved patient care===
Further, it is argued that this nexus will allow a more refined [[nosology]] of mental illness to emerge thus helping to improve [[therapy|remediation]] and [[psychiatric rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] strategies beyond current ones that lump together ranges of symptoms. However, it cuts both ways: traditionally neurological disorders, like [[Parkinson's disease]], are being recognized for their high incidence of traditionally psychiatric symptoms, like [[psychosis]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]] (Lerner and Whitehouse, 2002). These symptoms, which are largely ignored in [[neurology]],&lt;ref name="YH2002"/&gt; can be addressed by neuropsychiatry and lead to improved patient care. In sum, it is argued that patients from both traditional psychiatry and neurology departments will see their care improved following a reuniting of the specialties.

===Better management model===
Schiffer et al. (2004) argue that there are good management and financial reasons for rapprochement.

==US institutions==
"Behavioral Neurology &amp; Neuropsychiatry" fellowships are accredited by the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties (UCNS; [http://www.ucns.org www.ucns.org]), in a manner analogous to the accreditation of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] residencies in the United States by the [[American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology]] (ABPN).

The [[American Neuropsychiatric Association]] (ANPA) was established in 1988 and is the American medical subspecialty society for neuropsychiatrists. ANPA holds an annual meeting and offers other forums for education and professional networking amongst subspecialists in behavioral neurology &amp; neuropsychiatry as well as clinicians, scientists, and educators in related fields. American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. publishes the peer-reviewed ''[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences]]'', which is the official journal of ANPA.

==International organizations==
The International Neuropsychiatric Association was established in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Neuropsychiatric Association|url=http://www.inawebsite.org/|website=Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; INA holds congresses biennially in countries around the world and partners with regional neuropsychiatric associations around the world to support regional neuropsychiatric conferences and to facilitate the development of neuropsychiatry in the countries/regions where those conferences are held. Prof. Robert  Haim Belmaker &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://haimbelmaker.co.il/en/|title=אתר הבית של פרופ' חיים בלמקר|website=haimbelmaker.co.il|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the current President of the organization whereas [[Ennapadam Srinivas Krishnamoorthy|Prof. Ennapadam S Krishnamoorthy]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neurokrish  - The Neuropsychiatry Center|url=http://neurokrish.com/founder-team/our-founder/}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as President-Elect with Dr. Gilberto Brofman as Secretary-Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Neuropsychiatric Association|url=http://www.inawebsite.org/#!committees-/ieaoy/|website=Committee Members }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British NeuroPsychiatry Association (BNPA) was founded in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/pbrcpsych/12/5/174.2.full.pdf|title=Bulletin Of The Royal College Of Psychiatrists|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the leading academic and professional body for medical practitioners and professionals allied to medicine in the UK working at the interface of the clinical and cognitive neurosciences and psychiatry.

Recently, a new non-profit professional society named [[Neuropsychiatric Forum|Neuropsychiatric Forum (NPF)]] was founded. NPF aims to support effective communication and interdisciplinary collaboration, develop education schemes and research projects, organize neuropsychiatric conferences and seminars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6346">Paraheliotropism refers to the phenomenon in which plants orient their leaves parallel to incoming rays of light, usually as a means of minimizing excess light absorption. Excess light absorption can cause a variety of physiological problems for plants, including overheating, dehydration, loss of [[Turgor pressure|turgor]], [[photoinhibition]], [[Reactive oxygen species|photo-oxidation]], and [[photorespiration]], so paraheliotropism can be viewed as an advantageous behavior in high light environments.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lambers, H., Chapin, F. S., &amp; Pons, T. L. (2008). ''Plant Physiological Ecology'' (2nd ed.). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all plants exhibit this behavior, but it has developed in multiple lineages (e.g., both [[Styrax|Styrax camporum]] and ''[[Phaseolus vulgaris]]'' exhibit paraheliotropic movement).&lt;ref&gt;Satter, R.L., Schrempf, M., Chaudhri, J. and Galston, A.W. (1977).  Phytochrome and circadian clocks in Samanea. Rhythmic redistribution of potassium and chloride within the pulvinus during long dark periods.

''Plant Cell Physiol''. 20: 1621–1634.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological basis ==
While all mechanistic aspects of this behavior have yet to be elucidated (e.g., evidence indicates differential [[gene expression]] is involved, but the specifics have yet to be determined), many of the physiological aspects of paraheliotropic movement, at least in ''[[Phaseolus vulgaris]]'' (the common bean), are well understood.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Iino, M., Long, C., and Wang, X. (2001). Auxin- and Abscisic Acid-Dependent Osmoregulation in Protoplasts of ''Phasoleus vulgaris'' Pulvini. ''Plant Cell Physiol''. 42 (11). &lt;/ref&gt; In this plant, daily leaf movements are influenced by two main factors: an [[endogenous]] [[Circadian Oscillator|circadian oscillator]] and light-induced signals.&lt;ref&gt;Satter, R.L., Guggino, S.E., Lonergan, T.A. and Galston, A.W. (1981) The effects of blue and far red light on rhythmic leaflet movements in Samanea and Albizzia. ''Plant Physiol''. 67: 965–968.&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, the movement is carried out by turgor-dependent changes in the volume of cortical [[parenchyma]] cells (called motor cells) in a turgor-sensitive part of the plant called the [[pulvinus]], located at the juncture of the leaf base and the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mayer, E.-W., Flach, D., Raju, M.V.S., Starrach, N. and Wiech, E. (1985) Mechanics of circadian pulvini movements in Phaseolus coccineus L. ''Planta'' 163: 381–390.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Koller, D. and Ritter, S. (1994) Phototropic responses of the pulvinules and associated laminar reorientation in the trifoliate leaf of bean Phaseolus vulgaris (Fabaceae). J. ''Plant Physiol''. 143: 52–63.&lt;/ref&gt; The cumulative effect of volume-changes in these motor cells manifests itself on the tissue/organ level as a swelling or shrinking of one or both sides of the [[pulvinus]], which results in the reorientation of the adjacent leaf.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Potassium ion|Potassium]] and [[Chloride ion|chloride]] have been shown to be the major [[Osmolyte|osmolytes]] involved in the process, and plasma membrane-located [[Proton pump|proton pumps]] and [[Ion transporter|ion transporters]] have been shown to play a critical role in creating [[osmotic potential]].&lt;ref&gt;Suh, S., Moran, N. and Lee, Y. (2000) Blue light activates potassium-efflux channels in flexor cells from Samanea saman motor organs via two mechanisms. ''Plant Physiol.'' 123: 833–843.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moshelion, M. and Moran, N. (2000) Potassium-efflux channels in extensor and flexor cells of the motor organ of Samanea saman are not identical. Effects of cytosolic calcium. ''Plant Physiol''. 124: 911–919.&lt;/ref&gt; The hormones [[Auxin|IAA]] and [[Abscisic acid|ABA]] are also involved in the process and play antagonistic roles, with IAA inducing pulvinar swelling and ABA inducing pulvinar shrinking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Blue light has also been shown to induce rapid pulvinar shrinking.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, X., Haga, K., Nishizaki, Y. and Iino, M. (2001) Blue-light-dependent osmoregulation in protoplasts of Phaseolus vulgaris pulvini. ''Plant Cell Physiol''. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

== As an adaptive behavior ==
Plants require light to perform [[photosynthesis]], but receiving too much light can be just as damaging for a plant as receiving not enough light.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An excess of light leads to three main overarching physiological problems: a surplus of photochemical energy leads to the creation of [[Reactive oxygen species|Reactive Oxygen Species]], which are extremely damaging to numerous cellular structures; the temperature of the plant's cells becomes so high that proteins [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] and/or that [[enzyme kinetics]] are negatively impacted; and [[transpiration]] increases, resulting in losses of [[Turgor pressure|turgor]] and photochemical efficiency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Bielenberg, D.G., Miller, J.D., Berg, V.S. (2003). Paraheliotropism in two Phaseolus species: combined effects of photon flux density and pulvinus temperature, and consequences for leaf gas exchange. ''Environmental and Experimental Botany.'' 49, 95-105.&lt;/ref&gt; Paraheliotropic movement can help a plant avoid these problems by limiting the amount of light that is actually absorbed by the plant; when leaves are positioned parallel to incoming light, they intercept just a small fraction of the photons that they would intercept if they were positioned perpendicular to the incoming light.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; So in essence, paraheliotropic plants avoid the physiological consequences of excess light by simply avoiding light. In 2003, Bielenberg et al. used two [[Phaseolus]] species, a [[quantum sensor]], a [[LI-COR Biosciences|light meter]], a [[Thermocouple|thermocouple meter]], and an [[inclinometer]] to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach: leaves that displayed paraheliotropic behavior experienced lower photon flux densities (light intensity), lower temperatures, and higher [[Water-use efficiency|Water Use Efficiencies]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Petros Vassiliadis started his academic career by serving as an assistant to the late professor Savvas Agouridis (1974-1977) at the Theological School of the [[University of Athens]], where he submitted his doctoral dissertation entitled ''On the Hypothesis of the Q-Document. A Critical Consideration of Current Literary and Theological Problems of the Q-Document'' (1977).

He then moved to his home town, [[Thessaloniki]], where he was elected lecturer in 1982, assistant professor in 1983, associate professor in 1985, and full professor in 1989, at the Department of Theology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. There he taught for almost 35 years New Testament and [[Interfaith dialogue]], being also assigned for some time the courses of Missiology, Liturgics and Ecumenical Dialogue. He also taught as a visiting professor at various institutions, universities and colleges of USA (St. Vladimir's, St. Athanasius, Smith College, Lynchburg),  of  Europe  (Bossey,  Bologna Bari, Ravenna, Copenhagen, Lund, Oslo, Joensuu, Reykiavik), and Asia (South Korea).

He was for many years the departmental coordinator of the Erasmus/Socrates program of inter-university cooperation of the [[European Union]]. From 1986 he is co-editor of the Greek biblical series “Hermeneia of the New Testament” (ΕΚΔ) and “Bibliotheca Biblica” (ΒΒ), editor of the ecumenical series “Ecclesia-Koinonia-Oecumene” (ΕΚΟ), and of the CEMES series, editor-in-chief for East and South Europe of the “International Studies in Formative Christianity and Judaism” of the University of South Florida, and editor of the ''Great Orthodox Christian Encyclopedia'' (Μεγάλη Ορθόδοξη Χριστιανική Εγκυκλοπαίδεια, MOXE) in its early stages.

He also served as an Orthodox commissioner of CWME of the WCC (1998-2006), and chief organizer of the 14th World Mission Conference, officially hosted on his recommendation by the [[Church of Greece]] in Athens (2005), for the first time in an Orthodox  setting. He was coordinator of the Biblical Studies  in the 12th World Mission Conference in San Antonio, Texas of USA (1989), and the 8th General Assembly in Harare, Zimbabwe (1998). In addition, he served in various Synodical Committees of the Church of Greece (of Liturgical Renewal, and of Inter-Orthodox and Inter-Christian Relations), consultant of the [[United Bible Societies]] for the improvement of the relations with the Orthodox Churches and the presentation of the Orthodox understanding of the Bible to the global family of the Bible Societies, institutional coordinator of the Forum Mediterraneum, dealing with issues pertinent to faith,  history  of religions, and  cultural anthropological research on the three monotheistic religions of the Mediterranean sea, and member of the editorial committee of the Orthodox biblical journal ''Δελτίο Βιβλικών Μελετών'' (Bulletin of Biblical Studies) of the “[http://www.artoszois.gr/ Artos Zoes]” foundation, and of the Regnum Edinburgh 2010 Mission Series of the Oxford Center of Mission Studies.

He is Honorary President of the WOCATI, a founding member, secretary, and vice-president of the Society for Ecumenical Studies and Inter-Orthodox Relations (SESIOR), founding member, first secretary, and now president of the CEMES, member of the Q International Project of the Society of Biblical Literature, as well as of the ''[[Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas]]'' (SNTS), and among the coordinators of the regular conferences of Eastern and Western N.T. Scholars. He was one of the main contributors of the Inter-Christian Symposia of the Department of Theology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the [[Pontifical University Antonianum]] of Rome, and a close friend of the ecumenical monastic community of Bose in Italy.

He was awarded with the highest honour of the municipality of [[Neapoli, Thessaloniki|Neapoli]], Thessaloniki, for his contribution to the religious and cultural development of his home town, and also from the municipality of [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]] for his overall scientific contribution. Together with his colleagues, professors S. Agouridis, G. Galitis, J. Karavidopoulos, B. Stoyannos and J. Galanis, he translated [[Bible translations into Greek|the New Testament into Modern Greek]] (1977-1989). He published, edited in Greek and English nearly 20 books, and 300 articles in scientific journals, conference proceedings, and collective volumes, as well as in the conventional and electronic press. He supervised more than 17 master and 10 doctoral dissertations (promoting, in addition to the traditional, the sociological, feminist and other contemporary exegetical methods of biblical analysis), but also of missiological, ecumenical and liturgical character. He also participated in radio and television discussions, and gave numerous interviews on a variety of themes. He participated in more than 100 international conferences.

==His contribution to the Biblical studies==
In the field of biblical literature his scholarly speciality was mainly the Sayings of the Historical Jesus, the Q-Document,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. his doctoral dissertation, ''Η περί της Πηγής των Λογίων θεωρία'', Αθήνα 1977; ''LOGOI IESOU. Studies in Q'', Atlanta 1999; ''Τα Λόγια του Ιησού. Το αρχαιότερο ευαγγέλιο'', Athens 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; the  Pauline theology,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Σταυρός και Σωτηρία'', Thessaloniki 1983; ''Χάρις- Κοινωνία-Διακονία. Ο κοινωνικός χαρακτήρας του παύλειου προγράμματος της λογείας'', Thessaloniki 1985; ''Παύλος: Τομές στη θεολογία του Α΄'', Thessaloniki 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and the theology of Liturgy and [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;''Βιβλικές Ερμηνευτικές Μελέτες'', Thessaloniki 1987; Επίκαιρα Αγιογραφικά Θέματα. Αγία Γραφή και Ευχαριστία, Thessaloniki 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ηis contribution to the Synoptic (Q) scholarship was mainly his widely accepted and used procedural principles for the reconstruction of the Q-Document&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "The Nature and Extent of the Q-Document", ''Novum Testamentum'' 20 (1978) 49-73.&lt;/ref&gt; and the consequences of the [[Q source|Q Hypothesis]], not so much as a solution to the Synoptic Problem, but as a change of the conventional picture of Christian origins. With regard to the Pauline collection project, on the basis of a thorough examination of 2 Corinthians 8-9, he is among those specialized scholars who support the social character of this ancient radical institution of Christianity, the main purpose of which was the ideal of “equal distribution and permanent sharing of the material wealth.” As to the Pauline (and general New Testament) Theology his recommendation is a combination of historical and thematic approach of this discipline, with a parallel recognition and use of such semi- and extra-canonical texts and traditions, as [[Q source|Q]] and the [[Gospel of Thomas]] among others, suggesting what he calls a “Eucharistic Paradigm”.

==His theological contribution==
Although his primary scholarly profession is biblical, he has deliberately chosen to engage with the wider theological scholarship. With the decline of the word of God, the Gospel and the overall biblical foundation of the Orthodox theology, mainly as a result of the predominance of the institutional expression of the Church at the expense of her charismatic character, he attempted in many of his works a creative encounter between the later development of the ecclesiastical tradition and the modern theological problematic with the foundational biblical tradition. Realizing the fragmentation of contemporary theological scholarship, and wishing to overcome it, he extended his scholarly and practical engagement to other areas, such as ecumenical movement and theology, missiology, liturgical theology, and world theological education.

Among his characteristic theological propositions is the priority of the eschatological experience of the early Christian community over against its literary products (texts, Bible etc.), although from the time of St. Paul there has been a shift of the center of gravity from the (Eucharistic) experience to the (Christian) message, from eschatology to Christology (and further and consequently to soteriology), from the event (the Kingdom of God), to the bearer and center of this event (Christ, and more precisely his sacrifice on the cross). This basic theological positions of his, i.e. the priority of the horizontal (ecclesiological and eschatological) perspective, both in the N.T. and in the early Church, as well as in later Christian literature, with the vertical soteriological (Pauline?) teaching placed always within the framework of the horizontal eschatological as complementary, has determined his extra-biblical theological activity and research.

Basing his theological endeavour on the foundational, yet marginalized, incarnational Christian doctrine, and maintaining the overcoming the traditional patristic “exclusivity” of modern Orthodox theology, and in addition promoting the necessity of the biblical foundation of the Eucharistic ecclesiology, he adamantly promotes – following the legacy of his Doctor Vater, the late Savvas Agouridis – the Prophetic theology, above and beyond the contemporary classical “theologies”, which dominated his country since the decade of the ‘60s, i.e. the Eucharistic and the therapeutic.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. “[https://www.academia.edu/5016830/%CE%95%CE%99%CE%A3_%CE%9C%CE%95%CE%A4%CE%A1%CE%9F%CE%9D_%CE%97%CE%9B%CE%99%CE%9A%CE%99%CE%91%CE%A3_%CE%A4%CE%9F%CE%A5_%CE%A0%CE%9B%CE%97%CE%A1%CE%A9%CE%9C%CE%91%CE%A4%CE%9F%CE%A3_%CE%A4%CE%9F%CE%A5_%CE%A7%CE%A1%CE%99%CE%A3%CE%A4%CE%9F%CE%A5_%CE%95%CE%A6_4_17_._To_%CE%B2%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C_%CF%85%CF%80%CF%8C%CE%B2%CE%B1%CE%B8%CF%81%CE%BF_%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82_%CF%87%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%CF%82_%CF%80%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%82 ‘Εις μέτρον ηλικίας του πληρώματος του Χριστού’ (Εφ 4:17). To βιβλικό υπόβαθρο της χριστιανικής πνευματικότητας],” and “[https://www.academia.edu/7652645/%CE%A0%CF%84%CF%85%CF%87%CE%AD%CF%82_%CF%83%CF%8D%CE%B3%CF%87%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82_%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%84%CF%85%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1%CF%82_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85._%CE%A4%CE%BF_%CE%BD%CE%AD%CE%BF_%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B4%CF%85%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%BF_%CE%B2%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C_%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B3%CE%BC%CE%B1_ Πτυχές σύγχρονης μαρτυρίας του ευαγγελίου: Το νέο αναδυόμενο βιβλικό ‘παράδειγμα’],” ''Θεολογία'' 58:2 (2014) 63-78.&lt;/ref&gt; In quite a number of his works he opined that the relegation of the biblical word has inevitably resulted in limiting contemporary theology in dilemmas of the type: therapeutic or Eucharistic theology, gerontes/starets or bishop, theosis or sacraments etc. Following the general line of Metropolitan of Pergamon, John (Zizioulas’) Eucharistic  ecclesiology  for  the  necessity  of  the  “primacy”  on  a theological and not just historical basis, he also brought into the fore for reconsideration the views expressed by the pioneer in the field [[Nicholas Afanasiev]],&lt;ref&gt;«Συνοδικότητα και πρωτείο στην Καινή Διαθήκη. Η παύλεια ‘περιεκτική’ ευχαριστιακή  θεολογία  αίτιο  και  προϋπόθεση  της  συνοδικότητας», ''Θεολογία'' 80 (2009) vol. 2, 43-66)&lt;/ref&gt; underlining Pneumatological (in addition to the Christological) and the Missiological (beyond the Eucharistic) dimension of the Church, thus coming closer to the theological views supported by the [[Anastasios of Albania|Archbishop Anastasios (Yannoulatos) of Tirana, Durrës and All Albania]].

==His missiological contribution==
Based on this position and relying on the biblical data he suggested a reconsideration of the Orthodox position on ''intercommunio'' and of the exclusivistic character of the Eucharist,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. «Η Ευχαριστία ως στοιχείο περιεκτικότητας και ενότητας στην εκκλησιολογία της Καινής Διαθήκης», ''ΔΒΜ'' 24 (2006) 77-105; “The Missionary Implications  of  St. Paul’s  Eucharistic  Inclusiveness,” ''The  Relevance  of  Rev.  Ion Bria’s Work for Contemporary Society and the Life of the Church'', Sibiu 2010, 123-128; and “St. Paul: Apostle of Freedom in Christ,” ''In the Footsteps of Saint Paul. An Academic Symposium'', HC Orthodox Press Boston 2011, 153-167)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of the Orthodox position on [[Christian anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. «Ο ιερός Αυγουστίνος ως ερμηνευτής του αποστόλου Παύλου και το πρόβλημα της ανθρώπινης σεξουαλικότητας», ''Θεολογία'' 81 (2010) vol. 3, 129-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-80s he promotes a new “paradigm” of Christian witness (mission) in the  post-modern  era,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. his  studies ''Η  Ορθοδοξία  στο  Σταυροδρόμι'', Thessaloniki 1992; ''Μετανεωτερικότητα και Εκκλησία. Η πρόκληση της Ορθοδοξίας'', Athens 2002; ''Ενότητα και Μαρτυρία: Ορθόδοξη Χριστιανική Μαρτυρία και Διαθρησκειακός Διάλογος-Εγχειρίδιο Ιεραποστολής'', Thessaloniki 2007; and he edited ''Orthodox Perspectives on Mission'', Regnum, Oxford 2013, and ''Ορθόδοξη προσέγγιση για μια θεολογία των θρησκειών'', CEMES, Thessaloniki 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; being at the same time systematically engaged with the Orthodox understanding of the ecumenical theology,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. “Η Ορθόδοξη Εκκλησία και η αναζήτηση της ορατής ενότητος”, ''Ορθοδοξία και η των πάντων ενότης'', [ed. by the H.M. of Koutloumousi], Mount Athos 1997, 139-152; and “L’ eschatologie dans la vie de l’ Églige: Une perspective chrétien orthodoxe et son impact sur la vie de la société,” ''Irénikon'' 73 (2000) 316-334.&lt;/ref&gt; underlining the Christian witness as the real Liturgy after the liturgy and insisting on the necessity of the inter-Christian and inter-faith dialogue,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Petros Vassiliadis (ed.), ''Orthodox Perspectives on Mission'', Regnum, Oxford 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially the biblical and liturgical renewal.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Eucharist and Witness. Orthodox Perspectives on the Unity and Mission of the Church'', Geneva/Boston 1998; ''Lex Orandi: Λειτουργική Θεολογία και Λειτουργική Αναγέννηση'', Athens  2005; and “Ο  λόγος  του  Θεού  στη  σύγχρονη Ορθόδοξη θεολογία και η βιβλική αναγέννηση στην ελληνική πραγματικότητα”, ''ΔΒΜ'' 9/Β (2011) 9-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last decade (since 2006, as a member of the WCC program on Poverty-Wealth-Ecology [PWE]) he is specialized and practically engaged in the alternative (to the neo-liberal economic globalization) Christian proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. his scholarly contributions in the special editions on the world economy of the Greek Orthodox scientific journals ''ΔΒΜ'' [2011)] and ''Θεολογία'' [2013], with the title “Αγία Γραφή και Παγκόσμια  Οικονομία”  and  “Θεολογία  και  Οικονομία”,  respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;  His engagement with the interfaith dialogue, and his position for an encounter between Christianity and modernity (and post-modernity) made him aware of the need of a legally established and internationally binding Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities, along with the Human Rights. He suggested that the interfaith dialogue and cooperation are necessary in the areas, where the “modern paradigm” failed to succeed, i.e. in the spiritual and material welfare of the people, the degradation in social and moral values, in the inability of our world order to enforce a lasting just peace on earth, and especially in its unwillingness to preserve the natural environment, and its surrender to the rules of the dominant world economic system.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. “[https://www.academia.edu/2952054/THE_RESPONSIBILITY_OF_WORLD_RELIGIONS_FOR_ECOLOGY_THE_WORLD_ECONOMIC_SYSTEM_AND_THE_INTERNATIONAL_LAW The  Responsibility  of  World  Religions  for  Ecology,  the  World  Economic System, and the International Law],” and “[https://www.academia.edu/7045360/SPIRITUALITY_AND_POLITICS_The_Importance_of_Religion_for_the_Re-integration_of_Europe Spirituality and Politics: The Importance of Religion for the Re-integration of Europe].”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to theological education==
In 2002, after more than a decade in WOCATI, having also served as member of the executive  committee, he  was elected WOCATI's president (2002–2008), and for his contribution he was awarded for life the title of its honorary president. His scholarly contribution on the world ecumenical theological education is specified in combining the new challenges with the traditional Christian presuppositions.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "The Importance of the Ecumenical Vision for Theological Education and Ecumenical Formation. Response," J. Pobee (ed.), ''Towards Viable  Theological Education. Ecumenical Imperative, Catalyst of Renewal'', WCC Publications: Geneva, 66-72; Petros Vassiliadis (ed.), ''Challenging Traditional Theological Education. 20 Years of WOCATI'', Neapolis 2008; and “Theological Education in the Orthodox World”, ''Handbook of Theological Education in World Christianity. Theological Perspectives-Regional  Surveys-Ecumenical Trends'', Oxford 2010, 603–610.&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of his international experience and the nearly 40&amp;nbsp;years academic service in Greece he is one of the contributors to the revision of the religious course in the public secondary education (Lyceum) of his country, and a fervent supporter of the constitutional changes in Greek public higher education, and a member of the Association of Professors of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.&lt;ref&gt;Official website at [http://syndesmosauth.gr syndesmosauth.gr].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12212">The '''phantom time hypothesis''' is a historical [[conspiracy theory]] asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, it hypothesizes a conspiracy by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III]], [[Pope Sylvester II]], and possibly the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]], to fabricate the [[Anno Domini]] dating system retrospectively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Ulrich Niemitz, [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/Niemitz-1997.pdf ''Did the Early Middle Ages Really Exist?''] pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.&lt;ref name="fomenko1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly | year = 2007 | publisher = Mithec | isbn = 2-913621-07-4 | title = History: Chronology 1: Second Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this scenario, the entire [[Carolingian period]], including the figure of [[Charlemagne]], is a fabrication, with a "phantom time" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The proposal has been universally rejected by mainstream historians.

== Heribert Illig ==
Illig was born in 1947 in [[Vohenstrauß]], [[Bavaria]].
He was active in an association dedicated to [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], [[catastrophism]] and [[historical revisionism]],
''Gesellschaft zur Rekonstruktion der Menschheits- und Naturgeschichte''.
From 1989 to 1994 he acted as editor of the journal ''Vorzeit-Frühzeit-Gegenwart''.
Since 1995, he has worked as a publisher and author under his own publishing company, ''Mantis-Verlag'', and publishing his own journal, ''Zeitensprünge''.
Outside of his publications related to revised chronology, he has edited the works of [[Egon Friedell]].

Before focusing on the early medieval period, Illig published various proposals for revised chronologies of prehistory and of Ancient Egypt.
His proposals received prominent coverage in German popular media in the 1990s. His 1996 ''Das erfundene Mittelalter'' also received scholarly recensions, but was universally rejected as fundamentally flawed by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Fried: ''Wissenschaft und Phantasie. Das Beispiel der Geschichte'', in: Historische Zeitschrift Band 263,2/1996, 291–316.
Matthias Grässlin, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 1. Oktober 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, the journal ''Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften'' offered a platform for critical discussion to Illig's proposal, with a number of historians commenting on its various aspects.&lt;ref&gt;EuS 1997 Heft 4.
Theo Kölzer (Bonn University) refused to contribute, and the journal printed his letter of refusal instead in which Kölzer criticizes the journal for lending credibility to Illig's "abstruse" idea.
A favourable review was published by sociologist Gunnar Heinsohn, which later led to a collaboration between Illig and Heinsohn until 2011, when Heinsohn left the board of editors of Illig's journal and published his rejection of Illig's core idea that the figure of Charlemagne is a high medieval fiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1997, there has been little scholarly reception of Illig's ideas, although they continued to be discussed as [[pseudohistory]] in German popular media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Borgolte]]. In: [[Der Tagesspiegel]] vom 29. Juni 1999. Stephan Matthiesen: ''[http://www.stephan-matthiesen.de/de/texte/archaeologie-geschichte/erfundenes-mittelalter-illig.html Erfundenes Mittelalter – fruchtlose These!]'', in: Skeptiker 2/2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Illig continued to publish on the "phantom time hypothesis" until at least 2013.
Also in 2013, he published on an unrelated topic of [[art history]], on [[German Renaissance]] master [[Anton Pilgram]], but again proposing revisions to conventional chronology, and arguing for the abolition of the art historical category of [[Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Anton, gen. Pilgram, oder Abschied vom Manierismus'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposal ==
The bases of Illig's hypothesis include:&lt;ref name="Illig 1"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Wer hat an der Uhr gedreht? |isbn=3-548-75064-8 | publisher = Econ Verlag | year = 2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illig 2"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Das erfundene Mittelalter |isbn=3-548-36429-2 | publisher = | year =
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scarcity of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence that can be reliably dated to the period AD 614–911, the perceived inadequacies of radiometric and [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] methods of dating this period, and the over-reliance of medieval historians on written sources.
* The presence of [[Romanesque architecture]] in tenth-century Western Europe, suggesting the Roman era was not as long ago as conventionally thought.
* The relation between the [[Julian calendar]], [[Gregorian calendar]] and the underlying astronomical [[tropical year|solar or tropical year]]. The Julian calendar, introduced by [[Julius Caesar]], was long known to introduce a discrepancy from the tropical year of around one day for each century that the calendar was in use. By the time the Gregorian calendar was introduced in AD 1582, Illig alleges that the old Julian calendar should have produced a discrepancy of thirteen days between it and the real (or tropical) calendar. Instead, the astronomers and mathematicians working for [[Pope Gregory XIII]] had found that the civil calendar needed to be adjusted by only ten days. (The Julian calendar day Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582). From this, Illig concludes that the [[Anno Domini|AD]] era had counted roughly three centuries which never existed.

== Criticism ==
* The most difficult challenge to the theory is through observations in [[Archaeoastronomy|ancient astronomy]], especially those of [[solar eclipse]]s cited by European sources prior to 600 AD (when phantom time would have distorted the chronology). Besides several others that are perhaps too vague to disprove the phantom time hypothesis, two in particular are dated with enough precision to disprove the hypothesis with a high degree of certainty. One is reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] in 59 AD&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder. [http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20II ''Natural History'' (Book II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm |date=2017-01-01 }}, accessed 14 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and one by [[Photius]] in 418 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Photius. [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/philostorgius.htm ''Epitome of the Church History of Philosturgius''], accessed 4 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these dates and times have confirmed [[Lists of solar eclipses|eclipses]]. In addition, observations during the [[Tang dynasty]] in China, and [[Halley's Comet]], for example, are consistent with current astronomy with no "phantom time" added.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|surname1=Dieter Herrmann|periodical=Beiträge zur Astronomiegeschichte&amp;nbsp;3|title=Nochmals: Gab es eine Phantomzeit in unserer Geschichte? |year=2000|at=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–14|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutch|first=Stephen|title=Is a Chunk of History Missing?|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/Phantom%20Time.HTM|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Archaeological remains and dating methods such as [[dendrochronology]] refute, rather than support, "phantom time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Amalie |last=Fößel |title=Karl der Fiktive? |work=[[Damals]], Magazin für Geschichte und Kultur |issue=8 |year=1999 |pages=20f }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Gregorian reform was never purported to bring the calendar in line with the Julian calendar as it had existed at the time of its institution in 45 BC, but as it had existed in 325, the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], which had established a method for [[Computus|determining the date]] of [[Easter Sunday]] by fixing the [[vernal equinox]] on March 21 in the Julian calendar. By 1582, the astronomical equinox was occurring on March 10 in the Julian calendar, but Easter was still being calculated from a nominal equinox on March 21. In 45 BC the astronomical vernal equinox took place around March 23. Illig's "three missing centuries" thus correspond to the 369 years between the institution of the Julian calendar in 45 BC, and the fixing of the Easter Date at the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Mütz: ''Die „Phantomzeit“ 614 bis 911 von Heribert Illig. Kalendertechnische und kalenderhistorische Einwände.'' In: ''Zeitschrift für Württembergische Landesgeschichte.'' Band 60, 2001, S. 11–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Carolingian dynasty]] were fabricated, there would have to be a corresponding fabrication of the history of the rest of Europe, including [[Anglo-Saxon England]], the [[History of the papacy|Papacy]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The "phantom time" period also encompasses the life of [[Muhammad]] and the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]] into the areas of the former Roman Empire, including the conquest of [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Iberia]]. This history too would have to be forged or drastically misdated. It would also have to be reconciled with the history of the [[Tang dynasty]] of China and its contact with Islam, such as at the [[Battle of Talas]].&lt;ref name="Dutch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=Did the Middle Ages Not Really Happen?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2992/did-the-middle-ages-not-really-happen|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1959">As the tip of a plant [[shoot]] grows, new leaves are produced at regular time intervals if temperature is held constant.

==Definitions==
The spatial pattern of the arrangement of leaves is called [[phyllotaxis|phyllotaxy]] whereas the time between successive leaf initiation events is called the plastochron and the rate of emergence from the [[Bud#Types_of_buds|apical bud]] is the [[phyllochron]].

==Plastochron ratio==
In 1951, F. J. Richards introduced the idea of the plastochron ratio and developed a system of equations to describe mathematically a centric representation using three parameters: plastochron ratio, divergence angle, and the angle of the cone tangential to the apex in the area being considered.&lt;ref&gt;FJ Richards, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London, Ser.

Emerging [[Petiole (botany)|phyllodes]] or leaf variants experience a sudden change from a high [[humidity]] environment to a more [[arid]] one. There are other changes they encounter such as variations in light level, [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]] and the gaseous content of the air.

{{Green economics sidebar}}

The '''pollution haven hypothesis''' posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this often comes at the cost of environmentally unsound practices. [[Developing country|Developing nations]] with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

==Three scales of the hypothesis==
#[[Pollution control]] costs have an impact at the margins, where they exert some effect on investment decisions and trade flows.
#Pollution control costs are important enough to measurably influence trade and investment.
#Countries set their environmental standards below socially-efficient levels in order to attract investment or to promote their exports.&lt;ref name="Four New Empirical Tests of the PHH"&gt;{{cite web|last=Millimet|first=Daniel|title=Four New Empirical Tests of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis When Environmental Regulation is Endogenous|url=http://econ.tulane.edu/seminars/Millimet.pdf|publisher=Tulane University|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scales 1 and 2 have empirical support, but the significance of the hypothesis relative to other investment and trade factors is still controversial.  One study found that environmental regulations have a strong negative effect on a country's [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]], particularly in pollution-intensive industries when measured by employment.  However, that same study found that the environmental regulations present in a country's neighbors have an insignificant impact on that country's trade flows.&lt;ref name="Four New Empirical Tests of the PHH" /&gt;

==Formula and variations==
:Yi = αRi + XiβI + εi

In the above formula, Y is economic activity, R is regulatory stringency, X is an aggregate of other characteristics that affect Y and ε is an [[error term]].&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; Theoretically, by changing your value of R, analysts will be able to calculate the expected effect on economic activity. According to the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, this equation shows that environmental regulations and economic activity are negatively correlated, because regulations raise the cost of key inputs to goods with pollution-intensive productions and reduce jurisdictions' comparative advantage in these goods. This lack of comparative advantage causes firms to move to countries with lower environmental standards, decreasing Y.

There is also an expanded formula, as shown below:

:Yit = vi + αRit + γTit + θRitTit + X’βit + εit

This expanded formula takes into account whether [[trade liberalization]] (i.e. the level of [[trade barrier]]s that exist in a country, labeled as T) increases the negative correlation between economic activity (Y) and regulatory stringency (R).  Some authors claim that trade barriers disproportionately effect the environment, and this equation attempts to quantify the interaction between trade barriers and regulatory stringency, and the corresponding effect with respect to output in an economy.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt;

== Connection with the environmental Kuznets curve ==
[[File:Environmntal Kuznets Curve.png|thumb|A simple recreation of the Environmental Kuznets Curve, made using Microsoft Excel.]]
{{see also|Kuznets curve}}

The '''environmental Kuznets curve''' (EKC) is a conceptual model that suggests that a country's pollution concentrations rise with development and industrialization up to a turning point, after which they fall again as the country uses its increased affluence to reduce pollution concentrations, suggesting that the cleaner environment in developed countries comes at the expense of a dirtier environment in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Exploring the Causality between the Pollution Haven Hypothesis and the Environmental Kuznets Curve"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ibara|first=Brian|title=Exploring the Causality between the Pollution Haven Hypothesis and the Environmental Kuznets Curve|url=http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/econ_honproj/21|work=Honors projects|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the EKC is potentially a reflection of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, because one of the factors that may drive the increase in [[environmental degradation]] seen in [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial economies]] is an [[global waste trade|influx of waste from post-industrial economies]].  This same transfer of polluting firms through trade and foreign investment could lead to the decrease in environmental degradation seen in downward-sloping section of the EKC, which models post-industrial (service) economies. This model holds true in cases of national development, but cannot necessarily be applied at a local scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography|last=Moseley, Perramond, Hapke, Laris|first=William G., Eric, Holly M., Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4051-8932-3|location=Oxford, UK|pages=179-180|quote=|via=Open edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real-world example==
Spent batteries that [[United States|Americans]] turn in to be recycled are increasingly being sent to [[Mexico]], where the lead inside them is extracted by crude methods that are illegal in the United States.  This increased export flow is a result of strict new [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] standards on lead pollution, which make domestic recycling more difficult and expensive in the United States, but do not prohibit companies from exporting the work and danger to countries where environmental standards are low and enforcement is lax.  In this sense, Mexico is becoming a pollution haven for the United States battery industry because Mexican environmental officials acknowledge that they lack the money, manpower, and technical capacity to police the flow.  According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2011, 20% of spent American vehicle and industrial batteries were being exported to Mexico, up from 6% in 2007, meaning that approximately 20 million batteries would cross the border that year.  A significant proportion of this flow was being smuggled in after being mislabeled as metal scrap.&lt;ref name="NY Times Lead Export Article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenthal|first=Elizabeth|title=Lead from Old US Batteries Sent to Mexico Raises Risks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/science/earth/recycled-battery-lead-puts-mexicans-in-danger.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=14 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E-waste dump site GDP per capita.png|thumb|Map of GDP PPP per-capita with known e-waste dump sites added in 2013.]]
The world map shown here illustrates how e-waste dump sites (or sites where citizens or multinational corporations of industrialized nations dump their used electronic devices) along with the [[Purchasing power parity|GDP PPP per-capita]] of those countries.&lt;ref name="e-waste dump locations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Where does e-waste end up?|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Used EEE &amp; E-Waste Import and E-Waste Generated in Kyoto Protocol Non-Annex I Countries.png|thumb|Shows an estimated amount of Used EEE and E-Waste imported into [[Kyoto Protocol]] Non-Annex 1 countries, with the E-Waste generated by each country's own domestic supplies.]] While GDP PPP per-capita is not a perfect indicator of economic development, and e-waste dump sites are only one small facet of what could be a greater pollution haven, this map does illustrate how e-waste dump sites are often located in poorer, relatively pre-industrial nations, which provides some rudimentary support for the Pollution Haven Hypothesis.

==Areas of controversy ==
The first area of controversy with respect to the Pollution Haven Theory has to do with the formulas above.  Finding an appropriate measure of regulatory stringency (R) is not simple, because we want to know how much more costly production is in a given jurisdiction relative to others due to that jurisdiction's environmental regulations.  The compliance costs stemming from these regulations, however, could come in the form of environmental taxes, regulatory delays, the threat or execution of lawsuits, product redesign, or emissions limits.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; This proliferation of cost styles makes R hard to quantify.

Another major critique of the second formula is that it is difficult to measure regulatory stringency and trade barriers because the two effects are likely endogenous, so few studies have attempted to estimate the indirect effect of trade liberalization on pollution havens.  Furthermore, governments at times engage in inefficient competition to actually attract polluting industries through weakening their environmental standards.  However, as per conventional economic theory, welfare-maximizing governments should set standards so that the benefits justify the costs at the margin.  This does not mean that environmental standards will be equal everywhere, as jurisdictions have different assimilative capacities, costs of abatement, and social attitudes regarding the environment, meaning heterogeneity in pollution standards is to be expected.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; By extension, this means that industry migration to less stringent jurisdictions may not raise [[efficiency]] concerns in an economic sense.

A final area of controversy is whether the Pollution Haven Hypothesis has empirical support.  For example, studies have found [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] evidence that countries with poor air quality do have higher net factor exports of coal, but the magnitude of the impact is small relative to other variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellogg|first=Ryan|title=The Pollution Haven Hypothesis: Significance and Insignificance|year=2006|publisher=Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, UC Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]], a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]–winning economist, is skeptical as to whether pollution havens have empirical support in economic theory, as he writes, "At this point it's hard to come up with major examples of industries in which the pollution haven phenomenon, to the extent that it occurs, leads to international negative externalities. This does not, however, say that such examples cannot arise in the future."&lt;ref name="International Economics Theory &amp; Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=International Economics Theory and Policy|year=2006|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=9780321451347}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scale 3 above has had empirical arguments made specifically against it, especially in the last 20 years.  Some economists argue that once higher environmental standards are introduced in a country, larger multinational firms present in the country are likely to push for enforcement so as to reduce the cost advantage of smaller local firms.  This effect would make countries with strict environmental standards a haven for the large companies often associated with higher levels of pollution, meaning the polluting agents may be smaller companies, rather than the larger MNCs as theorized by other proponents of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Where Are The Pollution Havens?"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birdsall|first=Nancy|author2=Wheeler, David|title=Trade Policy and Industrial Pollution in Latin America: Where Are the Pollution Havens?|journal=The Journal of Environment &amp; Development|date=January 1993|volume=2|issue=1|pages=137–149|doi=10.1177/107049659300200107|url=http://jed.sagepub.com/content/2/1/137.full.pdf+html|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8012">A '''procedural drama''' is a [[genre]] of [[television program]]ming which focuses on how crimes are solved or some other aspect of a law enforcement agency, legislative body, or court of law.  Some dramas include a lab or conference room with high-tech or state-of-the-art equipment where the main characters meet to work out the problem. Shows usually have an episodic format that does not require the viewer to have seen previous [[episode]]s. Episodes typically have a self-contained, also referred to as stand-alone, plot that is introduced and resolved within the same episode.
 
The procedural format is popular around the world.&lt;ref name="dl062711"&gt;{{cite news | first = Tim | last = Adler | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/why-tv-procedurals-also-rule-the-world/ | title = Why TV Procedurals Also Rule The World | date = June 27, 2011 | accessdate = June 27, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the director of a TV consultancy said, "The continuing trend is for procedurals because they use a predictable structure."&lt;ref name="dl062711"/&gt; Due to their stand-alone episodic nature, they are more accessible to new viewers than serials. Self-contained episodes also make it easier for viewers to return to a show if they have missed some episodes.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | author = Gerard Gilbert | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/american-law--british-order-1626849.html | title = American law...

Douglas|title=The Broadview Anthology of Restoration and Early Eighteenth-Century Drama|year=2001|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=9781551112701}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent she-tragedies include [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[The Orphan (play)|The Orphan]]'' (1680), [[John Banks (playwright)|John Banks]]' ''[[Virtue Betrayed, or, Anna Bullen]]'' (1682), [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''[[The Fatal Marriage]]'' (1694) and [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]'s ''[[The Fair Penitent]]'' (1703) and ''[[Lady Jane Grey (play)|Lady Jane Grey]]'' (1715). Rowe was the first to use the term "she-tragedy," in 1714.

== Overview ==
When English drama was reborn in 1660 with the re-opening of the theatres, the leading tragic style was the male-dominated [[heroic drama]] which celebrated powerful, aggressively [[masculinity|masculine]] heroes and their pursuit of glory, as rulers and conquerors as well as lovers. In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from [[heroic]] to [[pathos|pathetic]] tragedy, where the subject was love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might be public figures. After the phenomenal success of [[Elizabeth Barry]] in moving the audience to tears in the role of Monimia in Otway's ''The Orphan'', she-tragedy became the dominant form of pathetic tragedy and remained highly popular for nearly half a century.

The realm of pathetic tragedy became an exploration of the female experience as the private female sphere, that of the domestic, was put on the stage and publicized. The she-tragedies demonstrated the psychology and behavior of women in their private sphere and presented it for public consideration, a new concept that emerged as women began to star in main roles instead of only supporting characters. For the first time, plays were written that had a woman as the main character and that followed her experiences and emotions. She-tragedies brought what was once solely internal (emotions and thoughts) out for external display. The rise of pathetic tragedy commodified the female experience and women themselves with the transition from men (dressed as women) playing the female roles to women acting on the stage themselves. Actresses, while not unusual in Continental Europe, were just beginning to be accepted as a novelty by the predominantly male audience. The idea of the woman, occupier of the private sphere, as a public figure was bizarre. As a result, actresses often had a bad moral reputation as before the Restoration, public women were immoral women. However, royal sanction gave actresses more opportunities and opened the way for new dramatic possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe|first=Elizabeth|title='The First English Actresses: Women and Drama 1660&amp;ndash;1700'|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42210-9|pages=19, 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components of She-tragedy ==
She tragedies are known for having focused on the hardships of women rather than those suffered by men. A she-tragedy during the 1680s derived its power from the ability to create titillating scenes that portrayed the suffering of an innocent woman.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Deborahh Payne (2000). The Cambridge companion to English Restoration Theatre. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Pathetic tragedies would begin by presenting the heroine and establishing that she was desirable. Unlike the other popular new genre, horror, the she-tragedy did not depend on violence and gore to become the spectacle of the heroine but rather used the physical suffering that was inflicted on the blameless female victims.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women, who were the subject of the play, would usually become victims of adversity and crimes that sexually exploited them such as rape or unsolicited adultery. During the scenes of rape the woman would be abducted and carried off stage. The act of rape, or adultery, would be conveyed to the audience by screams from the woman as the villain completed the evil deed. After the scene the woman would return onstage. Evidences of ravished womanhood such as disheveled hair, disordered clothing, and phallic dagger were trademark of Restoration rape and prominent in she-tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Deborahh Payne (2000). The Cambridge companion to English Restoration Theatre. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Playwrights would utilize other ill fortune such as the loss of a husband or child and a single mother's struggle to raise her children as another means of causing hardship in the heroine's life. After suffering these hardships throughout the play the female protagonist would be overcome by madness, commit suicide or murder as a result of the burden with which she had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Susan J. (2001). A Companion to Restoration Drama. Blackwell Publishers. {{ISBN|0-631-21923-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of a she-tragedy was dependent upon the emotion that the actress conveyed to the audience, but the emotion that the audience felt as they watched the performance. She-tragedy also focused on making the heroine and not the hero the focus of the play. Attention would be placed on the female actress and her sexuality as playwrights used specific dialogue and devices to focus on the sexuality of the woman. One example of this is seen in The Orphan by Otway. In a scene Monimia is accompanied by a page who states to her 
"''Madam, Indeed I'd serve you with my soul;
But n the morning when you call me to you
As by your bed I stand and tell you stories,
I am asham'd to see your swelling Breasts, 
It makes me blush, they are so very white''." (1.221-25)
Here Otway is directing the audience's eyes to the actress' breasts, making her the focal point, and also sexualizing the actress and the character of Monima.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in Political Propaganda ==
While she-tragedies were highly entertaining to the public, playwrights would also use them to voice political opinions. In Rowe's ''Jane Grey'' the character Jane represents a symbol of virtue whose desires are second to the political good. During the 1690s the rape in she-tragedies leaned towards Whig beliefs and became a symbol for the justification for displacing proper rule.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacle of rape within the tragedy was used to convey the belief that the sexual assault on the female victim was a visual representation of assault on the subjects' liberties.

== Actresses and Royal Support ==
One reason that the Carolinian court was more accepting of the addition of women to the world of theater was the experience of the new monarch, Charles II, before he ascended to the throne.  As part of the English Civil War, the previous monarch, Charles II's father Charles I, was executed, sending his sons into exile. Charles II spent much of his exile abroad in France, living as part of the French court and learning French tastes and manners. Although practically unheard of in England, it was not uncommon for women to take part in French and Italian theater, which Charles II would have been exposed to. As a result, when he returned to England, Charles II did not have the same qualms as his countrymen when it came to the more public presence of women.

In addition, in 1662, a law was passed that women's roles were to be played by women and no longer by men. It is speculated that this change was at least partially due to the influence of the Puritans, who "took offence" &lt;ref&gt;The First English Actresses: Women and Drama, 1660-1700&lt;/ref&gt; at men cross-dressing to play women, something that goes against a verse from Deuteronomy in the Old Testament. Ironically, this attempt to reclaim morality in theater led to further scandals as the practice of "breeches roles" developed. These were roles played by woman while wearing men's clothing, either as part of a disguise required by the script or to give the actresses more license to behave as society allowed men to. These roles, while part of elaborate  plot, were sometimes used to exploit the physical aspects of women as men's clothing did not disguise the body's form as much as the dresses traditionally worn by women.

== Women In Tragedy ==
The new focus on women in tragedy may be linked with a growing political disillusion with the old [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] ideology and its traditional masculine ideals (see Staves). Other possible explanations for the great interest in she-tragedy are the popularity of [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], who often ruled alone in the 1690s while her husband [[William III of England|William III]] was on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], and the publication of ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', the first periodical aimed at women. Elizabeth Howe has argued that the most important explanation for the shift in taste was the emergence of tragic actresses whose popularity made it unavoidable for dramatists to create major roles for them. With the conjunction of the playwright "master of pathos" Thomas Otway and the great tragedienne Elizabeth Barry in ''The Orphan'', the focus shifted decisively from hero to heroine.

Most of the nation's political elite graduated from the school.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==History==

The School of Political Science was founded in 1899 by [[Hassan Pirnia]]. It was run by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. It later merged with the School of Law (''Madreseh-ye alee-e hoquq''), which had been established in 1918, to form the Faculty of Law and Political Science of the [[University of Tehran]] in 1933.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24871">'''Trajectory optimization''' is the process of designing a [[trajectory]] that [[Mathematical optimization|minimizes]] (or maximizes) some measure of performance while satisfying a set of constraints. Generally speaking, trajectory optimization is a technique for computing an open-loop solution to an [[optimal control]] problem. It is often used for systems where computing the full closed-loop solution is either impossible or impractical.

Although the idea of trajectory optimization has been around for hundreds of years ([[calculus of variations]], [[Brachistochrone curve|brachystochrone problem]]), it only became practical for real-world problems with the advent of the computer. Many of the original applications of trajectory optimization were in the aerospace industry, computing rocket and missile launch trajectories. More recently, trajectory optimization has also been used in a wide variety of industrial process and robotics applications.

==History==
Trajectory optimization first showed up in 1697, with the introduction of the Brachystochrone problem: find the shape of a wire such that a bead sliding along it will move between two points in the minimum time.&lt;ref name = "Willems1997"&gt;''300 Years of Optimal Control: From The Brachystochrone to the Maximum Principle'', Hector J. Sussmann and Jan C. Willems. IEEE Control Systems, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The interesting thing about this problem is that it is optimizing over a curve (the shape of the wire), rather than a single number. The most famous of the solutions was computed using [[calculus of variations]].

In the 1950s, the digital computer started to make trajectory optimization practical for solving real-world problems. The first optimal control approaches grew out of the [[calculus of variations]], based on the research of [[Gilbert Ames Bliss]] and Bryson&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Ho,Applied Optimal Control, Blaisdell Publishing Company, 1969, p 246.&lt;/ref&gt; in America, and [[Pontryagin]]&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Pontyragin, The Mathematical Theory of Optimal Processes, New York, Intersciences, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; in Russia. [[Pontryagin's maximum principle]]&lt;ref name = "Ross"&gt;[[I. Michael Ross|Ross, I. M.]] ''A Primer on Pontryagin's Principle in Optimal Control'', Collegiate Publishers, San Francisco, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is of particular note. These early researchers created the foundation of what we now call indirect methods for trajectory optimization.

Much of the early work in trajectory optimization was focused on computing rocket thrust profiles, both in a vacuum and in the atmosphere. This early research discovered many basic principles that are still used today. 
Another successful application was the climb to altitude trajectories for the early jet aircraft.  Because of the high drag associated with the transonic drag region and the low thrust of early jet aircraft, trajectory optimization was the key to maximizing climb to altitude performance.  Optimal control based trajectories were responsible for some of the world records.  In these situations, the pilot followed a Mach versus altitude schedule based on optimal control solutions.

One of the important early problems in trajectory optimization was that of the [[Singular control|singular arc]], where [[Pontryagin's maximum principle]] fails to yield a complete solution. An example of a problem with singular control is the optimization of the thrust of a missile flying at a constant altitude and which is launched at low speed.  Here the problem is one of a [[bang-bang control]] at maximum possible thrust until the singular arc is reached.  Then the solution to the singular control provides a lower variable thrust until burnout.  At that point bang-bang control provides that the control or thrust go to its minimum value of zero.  This solution is the foundation of the boost-sustain rocket motor profile widely used today to maximize missile performance.

==Applications==

There are a wide variety of applications for trajectory optimization, primarily in robotics: industry, manipulation, walking, path-planning, and aerospace. It can also be used for modeling and estimation.

===Quadrotor helicopters===

Trajectory optimization is often used to compute trajectories for [[Quadcopter|quadrotor helicopters]]. These applications typically used highly specialized algorithms.
&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Mellinger and Vijay Kumar, "Minimum snap trajectory generation and control for quadrotors" International Conference on Robotics and Automation, IEEE 2011
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Markus Hehn and Raffaello D'Andrea, "Real-Time Trajectory Generation for Quadrocopters" IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;
One interesting application shown by the [http://www.kumarrobotics.org/research/ U.Penn GRASP Lab] is computing a trajectory that allows a quadrotor to fly through a hoop as it is thrown. Another, this time by the [http://flyingmachinearena.org/research/ ETH Zurich Flying Machine Arena],  involves two quadrotors tossing a pole back and forth between them, with it balanced like an inverted pendulum.

===Manufacturing===

Trajectory optimization is used in manufacturing, particularly for controlling chemical processes (such as in 
&lt;ref&gt;
John W. Eaton and James B. Rawlings. "Model-Predictive Control of Chemical Processes" Chemical Engineering Science, Vol 47, No 4. 1992.
&lt;/ref&gt;
) or computing the desired path for robotic manipulators (such as in
&lt;ref&gt;T. Chettibi, H. Lehtihet, M. Haddad, S. Hanchi, "Minimum cost trajectory planning for industrial robots" European Journal of Mechanics, 2004.
&lt;/ref&gt;
).

===Walking robots===

There are a variety of different applications for trajectory optimization within the field of walking robotics. For example, one paper used trajectory optimization of bipedal gaits on a simple model to show that walking is energetically favorable for moving at a low speed and running is energetically favorable for moving at a high speed.
&lt;ref&gt;Manoj Srinivasan and Andy Ruina. "Computer optimization of a minimal biped model discovers walking and running" Nature, 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Like in many other applications, trajectory optimization can be used to compute a nominal trajectory, around which a stabilizing controller is built.
&lt;ref&gt;E.R. Westervelt, J.W. Grizzle, and D.E. Koditschek. "Hybrid Zero Dynamics of PLanar Biped Walkers" IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 2003.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Trajectory optimization can be applied in detailed motion planning complex humanoid robots, such as [[Atlas (robot)|Atlas]].
&lt;ref&gt;Michael Posa, Scott Kuindersma, and Russ Tedrake. "Optimization and stabilization of trajectories for constrained dynamical systems." International Conference on Robotics and Automation, IEEE 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, trajectory optimization can be used for path-planning of robots with complicated dynamics constraints, using reduced complexity models.
&lt;ref&gt;Hongkai Dai, Andres Valenzuela, and Russ Tedrake. "Whole-body motion planning with Centroidal Dynamics and Full Kinematics" International Conference on Humanoid Robots, IEEE 2014.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerospace===
For [[tactical missile]]s, the flight profiles are determined by the thrust and [[load factor (aeronautics)|lift]] histories.  These histories can be controlled by a number of means including such techniques as using an [[angle of attack]] command history or an altitude/downrange schedule that the missile must follow.  Each combination of missile design factors, desired missile performance, and system constraints results in a new set of optimal control parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, C.A, "Energy Management for a Multiple Pulse Missile", AIAA Paper 88-0334, Jan., 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

;Decision variables
: The set of unknowns to be found using optimization.

;Trajectory optimization problem
: A special type of optimization problem where the decision variables are functions, rather than real numbers.

;[[Mathematical optimization|Parameter optimization]]
: Any optimization problem where the decision variables are real numbers.

;[[Nonlinear programming|Nonlinear program]]
: A class of constrained parameter optimization where either the objective function or constraints are nonlinear.

;Indirect method
: An indirect method for solving a trajectory optimization problem proceeds in three steps: 1) Analytically construct the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality, 2) Discretize these conditions, constructing a constrained parameter optimization problem, 3) Solve that optimization problem.&lt;ref name=Betts2010&gt;
John T. Betts  "Practical Methods for Optimal Control and Estimation Using Nonlinear Programming" SIAM Advances in Design and Control, 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;

;Direct method
: A direct method for solving a trajectory optimization problem consists of two steps: 1) Discretize the trajectory optimization problem directly, converting it into a constrained parameter optimization problem, 2) Solve that optimization problem.&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt;

;Transcription
: The process by which a trajectory optimization problem is converted into a parameter optimization problem. This is sometimes referred to as discretization. Transcription methods generally fall into two categories: shooting methods and collocation methods.

;[[Shooting method]]
: A transcription method that is based on simulation, typically using explicit Runge--Kutta schemes.

;[[Collocation method]] (Simultaneous Method)
: A transcription method that is based on function approximation, typically using implicit Runge--Kutta schemes.

;[[Pseudo-spectral method|Pseudospectral method]] (Global Collocation)
: A transcription method that represents the entire trajectory as a single high-order orthogonal polynomial.

;Mesh (Grid)
: After transcription, the formerly continuous trajectory is now represented by a discrete set of points, known as mesh points or grid points.

;Mesh refinement
: The process by which the discretization mesh is improved by solving a sequence of trajectory optimization problems. Mesh refinement is either performed by sub-dividing a trajectory segment or by increasing the order of the polynomial representing that segment.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher L. Darby, William W. Hager, and Anil V. Rao. "An hp-adaptive pseudospectral method for solving optimal control problems." Optimal Control Applications and Methods, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Multi-phase trajectory optimization problem 
: Trajectory optimization over a system with [[Hybrid system|hybrid dynamics]] can be achieved by posing it as a multi-phase trajectory optimization problem. This is done by composing a sequence of standard trajectory optimization problems that are connected using constraints.&lt;ref name=GPOPSII&gt;{{Cite journal|title = GPOPS-II: A MATLAB Software for Solving Multiple-Phase Optimal Control Problems Using hp-Adaptive Gaussian Quadrature Collocation Methods and Sparse Nonlinear Programming|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2558904|journal = ACM Trans. Math. Softw.|date = 2014-10-01|issn = 0098-3500|pages = 1:1–1:37|volume = 41|issue = 1|doi = 10.1145/2558904|first = Michael A.|last = Patterson|first2 = Anil V.|last2 = Rao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trajectory optimization techniques==

The techniques to any [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization problems]] can be divided into two categories: indirect and direct. An indirect method works by analytically constructing the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality, which are then solved numerically. A direct method attempts a direct numerical solution by constructing a sequence of continually improving approximations to the optimal solution.&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt; Direct and indirect methods can be blended by an application of the [[covector mapping principle]] of [[I. Michael Ross|Ross]] and [[Fariba Fahroo|Fahroo]].&lt;ref name="ReviewPOC"&gt;[[I. Michael Ross|I. M. Ross]] and M. Karpenko, "A Review of Pseudospectral Optimal Control: From Theory to Flight," Annual Reviews in Control, Vol. 36, pp. 182-197, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The optimal control problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, since the decision variables are functions, rather than real numbers. All solution techniques perform transcription, a process by which the trajectory optimization problem (optimizing over functions) is converted into a constrained parameter optimization problem (optimizing over real numbers). Generally, this constrained parameter optimization problem is a non-linear program, although in special cases it can be reduced to a [[Quadratic programming|quadratic program]] or [[Linear programming|linear program]].

===Single shooting===
Single shooting is the simplest type of trajectory optimization technique. The basic idea is similar to how you would aim a cannon: pick a set of parameters for the trajectory, simulate the entire thing, and then check to see if you hit the target. The entire trajectory is represented as a single segment, with a single constraint, known as a defect constraint, requiring that the final state of the simulation match the desired final state of the system. Single shooting is effective for problems that are either simple or have an extremely good initialization. Both the indirect and direct formulation tend to have difficulties otherwise.&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Betts1998&gt;Survey of Numerical Methods for Trajectory Optimization; John T. Betts 
Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics 1998; 0731-5090 vol.21 no.2 (193-207)
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Rao2009&gt;Anil V. Rao "A survey of numerical methods for optimal control" Advances in Astronautical Sciences, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple shooting===
Multiple shooting is a simple extension to single shooting that renders it far more effective. Rather than representing the entire trajectory as a single simulation (segment), the algorithm breaks the trajectory into many shorter segments, and a defect constraint is added between each. The result is large sparse non-linear program, which tends to be easier to solve than the small dense programs produced by single shooting.&lt;ref name=Betts1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rao2009 /&gt;

===Direct collocation===
Direct collocation methods work by approximating the state and control trajectories using polynomial [[Spline (mathematics)|splines]]. These methods are sometimes referred to as direct transcription. '''Trapezoidal collocation''' is a commonly used low-order direct collocation method. The dynamics, path objective, and control are all represented using linear splines, and the dynamics are satisfied using [[Trapezoidal rule|trapezoidal quadrature]]. '''Hermite-Simpson Collocation''' is a common medium-order direct collocation method. The state is represented by a [[Cubic Hermite spline|cubic-Hermite spline]], and the dynamics are satisfied using [[Simpson's rule|Simpson quadrature]].&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rao2009 /&gt;

===Orthogonal collocation===
Orthogonal collocation is technically a subset of direct collocation, but the implementation details are so different that it can reasonably be considered its own set of methods. Orthogonal collocation differs from direct collocation in that it typically uses high-order splines, and each segment of the trajectory might be represented by a spline of a different order. The name comes from the use of orthogonal polynomials in the state and control splines.&lt;ref name=Rao2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rao2014&gt;Camila C. Francolin, David A. Benson, William W. Hager, Anil V. Rao. "Costate Estimation in Optimal Control Using Integral Gaussian Quadrature Orthogonal Collocation Methods" Optimal Control Applications and Methods, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudospectral collocation===
Pseudospectral collocation, also known as global collocation, is a subset of orthogonal collocation in which the entire trajectory is represented by a single high-order orthogonal polynomial. As a side note: some authors use orthogonal collocation and pseudospectral collocation interchangeably. When used to solve a trajectory optimization problem whose solution is smooth, a pseudospectral method will achieve [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spectral_methods spectral] (exponential) convergence.&lt;ref name=ApprxTheoryApprxPractice&gt;Lloyd N. Trefethen. "Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice", SIAM 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential dynamic programming===
[[Differential dynamic programming]], is a bit different than the other techniques described here. In particular, it does not cleanly separate the transcription and the optimization. Instead, it does a sequence of iterative forward and backward passes along the trajectory. Each forward pass satisfies the system dynamics, and each backward pass satisfies the optimality conditions for control. Eventually, this iteration converges to a trajectory that is both feasible and optimal.&lt;ref name=DDP&gt;David H. Jacobson, 
David Q. Mayne. "Differential Dynamic Programming" Elsevier, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of techniques==
There are many techniques to choose from when solving a trajectory optimization problem. There is no best method, but some methods might do a better job on specific problems. This section provides a rough understanding of the trade-offs between methods.

===Indirect vs. direct methods===
When solving a trajectory optimization problem with an indirect method, you must explicitly construct the adjoint equations and their gradients. This is often difficult to do, but it gives an excellent accuracy metric for the solution. Direct methods are much easier to set up and solve, but do not have a built-in accuracy metric.&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt; As a result, direct methods are more widely used, especially in non-critical applications. Indirect methods still have a place in specialized applications, particularly aerospace, where accuracy is critical.

One place where indirect methods have particular difficulty is on problems with path inequality constraints. These problems tend to have solutions for which the constraint is partially active. When constructing the adjoint equations for an indirect method, the user must explicitly write down when the constraint is active in the solution, which is difficult to know a priori. One solution is to use a direct method to compute an initial guess, which is then used to construct a multi-phase problem where the constraint is prescribed. The resulting problem can then be solved accurately using an indirect method.&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt;

===Shooting vs. collocation===
Single shooting methods are best used for problems where the control is very simple (or there is an extremely good initial guess). For example, a satellite mission planning problem where the only control is the magnitude and direction of an initial impulse from the engines.&lt;ref name=Betts1998 /&gt;

Multiple shooting tends to be good for problems with relatively simple control, but complicated dynamics. Although path constraints can be used, they make the resulting nonlinear program relatively difficult to solve.

Direct collocation methods are good for problems where the accuracy of the control and the state are similar. These methods tend to be less accurate then others (due to their low-order), but are particularly robust for problems with difficult path constraints.

Orthogonal collocation methods are best for obtaining high-accuracy solutions to problems where the accuracy of the control trajectory is important. Some implementations have trouble with path constraints. These methods are particularly good when the solution is smooth.

===Mesh refinement: h vs. p===

It is common to solve a trajectory optimization problem iteratively, each time using a discretization with more points. A '''h-method''' for mesh refinement works by increasing the number of trajectory segments along the trajectory, while a '''p-method''' increases the order of the transcription method within each segment.

Direct collocation methods tend to exclusively use h-method type refinement, since each method is a fixed order. Shooting methods and orthogonal collocation methods can both use h-method and p-method mesh refinement, and some use a combination, known as hp-adaptive meshing. It is best to use h-method when the solution is non-smooth, while a p-method is best for smooth solutions.&lt;ref name=GPOPSII /&gt;

'''Transcellular fluid''' is the portion of [[total body water]] that represents all body fluids which are formed from the transport activities of cells. It is the smallest component of [[extracellular fluid]]. It is contained within epithelial lined spaces. It is often not calculated as a fraction of the extracellular fluid, but it is 5% of extracellular fluid (2.5% of total body water). Examples of this fluid are [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[aqueous humor|ocular fluid]] and [[synovial fluid|joint fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anaesthesiamcq.com/FluidBook/fl2_1.php Fluid Physiology: 2.1 Fluid Compartments&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physiology, 5th Ed.|last=Constanzo|first=Linda S.|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|year=2014|isbn=9781455708475|location=|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Due to the varying locations of transcellular fluid, the composition changes dramatically. Some of the electrolytes present in the transcellular fluid are [[sodium]] ions, [[chloride ion]]s, and [[bicarbonate]] ions.

== Physiological Function ==
There are also varied functions for the trans-cellular fluid. In the joints, it serves a lubrication function, while the urine allows for the removal of electrolytes and molecules from the body.

'''Visual research''' is a qualitative research methodology that relies on the use of artistic mediums to "produce and represent knowledge." These artistic mediums include, but are not limited to: [[film]], [[photography]], [[drawing]]s, [[painting]]s, and [[sculptures]]. The artistic mediums provide a rich source of information that has the ability of capturing reality. They also reveal information about what the medium captures, but the artist or the creator behind the medium. Using photography as an example, the photographs taken illustrate reality and give information about the photographer through the angle, focus of the image, and the moment in which the photograph was taken.

==  Research process, a definition and visual images ==

Images are an essential component for different sorts on inquires in a wide range of topics and research questions may call for a visual component in a variety of ways. One way could be to the research questions or the phenomena being examined, or the researcher could be the one making new images. After the visual material is created the resulting collection may be the base of further discussion, interviews, and or analysis, although the process of creating images is often a large part of the research process itself.

== Participant generated visual methodologies ==

This method of data collection is often used to elicit data or opinion, here the participant is the one who would be generating the visual data. If it is a photograph she or he has taken  it, or for a video, she or he has shot the visual data that will be further analysed. This is important as it allows the researcher to understand participants' views and perceptions.
 definition

=== Photovoice ===
Caroline C. Wang and Mary Anne Burris conceptualized the visual methodology called [[photovoice]].  Participants are provided with a camera and asked to produce an image-based account of their experiences and/or those things that are important to them in a particular context. These projects share the assumption that increased participant control of data generation through production of visual images will help to highlight important aspects of lived experience that might otherwise have been overlooked or ignored by researchers. This method is often used in social science and health research.

=== Fotohistorias ===
Ricardo Gomez and Sara Vannini (&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, Ricardo &amp; Vannini, Sara (2015). Fotohistorias: Participatory Photography and the Experience of Migration. CreateSpace, Bilingual: English &amp; Spanish&lt;/ref&gt;) introduced a variation of photovoice called Fotohistorias, that combines participant-generated photos and semistructured interviews to elicit lived experiences of immigrants and other marginalized communities. Fotohistorias combines the power of images and the richness of stories. Together, they yield more depth and sensitivity than either photos or interviews alone. Fotohistorias helps to quickly get to deep conversation about profound and meaningful topics, by focusing on the photos as a pretext for conversation. Fotohistorias helps elicit multiple perspectives and symbols from the same image or place, emphasizing how people’s perceptions and feelings shape meaning and experience. Fotohistorias participants frequently feel empowered, heard and valued, and gain a new perspective and agency over their current situation and context. &lt;ref&gt;www.fotohistorias.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photo-elicitation ===
The photo-elicitation approach can include researcher or participant generated photographs. Photographs are introduced to the context of research interview based off the "assumption about the role and utility of photographs in promoting reflections that words alone cannot." Participant generated photo elicitation puts significance to the participants role in shaping the creation of visual images. It is important to note the value of the technique for "bridging culturally distinct worlds of the researcher and the researched." The term photo-elicitation originated from a paper published by Collier (1957), when it was initiated as a solution to the practical difficulties that research teams were having in relation to agreeing on categories for quality housing. Collier extended the method to examine how families adapted to residence among ethnically different people, and to new forms of work in urban factories, interviewing families and communities with photographs created by researchers. Reflecting on the use of photo-elicitation, Collier (1957, p.&amp;nbsp;858), argued that ‘pictures elicited longer and more comprehensive interviews but at the same time helped subjects overcome the fatigue and repetition of conventional interviews’ and noted the technique’s ‘compelling effect upon the informant, its ability to prod latent memory, to stimulate and release emotional statements about the informant’s life’. Photo-elicitation with researcher-initiated productions has been taken up by a range of researchers across the social sciences and related disciplines (Mannay 2016)&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2016 Visual, Narrative and Creative Research Methods Application, reflection and ethics. Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film-elicitation ===

This technique of data collection is mostly used by researchers who believe in Positivist or realist view of the world.
Making a film as opposed to simply shooting footages, involves editing and other post production tasks, such as adding subtitles, but it also rests upon a series of ideas concerning the place of visual representation within social science itself. 
This technique of data collection or data analysis is not widely used because of its multiple requirements. 
Making films – to elicit data or opinion, can be of 3 basic types:
1.Documenting or filming the subjects
2.Showing a film to the subjects and asking about their opinion 
3.Asking the subjects to make a film

There are 3 basic concerns when it comes to analysis of a film or a video: 
1. the analytical approach taken towards film or video.
2. method employed to derive data.
3. the kind of issue being analysed.

=== Benefits and limitations ===

This methodology is beneficial in its applicability to participants who may be [[illiterate]] or have difficulty communicating because of [[language barrier]]s, lack of education, or a disability. This characteristic of Photovoice allows researchers who choose to use this methodology to choose participants from a large sample pool because there are no language or literacy requirements. Photovoice may be a powerful research tool because it allows the researcher to see the topic being studied from the participant's perspective. It also encourages the participants and the researcher to reflect on the images and meaning behind them as they highlight an aspect or perspective of the research topic perhaps not previously considered. In this way visual methods of data production can act as tools of defamilairisation, fighting familiarity for both researchers and participants and allowing space for a more nuanced understanding of the topics studies (Mannay 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2010. Making the familiar strange: Can visual research methods render the familiar setting more perceptible?. Qualitative Research 10(1), pp. 91-111&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The use of Photovoice also has its limits. It requires the researcher to budget for the equipment used to carry it out, such as cameras, ink and printing costs. This may be problematic for the researcher if the research has been given limited or insufficient funds.
 
Another problem that may arise in the use of Photovoice is the question of photograph ownership. The researcher may be providing the equipment, but it is the participants who are taking the pictures. To avoid any potential issues regarding photograph ownership, it is advised that researchers obtain from their participants permission to use the photographs they take. It is particularly important to think carefully about informed consent in an era of digital dissemination and open access publication where images can be reworked, redistributed and recirculated in the digital economy, in ways that may not have been envisaged at the time of the research study (Mannay, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2014. Story telling beyond the academy: exploring roles, responsibilities and regulations in the Open Access dissemination of research outputs and visual data. The Journal of Corporate Citizenship 54, pp. 109-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical warnings ==

=== Deception or manipulation ===

These are activities where the experimenters are either not disclosing their real identity, or their true purpose for the activity.  This includes assuming a [[pseudonym|false identity]] such as creating an avatar in an online game, or pretending to be a tourist while looking at statutes. This could also includes manipulating settings in order to observe reactions.

=== Observing and objectifying people by looking covertly from a distance ===

These activities concern individuals who feel that a particular population is being treated in a dispassionate manner or similar to scientists observing natural phenomena in a clinical way. Examples of this would be the exercises which you ask to observe the waiting behaviors of people in public places (either in person from a distance or via [[webcam]]).

=== Intimate or detailed observations of personal places or behavior ===

This category refers to a in-depth analysis of intimate, meaningful or personal places activities or spaces, and may include making judgments which could sadden or offend people. An example of this could be coding or commenting on gravestone trends or personal graffiti.

=== Possibility of causing discomfort or concern ===

This is a category, in which the exercise or project may upset some people, or create anxiety or fear (including and potentially, in the researcher). This may happen due to situations which could include wasting people's time or not conforming to societal norms, such as in 'breaching' experiments. The visual offers a range of exciting possibilities for social research but it also brings an array of challenges and ethical difficulties. Visual Ethics can now be regarded as a specialist area within visual methodologies. Much mainstream engagement with the ethics of visual ethnography focuses on issues of anonymity of place and participants so that the focus is on who is taking the picture, who is in the picture; and what else can be known from the geography or materiality of the image. Thus, the moral maze of image ethics has been centrally concerned with the creator of images in relation to informed consent and the tension between revealing and concealing the contents of visual images; and who has ‘the right’ to claim ownership of images to in turn edit their content and show them to others (Mannay 2016).Once a visual image is created it becomes very difficult to control its use or remove it from the public arena if participants decide that they no longer want to be represented in a fixed visual trope for time immemorial. Even if images are successfully anodised, acts to disguise images can be seen as tantamount to silencing the voice of research participants. This is particularly problematic where researchers invest in the epistemological aims of participatory approaches predicated on giving ‘voice’.

The institute was founded by the Estonian government in 1995 and is located in the Southern Estonian town of [[Võru]]. The directors of the institute have been [[Enn Kasak]], [[Kaido Kama]] and [[Külli Eichenbaum]]. The present director of the institute is [[Rainer Kuuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://news.err.ee/114404/smoke-sauna-tradition-in-vorumaa-added-to-unesco-intangible-cultural-heritage-list||title=Smoke sauna tradition in Võrumaa added to UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List|access-date=26 February 2018|date=27 November 2014|publisher=eer.ee|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the institute include the toponymist [[Evar Saar]] and the lexicographer [[Sulev Iva]].

==Activities==
The institute is engaged in a wide range of activities to meet the challenges facing lesser-spoken languages, including establishing school programs, conducting linguistic and regional research, preserving place-names and their corresponding stories (mostly by [[Evar Saar]]), publishing Võro-language scholarship and school textbooks, and organizing annual language conferences. The aim of these activities is to encourage the Võro people to speak their own language and to preserve their characteristic life-style.

The probable extent of land at the time of the [[last glacial maximum]], when the sea level was more than 110 m lower than today, is shown in grey. The deep water of the [[Lombok Strait]] between Bali and Lombok formed a water barrier even when lower sea levels linked the now-separated islands and landmasses on either side.]]

The '''Wallace Line''' or '''Wallace's Line''' is a [[wikt:faunal|faunal]] boundary line drawn in 1859 by the British naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and named by English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], that separates the [[Terrestrial ecozone|ecozones]] of [[Asia]] and [[Wallacea]], a transitional zone between Asia and [[Australia_(continent)|Australia]]. West of the line are found organisms related to Asiatic species; to the east, a mixture of species of Asian and Australian origin is present. Wallace noticed this clear division during his travels through the [[East Indies]] in the 19th century.

The line runs through [[Indonesia]], between [[Borneo]] and [[Sulawesi]] (Celebes), and through the [[Lombok Strait]] between [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]]. The distance between Bali and Lombok is small, about {{convert|35|km}}. The distributions of many [[bird]] species observe the line, since many birds do not cross even the shortest stretches of open ocean water. Some [[bat]]s have distributions that cross the line, but larger terrestrial mammals are generally limited to one side or the other; exceptions include [[macaque|macaques]], pigs and [[tarsier|tarsiers]] on Sulawesi. Other groups of plants and animals show differing patterns, but the overall pattern is striking and reasonably consistent. [[Flora]] do not follow the Wallace Line to the same extent as [[fauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Welzen | first1 = P. C. | last2 = Parnell | first2 = J. A.

== Historical context ==
[[File:Wallace-line1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The original drawing of the line from Wallace's paper]]
[[Antonio Pigafetta]] had recorded the biological contrasts between the [[Philippines]] and the [[Maluku Islands]] (Spice Islands) (on opposite sides of the line) in 1521 during the continuation of the voyage of [[Ferdinand Magellan]], after Magellan had been killed on [[Mactan]]. Moreover, as noted by Wallace himself, the observations in faunal differences between the two regions had already been made earlier by English navigator [[George Windsor Earl]]. In Earl's pamphlet ''On the Physical Geography of South-Eastern Asia and Australia'', published in 1845, he described how shallow seas connected islands on the west ([[Sumatra]], [[Java]], etc.) with the Asian continent and with similar wildlife, and islands on the east such as [[New Guinea]] were connected to Australia and were characterised by the presence of [[marsupial]]s. Wallace used his extensive travel in the region to propose a line to the east of Bali since "all the islands eastward of Borneo and Java formed part of an Australian or Pacific Continent, from which they were separated."{{sfn|Wallace|1863|p=231}} The name 'Wallace's Line' was first used by [[Thomas Huxley]] in an 1868 paper to the [[Zoological Society of London]], but showed the line to the west of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Huxley| first=T.

==Biogeography==
[[File:Wallacea.png|thumb|right|250px|The [[Wallacea]] region situated between the Wallace Line (after [[Ernst Mayr]] or [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]) and the Lydekker Line]]
Understanding of the [[biogeography]] of the region centers on the relationship of ancient [[sea level]]s to the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]]. Wallace's Line is visible geographically when the continental shelf contours are examined; it can be seen as a deep-water channel that marks the southeastern edge of the [[Sunda Shelf]] which links Borneo, Bali, Java, and Sumatra underwater to the mainland of southeastern Asia. Australia is likewise connected by the [[Sahul Shelf]] to New Guinea. The biogeographic boundary known as [[Richard Lydekker|Lydekker's Line]], which separates the eastern edge of Wallacea from the Australian region, has a similar origin to the Wallace line.

During [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] [[glacial period|glacial advances]], when the [[:Image:Sea level temp 140ky.gif|ocean levels were up to {{convert|120|m}} lower]], both Asia and Australia were united with what are now islands on their respective continental shelves as continuous land masses, but the deep water between those two large continental shelf areas was, for over 50 million years, a barrier that kept the flora and fauna of Australia separated from those of Asia. [[Wallacea]] consists of islands that were not recently connected by dry land to either of the continental land masses, and thus were populated by organisms capable of crossing the straits between islands. "[[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber's Line]]" runs through this transitional area (to the east of centre), at the tipping point between dominance by species of Asian against those of Australian origin.&lt;ref name="Mayr44"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Mayr  | first = E.  | title = Wallace's Line in the Light of Recent Zoogeographic Studies  | journal = [[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]  | volume = 19 | issue = 1  | pages = 1–14  | year = 1944  | jstor = 2808563 | doi=10.1086/394684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can reasonably be concluded it was an ocean barrier preventing species migration because the physical aspects of the separated islands are very similar.&lt;ref name="zoology"&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last=Newton |first=Alfred |year=1874 |publisher=Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MUkDAAAAQAAJ |accessdate=15 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Species found only on the Asian side include tigers and rhinoceroses, while marsupials and monotremes are only found on the eastern side of the Line.&lt;ref name="nast"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nature's Strongholds: The World's Great Wildlife Reserves |last=Riley |first=Laura |author2=William Riley |year=2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691122199 |page=602 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icMuBQhW4vgC |accessdate=15 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Windham College''' was a [[liberal arts college]] located in [[Putney, Vermont|Putney]], [[Vermont]] on the campus of what is now [[Landmark College]].

==History==
Windham was founded in 1951 by Walter F. Hendricks as the Vermont Institute of Special Studies. The school's initial aim was to help foreign students improve their [[English language]] skills to enable them to meet the requirements for attending U.S. institutions. In 1954, the institution was renamed Windham College and began offering courses in the [[liberal arts]] and sciences, earning accreditation in December, 1967. Eugene Winslow succeeded Hendricks as president in 1964, and served for ten years. Under his tenure the college was relocated to an [[Edward Durell Stone]]-designed campus outside the village. The academic campus consisted of five buildings: Humanities, Library, Sciences on one side, Fine Arts and the Student Union across the green, all connected by a [[colonnade]]. On the hill above stood the five major dormitories, Aiken, Frost, Hendricks, Stone and Dorm Five, as well as two smaller residences, Chumley and Dorm Two.

Under President Winslow, student enrollment grew from 160 to a peak of 935. By 1975, under college president Harrison Symmes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/starnewsonline/obituary.aspx?n=harrison-matthews-symmes&amp;pid=142695472|title=Harrison Matthews Symmes's Obituary on Wilmington Star-News|website=Wilmington Star-News}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite aggressive recruitment and placement of Middle Eastern students, the number of students had fallen to 450, perhaps due to the end of the [[Vietnam War]] and the decreased demand for student deferments.{{original research inline|date=July 2015}} When it closed in 1978, &lt;ref&gt;Putney Historical Society, [http://www.putneyvt.org/history_time.php History Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; there were only 254 students.

In 1978, there were more than 75 international students invited from Middle Eastern countries to help the school sustain its financially problematic existence, but it closed unceremoniously, in the middle of the cold Vermont winter, two weeks prior to the winter holidays.  Stranded international students were forced to leave the school premises by the order of local sheriff, and all of the dormitories were vacated and padlocked. Most international students lost their tuition money (and their boarding costs) that had been paid in advance four weeks prior, and were forced to disperse to other parts of the USA or to return to their countries. Most of the foreign students were guided to another local school{{which|date=July 2015}} that helped them to take shelter during the cold winter for a short period, in hopes of absorbing them as new students or for humanitarian reasons.

Walter Hendricks also founded the still functioning [[Marlboro College]] in [[Marlboro, Vermont]], west of [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], as well as Mark Hopkins College whose main (and only) administration and classroom building was in a mansion on [[Vermont Route 9|Route 9]] in Brattleboro. Mark Hopkins College was accredited by the State of Vermont and authorized to grant bachelor's degrees; it closed in 1977.

[[John Irving]] taught at Windham when he wrote his first novel, ''[[Setting Free the Bears]]''. Part of Irving's novel ''[[Last Night in Twisted River]]'' is set around Putney, where a character teaches at Windham. Irving writes in the novel: "Windham College was an architectural eyesore on an otherwise beautiful piece of land."

[[Pearl S. Buck]] was a trustee of the college.
