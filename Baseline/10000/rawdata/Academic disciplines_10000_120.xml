[[File:Marc, Franz - Pferde in Landschaft.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Franz Marc]]'s ''Pferde in Landschaft'', one of the artworks discovered in the Gurlitt collection (probably 1911, [[gouache]] on coloured paper).]]

In February 2012, the [[Prosecutor|District Prosecutor]] of Augsburg confiscated 121 framed and 1,285 unframed artworks found in an apartment in [[Schwabing]], [[Munich]] in the course of an investigation into possible tax evasion.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; The apartment was rented to  Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of celebrated art historian, dealer, and war profiteer, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], and grandson of the art historian [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]].  Some of the paintings were immediately suspected of having been [[Nazi plunder|looted]] by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The collection is largely undamaged and of remarkable quality. It contains [[Old Masters]] as well as [[Impressionist]], [[Cubist]], and [[Expressionist]] paintings by artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Max Liebermann]], among many others. Although German authorities seized the entire collection, Gurlitt was not detained. Not until 3 November 2013 did the magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' report the find.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; News of the discovery was reported worldwide.&lt;ref name="Smale"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |title= Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar |last=Smale |first=Alison |date=4 November 2013 |website= |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date= 18 March 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurlitt initially refused to cooperate with investigators. He retained several dozen additional suspect paintings, kept not in Munich but in his home in Salzburg, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26133532 |title=Nazi loot probe: More art found at Gurlitt Austria home, BBC News, 11 February 2014 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2014, an agreement was reached whereby the collection confiscated in Munich was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with a government-led task force charged with returning stolen pieces to the rightful owners.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dw.de/p/1BdMb |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |last=R |first=D |title=Gurlitt reaches deal with German authorities over vast trove of art}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10811916/Cornelius-Gurlitt-obituary.html |title=Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate= 28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His will bequeathed all his property to the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]], Switzerland, after all legitimate claims of ownership against it had been evaluated.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title='Nazi art' hoarder Gurlitt makes Swiss museum sole heir|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27306269|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/will-germany-keep-gurlitts-trove-from-the-swiss-14647#.U2ujUaPvmMk.facebook |title=Artnet news, Alexander Forbes, '&amp;#39;Will Germany Keep Gurlitt’s Trove from the Swiss?'&amp;#39; |publisher=News.artnet.com |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1930 art collector Hildebrand Gurlitt was removed as director of the museum in [[Zwickau]] because he exhibited contemporary artists. After the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his new job as director of [[Kunstverein Hamburg]], because his grandmother was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/nazi_policies_toward_jews_and_minorities/ |title='&amp;#39;Nazi Policies Toward Jews and Minorities'&amp;#39;, NY Times, 18 November 2013 |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved the family to [[Dresden]] and built a prosperous business as an art dealer, specializing in modern art.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"/&gt;

Hildebrand was appointed as a dealer for the [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Appointed when?  by whom?}}  On instructions from [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Created when?}}  The Commission in turn appointed a series of dealers approved by the official Nazi confiscation service, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]], to handle the marketing of these art assets. Four men who had been dealing in modern art for years were chosen: Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Möller, Bernhard A. Böhmer and Hildebrand Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title= The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War| publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. |date = 1995 |accessdate=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were instructed to sell these artworks abroad for foreign currency.  Hildebrand's extensive network of European and North American art contacts were invaluable in this.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Göring used the funds raised to grow his personal art collection, though the four men did not always report to the Commission all proceeds of their sales.&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|last=Feliciano |first=Hector |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/ |title=The Lost Museum |publisher=Bonjour Paris |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works of so-called "degenerate art" that the Commission sold off were many paintings stolen from noted French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].

[[File:Sworn Statement Dr. H. Gurlitt 1945.pdf|thumb|1945 statement by [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] to Allied authorities, describing his dealings before and during the war and listing art in his possession]]

In May 1940 the Reich Propaganda Ministry sold to Gurlitt 200 paintings, including Chagall's ''The Walk'', Picasso's ''Farming Family'', and Nolde's ''Hamburg Harbour,'' for the small sum of 4,000 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt;  Hildebrand similarly acquired 115 additional works of "degenerate art" in 1941.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt; It is estimated that, at his height, he had a personal trading collection of more than 1500 art objects.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt;

Gurlitt used his position to sell art to domestic collectors, most notably to [[Bernhard Sprengel]], whose collection forms the core of the [[Sprengel Museum]] in Hannover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://derstandard.at/1216918696497/Entartete--Kunstgeschaefte | title=Entartete Kunstgeschäfte | work=Der Standard | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captured with his wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach ([[Schlüsselfeld]]) in June 1945, Gurlitt claimed that the art was part of his personal collection, and that most of his collection and all of his records had been destroyed during the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/depot-mit-nazi-raubkunst-in-muenchen-der-verwerter-und-sein-sohn-1.1809631 | title=Depot mit Nazi-Raubkunst in München | work=Süddeutsche.de | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | author=Mazzoni, Ira |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He painted himself as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and on those grounds he was released.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;
 
[[File:Liebermann, Max - Zwei Reiter am Strand - Gurlitt.jpg|thumb|[[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' in the Gurlitt collection and subject to a claim by the descendants of the original Jewish owner]]

Although suspicious of his story, in December 1950 US investigators returned 206 items to Gurlitt, including [[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'', [[Otto Dix]]'s self-portrait, an allegorical painting by [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2493980/Nazi-art-loot-German-dealer-quizzed-U-S-military-just-war.html#ixzz2k9BmfvdM|title=How U.S. military quizzed German dealer of £1bn Nazi art loot just after the war|last=Enoch |first=Nick|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurlitt continued trading artworks until his death in 1956.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War | publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. | date=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelius Gurlitt (28 December 1932 – 6 May 2014) was a German [[Private collection|art collector]], son  of [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. He grew up in the [[Dammtor]] district of Hamburg with his sister Renate, who was born there in 1935. His great-grandmother was Jewish, which caused his father to be labelled as a "quarter-Jew" under the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nazi race laws]] in the ''Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939'', or so-called "German Minority Census" of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;This "German Minority Census" is available in digital form at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Resource Center in Washington D.C. and at the German Federal Archives in Berlin-Lichterfelde. An unsourced copy of the database was published online by the [http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx Holocaust Era Assets and Restitution Taskforce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109175142/http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx |date=2013-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery by German customs authorities==
In 2010 German customs officers detained Cornelius Gurlitt entering Germany from Switzerland carrying €9,000 (£7,500; $13,000) in cash,&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; which he explained as the proceeds of a transaction with the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Gurlitt was allowed to go on his way, but he had aroused suspicions. Further investigation by the prosecutor's office, the federal police and the tax authorities uncovered a number of anomalies.&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Investigators discovered that Gurlitt had never been employed, had no obvious source of income, was not registered with the {{ill|Einwohnermeldeamt|de}} or with the tax authorities or social services, had never married, and had no pension or health insurance.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In late February 2012, the authorities searched his apartment, finding more than a thousand paintings valued at as much as €1 billion.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/kunst/1500-werke-von-picasso-bis-chagall-zollfahnder-entdecken-sensationellen-kunstschatz-in-muenchen_aid_1147066.html|title=Fahnder entdecken 1500 Werke von Picasso, Chagall und weiteren Künstlern|work=Focus|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24794970|title=Nazi looted art 'found in Munich'|publisher=BBC News|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAZ_Nov22&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-ein-dementi-weitere-meldungen-nuechterne-schaetzungen-12674903.html|title=Schwabinger Kunstfund: Ein Dementi, weitere Meldungen, nüchterne Schätzungen|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' stated that at least 200 pieces were believed to have been lost during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;
The paintings recovered included works by &lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Canaletto]], Marc Chagall, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Christoph|de}}, [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], Otto Dix, [[Albrecht Dürer]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Erich Fraaß|de}}, [[Conrad Felixmüller]], [[Bonaventura Genelli]], [[Ludwig Godenschweg]], [[Otto Griebel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Paul Klee]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Kretzschmar|de}}, [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Wilhelm Lachnit]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Maskos|de}}, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Carl Spitzweg]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Christoph Voll]].

==Initial legal handling of the Gurlitt case==
On 5 November 2013, Reinhard Nemetz, the head of the prosecutors' office in [[Augsburg]], said that 121 framed and 1,258 unframed works had been seized from the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt in early March 2012,&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; including unregistered works by Chagall, Dix, Liebermann, and Matisse.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24818541|title=Nazi trove in Munich contains unknown works by masters|publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian who first examined the collection, [[Meike Hoffmann]], claimed in print in 2010 that "not a single one" of these works was ever acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt. Dr. Meike Hoffmann wishes to remark that this controversy derives from a misreading of her book on Bernhard A. Böhmer. In her book, the art historical term ‘Bildwerke’ is used. The term refers only to sculptures, which indeed Hildebrand Gurlitt did not take from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. Of course, Meike Hoffmann has never questioned the fact that Hildebrandt Gurlitt dealt with other kinds of artworks from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman's book (in German) ''Ein Händler "entarteter" Kunst: Bernhard A. Böhmer und sein Nachlass.'' Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-05-004498-9}}. (''Schriften der Forschungsstelle "Entartete Kunst"''),  p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; She stated to ''Focus'' that as many as 300 pieces had appeared in the 1937 Nazi [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970/&gt; At the time of the interview with ''Focus'', she was trying to trace the original owners of the works and their surviving relatives.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Art historians asked that a complete list of the paintings be published in order that they be returned to their rightful owners.&lt;ref name=Telg10424957&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10424957/Art-experts-demand-Germany-releases-list-of-1-billion-Nazi-art-trove.html | title=Art experts demand Germany releases list of €1-billion Nazi art trove | work=The Telegraph | date=4 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Alexander, Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine in November 2013, Cornelius insisted that his father had obtained the works legally and stated that he would not voluntarily return any of them to previous owners.&lt;ref name=BBCSpiegel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24977814|title=Nazi-looted art: German collector says he owns pictures |date=17 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/spiegel-interview-with-cornelius-gurlitt-about-munich-art-find-a-933953.htm | title=Interview with a Phantom: Cornelius Gurlitt Shares the Secrets of His Pictures | work=Der Spiegel | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Gezer, Õzlem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling threatened by the intense media attention, Gurlitt's brother-in-law offered 22 works in his possession to the police for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10439168/Art-dealer-paid-Nazis-just-4000-Swiss-Francs-for-masterpieces.html|title=Art dealer paid Nazis just 4,000 Swiss Francs for masterpieces|last=Barnett |first=Louise|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 November 2013|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCStuttgart&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24910093|title=German police check new art haul near Stuttgart |date=12 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' revealed that they had received a letter from Gurlitt telling them that "the name Gurlitt may not appear in your magazine." Gurlitt then told two reporters from the ''[[Paris Match]]'', who confronted him in a Munich supermarket, that "Applause from the wrong side is the worst thing there is." ''Der Spiegel'' found this comment "puzzling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/cornelius-gurlitt-reporter-spueren-den-kunstsammler-in-muenchen-auf-a-932755.html ''Der Spiegel''], 11 November 2013 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of a woman'' by [[Henri Matisse]] was directly traceable to the collection of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], a Jewish art dealer from Paris who had represented [[Matisse]] and [[Picasso]] and who had been forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|title=German police recover 1,500 modernist masterpieces 'looted by Nazis'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When approached by ''Focus'', Rosenberg's granddaughter, French television presenter [[Anne Sinclair]], who had been fighting for decades for the return of the art dealer's paintings, stated that she knew nothing of the existence of the painting.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2486251/Discovered-Billion-pound-art-collection-seized-Nazis-ordered-destroyed-discovered-rotting-food-dishevelled-Munich-apartment.html#ixzz2jbOnohDE|title=£1billion art collection seized by Nazis found in shabby Munich apartment|author=Hall, Alan|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery efforts for ''Portrait of a woman'' were immediately undertaken on behalf of the Rosenberg heirs by [[Art Recovery Group|Christopher A.

It is believed the work was sold to a collector in Florida in 2002.

One of the last pieces that Cornelius Gurlitt sold was ''The Lion Tamer'' by Max Beckmann. After a settlement, initiated by the Lempertz auction house in Cologne, was reached between Gurlitt and the heirs of [[Alfred Flechtheim]], it was auctioned off for nearly £750,000.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Another work was reportedly sold in 1990 through the [[Bern]]-based gallery of [[Eberhard Kornfeld]].&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"/&gt;

In March 2014, a BBC reporter was granted access to one of the locations where 238 of the seized works were stored. He viewed works such as [[Monet]]'s ''[[Waterloo Bridge (painting)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1903) and others by [[Picasso]], [[Cezanne]], [[Liebermann]], [[Renoir]], [[Courbet]], and [[Manet]].&lt;ref name="BBC 20140326"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26746697 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: One lonely man and his hoard of stolen Nazi art |last=Evans |first=Stephen |publisher=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2014, a month before Gurlitt's death, an agreement was reached whereby the seized artwork was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with the government-led task force charged with determining which of the pieces was stolen and returning them to the rightful heirs.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"/&gt;

===Schwabinger (Gurlitt) Art Trove Task Force===
An entity called the Schwabinger Kunstfund or Gurlitt Task Force was created to research the provenance of the paintings in the Gurlitt trove. However, after several years of operations under the direction of Ingeborg Berggreen-Merkel it was widely criticized for having few results and little visibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/task-force-investigating-art-trove-inherited-from-nazi-collector-achieved-embarrassing-results/a-18876659&lt;/ref&gt;

Berggreen-Merkel was accused of visiting the severely ill Gurlitt at his hospital bed and persuading him to sign over the ownership of his collection, allegedly as the only way to prevent Gurlitt from getting sued from various interest groups, Jewish or other. In early 2014 Gurlitt designated the Kunstmuseum as his sole heir. A few weeks earlier, Berggreen-Merkel had met with the President of the Museum's Foundation Council, Christoph Schäublin. One year later, her taskforce was dissolved. "We are disappointed," said Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taskforce-kunstfund.de/en/chronology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/gurlitt-und-die-folgen-des-schwabinger-kunstfunds-kunstmuseum-bern-tritt-gurlitt-erbe-an/11021442.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/Laesst-sich-Bern-die-grosse-GurlittAusstellung-wegschnappen-/story/31357598&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Gurlitt, and after==
Cornelius Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Nazi art' hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27298832|work=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, written on his deathbed, Gurlitt named the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]] in Switzerland as his sole heir.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014" /&gt;  People close to Gurlitt told an American newspaper that he decided to give the collection to a foreign institution because he felt that Germany had treated him and his father badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-museum-close-to-accepting-nazi-era-art-bequest-1416443643 |title= Swiss Museum Close to Accepting Trove of Nazi Art|last1= Lane|first1= Mary M.|date= November 20, 2014|publisher= ''The Wall Street Journal'' |access-date= 13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy included the paintings Gurlitt had kept in Salzburg, paintings which German authorities had not confiscated because their remit did not extend to property held in Austria. Gurlitt's decision created further controversy over the appropriateness of the museum accepting this bequest. The will stipulated that the museum would be required to research the provenance of the paintings and make restitution as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum decided to accept those works which are not legally the property of previous Nazi-era owners, or their heirs, and has entered into a joint-agreement with German and Swiss authorities about the handling of this bequest.

Gurlitt's family (cousins) also entered the discussion, raising questions about the legality of the will, based on his state of mind at the time. Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a claim of inheritance on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the rightful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from [[schizoid personality disorder]], delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die 'Causa Gurlitt': Leichtgradig Kompliziert|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/die-causa-gurlitt-leichtgradig-kompliziert-13273066.html|work=Franffurter Algemeine|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means.&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article121499967/Wie-Picassos-in-einer-vermuellten-Wohnung-landeten.html | title=Wie Picassos in einer vermüllten Wohnung landeten | work=Die Welt | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Dittmar, Peter | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as "degenerate art".&lt;ref name="Schwabing art trove"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.lostart.de/Content/02_Aktuelles/2013/13-11-15%20PM%20Taskforce_EN.html?nn=9848 | title=Schwabing art trove: Provenance of treasures to be researched alongside criminal proceedings – suspicious works being publicised at lostart.de | publisher=the Bavarian State Ministry of Justice, the Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art objects continued to surface after Gurlitt's death. In July 2014, a new discovery was made in his Munich apartment: two sculptures, possibly the work of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name=sculptures&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28464629 |title=Possible Rodin and Degas works found at Gurlitt home |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a landscape by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase Gurlitt had left in a hospital where he stayed.&lt;ref name=suitcase&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29085509 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: Monet found in art hoarder's suitcase |publisher=BBC |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
German newspapers questioned the prosecutor's right to seize the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Voss |first=Julia |date=17 November 2013 |title=Münchner Kunstfund: Wo bleibt der Rechtsstaat? |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/muenchner-kunstfund-wo-bleibt-der-rechtsstaat-12668607.html |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-politische-strafjustiz-12678004.html ''Politische Strafjustiz''] (in German) in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 25 November 2013, by Volker Rieble.&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights in cases of works of art acquired during the Nazi period are highly complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dittmar |first=Peter |date=7 November 2013 |title=Verbrechen lohnt sich |newspaper=Jüdische Allgemeine |url=http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/17492 |language=de}}. This article refers in particular to works of ''[[degenerate art]]'', whose confiscation had been formalized by a Nazi law. ''Gesetz über Einziehung von Erzeugnissen entarteter Kunst'' (Act on the Confiscation of Works of Degenerate Art) of 31 May 1938&lt;/ref&gt; After the war the Nazi law legalizing possession of stolen works of ''[[degenerate art]]'' was deliberately upheld by the [[Allied Control Council]] in order that the trade in artworks could continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 Heuer, Carl-Heinz (undated). "Die eigentumsrechtliche Problematik der ''entarteten'' Kunst" – "The problems surrounding ownership rights to ''degenerate'' art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235653/http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 |date=2 December 2013 }} (bilingual), on the website of the [[Free University of Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;''Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998'' (''Art Return Law 1998'') See the [[:de:Restitution (Österreich)#Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998|German Wikipedia entry]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no law in effect in Germany requiring the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the [[Wiedergutmachung|1998 Washington Agreement]], Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries&lt;ref&gt;The [http://raubgut.zlb.de/index.php/About/Index_en Central and Regional Library of Berlin] is the only library in Germany to have full-time staff devoted to the search for Nazi-looted cultural goods.&lt;/ref&gt; have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. A failure on the part of the German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might have been a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2013/48/gurlitt-kunstwerke-raubkunst/seite-1 ''Fluch des Schatzes''] (''Curse of the Treasure'') in ''Der Zeit'', 21 November 2013 (in German). ''“German museums are accordingly, albeit rather hesitantly, searching for looted art in their collections, and from time to time works are returned. This is cumbersome, mostly unspectacular and takes far too long, but it is still the right way. But Cornelius Gurlitt is a private person, and therefore the principles of the Washington Agreement do not apply to his artworks. He cannot be forced, and it appears the government wants to seize the works, which is hardly possible in the face of the constitution.”''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2013, prominent German art historian [[Sibylle Ehringhaus]], who was one of the first experts to view the artworks in the spring of 2012, gave an interview in the newspaper ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'', demanding the immediate return of the complete collection to Gurlitt. However, she had looked at the works very briefly and had not researched their [[provenance]] because, as she stated in the interview, "Cornelius Gurlitt commissioned neither myself nor anyone else" to perform such research. Chief Prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz vehemently denied her appeal, yet apparently failed to cite any concrete legal grounds for the seizure.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Interview-Kunstexpertin-fordert-Rueckgabe-aller-Bilder-an-Gurlitt-id27983722.html Interview: Kunstexpertin fordert Rückgabe aller Bilder an Gurlitt], ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 4 December 2012 (in German) or a [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001010/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} of the article in English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Augsburger-Staatsanwaltschaft-weist-Vorwuerfe-der-Kunstexpertin-zurueck-id27992202.html Augsburger Staatsanwaltschaft weist Vorwürfe der Kunstexpertin zurück] ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 5 December 2012 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, the German jurist [[Jutta Limbach]], the head of the Limbach Commission on Nazi-looted art, confirmed the opinion of the German ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' newspaper that the Bavarian "State Prosecutor used an incorrect application of the tax liability law to seize" the artworks of Cornelius Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', ''Ein Bild lässt sich abhangen, Schuld nicht'' (in German; English: "A picture may be taken down, but not the guilt"), interview by Heribert Prantl and Kia Vahland, 20 November 2014, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the artworks have been returned to the heirs of the legitimate owners, notably a portrait by Matisse restored to the heirs of French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. Another major painting from the collection, ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' (1901), by [[Max Liebermann]], was returned to the heirs of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann,&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Melissa (May&amp;nbsp;15, 2015).

==Swiss museum's acceptance of Gurlitt's estate==
On 24 November 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Bern]] agreed to accept the Gurlitt estate.  Museum officials stated that no art looted by the Nazis would be permitted to enter the museum's collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious&gt;{{cite web| url = https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gurlitt-collection-arrives-kunstmuseum-bern-1018277| title = The Notorious Gurlitt Trove of Nazi-Tainted Art Makes Its First Appearance at Kunstmuseum Bern| author = Neuendorf, Henri| date = July 10, 2017| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = artmet.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 500 works were to remain in Germany until their rightful owners could be identified. Three pieces were singled out for immediate return: [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Femme Assise'' to the descendants of the Jewish art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Max Liebermann's ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' to the great-nephew of the industrialist and art collector [[David Friedmann]], and [[Carl Spitzweg]]'s ''Playing the Piano'' to the heirs of music publisher [[Henri Hinrichsen]], who was murdered at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30176190 |title=Swiss museum to accept Gurlitt 'Nazi art' |publisher=BBC News |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public display of the Gurlitt art trove took place at an exhibition curated by the Bern Fine Art Museum, running from November 2017 to March 2018, which featured 160 works from the controversial Gurlitt art collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/bern-fine-arts-museum_gurlitt-exhibition-attracts-droves-of-visitors/43793524| title = Gurlitt exhibition attracts droves of visitors| date = January 2, 2018| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = Swissinfo.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anachronism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνά}} {{lang|grc-Latn|ana}}, "against" and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}} {{lang|grc-Latn|khronos}}, "time") is a [[chronology|chronological]] inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of persons, events, objects, or customs from different periods of time. The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period in time that is placed outside its proper temporal domain.

An anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period. Anachronism can also be used for purposes of rhetoric, comedy, or shock. Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer, artist, or performer is unaware of differences in technology, language, customs, attitudes, or fashions between different historical eras.

==Types== 
[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493) shows [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] in scholar's clothing of the book's time, 1,800 years too modern for Aristotle]]

=== Parachronism &lt;!-- 'Parachronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''parachronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|παρά}}, "on the side", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found (though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible).

This may be an object, idiomatic expression, technology, philosophical idea, musical style, material, custom, or anything else so closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era.  They may be objects or ideas that were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate.  They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion.

Examples of parachronisms could include a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 using a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]] for laundry (well after [[washing machine]]s had become the norm); or a teenager from that time period being an avid fan of [[ragtime]] music. Often, a parachronism is identified when a work based on a particular era's state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era—with a different state of knowledge.  Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings, and works of [[speculative fiction]] often find their speculations outstripped by real-world technological developments or scientific discoveries.

=== Prochronism &lt;!-- 'Prochronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''prochronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πρό}}, "before", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is an impossible anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time (e.g. ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] at the top of the article). A prochronism may be an object not yet developed, a verbal expression that had not yet been coined, a philosophy not yet formulated, a breed of animal not yet evolved (or perhaps engineered), or use of a technology that had not yet been created.

===Behavioral and cultural anachronism===
The intentional use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a [[top hat]], write with a [[quill]], or carry on a conversation in Latin. Such choices may reflect an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] or an [[aesthetic]] preference.

[[Image:Constantin Lecca - Infratirea moldovenilor si muntenilor.jpg|thumb|''Moldavians and [[Muntenia]]ns Become Brothers'': 19th-century flags in 16th-century scene]]
== Politically motivated anachronism ==
Some writings and works of art promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is. For example, the 19th-century Romanian painter [[Constantin Lecca]] depicts the peace agreement between [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Ioan Bogdan Voievod]] and [[Radu cel Mare|Radu Voievod]]—two leaders in Romania's 16th-century history—with the flags of [[Moldavia]] (blue-red) and of [[Wallachia]] (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags date only from the 1830s. Here anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of Moldavia and  Wallachia into the [[Kingdom of Romania]] at the time the painting was made.

== Art and literature ==
[[File:Lucas van Leyden - Lot and his Daughters - WGA12932.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucas van Leyden]]'s 1520 painting ''Lot and His Daughters'' shows Biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] as a typical Dutch city of the painter's time.]]
Anachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. It is only since the close of the 18th century that this kind of deviation from historical reality has jarred on a general audience.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Sir [[Walter Scott]] justified the use of anachronism in historical literature: "It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Scott |authorlink=Walter Scott |title=Ivanhoe; a Romance |place=Edinburgh |year=1820 |volume=1 |page=xvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzQJAAAAQAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as fashions move on, such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect, as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented, nor to the present, but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created. "Nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period", writes [[Anthony Grafton]]; "Hearing a mother in a historical movie of the 1940s call out 'Ludwig! [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]! Come in and practice your piano now!' we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it, and plunged directly into the American bourgeois world of the filmmaker."&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anachronism can also be an aesthetic choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174817-for-infidelity-reconsidering-aesthetic-anachronism/|title=For Infidelity: Reconsidering Aesthetic Anachronism|last=Potthast|first=Jane|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-18|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronisms abound in the works of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Raphael Santi: His Life and His Works|last=von Wolzogen|first=Alfred Freiherr|publisher=[[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]|year=1866|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZhAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare and the Uses of Antiquity: An Introductory Essay|last=Martindale |first=Michelle |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2005 |isbn=9781134848508 |pages=121–125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDwrK5FNnN0C&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in those of less celebrated painters and playwrights of earlier times. Anachronisms can exist in ancient texts. [[Carol Meyers]] says that these anachronisms can be used to better understand the stories by asking what the anachronism represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/02/14/276782474/the-genesis-of-camels |title=Archaeology Find: Camels In 'Bible' Are Literary Anachronisms|last=Montagne|first=Renee |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2014-02-14|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated anachronisms and historical errors can become an accepted part of popular culture, such as Roman legionaries that wear leather armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-03-31/time-meddlers-anachronisms-in-print-and-on-film|title=Time meddlers: anachronisms in print and on film|last=Cole|first=Tom|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=2011-03-31|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumb|[[Dinosaurs]] co-existing with [[hominid]]s, as here in ''[[The Flintstones]]'', is a relatively common anachronistic depiction in comics and animated cartoons.]]
=== Comical anachronism ===
[[Comedy]] fiction set in the past may use anachronism for humorous effect. Comedic anachronism can be used to make serious points about both historical and modern society, such as drawing parallels to political or social conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174969-hollywood-history-and-the-art-of-the-big-anachronism/|title=Hollywood, History, and the Art of the Big Anachronism|last=van Riper|first=A. Bowdoin|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-26|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future anachronism === &lt;!-- Section is linked from the redirected [Future anachronism] article; use caution. --&gt;
{{see also|Retrofuturism}}
[[File:Amazing_stories_193107.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In the future envisioned on this 1931 cover of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', [[Propeller (aeronautics) |propeller airplanes]] would coexist with [[space technology]] advanced enough for a large-scale [[colonization of Mars]].]]

Even with careful research, [[science fiction]] writers risk anachronism as their works age because they cannot predict all political and technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction|last1=Athans|first1=Philip|authorlink1=Philip Athans|last2=Salvatore|first2=R. A.|authorlink2=R. A. Salvatore|publisher=[[Adams Media]]|year=2010|isbn=9781440507298|pages=167–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9l5JO_FM6cC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, many books and films nominally set in the mid-21st century or later refer to the [[Soviet Union]], to [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia as [[Leningrad]], to [[Cold War|the continuing struggle between the Eastern and Western Blocs]] and to [[History of Germany (1945–90)|divided Germany and divided Berlin]]. ''[[Star Trek]]'' has suffered from future anachronisms; instead of "[[Retroactive continuity|retconning]]" these errors, the [[Star Trek (film)|2009 film]] retained them for consistency with older franchises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/living-the-star-trek-life/|title=Living the Star Trek life|last=Glaskowsky|first=Peter|work=[[CNET]]|date=2009-05-08|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Buildings or natural features, such as the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], can become out of place once they disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/12/06/AR2005033116653.html|title='Empire': Gangster Tale Sleeps With the Fishes|last=Hornaday|first=Ann|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2002-12-06|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language anachronism ===
[[Language]] anachronisms in novels and films are quite common, both intentional and unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/26/172955182/historical-vocab-when-we-get-it-wrong-does-it-matter|title=Historical Vocab: When We Get It Wrong, Does It Matter?|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|work=[[NPR]]|date=2013-02-26|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentional anachronisms inform the audience more readily about a film set in the past. In this regard, language and pronunciation change so fast that most modern people (even many scholars) would find it difficult, or even impossible, to understand a film with dialogue in 15th-century English; thus, we [[Suspension of disbelief|willingly accept]] characters speaking an updated language, and modern [[slang]] and figures of speech are often used in these films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-3-26-00-on-language-anachronism.html|title=The Way We Live Now: 3-26-00: On Language; Anachronism |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2000-03-26|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subconscious anachronism==
[[File:RR5011-0017R.gif|thumbnail|right|A Russian commemorative coin depicting the meeting of Soviet and American troops at [[Torgau]] in 1945 shows the 50-star [[flag of the United States of America]], a flag not in use until 1960. The US flag used during the Second World War had 48 stars.]]

Unintentional anachronisms may occur even in what are intended as wholly objective and accurate records or representations of historic artifacts and artworks, because the recorder's perspective is conditioned by the assumptions and practices of his or her own times (a form of [[cultural bias]]). One example is the attribution of historically inaccurate beards to various [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Effigy|tomb effigies]] and figures in [[Medieval stained glass|stained glass]] in records made by English [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]] of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Working in an age in which beards were in fashion and widespread, the antiquaries seem to have subconsciously projected the fashion back into an era in which it was rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver D. |title=Beards: true and false |journal=Church Monuments |volume=28 |year=2013 |pages=124–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time travel==
The extensive science fiction subgenre depicting [[Time travel in fiction| time travel]] in effect consists of deliberate, consciously created anachronisms, letting people of one time meet and interact with those of another time. Covers of time-travel books often depict deliberate anachronisms of this kind. For example, the cover of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' (1992) features a portrait of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] holding an [[AK-47]] rifle.

== In academia ==
In historical writing, the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political, social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another. The anachronistic application of present-day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]]. [[Empiricism|Empiricist]] [[historian]]s, working in the traditions established by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in the 19th century, regard this as a great error, and a trap to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Davies |title=Empiricism and History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2003 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that "a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that "anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing, as in early-20th-century scholarship's use of [[Translatio imperii]], first formulated in the 12th century, to interpret 10th-century literature.

The use of anachronism in a rhetorical or hyperbolic sense is more complex. To refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the First [[Reich]], for example, is technically inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise; the application of theory to works which predate [[Marxist]], [[Feminist]] or [[Freudian]] subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice. In most cases, however, the practitioner will acknowledge or justify the use or context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Detection of anachronism==

The ability to identify anachronisms may be employed as a critical and forensic tool to demonstrate the fraudulence of a document or artifact purporting to be from an earlier time. [[Anthony Grafton]] discusses, for example, the work of the 3rd-century philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], of [[Isaac Casaubon]] (1559–1614), and of [[Richard August Reitzenstein|Richard Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931), all of whom succeeded in exposing literary forgeries and plagiarisms, such as those included in the "[[Hermetica|Hermetic Corpus]]", through – among other techniques – the recognition of anachronisms.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, pp. 75–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of anachronisms is an important element within the scholarly discipline of [[diplomatics]], the critical analysis of the forms of documents, developed by the [[Maurist]] scholar [[Jean Mabillon]] (1632–1707) and his successors [[René-Prosper Tassin]] (1697–1777) and [[Charles-François Toustain]] (1700–1754). The philosopher and reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote at the beginning of the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The falsehood of a writing will often be detected, by its making direct mention of, or allusions more or less indirect to, some fact posterior to the date which it bears. ... ''The mention of posterior facts;'' – first indication of forgery.&lt;br&gt;

In a living language there are always variations in words, in the meaning of words, in the construction of phrases, in the manner of spelling, which may detect the age of a writing, and lead to legitimate suspicions of forgery. ... ''The use of words not used till after the date of the writing;'' – second indication of forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham |authorlink=Jeremy Bentham |title=A Treatise on Judicial Evidence |editor-first=Étienne |editor-last=Dumont |editor-link=Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont |place=London |publisher=Baldwin, Cradock and Joy |year=1825 |page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tMsDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exposure by [[Lorenzo Valla]] in 1440 of the so-called [[Donation of Constantine]], a decree purportedly issued by the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] in either 315 or 317 AD, as a later forgery, depended to a considerable degree on the identification of anachronisms, such as references to the city of [[Constantinople]] (a name not in fact bestowed until 330 AD). A large number of apparent [[anachronisms in the Book of Mormon]] have served to convince critics that the book was written in the 19th century, and not, as its adherents claim, in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. The use of 19th- and 20th-century [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] terminology demonstrates that the purported "[[Franklin Prophecy]]" (attributed to [[Benjamin Franklin]], who died in 1790) is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/franklin_prophecy/print.asp |title=Anti-Semitic Myth: The Franklin "Prophecy" |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ""[[William Lynch speech]]", an address, supposedly delivered in 1712, on the control of slaves in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], is now considered to be a 20th-century forgery, partly on account of its use of anachronistic terms such as "program" and "refueling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/question/may04.htm |title=Is Willie Lynch's Letter Real? |last=Cobb |first=W.

The '''Australian National Wildlife Collection''' ('''ANWC''') is a collection of almost 200,000 [[zoology|zoological]] [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s, including skeletons, skins, spirit specimens, birds’ eggs, frozen tissue samples and a wildlife sound library, mainly of [[vertebrate]] animals from [[Australia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], which are stored in a secure, climate-controlled facility.  It is based at [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] Sustainable Ecosystems Division in the [[Australian Capital Territory]].

==History==
The ANWC was established in 1966, though its origins date from the late 1950s when scientists in the CSIRO’s Wildlife Survey section were collecting specimens in the course of their work and were concerned that their individual collections should not be dispersed and should be accessible at a central location for long-term security and so that comparative studies could be made.  The decision to establish a central facility was made by [[Harold James Frith|Harold Frith]], Chief of the Division of Wildlife.  The founding Curator, later Director, was [[Richard Schodde]], who held the post for nearly thirty years.  It was formally recognised and named the Australian National Wildlife Collection in 1976 through [[gazettal]] by the [[Government of Australia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2729">'''The Awaze Tribune''' ('''AwazeTribune''') is an Eritrean [[news satire]] organization that publishes articles on international, national, and local news. Based in [[Asmara]], Eritrea.  The website carries articles that may cover current events, both real and fictional, satirizing the tone and format of traditional news organizations with stories, editorials, [[op-ed]] pieces, and [[Vox populi|man-in-the-street]] interviews using a traditional news website layout and an editorial voice modeled after [[the New York Times]], and the usage of the [[AP Stylebook|AP Style]] of news writing.

== History ==
The articles of AwazeTribune mostly revolve around the coverage of real or imaginary events in a satirical and offbeat way, taking again most of the press codes. AwazeTribune appeared first an element on [[Twitter]] that began in February 2016, during the American Presidential Elections, before being transformed to becoming a website. Since then, many of its articles were relayed in the press.

In its about page, the website claims to have been founded in 32 A.D., to have covered the [[baptism]] of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and the birth of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Mohammad]], and to receive 14 billion unique daily hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://awazetribune.com/index.php/about/|title=About|date=2016-07-02|newspaper=Awaze Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the curators is yet unknown, in a recent interview with [[Radio France Internationale]], one of the anonymous personalities associated with the website flatly declined to be identified stating that " the message of AT outweighs the identity of the curators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20161114-erythree-awase-site-parodique-actualite-denoncer-dictature|title=Erythrée: Awaze, un site parodique d’actualité pour dénoncer la dictature - RFI|newspaper=RFI Afrique|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Many users of social media have taken AwazeTribune articles to be literal (especially those which address controversial topics), and have expressed their anger and confusion online failing, according to one of the website's managers, to 'comprehend that the site makes a [[tongue-in-cheek]] news commentary revolving around the secretive Eritrean regime'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://information.tv5monde.com/afrique/en-erythree-l-humour-est-la-politesse-du-desespoir-138929|title=En Erythrée, l'humour du Awaze Tribune est la politesse du désespoir|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=TV5MONDE|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5243">'''BC Agriculture in the Classroom Foundation''' (BCAITC) is a registered [[nonprofit organization]] that works with educators through various programs to bring [[British Columbia|British Columbia's]] agriculture to elementary and secondary students within the province. Students learn about where their food comes from, how to grow their own food, and why farms and agriculture play such an important role in our society.

== Governance ==
The foundation is part of a national group, [http://www.aitc.ca/ Agriculture in the Classroom] that operates across [[Canada]] through individual provinces. Though partially supported by government, the foundation relies on financial support from the agricultural community to sustain its activities.

The organization's mission is: "Working to bring BC's agriculture to our students".

The foundation has representation on its board of directors from [[teachers]], the provincial government, [[financial institutions]], [[nutritionists]], producers, and [[dieticians]].

==Teacher Resources and Programs==

BCAITC's resource centre provides teachers with print and video resources.&lt;ref&gt;BCAITC Resources http://www.aitc.ca/bc/index.php?page=resources&lt;/ref&gt; With titles such as The Sustainability Road Show, Wonderful Worms, Food For Thought,&lt;ref&gt;Metro Vancouver http://www.metrovancouver.org/region/teachers/Pages/AgricultureFood4Thought.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227083651/http://www.metrovancouver.org/region/teachers/Pages/AgricultureFood4Thought.aspx |date=2011-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spuds In Tubs, teachers from all grades are encouraged to bring resources into their classroom and have developed different programs to help spread awareness of agriculture and the importance of eating healthy and supporting local producers.&lt;ref&gt;BCAITC Programs http://www.aitc.ca/bc/index.php?page=programs&lt;/ref&gt;

===Take a Bite of BC===

Take a Bite of BC was developed in 2009 by BCAITC in partnership with the BC Culinary Arts Association, BC agricultural commodity groups and BC producers. BC grown products are donated to the program and delivered to participating secondary school teaching kitchens over a four-month period. The program provides an opportunity for Chef Instructors to feature locally grown product in secondary school teaching kitchens.&lt;ref&gt;Vancouver Sun https://vancouversun.com/business/Students+serve+tasty+Bite/4463235/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Students gain experience working with fresh products and begin to develop an appreciation for [[farmers]] in their community as they connect with the foods that are grown around them and learn about the benefits of eating healthy, fresh and local. As of the 2016/2017 school year, all 60 secondary schools with culinary arts programs are benefiting from this program.  {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

===Spuds in Tubs===

BCAITC's signature program, Spuds in Tubs enables students to experience growing their own food. With the help of a teacher, students plant seed potatoes into tubs, and from there tend them and watch them grow into something they can harvest and eat. There are currently 125 classrooms and 3,250 students participating {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

===The BC School Fruit and Vegetable Nutritional Program===

The foundation's biggest program, the BC School Fruit and Vegetable Nutritional Program, partners with local producers to deliver fresh, local fruits and [[vegetables]] to BC schools. In 2011 a three million dollar expansion of the program was announced and the program will now reach over 1,200 schools in BC, and serve over 400,000 students with fresh fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;BC Government http://www2.news.gov.bc.ca/news_releases_2009-2013/2011PREM0051-000552.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summer Institute==

The Summer Institute is a course put on by BCAITC for teachers who want to learn more about [[agriculture]]. This course is designed for teachers in the BC school system to explore practical ways to integrate concepts related to [[food production]] and consumption, [[food safety]], agricultural issues, and [[sustainability]] across the curriculum at all grade levels.  Through active participation, field trips, guest speakers, video presentations, and the like, participants will expand their knowledge of agriculture and food concepts and issues and reflect on their own values and orientations to the topic.  Ways to incorporate this new knowledge into existing courses will be explored with ethical defensibility being the guiding principle.  The goal is to produce curriculum projects that can be implemented in schools or other settings. The course is put on in partnership with the [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;UBC http://www.eplt.educ.ubc.ca/courses/home-economics-education-summer-institutes-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tanakh OT |deutero}}
The '''Wisdom of Solomon''' or '''Book of Wisdom''' is a Jewish work, written in Greek, composed in [[Alexandria]] (Egypt). Generally dated to the 2nd century BC, the central theme of the work is "Wisdom" itself, appearing under two principal aspects. In its relation to man, Wisdom is the perfection of knowledge of the righteous as a gift from God showing itself in action. In direct relation to God, Wisdom is with God from all eternity.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}} It is one of the seven [[Sapiential Books|Sapiential]] or wisdom books included within the [[Septuagint]], along with [[Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Song of Songs]] (Song of Solomon), [[Book of Job|Job]], and [[Wisdom of Sirach|Sirach]], and is included in the canon of [[Deuterocanonical books]] by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the ''anagignoskomena'' (Gr. ἀναγιγνωσκόμενα, meaning "those which are to be read") of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

==Structure, genre and content==
The structure can be divided into three sections:{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=22-23}}
# Book of [[Eschatology]]
#* exhortation to justice
#* speech of the impious, contrasts of the wicked and the just
#* exhortation to wisdom
# Book of Wisdom
#* Solomon's speech concerning wisdom, wealth, power and prayer
# Book of History
#* introduction, followed by diptychs of plagues
#* digression on God's power and mercy
#* digression on false worship and further plagues
#* recapitulation and concluding [[doxology]].

The book is addressed to the rulers of the earth, urging them to love righteousness and seek wisdom; the wicked think that all is chance and that they should enjoy each day, but they are deluded.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=13}} In the second section Solomon (not explicitly named, but strongly implied) tells of his search for wisdom.

The Wisdom of Solomon can be linked to several forms of ancient literature, both Jewish and non-Jewish, but it clearly belongs with biblical Wisdom books such as [[the Book of Job]], one of only five such books among ancient Jewish literature.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=25}} In terms of classical genre it has been identified as an [[encomium]] and with the Greek genre of the "exhortatory discourse", by which a teacher attempts to persuade others to a certain course of action.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=25-26}}

The Book of Wisdom was listed as canonical by the [[Council of Rome]] (382 AD),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/decretum_eng.htm Decretum Galasianum]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Synod of Hippo]] (393),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xv.iv.iv.xxv.html |chapter=Canon XXIV.

F. Westcott, ''A General Survey of the History of the Canon of the New Testament'' (5th ed. Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 440, 541-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3816.htm Council of Carthage (in 419) Canon 24]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Florence]] (in 1442)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/FLORENCE.HTM Session 11—4 February 1442]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Council of Trent]] (in 1546).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/TRENT4.htm Session IV Celebrated on the eighth day of April, 1546 under Pope Paul III]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The Wisdom of Solomon was written in Greek, in [[Alexandria]] (Egypt), in the late 1st century BC to early 1st century AD; the author's prime literary source was the [[Septuagint]], in particular the [[Wisdom literature]] and the [[Book of Isaiah]], and he was familiar with late Jewish works as the [[Book of Enoch]] and with Greek philosophical literature.{{sfn|Hayman|2003|p=763}} It is uncertain whether the book has a single author or comes from a school of writers, but recent scholarship has favoured regarding it as a unified work.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=24}} In either case its blend of Greek and Jewish features suggests a learned Hellenistic background, and despite the address to the "rulers of the world" the actual audience was probably members of the author's own community who were tempted to give up their Jewishness in the face of the temptations of Greek culture and the hostile conditions facing Jews in the Greek world.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}}

==Themes==
The book opens with the opposed pairs righteousness/unrighteousness and death/immortality: those who do not follow righteousness will fall into "senseless reasoning" and will not be open to wisdom; wisdom is not an inherent human quality nor one that can be taught, but comes from outside, and only to those who are prepared through righteousness.{{sfn|Hayman|2003|p=764}} The suffering of the righteous will be rewarded with immortality, while the wicked will end miserably.{{sfn|Horbury|2007|pp=655-656}} The unrighteous are doomed because they do not know God's purpose, but the righteous will judge the unrighteous in God's presence.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=293}} Lady Wisdom dominates the next section, in which Solomon speaks.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=293}} She existed from the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]], and God is her source and guide.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=293}} She is to be loved and desired, and kings seek her: Solomon himself preferred Wisdom to wealth, health, and all other things.{{sfn|Horbury|2007|p=658}} She in turn has always come to the aid of the righteous, from Adam to the Exodus.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}} The final section takes up the theme of the rescue of the righteous, taking the Exodus as its focus: "You (God) have not neglected to help (your people the Jews) at all times and in all places." (Wisdom of Solomon, 19:22).{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">'''Business Studies''' is an academic subject taught in schools and at [[university]] level in many countries. Its study combines elements of [[accountancy]], [[finance]], [[marketing]], [[organizational studies]] and [[economics]]. '''Business Studies''' is a broad subject in the Social Sciences, allowing the in-depth study of a range of specialties such as accountancy, finance, organisation, [[Human resource management|human resources management]] and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sh.se/p3/ext/content.nsf/aget?openagent&amp;key=about_the_subject_1298025420871|title=Business Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries where Business Studies are taught include [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Malta]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Tanzania]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]

== United Kingdom ==
=== England ===
Business Studies can be taken as part of the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) option for Year 9, Year 10 and Year 11 at [[secondary school]], and also can be taken as part of a [[GCE Advanced Level]] (A-level) course in Year 12 and Year 13. It includes a range of subjects, which give the student general understanding of the various elements of running a business. Subjects covered include, but are not limited to: Business Organization, People in Business, [[Marketing]], Operations &amp; Production, Finance, and [[Strategic Management]].&lt;ref name="BBCBitesize"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/subjects/zpsvr82 | title=GCSE &gt; Business | work=BBC Bitesize | accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business management is an option for National 5&lt;ref name="BBCBitesizeNat5"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/subjects/zd6fcdm | title=National 5 &gt; Business management | work=BBC Bitesize | accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Higher&lt;ref name="BBCBitesizeHigher"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/subjects/zw26n39 | title=Higher &gt; Business management | work=BBC Bitesize | accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; qualifications. Both National 5 and Higher exams cover Understanding business, People, Finance, and Marketing and operations.

=== Entry to UK Higher Education ===
The [[University of Cambridge]] considers Business Studies not to be a 'traditional academic subject', although taking Business Studies individually will not disadvantage students as long as it is identified as 'essential' or 'desirable' for the course being applied for. It is also suitable when applying for [[economics]] at university, if the college the candidate comes from does not offer the economics A-level individually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/requirements/#course Cambridge University entrance requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hungary ==
After finishing [[secondary school]], students in Hungary have the option of either taking an accredited 2-4 semester business course and obtaining a certificate, or applying to college or university. Students can also take part in a 2-semester preparatory business course to have a greater chance of getting accepted by a university. Hungarian business education has been organized according to the Bologna system since 2006. As the first stage of the multi-cycle educational system, a [[Bachelor’s degree]] can be earned within 6-8 semesters. In case a student wishes to further his or her studies, they can opt for a Master’s program lasting another 2-4 semesters.

== People's Republic of Nepal ==
Business studies programmes are widely taught in the [[Nepal|Republic of Nepal]], where it is taught at every colleges of +2 level and also in colleges that provide A-Levels. A number of universities (public and private) are offering business studies programme under the heading of Business Administration.

== Republic of South Africa ==
''Business Studies'' can be taken as an elective subject from a student's Grade 10 year through to their Grade 12 year.

South Africa has many different standards of Education. Some schools vary in the ''Exam Board'', chosen, to educate their students under. The Governmental Department of Education allow for children to write [[National Senior Certificate|NSC]] Examinations; this Board is the most widely used in South Africa. Students from private schools write [[Independent Examinations Board|IEB]] Exams and are taught under IEB-Standards. Lastly, Business Studies can be taken as part of the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]], or can be taken as part of a [[GCE Advanced Level]] (A-level) course in Schools run under the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] Board, providing a British education in South Africa. ''Cambridge Schools'' are of the fewest in South Africa. Business Studies includes a range of subjects, which give the student general understanding of the various elements of running a business.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17484">[[File:Bynesian decay efflorescence.tif|thumb|Crystallized salt clusters ([[efflorescence]]) produced by Byne's disease on a gastropod shell's surface]]

'''Byne's disease''', more accurately known as '''Bynesian decay''', is a peculiar and permanently damaging condition (resulting from an ongoing [[chemical reaction]]) which often attacks [[mollusk shell]]s that are in storage or on [[Display case|display]] for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Sally2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shelton |first=S. |year=1996 |title=The Shell Game: Mollusks Shell Deterioration in Collections and its Prevention |journal=The Festivus |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=74–80 |url=http://s190418054.onlinehome.us/portal/1999/9908mon.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124152217/http://s190418054.onlinehome.us/portal/1999/9908mon.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bynesian decay is a form of [[efflorescence]] of [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] formed by the reaction of [[acid]]ic vapors with the [[base (chemistry)|basic]] shell surface. The efflorescence can sometimes superficially resemble a growth of [[mold]]. Although first described in the early 19th century, Bynesian decay was not well understood until almost a hundred years later. The condition is named after the man (L. Byne) who is best known for describing it in the late 19th century, even though he was not the first person to describe it in print. In addition, Byne mistakenly assumed that the condition was caused by [[bacteria]], and thus the condition came to be referred to as a "disease".

In addition to mollusk shells, various other [[natural history]] [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s are susceptible to this form of decay, including [[eggshell]]s&lt;ref name="RS2001"&gt;Ryhl-Svendsen, M. (2001). [http://iaq.dk/image/eggshell.htm "Bynes efflorescence on an egg shell"]. (IAQ): ''Museums and Archives''.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[fossil]]s and [[mineral]] samples that are composed of [[calcium carbonate]]. This condition is of concern for [[museum]] scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds. In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, non-reactive polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary glues and varnishes in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent reallocation to an archival setting.

==Appearance==

[[File:Bynesian Decay 001.JPG|thumb|Some affected mollusk shells. The efflorescence is clearly visible in both specimens. This decay was deliberately produced under extreme conditions.]]

Byne's disease can appear as a powdery white coating on a shell. It also often looks as if a shell has been "infected" with [[mold]]; however, under magnification the mold-like appearance is revealed to be a crystalline growth of salts.&lt;ref name="Tennent"/&gt;

==History==
In 1839, the [[British people|British]] [[naturalist]] and [[malacologist]] [[Thomas Brown (naturalist)|Thomas Brown]] (1785–1862) briefly mentioned this form of deterioration in his book ''A Conchologist's Text-Book''.&lt;ref name="Sally2"/&gt; Agnes Kenyon also described the condition in 1896, suggesting that "saline particles in the [[atmosphere]] [were] evidently exerting a [[corrosive]] effect".&lt;ref name="Sally2"/&gt;

;Origin of the name

In 1899, the British amateur [[conchology|conchologist]] and [[naturalist]] Loftus St. George Byne (1872–1947)&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;Salisbury A. E. (1951). "Obituaries: Ronald Winckworth, 1884–1950". ''Proceedings of the malacological Society of London'' '''29''' (1951-1953, Part I): [http://mollus.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/29/1/5 5]-6.&lt;/ref&gt; described this condition,&lt;ref name="Callomon"&gt;Callomon, P. [http://www.conchologistsofamerica.org/articles/y2002/0209_callomon.asp "Byne’s Disease – Questions and Answers"]. Accessed 25 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; in a presentation to the [[Conchological Society of Great Britain]] in Ireland, and did so again in another presentation in June of that same year.&lt;ref name="Sally2"/&gt;

{{cquote|1=
...a dullness first pervading the exterior of certain smooth species more markedly e.g. ''[[Conus]]'', ''[[Cypraea]]'', and especially [[Naticidae]]. Then grey acid efflorescence, both tasting and smelling strongly of [[vinegar]] covers the whole surface like a powder, rising doubtless from the interior, and the specimens are soon almost irretrievably ruined.}}

Byne was convinced that [[butyric acid]] was present together with [[calcium acetate]] in the affected shells, although he never really described the methods he used in the so-called "extensive chemical tests" he claimed to  have applied to these [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s. Among other conclusions, he assumed that the butyric acid originated from [[bacteria]]l activity. He also concluded that the decaying effect 'travelled from shell to shell and drawer to drawer',&lt;ref name="Byne"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byne|first=L. St G.|year=1899|title=The corrosion of shells in cabinets|journal=Journal of Conchology|volume=9|issue=6|pages=172–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the condition came to be called a "disease".&lt;ref name=Sally2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's" /&gt;

;Clarification and resolution

The true nature of the "disease" was partially clarified in 1934, when the [[British government]] [[chemist]] John Ralph Nicholls explained that oak cabinets at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London were giving off acetic acid fumes, which were attacking the shells stored in them.&lt;ref name="Sally2"/&gt;

In 1985, almost 150 years after the Byne's disease was first mentioned in the literature, Norman H. Tennent and Thomas Baird published an extensive study on the subject. Their deep analysis, involving many complex and sophisticated techniques such as [[X-Ray diffraction]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[thermogravimetric analysis]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], finally revealed the true nature of the decaying process. They identified the substances involved (the [[calcium]] salts), as well as the [[chemical reaction]]s that originated them. They concluded that Byne's disease is not actually a disease, and is in fact caused by simple chemical reactions which occur in the presence of acidic vapors originating from the immediate environment in which the specimens are stored.&lt;ref name="Tennent"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1506091|last=Tennent|first=N. H.|author2=Baird, T.|year=1985|title=The Deterioration of Mollusca Collections: Identification of Shell Efflorescence|journal=Studies in Conservation|publisher=International Institute For Conservation Of Historic And Artistic Works (IIC)|volume=30|pages=73–85|issn=0039-3630|jstor=1506091|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==

Bynesian decay usually starts when specimens are stored or displayed for considerable periods of time in an enclosed space. The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, cabinets or [[display case]]s are entirely or partially made of [[wood]], [[plywood]] or other wood products such as [[Masonite]], or when the specimens are surrounded by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are [[cellulose]]-based and can turn water vapor [[acid]]ic.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt;

Other potentially damaging materials include non-archival quality [[Paperboard|cardboard]], card, [[paper]], [[cotton]] and [[Cork material|cork]], all of which give off acidic vapors over time. [[PVC]] and [[polyurethane]] plastics are also a problem, as they also degrade and give off acidic vapors with time.&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt; High [[humidity]] of the air is a significant contributing factor, as is lack of ventilation of the specimens. High ambient temperatures can increase the rapidity of the decay.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;

Generally, in cabinets or display cases that are entirely or partially made of wood, the [[hydrolysis]] of [[acetyl]] groups in the wood [[hemicellulose]]s creates [[acetic acid]]. The rate at which the acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of [[esters]] in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment.&lt;ref name="Berndt"&gt;Berndt, H. (1987). [http://www.wag-aic.org/1987/berndt87.pdf "Assessing the Detrimental Effects of Wood and Wood Products on the Environment Inside Display Cases"]. AIC, Vancouver, BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Acidic fumes can also be released from [[formaldehyde]] which can occur in wood as a degradation product of [[lignin]]. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous [[formaldehyde]] [[resins]] (commonly [[urea-formaldehyde resins]]).&lt;ref name="Berndt"/&gt;

In the first case, acetic acid reacts with the calcium carbonate (one of the main components of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing [[calcium acetate]], a salt. [[Formaldehyde]] can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create [[formic acid]], which then has basically the same effects as [[acetic acid]], reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts ([[calcium acetate]] and [[calcium formate]]) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"&gt;Shelton, S.Y. (2008). [http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-15.pdf "Byne's "Disease; How to recognize, Handle and Store Affected Shells and Related Collections."] ''Conserve O Gram'' 11-15. National Park Service USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calcium carbonate and acetic acid chemical reaction occurs as follows:&lt;ref name="Brokerhof"&gt;Brokerhof, A. (1999). [http://iaq.dk/iap/iap1998/1998_10.htm "Application of Sorbents To Protect Calcareous Materials Against Acetic Acid Vapours"]. Indoor Air Pollution: Detection and Mitigation of Carbonyls, Presentation Abstracts and Additional Notes. The University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland 17–18 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2[[Acetic acid|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH]] → [[Calcium acetate|Ca(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Calcium carbonate and formic acid chemical reaction occurs as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Baltrusaitis, J., Usher, C. and Grassian, V. (2006). "Reactivity of Formic Acid on Calcium Carbonate Single Particle and Single Crystal Surfaces: Effect of Adsorbed Water". ''Microscopy and Microanalysis'' (Cambridge University Press) '''12'''(Suppl 2): 796-797.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2[[Formic acid|CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[Calcium formate|Ca(HCOO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Calcium carbonate and sulfuric acid chemical reaction occurs as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Casiday, R. and Frey, R.
[http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~edudev/LabTutorials/Water/FreshWater/acidrain.html'''Acid Rain Inorganic Reactions Experiment''']. Department of Chemistry, Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Sulfuric Acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[Calcium sulfate|CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

In this last reaction, calcium carbonate reacts with [[sulfuric acid]] and produce calcium sulfate, water and carbon dioxide.

==Prevention==
When specimens are to be placed in any size of container for long-term storage or display, the consistent use of only archival-quality materials prevents the development of Byne's disease. Thus, materials such as metal cabinets and display cases, archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might be vulnerable to this reaction.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt;

It is also worth mentioning that sea shells, after collecting, need to be washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in the shell, and then dried thoroughly before they are stored. Salt attracts moisture and makes shells more vulnerable to Bynesian decay.&lt;ref name=Sally2 /&gt;

The following is a chart that shows non-archival materials and their archival equivalents:&lt;ref name=Sturm /&gt;

If possible, the use of wood and [[cellulose]] derivatives should be avoided entirely. Many [[varnish]]es and [[paint]]s are well known emitters of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs),&lt;ref name="Tétreault"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1506710|last=Tétreault|first=J.|author2=Stamatopoulou, E.|year=1997|title=Determination of Concentrations of Acetic Acid Emitted from Wood Coatings in Enclosures|jstor=1506710|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=42|issue=3|pages=141–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which may be acidic, and thus have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these [[coating]]s should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.&lt;ref name="Sturm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturm|first=C.

Because the reactions involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of [[moisture]] in the air in order for them to take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental [[relative humidity]] under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a [[hygrometer]]), and applying [[dehumidifiers]] when necessary; sometimes, simple [[air conditioning]] systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt; Applying [[sorbent]]s containing a [[strong base]], such as [[potassium hydroxide]], inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated [[filter paper]] are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid [[concentration]] inside the enclosed space.&lt;ref name="Brokerhof"/&gt;

==Management==
The damage to specimens is unfortunately not reversible; however, the decay can be arrested by washing or soaking the specimens in water, followed by a very thorough drying. The specimens must then be placed in an environment that consists of only archival materials, in a completely archival setting.&lt;ref name=Sally2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sturm /&gt;

==Pyrite disease==
In collections which contain [[fossils]], high humidity can also affect [[pyrite]] (or its more reactive polymorph [[marcasite]]) (iron sulphide) fossils in a somewhat similar condition, which is known as [[marcasite#Pyrite Decay|pyrite disease]]. The [[iron sulfide]] can react with water and oxygen to form [[iron sulfate]]s and [[sulfuric acid]], which then can produce Bynesian decay.&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cavallari&amp;Salvador&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavallari|first1=D.C.|last2=Salvador|first2=R.B.|last3=Cunha|first3=B.R.|title=Dangers to malacological collections: Bynesian decay and Pyrite decay|journal=Collection Forum|date=2014|volume=28|issue=1-2|pages=35–46|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Cavallari/publication/269112497_Dangers_to_malacological_collections_Bynesian_decay_and_pyrite_decay/links/549b14ca0cf2d6581ab2e158.pdf?origin=publication_detail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faculty and staff of The [[University of Wisconsin Extension]] Center have affiliations at the [[University of Wisconsin-Superior]], [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and the [[University of Wisconsin-Extension]]. The Center was founded by Dr. Ron Shaffer in 1990 shortly after publishing "Community Economics: Economic Structure and Change in Smaller Communities". In the preface of that book, Shaffer noted, "There are many citizens in Wisconsin and county extension community development agents whose interest in community economics continually remind me that universities must help them improve their collective economic conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Climate Central''' is a nonprofit news organization that analyzes and reports on [[climate science]]. Composed of scientists and science journalists, the organization conducts scientific research on climate change and energy issues, and produces multimedia content that is distributed via their [http://www.climatecentral.org website] and media partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grist.org/article/Climate-Central Scientists and journalists team up to get the climate story straight], [[Grist (magazine)|Gris]]t&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/climate_central.php Columbia Journalism Review: A One-Stop Shop for Climate Information]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sej.org/publications/journalismmedia/new-journalism-science-initiatives-alter-how-news-is-shaped New Journalism-Science Initiatives Alter How News Is Shaped]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flowtv.org/?p=2372 Climate Change TV]&lt;/ref&gt; Climate Central has been featured in many prominent U.S. news sources, including the New York Times, the Associated Press, Reuters, NBC Nightly News, CBS News, CNN, ABC News, Nightline, Time, National Public Radio, PBS, Scientific American, National Geographic, Science, and The Washington Post.

==History==

At an October 2005 conference sponsored by the [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]] and held in Aspen, Colorado, more than a hundred scientists, policymakers, journalists, and leaders from business, religion and civil society identified the critical need for a central authoritative source for [[climate change]] information. A broad group of climate experts later confirmed this need during a November 2006 New York meeting convened by [[James Gustave Speth]], Dean of the [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]]. At roughly the same time, in Palo Alto, California, [[The 11th Hour Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.11thhourproject.org/partners |title=Grantees |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=11thhourproject.org |publisher=11th Hour Project |access-date=August 31, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; began organizing with the mission to popularize reliable information about [[Climate change mitigation|global warming solutions]], using the power of Silicon Valley scientists, entrepreneurs, and inventors.

These meetings inspired the idea for Climate Central, which took shape early in 2008 with seed money from The Flora Family Foundation and development funds from 11th Hour Project. The founding board included [[Jane Lubchenco]], Steven Pacala and Wendy Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatecentral.org/about/people/#founding_board] Climate Central's Founding Board&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate Central also sponsors classes for meteorologists and provides climate graphics to television stations. This has been credited in part for the increase in acceptance of climate change science among local forecasters and their willingness to share it in their broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morrison |first1=David |authorlink1=David Morrison (astrophysicist) |title=Some Good News on Climate: A Big Shift among TV Weathercasters |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Darwin's Angel''''' is a book published in response to [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The God Delusion]]''. It was written by [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] and subtitled ''An Angelic Riposte to The God Delusion''.

Cornwell runs a "Public Understanding of Science" programme at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], one of the constituent colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]]. He has previously written reviews of religious and scientific books, including other works of Dawkins. He stated that he finds ''The God Delusion'' harmful in its failure to tackle the problem of extremism, and wrong on many important issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A great debate for heaven's sake |work=Cambridge Evening News |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/features/2007/09/17/01a992cd-b6a6-44a4-96aa-30ea96d47914.lpf |accessdate=5 October 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In this book, Cornwell adopts the persona of the [[guardian angel]] of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Gregor Mendel]], who is now looking after [[Richard Dawkins]]. He pens a letter to Dawkins in 21 chapters.&lt;ref&gt;The summaries here are quotes or direct paraphrases from the relevant chapters of Darwin's Angel.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''A Summary of your Argument'' suggests that Dawkins regards all claims about God's existence as "the exclusive province of science and reason".
# ''Your Sources'' suggests that the book ignores distinguished scholarship and uses inappropriate sources.
# ''Imagination'' suggests that Dawkins takes things too literally.
# ''Beauty'' suggests that Dawkins misunderstands the links between beauty, creativity and faith, and suggests he studies [[George Steiner]], [[William Blake]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[C. S. Lewis]].
# ''What is Religion'' suggests that religion is not science and that Dawkins should study sociologists of religion such as [[Émile Durkheim]].
# ''Is God Supernatural?'' claims that Dawkins' image of God is not what most theists believe in.
# ''Celestial Teapots'' suggests that the comparison with [[Russell's teapot]] is misplaced because Cornwell claims there are ''prima facie'', albeit inconclusive, grounds for believing in God.
# ''God's Simplicity'' claims that Dawkins imagines that God is an object but this is not how theologians think about God. 
# ''Theories of Everything'' claims that [[Stephen Hawking]] and others now believe a "[[Theory of Everything]]" is impossible due to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].
# ''Dawkins versus Dostoyevsky'' suggests that Dawkins mistakenly attributes the nihilistic views of [[Ivan Karamazov]] to [[Dostoyevsky]]. Dawkins responded to this chapter specifically by saying that he was either misunderstood or misquoted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richarddawkins.net/article,1610,Honest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity,Richard-Dawkins Richard Dawkins' Response to Cornwell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011120904/http://richarddawkins.net/article%2C1610%2CHonest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity%2CRichard-Dawkins |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Jesus, the Jews and the "Pigs"'' suggests that Dawkins relies on a single source when he discusses "the moral consideration for others" in Judaism and Christianity being originally intended to apply only to a narrowly defined in-group.
# ''Dawkins's Utopia'' claims that Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Hitler all used "science as an ideology combined with militant atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin's Angel p 86&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims that Stalin's atheism was foundational to his entire ideology, and that as atheism doesn't necessarily lead to violence, nor does religion.
# ''Fundamentalism'' suggests that it is important to distinguish between tolerant and violent forms of faith. Cornwell also claims it is a [[Category mistake|category error]] to confuse creationism and the "doctrine of creation".&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'' p 98&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Is Religious Education Child Abuse?'' questions whether being indoctrinated in a faith is tantamount to child abuse. He goes on to claim the [[Amish]] are a living testimony to the advantages of frugality and simplicity.
# ''Life After Death'' suggests that most religious believers ''hope'' for an afterlife,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Kenny argues that this is theologically unsound. Christians don't just hope for an afterlife, Christians "affirm in the creeds belief in a final judgement, a resurrection of the body, and an everlasting life."&lt;/ref&gt; In Dawkins' response to the book, he criticised Cornwell for quoting him out of context in this section. 
# ''Religious People Less Clever than Atheists?'' suggests that scientific eminence does not guarantee sound judgement, and that scientists are prejudiced against religious believers. 
# ''Does our Moral Sense have a Darwinian Origin?'' claims that there is more to morality than evolution can explain.
# ''The Darwinian Imperative'' claims that attempts to explain religion via evolution are simplistic. 
# ''Religion as a Bacillus'' discusses Dr [[Gerhard Wagner (Nazi physician)|Gerhard Wagner]], and states that describing all religious believers as infected with a virus has deplorable overtones.&lt;ref&gt;DA p 141-145.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Does God Exist?'' suggests that Dawkins does not understand the question "why is there something rather than nothing?", which is why he finds it ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;DA pp152-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Cornwell goes on to say "the ludicrous anthropomorphic deity that rightly appals" Dawkins is not the view of God most Christian theologians hold.
# ''Being Religious'' suggests that being religious is not a question of factual beliefs but a personal relationship and quest based on prayer and love.

==Reviews and comments==

The book was praised by [[Salley Vickers]] in ''[[The Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article2361294.ece ''Darwin's Angel: An Angelic Response to the God Delusion''], 1 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madeleine Bunting]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Madeleine Bunting]] [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/madeleine_bunting/2007/09/the_smallest_signs_of_retreat.html ''The smallest signs of retreat''] [[The Guardian]] 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Polkinghorne]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Polkinghorne]] [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article2778493.ece "The truth in religion"] [[The Times Literary Supplement|TLS]] 31 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Stanford]] in ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Stanford]] [[The Independent]] 14 September 2007 [http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/reviews/article2959467.ece Doubts about Dawkins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022042200/http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/reviews/article2959467.ece |date=22 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named one of the 'Books of the Year' by the ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;FT Magazine 8/9 Dec 2007 ''The Year in Books'' p37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Kenny]] reviewed the book in ''[[The Tablet]]'' noting that both Cornwell and Dawkins fail to observe the prime rule of intellectual debate, that one should attack the opponent's arguments, not his personality. Kenny goes on to say that neither ''The God Delusion'' nor ''Darwin's Angel'' "provides the reader with sufficient grounds for a reasoned conclusion" about God's existence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Kenny]] in [[The Tablet]] 13 September 2007 [http://www.thetablet.co.uk/reviews/359 Argument not always angelic]&lt;/ref&gt; A profile of ''Darwin's Angel'' in ''[[New Scientist]]'' by Amanda Gefter criticised Cornwell for confusing two meanings of "religion" demarcated in ''[[The God Delusion]]'' and for holding one religion in higher esteem than any other. She also suggested that both books are part of a modern debate that is suffering from the fact that the two sides do not concentrate on one definition of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19526221.800-review-ian-angelic-riposte-to-the-god-delusioni-by-john-cornwell.html Review: ''An angelic riposte to the God Delusion'' by John Cornwell – 22 September 2007 – New Scientist Space&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Darwin's Angel'' is listed on the RichardDawkins.net website as one of several "fleas" following ''The God Delusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The fleas are multiplying |url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/1617-the-fleas-are-multiplying |accessdate=12 September 2007 |work=www.RichardDawkins.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121235026/http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/1617-the-fleas-are-multiplying |archivedate=21 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dawkins, the book contains a number of inaccurate portrayals of what he actually said. Dawkins questions whether these are "honest mistakes or willful mendacity".&lt;ref name=dawkins&gt;{{cite web |title=Honest Mistakes or Willful Mendacity |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |url=http://richarddawkins.net/article,1610,Honest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity,Richard-Dawkins |accessdate=10 September 2007 |work=www.RichardDawkins.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011120904/http://richarddawkins.net/article%2C1610%2CHonest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity%2CRichard-Dawkins |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests six examples where his writing has been quoted out of context or otherwise misrepresented. For example, Cornwell suggests that Dawkins would have been in favour of [[Social Darwinism]] when in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' Dawkins has explicitly condemned such views and says no one supports such ideas any more.&lt;ref name=dawkins /&gt;

[[File:Moana_tatoo.jpg|thumb|[[Moana (1926 film)|Moana]], by Robert Flaherty, the first docufiction in film history (1926)]]

'''Docufiction''' (or '''docu-fiction'''), often confused with [[docudrama]], is the cinematographic combination of [[documentary film|documentary]] and [[fiction]], this term often meaning [[narrative film]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://girishshambu.blogspot.com/2006/12/six-types-of-documentary.html Reality and documentary] – at Six Types Of Documentary, article by Girish Shambu (blog)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a [[film genre]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/intgenre/intgenre7.html An Introduction to Genre Theory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118185337/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/intgenre/intgenre7.html |date=November 18, 2011 }} by [[Daniel Chandler]] at [http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/ Aberystwyth University]&lt;/ref&gt; which attempts to capture reality such as it is (as [[direct cinema]] or [[cinéma vérité]]) and which simultaneously introduces unreal elements or fictional situations in [[narrative]] in order to strengthen the representation of reality using some kind of [[artistic expression]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.videomaker.com/article/c06/18290-a-creative-treatment-of-actuality A creative treatment of actuality] – article by Peter Biesterfeld at [https://www.videomaker.com/ Videomaker], 08/07/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, it is a documentary mixed with fictional elements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tesionline.it/default/tesi.asp?idt=18073 Il difficile rapporto tra fiction e non fiction che si concretizza nella docu-fiction] (The difficult relationship between fiction and non-fiction patent in docufiction) – thesis in Italian by Laura Marchesi, Faculty of Communication Sciences (Università degli Studi di Pavia) at [http://www.tesionline.it/default/index.asp Tesionline], 2005/06&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Real time (media)|real time]], filmed when the events take place, and in which the main [[character (arts)|character]] or characters — often portrayed by non-professional or amateur actors — are essentially playing themselves, or slightly fictionalized versions of themselves, in a fictionalized scenario. In this sense, docufiction may overlap to an extent with some aspects of the [[mockumentary]] format, but the terms are not synonymous.

A film genre in expansion, it is adopted by a number of [[experimental]] filmmakers.

==Origins==
The term involves a way of making films already practiced by such authors as [[Robert Flaherty]], one of the fathers of documentary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma01/huffman/frontier/define.html Definition of documentary – New Frontiers in American documentary] (American Studies at The University of Virginia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transartinstitute.org/Example_Papers.html The Impulse of Documentary-Fiction]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319052930/http://www.transartinstitute.org/Example_Papers.html |date=March 19, 2012 }} – Paper at [http://www.transartinstitute.org/About.html Transart Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831101542/http://transartinstitute.org/About.html |date=2011-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Rouch]], later in the 20th century.

In the domain of [[visual anthropology]], the innovating role of Jean Rouch&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rouge.com.au/3/rouch_valediction.html Jean Rouch 1917-2004, A Valediction] – Article by [[Michael Eaton]] at [http://www.rouge.com.au/ Rouge]&lt;/ref&gt; allows one to consider him as the father of a subgenre called [[ethnofiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maitres-fous.net/glossary.html Glossary] at MAITRES_FOUS.NET&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Rouch and the Genesis of Ethnofiction, thesis by Brian Quist, Long Island University&lt;/ref&gt; This term means: [[ethnographic]] documentary film with natives who play fictional roles. Making them play a role about themselves will help portray reality, which&lt;ref&gt;"Ethnofiction: drama as a creative research practice in ethnographic film." Journal of Media Practice 9, no. 3(2008), eScholarID:1b5648, article by Johannes Sjöberg&lt;/ref&gt; will be reinforced with [[imagery]]. A non-ethnographic [[documentary]] with fictional elements uses the same method and, for the same reasons, may be called docufiction.

==Docudrama and mockumentary==
In contrast, [[docudrama]] is usually a fictional and dramatized recreation&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.sadibey.com/dosyalar/Gerekli_Seyler/Documentary_Genres.doc Docudrama: the real (his)tory Confusion of genres] – Page 2 on the thesis by Çiçek Coşkun (New York University School of Education)&lt;/ref&gt; of factual events in form of a documentary, at a time subsequent to the "real" events it portrays. A docudrama is often confused with ''docufiction'' when [[drama]] is considered interchangeable with [[fiction]] (both words meaning the same). However, "docudrama" refers specifically to [[Television film|telefilms]] or other television media recreations that dramatize certain events often with [[actor]]s.
 	
A [[mockumentary]] is also a film or television show in which fictitious events are presented in documentary format, sometimes a recreation of factual events after they took place or a comment on [[current events]], typically satirical, comedic or even dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;A television programme or film which takes the form of a serious documentary in order to satirize its subject. – definition at The Free Dictionary and Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas mockumentaries are usually fully scripted comedies or dramas that merely adopt some aspects of documentary format as a framing device, docufictions are usually not scripted, instead placing the participants in a fictionalized scenario while portraying their own genuine reactions and their own [[improvisation]]al dialogue and character development.

The '''Efficiency Movement''' was a major movement in the United States, Britain and other industrial nations in the early 20th century that sought to identify and eliminate waste in all areas of the economy and society, and to develop and implement best practices.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Rodgers, ''Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The concept covered mechanical, economic, social, and personal improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Haber, ''Efficiency and Uplift: Scientific Management in the Progressive Era, 1890–1920'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The quest for efficiency promised effective, dynamic management rewarded by growth.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer K. Alexander, ''The Mantra of Efficiency: From Waterwheel to Social Control'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the influence of an early proponent, it is more often known as [[Taylorism]].

==United States==
The Efficiency Movement played a central role in the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States, where it flourished 1890–1932.&lt;ref&gt;Haber (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents argued that all aspects of the economy, society and government were riddled with waste and inefficiency.  Everything would be better if experts identified the problems and fixed them.  The result was strong support for building research universities and schools of business and engineering, municipal research agencies, as well as reform of hospitals and medical schools, and the practice of farming.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Spillman, "The Efficiency Movement in Its Relation to Agriculture," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' Vol. 59, (May, 1915), pp. 65–76 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1012894 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best known leaders were engineers [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] (1856–1915), who used a stopwatch to identify the smallest inefficiencies, and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.]] (1868–1924) who proclaimed there was always "one best way" to fix a problem.

Leaders such as [[Herbert Croly]], [[Charles R. van Hise]] and [[Richard T. Ely|Richard Ely]] sought to improve governmental performance by training experts in public service comparable to those in Germany, notably at the Universities of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Schools of business administration set up management programs oriented toward efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Morris, "The Wisconsin Idea and Business Progressivism," ''Journal of American Studies,'' April 1970, Vol. 4#1 pp 39–60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal and state efficiency===
Many cities set up "efficiency bureaus" to identify waste and apply the best practices.  For example, Chicago created an Efficiency Division (1910–16) within the city government's Civil Service Commission, and private citizens organized the Chicago Bureau of Public Efficiency (1910–32).  The former pioneered the study of "personal efficiency," measuring employees' performance through new scientific merit systems and efficiency movement &lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Lee, ''Bureaus of Efficiency: Reforming Local Government in the Progressive Era,'' (Marquette University Press, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-87462-081-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State governments were active as well. For example, Massachusetts set up its "Commission on Economy and Efficiency" in 1912.  It made hundreds of recommendations.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;Commission on Economy and Efficiency, ''Annual report of the Commission on Economy and Efficiency'' (Boston, 1913), p 76 [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWQNAAAAYAAJ  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Leading philanthropists such as [[Andrew Carnegie]]&lt;ref&gt;Abigail A. Van Slyck, ''Free to All: Carnegie Libraries &amp; American Culture, 1890–1920'' (1998) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John D. Rockefeller]] actively promoted the efficiency movement.  In his many philanthropic pursuits, Rockefeller believed in supporting efficiency.  He once said,
:"To help an inefficient, ill-located, unnecessary school is a waste ...it is highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to our needs, if the money had been properly directed to that end."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17090 John D. Rockefeller, ''Random Reminiscences of Men and Events'' (1933)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
The [[Conservation in the United States|conservation movement]] regarding national resources came to prominence during the Progressive Era.  According to historian [[Samuel P. Hays]], the conservation movement was based on the "gospel of the efficiency.".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Hays, ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement 1890–1920'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Massachusetts Commission on Economy and Efficiency reflected the new concern with conservation. It said in 1912:
:"The only proper basis for the protection of game birds, wild fowl and, indeed, all animals is an economic one, and must be based upon carefully constructed and properly enforced laws for the conservation of all species for the benefit of future generations of our citizens, rather than based on local opinion....This expenditure for the protection of fish and game is clearly a wise economy, tending to prevent the annihilation of birds and other animals valuable to mankind which might otherwise become extinct.  It may be said that Massachusetts and her sister States have suffered irreparable loss by carelessly allowing, for generations past, indiscriminate waste of animal life."&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;

[[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] was the nation's foremost conservationist, putting the issue high on the national agenda by emphasizing the need to eliminate wasteful uses of limited natural resources. He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter,  [[Gifford Pinchot]].  Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources, and is considered to be the nation's first [[conservation biology|conservation]] President.&lt;ref&gt;W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservation Legacy'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|325px|left|1908 US editorial cartoon on Theodore Roosevelt and conservation]]

In 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the [[Conference of Governors]] held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: "Conservation as a National Duty."

In contrast, environmentalist [[John Muir]] promulgated a very different view of conservation, rejecting the efficiency motivation. Muir instead preached that nature was sacred and humans are intruders who should look but not develop. Working through the [[Sierra Club]] he founded, Muir tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Nash, ''Wilderness and the American Mind'' (3rd ed. 1982), pp 122–40&lt;/ref&gt;  While Muir wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot's formulation, "to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees." &lt;ref&gt;Gifford Pinchot, ''Breaking New Ground,'' (1947) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National politics===
In U.S. national politics, the most prominent figure was [[Herbert Hoover]], a trained engineer who downplayed politics and believed dispassionate, nonpolitical experts could solve the nation's great problems, such as ending poverty.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Barber, ''From new era to New Deal: Herbert Hoover, the economists, and American economic policy, 1921–1933'' (1989) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on efficiency===
After 1929, [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] blamed the [[Great Depression]] on Hoover and helped to somewhat discredit the movement, though the demand for efficiency and elimination of waste remains an important component of American values.

===Antitrust===
Boston lawyer [[Louis Brandeis]] (1856–1941) argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added a new political dimension to the Efficiency Movement. For instance, while fighting against legalized price fixing, Brandeis launched an effort to influence congressional policymaking with the help of his friend [[Norman Hapgood]], who was then the editor of [[Harper's Weekly]]. He coordinated the publication of a series of articles (''Competition Kills'', ''Efficiency and the One-Price Article'', and ''How Europe deals with the one-price goods''), which were also distributed by the lobbying group American Fair Trade League to legislators, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices, governors, and twenty national magazines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prophets of Regulation|last=McCraw|first=Thomas|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=0674716086|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=103-104}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his works, he was asked to speak before a congressional committee considering the price-fixing bill he drafted. Here, he stated that "big business is not more efficient than little business" and that "it is a mistake to suppose that the department stores can do business cheaper than the little dealer."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brandeis ideas on which business is most efficient conflicted with Croly's positions, which favored efficiency driven by a kind of consolidation gained through large-scale economic operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Herbert Croly of the New Republic: The Life and Thought of an American Progressive|last=Levy|first=David|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1985|isbn=0691047251|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=157-158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1895 Brandeis had warned of the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin I. Urofsky, ''Louis D. Brandeis: a life'' (2009) pp 300–26&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Curse of Bigness'' he argued, "Efficiency means greater production with less effort and at less cost, through the elimination of unnecessary waste, human and material. How else can we hope to attain our social ideals?."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Brandeis, ''The curse of bigness: miscellaneous papers of Louis D. Brandeis'' edited by Osmond Kessler Fraenkel and Clarence Martin Lewis, (1965) p 51&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued against an appeal to Congress by the state-regulated railroad industry in 1910 seeking an increase in rates. Brandeis explained that instead of passing along increased costs to the consumer, the railroads should pursue efficiency by reducing their overhead and streamlining their operations, initiatives that were unprecedented during the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Efficient Society: Why Canada Is As Close To Utopia As It Gets|last=Heath|first=Joseph|publisher=Penguin Canada|year=2002|isbn=0140292489|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Bedaux system===
The Bedaux system, developed by Franco-American [[management consultant]] [[Charles Bedaux]] (1886–1944) built on the work of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]] and [[Charles Edward Knoeppel|Charles E. Knoeppel]].&lt;ref name=Brech&gt;[[Edward Francis Leopold Brech]], ''Productivity in Perspective, 1914-1974'' (Bristol: Thoemmes Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn&gt;Michael R. Weatherburn, 'Scientific Management at Work: the Bedaux System, Management Consulting, and Worker Efficiency in British Industry, 1914-48' (Imperial College PhD thesis, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Its distinctive advancement beyond these earlier thinkers was the [[Bedaux Unit]] or ''B'', a universal measure for all manual work.&lt;ref name=Littler&gt;Craig R. Littler, ''Development of the Labour Process in Capitalist Societies:  a Comparative Study of the Transformation of Work Organization in Britain, Japan and the USA'' (London: Heinemann, 1982) [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_development_of_the_labour_process_in.html?id=2k2yAAAAIAAJ entry on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

The Bedaux System was influential in the [[United States]] in the 1920s and [[Europe]] in the 1930s and 1940s, especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB&gt;Steven Kreis, 'Charles E. Bedaux' in ''[[American National Biography]]'' [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1000116 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Link"&gt;Steven Kreis, 'The Diffusion of Scientific Management: the Bedaux Company in America and Britain, 1926-1945' in ''A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management Since Taylor'' (1992) {{cite web|url= https://ohiostatepress.org/books/Complete%20PDFs/Nelson%20Mental/08.pdf |title=Link }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1920s to the 1950s there were about one thousand companies in 21 countries worldwide that were run on the Bedaux System, including giants such as [[Swift's]], [[Eastman Kodak]], [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich]], [[DuPont]], [[Fiat]], [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] and [[General Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Tisdall, ''Agents of Change: The Development and Practice of Management Consultancy'' (London: Heinemann, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Link" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kipping, 'Consultancies, Institutions and the Diffusion of Taylorism in Britain, Germany and France, 1920s to 1950s', ''Business History'' (1997) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076799700000146 PDF from Taylor &amp; Francis online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ferguson, ''The Rise of Management Consulting in Britain'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mckenna&gt;'Christopher D.

[http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/american-history-after-1945/worlds-newest-profession-management-consulting-twentieth-century Cambridge University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to other movements===
Later movements had echoes of the Efficiency Movement and were more directly inspired by Taylor and [[Taylorism]].  [[Technocracy movement|Technocracy]], for instance, more of a fad than a movement, and others flourished in the 1930s and 1940s.

Postmodern opponents of nuclear energy in the 1970s broadened their attack to try to discredit movements that saw salvation for human society in technical expertise alone, or which held that scientists or engineers had any special expertise to offer in the political realm.

Coming into usage in 1990, the Western term [[Lean manufacturing]] (lean enterprise, lean production, or simply "Lean") refers to a business idea that considered the expenditure of resources for anything other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Today the Lean concept is broadening to include a greater range of strategic goals, not just cost-cutting and efficiency.

==Britain==
In engineering, the concept of efficiency was developed in Britain in the mid-18th century by [[John Smeaton]] (1724–1792). Called the "father of civil engineering", he studied water wheels and steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (2008) ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 19th century there was much talk about improving the efficiency of the administration and economic performance of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold White, ''Efficiency and empire'' (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ANUBAAAAMAAJ  online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Efficiency''' was an attempt to discredit the old-fashioned habits, customs and institutions that put the British at a handicap in competition with the world, especially with Germany,&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Dawson, ''The German Workman: a Study in National Efficiency'' (1906) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HoxNAAAAMAAJ online]&lt;/ref&gt; which was seen as the epitome of efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. R. Searle]], ''The Quest for National Efficiency, 1899–1914: A Study in Politics and Political Thought'' (Oxford UP, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, "National Efficiency" became a powerful demand&amp;nbsp;— a  movement supported by prominent figures across the political spectrum who disparaged sentimental humanitarianism and identified waste as a mistake that could no longer be tolerated.  The movement took place in two waves; the first wave from 1899 to 1905 was made urgent by the inefficiencies and failures in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902).  ''Spectator'' magazine reported in 1902 there was "a universal outcry for efficiency in all departments of society, in all aspects of life".&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Searle, "The Politics of National Efficiency and of War, 1900–1918" in Chris Wrigley, ed.,  ''A Companion to Early 20th-Century Britain'' (Blackwell, 2003) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most important themes were technocratic efficiency and managerial efficiency.  As White (1899) argued vigorously, the empire needed to be put on a business footing and administered to get better results.  The looming threat of Germany, which was widely seen as a much more efficient nation, added urgency after 1902.  Politically National Efficiency brought together modernizing Conservatives and Unionists, Liberals who wanted to bring modernize their party, and [[Fabian Society|Fabians]] such as [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[H. G. Wells]], along with [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Sidney Webb]], who had outgrown socialism and saw the utopia of a scientifically up-to-date society supervised by experts such as themselves.  Churchill in 1908 formed an alliance with the Webbs, announcing the goal of a "National Minimum", covering hours, working conditions, and wages&amp;nbsp;– it was a safety net below which the individual would not be allowed to fall.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Kloppenberg, ''Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870–1920'' (1988) p 475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Pelling, ''Winston Churchill'' (1989) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative legislation included the [[Education Act 1902|Education Act of 1902]], which emphasized the role of experts in the schools system.  Higher education was an important initiative, typified by the growth of the [[London School of Economics]], and the foundation of [[Imperial College]].&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a pause in the movement between 1904 and 1909, when interest resumed.  The most prominent new leaders included Liberals [[Winston Churchill]] and [[David Lloyd George]], whose influence brought a bundle of reform legislation that introduced the welfare state to Britain.

Much of the popular and elite support for National Efficiency grew out of concern for Britain's military position, especially with respect to Germany.  The Royal Navy underwent a dramatic modernization, most famously in the introduction of the ''[[Dreadnought]]'', which in 1906 revolutionized naval warfare overnight.

==Germany==
In Germany the efficiency movement was called "rationalization" and it was a powerful social and economic force before 1933. In part it looked explicitly at American models, especially [[Fordism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Nolan, "Housework Made Easy: the Taylorized Housewife in Weimar Germany's Rationalized Economy," ''Feminist Studies.'' Volume: 16. Issue: 3. pp 549+&lt;/ref&gt; The Bedaux system was widely adopted in the rubber and tire industry, despite strong resistance in the socialist labor movement to the Bedaux system. [[Continental AG]], the leading rubber company in Germany, adopted the system and profited heavily from it, thus surviving the Great Depression relatively undamaged and improving its competitive capabilities. However most German businessmen preferred the home-grown '''REFA system''' which focused on the standardization of working conditions, tools, and machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Erker, "Das Bedaux-System: Neue Aspekte der Historischen Rationalisierungsforschung,["The Bedaux system: new aspects of research on the history of rationalization"], ''Zeitschrift für Unternehmensgeschichte,'' 1996, Vol. 41#2 pp 139–158&lt;/ref&gt;

"Rationalization" meant higher productivity and greater efficiency, promising science would bring prosperity. More generally it promised a new level of modernity and was applied to economic production and consumption as well as public administration. Various versions of rationalization were promoted by industrialists and Social Democrats, by engineers and architects, by educators and academics, by middle class feminists and social workers, by government officials and politicians of many parties. It was ridiculed by the extremists in the Communist movement. As ideology and practice, rationalization challenged and transformed not only machines, factories, and vast business enterprises but also the lives of middle-class and working-class Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Union==
Ideas of Science Management was very popular in the Soviet Union. One of the leading theorists and practitioners of the Scientific Management in Soviet Russia was [[Alexei Gastev]]. The [[Central Institute of Labour]] (Tsentralnyi Institut Truda, or TsIT), founded by Gastev in 1921 with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s support, was a veritable citadel of socialist Taylorism.
Fascinated by Taylorism and Fordism, Gastev has led a popular movement for the “scientific organization of labor” (Nauchnaya Organizatsiya Truda, or NOT).
Because of its emphasis on the cognitive components of labor, some scholars consider Gastev’s NOT to represent a [[Karl Marx|Marxian]] variant of cybernetics. As with the concept of 'Organoprojection' (1919) by [[Pavel Florensky]], underlying [[Nikolai Bernstein]] and Gastev's approach, lay a powerful man-machine metaphor.

==Japan==
[[W. Edwards Deming]] (1900–1993) brought the efficiency movement to Japan after World War II, teaching top management how to improve design (and thus service), product quality, testing and sales (the last through global markets), especially using statistical methods.  Deming then brought his methods back to the U.S. in the form of quality control called [[continuous improvement process]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Gabor, ''The Man Who Discovered Quality: How W. Edwards Deming Brought the Quality Revolution to America'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Childhood gender nonconformity ==
Researchers have found [[childhood gender nonconformity]] (GNC) to be the largest predictor of homosexuality in adulthood.&lt;ref name=Bearman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bem2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rieger"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=J.M.|author2=Zucker, K.J|year=1995|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/dev/31/1/43|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.31.1.43|title=Childhood sex-typed behavior and sexual orientation: A conceptual analysis and quantitative review|journal=[[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]]|volume=31|pages=43–55

[[Daryl Bem]] suggests that some children will prefer activities that are typical of the other sex. Choice of activity consistent with societally defined gender roles will make a gender-conforming child feel different from opposite-sex children. Gender-nonconforming children, on the other hand, will feel different from children of their own sex. In either case, Bem argues, this feeling of difference may evoke physiological arousal when the child is near members of the sex which it considers as being "different", which will later be transformed into [[sexual arousal]]. This nonconformity may be a result of genetics, prenatal hormones, personality, parental care or other environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Bem 1996 320–335"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bem|first=D.J.|title=Exotic Becomes Erotic: A Developmental Theory of Sexual Orientation|journal=Psychological Review|year=1996|volume=103|pages=320–335|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.2.320|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Bearman|Bearman]] and Bruckner showed that males with a female twin are twice as likely to report same-sex attractions, unless there was an older brother. They say that their findings can be explained by the hypothesis that less gendered socialization in early childhood and preadolescence shapes subsequent same-sex romantic preferences.  They suggest that parents of opposite-sex twins are more likely to give them unisex treatment, but that an older brother establishes gender-socializing mechanisms for the younger brother to follow.&lt;ref name="Bearman"/&gt; However, Bearman and Bruckner found no direct evidence for the effect of gender socialization on sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=SOReligion&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jacob Felson|title=The Effect of Religious Background on Sexual Orientation|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion|date=2011|volume=7|ssrn=2008124|issn=1556-3723}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, no evidence has ever been found linking the gender socialization of parents to the sexual orientation of their children&lt;ref name=SOReligion /&gt; while several twin studies have suggested that almost all of the familial resemblance that is observed for sexual orientation is attributable to genes, not family environment.&lt;ref name=SOReligion /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendler et al 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kendler KS|author2=Thornton LM|author3=Gilman SE|author4=Kessler RC|title=Sexual orientation in a U.S. national sample of twin and nontwin sibling pairs|journal=Am J Psychiatry|date=2000|volume=157|issue=11|pages=1843–6|pmid=11058483|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.11.1843}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of adolescents reporting same-sex attraction is significantly higher than the proportion reporting same-sex sexual experience. In addition to attraction, opportunity has to present itself. Since opportunity is socially structured, the expectation is that social influences should be stronger for behavior than attraction.&lt;ref name="Bearman"/&gt;

Scholar Lorene Gottschalk suggests that there may be a [[reporting bias]] that has influenced the results linking childhood gender nonconformity to homosexuality. Many of the studies on the link between CGN and sexual orientation are conducted [[Retrospective cohort study|retrospectively]], meaning that adults are asked to reflect on their behaviors as children.  Adults will often reinterpret their childhood behaviors in terms of their present conceptualizations of their [[gender identity]] and sexual orientation.  Gay men and lesbian women who endorsed a [[biological determinism|biological perspective]] on gender and sexual orientation tended to report more instances of childhood gender nonconformity and explain these behaviors as early genetic or biological manifestations of their sexual orientation.  Lesbian women who endorse a [[social constructionism|social constructionist]] perspective on gender identity often interpret their childhood GNC as an awareness of [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] norms and rejection of gender roles.  Heterosexual men are more likely to downplay GNC, attributing their behaviors to being sensitive or artistic. Retrospective reinterpretation does not invalidate studies linking GNC and sexual orientation, but awareness of how present conceptualization of gender identity and sexual orientation can affect perceptions of childhood may be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gottschalk|first=Lorene|title=Same-Sex Sexuality and Childhood Gender Non-Conformity: A Spurious Connection|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|year=2003|volume=12|issue=1|pages=35–50|doi=10.1080/0958923032000067808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family influences ==

===General===
Researchers have provided evidence that gay men report having had less loving and more rejecting fathers, and closer relationships with their mothers, than non-gay men. Some researchers think this may indicate that childhood family experiences are important determinants to homosexuality,&lt;ref name="Danes" /&gt; or that parents behave this way in response to [[Gender variance|gender-variant]] traits in a child.&lt;ref&gt;Isay, Richard A.

New York, Pantheon. {{ISBN|0-679-42159-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Ruse]] suggests that both possibilities might be true in different cases.&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, Michael ''Homosexuality: a philosophical inquiry'' (1988) {{ISBN|0-631-17553-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From their research on 275 men in the Taiwanese military, Shu and Lung concluded that "paternal protection and maternal care were determined to be the main vulnerability factors in the development of homosexual males". Key factors in the development of homosexuals were "paternal attachment, introversion, and neurotic characteristics".&lt;ref name="Shu and Lung"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lung |first=F.W. |year=2007 |title=Father-son attachment and sexual partner orientation in Taiwan |journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry |volume=48 |pages=20–6 |doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2006.08.001 |pmid=17145277 |last2=Shu |first2=B.C. |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study reported that homosexual males reported more positive early relationships with mothers than did homosexual females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ridge SR, Feeney JA |title=Relationship history and relationship attitudes in gay males and lesbians: attachment style and gender differences |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=848–59 |date=Dec 1998 |pmid=10084350 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0004-8674&amp;date=1998&amp;volume=32&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=848 |doi=10.3109/00048679809073875}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2000 American [[twin study]] showed that familial factors, which may be at least partly genetic, influence (but do not determine) sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendler KS, Thornton LM, Gilman SE, Kessler RC |title=Sexual orientation in a U.S. national sample of twin and nontwin sibling pairs |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=157 |issue=11 |pages=1843–6 |date=Nov 2000 |pmid=11058483|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11058483 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.11.1843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also indicates that homosexual men have significantly more older male siblings than the homosexual women, who, in turn, have significantly more siblings than heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bogaert AF |title=Sibling sex ratio and sexual orientation in men and women: new tests in two national probability samples |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=111–6 |date=Feb 2005 |pmid=15772774 |doi=10.1007/s10508-005-1005-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 Danish study compared people who had a heterosexual marriage versus people who had a [[same-sex marriage]].  Heterosexual marriage was significantly linked to having young parents, small age differences between parents, stable parental relationships, large numbers of siblings, and late birth order. Children who experience parental divorce are less likely to marry heterosexually than those growing up in intact families.  For men, same-sex marriage was associated with having older mothers, divorced parents, absent fathers, and being the youngest child. For women, maternal death during adolescence and being the only or youngest child or the only girl in the family increased the likelihood of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="Danes"&gt;{{cite journal

Results from a 2008 twin study were consistent with moderate, primarily genetic, familial effects, and moderate to large effects of the nonshared environment (social and biological) on same-sex sexual behavior; the study concluded that, for same-sex sexual behavior, shared or familial environment plays no role for men and minor role for women.&lt;ref name="Sweden"/&gt; By contrast, in a study doing genetic analysis of 409 pairs of homosexual brothers, including twins, strong evidence was found that some homosexual men are born homosexual. The study, including approximately three times as many people as the previous largest study on this subject, indicates that it is significantly more statistically reliable. It links sexual orientation in men with two regions of the [[human genome]] that have been implicated before.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13918830.300-gene-hunters-sound-warning-over-gay-link.html|title = Gene hunters sound warning over gay link|date = 24 July 1993|accessdate = 2014-12-27|website = |publisher = |last = Miller|first = Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead author of the study, Alan Sanders, however, states that "complex traits such as sexual orientation depend on multiple factors, both environmental and genetic".&lt;ref name="Coghlan"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26572-largest-study-of-gay-brothers-homes-in-on-gay-genes.html|title = Largest study of gay brothers homes in on 'gay genes'|last = Coghlan|first = Andy|date = 17 November 2014|journal = Psychological Medicine|doi = 10.1017/S0033291714002451|pmid = 25399360|access-date = 2014-12-27|pages=1–10|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; A region on the [[X chromosome]] called Xq28, was originally identified in 1993 by Dean Hamer of the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.

=== Fraternal birth order ===
{{main|Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation}}
According to several studies, each additional older brother increases a man's odds of developing a homosexual orientation by 28–48%.

== Urban setting ==
In their landmark study of sexual behavior in the United States—reported in the ''Social Organization of Sexuality''—the [[University of Chicago]] sociologist [[Edward Laumann]] and his colleagues found that homosexuality was positively correlated with urbanization of the place of residence at age 14. The correlation was more substantial among men than women. The authors hypothesized that "Large cities may provide a congenial environment for the development and expression of same-gender interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3RbyuQAYsdMC&amp;pg=PA561&amp;lpg=PA561|title=The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States|first=Edward O.|last=Laumann|author2=John H.

|isbn=978-0-446-67183-5|date=September 1, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was further elaborated in Laumann's later book, The Sexual Organization of the City, which showed that expression of sexual orientation is contingent on the existence of "sex marketplaces," or venues where people with specific sexual orientations can congregate and meet.&lt;ref&gt;Edward O. Laumann, Stephen Ellingson, Jenna Mahay, Anthony Paik, and Yoosik Youm (Eds.). (2004). ''The Sexual Organization of the City,'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, people born in the capital area were significantly less likely to marry heterosexually, and more likely to marry homosexually, than their rural-born peers.&lt;ref name="Danes" /&gt;

== Cultural influences ==
{{further|LGBT history}}
Miron Baron stated, "Some cultures – for example, the [[Assyria]]n and [[Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Graeco]]-[[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Roman]] – were more tolerant of homosexuality. The behavior was practiced openly and was highly prevalent. Sexual patterns are to some extent a product of society's expectations, but it would be difficult to envisage a change in the prevalence of the genetic trait merely in response to changing cultural norms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the US, there has been an increasing number of women developing an attraction for other women.{{Better source|reason=citation is a CNN article where Binnie Klein, a psychotherapist and lecturer, makes the claim based on anecdotal evidence, better sources (preferably statistical/scientific ones) are needed to prove this claim|date=October 2015}}  [[Susan Bordo]] has stated that when a taboo is lifted or diminished, it gives individuals the space to explore and express their sexual orientation.  Binnie Klein has stated that "It's clear that a change in sexual orientation is imaginable to more people than ever before, and there's more opportunity – and acceptance – to cross over the line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/personal/04/23/o.women.leave.menfor.women/|title=Why women are leaving men for other women|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of sexual abuse ==
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] states: "...no specific psychosocial or family dynamic cause for homosexuality has been identified, including histories of childhood sexual abuse. Sexual abuse does not appear to be more prevalent in children who grow up to identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, than in children who identify as heterosexual".&lt;ref name="AmPsychiAssn-Sexual orientation"/&gt;

One study in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' reported that "Abused adolescents, particularly those victimized by males, were up to 7 times more likely to self-identify as gay or bisexual than peers who had not been abused". However, the study went on to state that victims may self-identify as gay or bisexual before the abuse occurs, implying that their non-heterosexual orientation and identity is not caused by the abuse, and reported that no [[longitudinal study]] had determined a [[Causality|causal]] relationship between sexual abuse and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holmes|first=William C.|title=Sexual Abuse of Boys|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2 December 1998|volume=280|issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that "Forty-six percent of the homosexual men in contrast to 7% of the heterosexual men reported homosexual molestation. Twenty-two percent of lesbian women in contrast to 1% of heterosexual women reported homosexual molestation".&lt;ref name="Tomeo 2001 535–541"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomeo|first=M.E.|author2=Templer D.L.|title=Comparative data of childhood adolescence molestation in heterosexual and homosexual persons|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2001|volume=30|pages=535–541|doi=10.1023/A:1010243318426|pmid=11501300|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study has been criticized&lt;ref name=Throckmorton&gt;{{cite web|last1=Throckmorton|first1=Warren|title=A major study of child abuse and homosexuality revisited|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/2009/06/05/a-major-study-of-child-abuse-and-homosexuality-revisited/#ixzz3ETnAaaoR|website=Patheos.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CFI2007&gt;{{cite web|author1=Gerry Dantone|title=Anti-gay Activism and the Misuse of Science|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/Anti-gayActivismandtheMisuseofScience_1.pdf|website=centerforinquiry.net|publisher=Center for Inquiry|accessdate=12 November 2015|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; for being non-clinical, for using [[Representative sample|un-representative samples]] of homosexuals and heterosexuals, for not reporting how homosexual participants were recruited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Gerry Dantone|title=Anti-gay Activism and the Misuse of Science|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/Anti-gayActivismandtheMisuseofScience_1.pdf|website=centerforinquiry.net|publisher=Center for Inquiry|accessdate=12 November 2015|quote=it was a non-clinical study and the data concerning homosexuals was gathered by setting up an interview booth at a “Gay Pride” parade while the data for heterosexuals was gathered at a college. Did the signage attracting participants at the Gay Pride parade booth ask specifically for victims of abuse who were willing to tell their story? The study does not say anything on this point – we do not know how participants were attracted. How likely is it that all the persons who took the questionnaire at the booth ''just happened'' to be gay, as it is claimed in this study? [...] Meanwhile, the data on heterosexuals was obtained at colleges; is this a group that one could then compare to persons attracted by unknown means to a booth at a gay pride parade? Can one then ethically extrapolate the findings to the general public? [...] A non-clinical and flawed study with a much skewed sample that even the authors suggest may not be representative.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for contradictions between the results and their interpretation in the [[dissertation]], for contradictions in the original study and the conclusions drawn in the dissertation and journal, and for implying that the frequency of homosexual self-identification was a consequence of the abuse even though it reports that 68% of men and 62% of women identified as homosexual ''before'' their molestation experience.&lt;ref name=Throckmorton /&gt; The study is also criticized as some people are aware of their same-sex attraction at very early ages and people usually become aware of their same-sex attractions before they start [[coming out#Identity issues|self-identifying as homosexual]]; however, the study asked participants about the age at which they regarded themselves as homosexual, not the age at which they became aware of their same-sex attraction, thus rendering it impossible "to be certain about when the abuse occurred – before or after awareness of same-sex attraction".&lt;ref name=Throckmorton /&gt; Causation between sexual abuse and homosexuality cannot be inferred by this study.&lt;ref name=Throckmorton /&gt; The study itself states that its "homosexual participants may not be representative of [all] homosexual persons"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomeo|first=M.E.|author2=Templer D.L.|title=Comparative data of childhood adolescence molestation in heterosexual and homosexual persons|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2001|volume=30|pages=535–541|doi=10.1023/A:1010243318426|pmid=11501300|issue=5|quote=It must also be borne in mind that the present homosexual participants may not be representative of homosexual persons.

What does this phrase mean to the various participants? Does it mean one thing to those participating in a festive Gay Pride Parade and something quite different to a student at a perhaps more subdued or introspective University setting? Since 84% of gay men and 95% of women considered themselves gay before the “sexual contact” according to the study, could it be something less nefarious than, for example, forcible rape they were recounting? Could it be that the college students were only counting more disturbing experiences, such as forcible rape? Of course it is possible the two groups were defining “sexual contact” in precisely the same manner, but we really should not have to assume such a thing; our doubts are due to the absence of pertinent info from the researchers – this should have been made clear. The study does not even attempt to quantify these probably relevant differences in these two groups. And, instead of continuing to use the phrase “sexual contact” in their closing discussions, the authors of the study switch to “molestation” in their analysis of the data}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study has also come under criticism for relying on the work of [[Paul Cameron]], who was expelled by the [[American Psychological Association]] and has been condemned by the [[American Sociological Association]], [[Canadian Psychological Association]] and the Nebraska Psychological Association for consistently misinterpreting and misrepresenting scientific research on sexuality, male homosexuality and lesbianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Gerry Dantone|title=Anti-gay Activism and the Misuse of Science|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/Anti-gayActivismandtheMisuseofScience_1.pdf|website=centerforinquiry.net|publisher=Center for Inquiry|accessdate=12 November 2015|quote=Also cited in the Tomeo, et al. report are studies conducted by Paul Cameron that supported the contention that gays are more likely to have been molested and to molest others [...] The American Sociological Association has criticized Dr. Cameron, stating that "Cameron has consistently misinterpreted and misrepresented sociological research on sexuality, homosexuality, and lesbianism" and that he was kicked out of the American Psychological Association. Further, in a court case in 1985, a judge saw fit to characterize Paul Cameron’s “expert” testimony thusly: ''Second, this Court reaffirms its findings that Dr. Simon and Dr. Marmor were very credible witnesses and that their qualifications were impeccable. In contrast, Dr. Paul Cameron--the basis of the claim that Drs. Simon and Marmor committed fraud in their testimony--has himself made misrepresentations to this Court. For example:  (i) his sworn statement that "homosexuals are approximately 43 times more apt to commit crimes than is the general population" is a total distortion of the Kinsey data upon which he relies--which, as is obvious to anyone who reads the report, concerns data from a non-representative sample of delinquent homosexuals (and Dr. Cameron compares this group to college and non-college heterosexuals); (ii) his sworn statement that "homosexuals abuse children at a proportionately greater incident than do heterosexuals" is based upon the same distorted data--and, the Court notes, is directly contrary to other evidence presented at trial besides the testimony of Dr. Simon and Dr. Marmour.'' (553 F. Supp. 1121 at 1130 n.18.) n309 Yes, this study used data from this same researcher without commenting on his questionable credibility and the possible fraudulence of his data.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UC Davis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_cameron_sheet.html |title=Paul Cameron Bio and Fact Sheet |accessdate=2013-05-13 |author=UC Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 30-year longitudinal study published in the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]],'' although the authors found that men with histories of childhood sexual abuse were more likely to report ever having had same-sex sexual partners, they did not find any "significant relationships between childhood physical abuse or neglect and same-sex sexual orientation in adulthood"; neither men nor women with histories of childhood physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect reported more same-sex sexual partners in the previous year or same-sex romantic cohabitation compared to men and women without such histories.&lt;ref name=Wilson2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = H.

'''Food engineering''' is a multidisciplinary field which combines [[Food microbiology|microbiology]], applied [[physical sciences]], [[chemistry]] and engineering for food and related industries.  Food engineering includes, but is not limited to, the application of [[agricultural engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and [[chemical engineering]] principles to food materials. Food engineers provide the technological knowledge transfer essential to the [[cost-effective]] production and [[commercialization]] of food products and services. Physics, chemistry, and mathematics are fundamental to understanding and engineering products and operations in the [[food industry]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0123985307 | title=Introduction to Food Engineering (5th ed.) | publisher=Academic Press |author1=Singh , R Paul |author2=Dennis R. Heldman | year=2013 | pages=1 | isbn=978-0123985309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food engineering encompasses a wide range of activities. Food engineers are employed in food processing, food machinery, [[packaging]], [[ingredient]] manufacturing, instrumentation, and control. Firms that design and build food processing plants, consulting firms, government agencies, [[pharmaceutical]] companies, and [[health-care]] firms also employ food engineers. Specific food engineering activities include:

*  drug/food products;
* design and installation of food/biological/pharmaceutical production processes;
* design and operation of environmentally responsible waste treatment systems;
* marketing and technical support for manufacturing plants.

==Topics==
In the development of food engineering, one of the many challenges is to employ modern tools, technology, and knowledge, such as computational materials science and [[nanotechnology]], to develop new products and processes. Simultaneously, improving quality, safety, and security remain critical issues in food engineering study. New packaging materials and techniques are being developed to provide more protection to foods, and novel preservation technology is emerging. Additionally, [[process control]] and [[process automation|automation]] regularly appear among the top priorities identified in food engineering. Advanced monitoring and control systems are developed to facilitate automation and flexible food manufacturing. Furthermore, [[energy saving]] and minimization of environmental problems continue to be important food engineering issues, and significant progress is being made in [[waste management]], efficient utilization of energy, and reduction of effluents and emissions in food production.

Typical topics include:food people
* Advances in classical unit operations in engineering applied to food manufacturing
* Progresses in the transport and [[Food storage|storage]] of liquid and solid foods
* Developments in heating, chilling and [[frozen foode|freezing]] of foods
* Advanced mass transfer in foods
* New chemical and biochemical aspects of food engineering and the use of kinetic analysis
* New techniques in dehydration, thermal processing, non-thermal processing, [[Food extrusion|extrusion]], liquid food concentration, membrane processes and applications of membranes in food processing
* Shelf-life, electronic indicators in [[inventory management]], and sustainable technologies in food processing
* Modern [[Food packaging|packaging]], cleaning, and sanitation technologies.

{{Accounting}}
'''Forensic accounting''', '''forensic accountancy''' or '''financial forensics''' is the specialty practice area of [[accounting]] that describes engagements that result from actual or anticipated disputes or [[litigation]]. "[[Forensic science|Forensic]]" means "suitable for use in a court of law", and it is to that standard and potential outcome that forensic accountants generally have to work. Forensic accountants, also referred to as forensic auditors or investigative auditors, often have to give expert evidence at the eventual trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Within these groups, there may be further sub-specializations: some forensic accountants may, for example, just specialize in [[insurance]] [[claim (legal)|claims]], [[personal injury]] claims, [[fraud]], [[Money Laundering|anti-money-laundering]], [[construction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Forensic accounting is defined as "the application of investigative and analytical skills for the purpose of resolving financial issues in a manner that meets standards required by courts of law. Forensic accountants apply special skills in accounting, auditing, finance, quantitative methods, certain areas of the law, research and investigative skills to collect, analyze and evaluate evidential matter and to interpret and communicate findings."&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Hopwood, J.J. Leiner &amp; G.R. Young, ''Forensic Accounting'', McGraw-Hill Irwin (2008), as quoted by Stephen Pedneault, Frank Rudewicz, Michael Sheetz &amp; Howard Silverstone, ''Forensic Accounting and Fraud Investigation'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (4th ed. 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial forensic engagements may fall into several categories.  For example:
* [[Damages|Economic damages]] calculations, whether suffered through [[tort]] or [[breach of contract]];
* Post-acquisition disputes such as [[earnout]]s or breaches of [[warranty|warranties]];
* [[Bankruptcy]], [[insolvency]], and [[Corporate action|reorganization]];
* [[Securities fraud]];
* [[Tax fraud]];
* [[Money laundering]];
* [[Business valuation]]; and
* [[Computer forensics]]/[[Electronic discovery|e-discovery]].
Forensic accountants often assist in professional [[negligence]] claims where they are assessing and commenting on the work of other professionals.  Forensic accountants are also engaged in [[marital and family law]] of analyzing lifestyle for spousal support purposes, determining income available for child support and equitable distribution.

Engagements relating to criminal matters typically arise in the aftermath of fraud. They frequently involve the assessment of accounting systems and accounts presentation—in essence assessing if the numbers reflect reality.

Some forensic accountants specialize in forensic analytics which is the procurement and analysis of electronic data to reconstruct, detect, or otherwise support a claim of financial fraud.  The main steps in forensic analytics are (a) data collection, (b) data preparation, (c) data analysis, and (d) reporting.  For example, forensic analytics may be used to review an employee's purchasing card activity to assess whether any of the purchases were diverted or divertible for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Forensic accountants, investigative accountants or expert accountants may be involved in recovering proceeds of serious crime and in relation to confiscation proceedings concerning actual or assumed proceeds of crime or [[money laundering]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], relevant legislation is contained in the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]]. Forensic accountants typically hold the following qualifications; [[Certified Forensic Accounting Professional]] [Certified Forensic Auditors] (CFA - England &amp; Wales) granted by the [[Forensic Auditors Certification Board of England and Wales]] (FACB), [[Certified Fraud Examiner]]s (CFE - US / International), [[Certificate Course on Forensic Accounting and Fraud Detection (FAFD)]] by [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI)]], [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPA - US) with [[AICPA]]'s [Certified in Financial Forensics est. 2008] (CFF) Credentials, [[Chartered Accountant]]s (CA - Canada), [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMA - Canada), [[Chartered Professional Accountant]]s (CPA - Canada)), [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|Chartered Certified Accountant]]s (CCA - UK), or [[Certified Forensic Investigation Professionals]] (CFIP). In India there is a separate breed of forensic accountants called Certified Forensic Accounting Professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/forensic-auditor-courses-catching-up-in-india-114042301428_1.html|title=Forensic Auditor Courses catching up in India |publisher=business-standard.com |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Certified Forensic Accountant (CRFAC)''' program from the '''American Board of Forensic Accounting''' assesses Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) knowledge and competence in professional forensic accounting services in a multitude of areas. Forensic accountants may be involved in both litigation support (providing assistance on a given case, primarily related to the calculation or estimation of economic damages and related issues) and investigative accounting (looking into illegal activities). The American Board of Forensic Accounting was established in 1993. 

In 2016, the Forensic Auditors Certification Board (FACB) of England and Wales was established by the major forensic auditing and accounting bodies from across the world with its registered address in London. FACB is a professional bodies membership body comprising the International Institute of Certified Forensic Accountants (IICFA) of USA, Institute of Forensic Auditors of Zimbabwe (IFA), Institute of Forensic Accountants of Pakistan (IFAP), Institute of Certified Forensic Accountants (ICFA) of USA and Canada and the Institute of Forensic Accountants of Nigeria (IFA). FACB plays several roles and one the roles is standardization of the examination and certification of forensic auditors globally. Forensic auditors and accountants sit for one examination that is set by FACB and upon passing and meeting all the professional requirements, are awarded the credential, Certified Forensic Auditor (CFA) or the Registered Forensic Auditor (RFA) for practitioners who intend to go into public practice. All certification is renewed on an annual basis. Apart from practitioners certification, FACB is an oversight body which accredits prospective member organization before admission as part of quality checks. Persons with the FACB credential can practice as forensic auditors on a global scale.

Large accounting firms often have a forensic accounting department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.big4accountingfirms.org/forensic-accounting-firms/|title=Service of Forensic Accountants |publisher=big4accountingfirms.org |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic accounting and fraud investigation methodologies are different than internal auditing. Thus forensic accounting services and practice should be handled by forensic accounting experts, not by internal auditing experts. Forensic accountants may appear on the crime scene a little later than fraud auditors, but their major contribution is in translating complex financial transactions and numerical data into terms that ordinary laypersons can understand. That is necessary because if the fraud comes to trial, the jury will be made up of ordinary laypersons. On the other hand, internal auditors move on checklists that may not surface the evidence that the jury or regulatory bodies look for. The fieldwork may carry out legal risks if internal auditing checklists are employed instead asking to a forensic accountant and may result serious consultant malpractice risks.

Forensic accountants utilize an understanding of [[Economics|economic theories]], [[business information]], [[Financial statements|financial reporting]] systems, accounting and auditing standards and procedures, [[data management]] &amp; [[electronic discovery]], [[data analysis techniques for fraud detection]], [[evidence]] gathering and investigative techniques, and litigation processes and procedures to perform their work. Forensic accountants are also increasingly playing more proactive risk reduction roles by designing and performing extended procedures as part of the statutory audit, acting as advisers to audit committees, [[fraud deterrence]] engagements, and assisting in investment analyst research.

A December 10,2014 Business Insider article explains Benford's Law as follows: in most naturally occurring datasets, the first digit of a number is 1, about 30% of the time, 2 about 18% of the time and 9 only about 5% of the time. So, one can identify the probable area of fraud by looking at the occurrences of the first digit in a given dataset.

The '''''fruitless'' gene''' (''fru'') is a ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' [[gene]] that encodes several variants of a putative [[transcription factor]] [[protein]]. Normal ''fruitless'' function is required for proper development of several anatomical structures necessary for courtship, including [[motor neurons]] which innervate [[muscles]] needed for fly sexual behaviors.&lt;ref name="Demir_Dickson_2005"/&gt; The gene does not have an obvious mammalian homolog, but appears to function in sex determination in species as distant as the mosquito ''Anopheles gambiae''.&lt;ref name="pmid16319090"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gailey DA, Billeter JC, Liu JH, Bauzon F, Allendorfer JB, Goodwin SF | title = Functional conservation of the fruitless male sex-determination gene across 250 Myr of insect evolution | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 633–43 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16319090 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msj070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''fruitless'' serves as an example of how a gene or a group of genes may regulate the development and/or function of neurons involved in innate behavior.  Research on ''fruitless'' has received attention in the popular press, since it provokes discussion on [[Biology and sexual orientation|genetics of human sexual orientation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The Atlantic  | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199706/homosexuality-biology/4 | title = Homosexuality and Biology, The Genetic Quest | date = June 1997 | first = Chandler | last = Burr | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The New York Times | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E1D9173EF930A25751C1A960958260 | title = Mating Game of Fruit Fly Is Traced to a Single Gene | date = December 13, 1996 | first = Nicholas | last = Wade | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; and behaviors such as gender-specific [[aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1952198,00.html | title = Flies reveal gene that makes girls fight like boys | date = November 20, 2006 | first = Ian | last = Sample }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
[[Male]] flies with mutations in the ''fruitless'' gene display altered sexual behavior. Fruitfly courtship, which involves a complex male-initiated [[ritual]], may be disrupted in many ways by mutated ''fru'' [[alleles]]; ''fru'' is necessary for every step in the ritual. Some alleles prevent courting entirely, while others disrupt individual components. Notably, some [[loss-of-function]] alleles change or remove [[sexual orientation|sexual preference]].&lt;ref name="Demir_Dickson_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Demir E, Dickson BJ | title = fruitless splicing specifies male courtship behavior in Drosophila | journal = Cell | volume = 121 | issue = 5 | pages = 785–94 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15935764 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.04.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many genes are known to be involved in male courtship behavior, the ''fruitless'' gene has been considered noteworthy because it exhibits sex-specific [[alternative splicing]]. When females produce the male-spliced gene product, they behave as males. Males that do not produce the male-specific product do not court females and are infertile.&lt;ref name="Demir_Dickson_2005"/&gt; In the brain, a subset (ca. 2,000) of neurons express ''fruitless''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cachero S, Ostrovsky AD, Yu JY, Dickson BJ, Jefferis GS | title = Sexual dimorphism in the fly brain | journal = Current Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 18 | pages = 1589–601 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20832311 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2010.07.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''fruitless'' expression is sufficient to instruct sexually dimorphic connectivity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kohl J, Ostrovsky AD, Frechter S, Jefferis GS | title = A bidirectional circuit switch reroutes pheromone signals in male and female brains | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 7 | pages = 1610–23 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24360281 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.11.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruta V, Datta SR, Vasconcelos ML, Freeland J, Looger LL, Axel R | title = A dimorphic pheromone circuit in Drosophila from sensory input to descending output | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7324 | pages = 686–90 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21124455 | doi = 10.1038/nature09554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''fruitless'' has at least four [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], each encoding proteins containing both a BTB (Broad complex/tramtrack/bric-a-brac) domain and a [[zinc finger]] [[Structural motif|motif]]. Alternative splicing occurs at both the 5' and 3' ends, and there are several variants (other than the male- and female-specific splicing patterns).&lt;ref name="Demir_Dickson_2005"/&gt;  The fruitless gene locus also controls the expression of hundreds of other genes,&lt;ref name="pmid18039034"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldman TD, Arbeitman MN | title = Genomic and functional studies of Drosophila sex hierarchy regulated gene expression in adult head and nervous system tissues | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = e216 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18039034 | pmc = 2082469 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; any subset of which may actually regulate behavior.

==Name==
Early work refers to the gene as ''fruity'', an apparent pun on both the common name of ''D. melanogaster'', the ''fruit fly'', as well as a [[slang]] word for [[homosexual]]. As [[social]] attitudes towards homosexuality changed, ''fruity'' came to be regarded as offensive, or at best, not [[politically correct]]. Thus, the gene was re-dubbed ''fruitless'', alluding to the lack of offspring produced by flies with the mutation.&lt;ref name="pmid2542123"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gailey DA, Hall JC | title = Behavior and cytogenetics of fruitless in Drosophila melanogaster: different courtship defects caused by separate, closely linked lesions | journal = Genetics | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = 773–85 | date = April 1989 | pmid = 2542123 | pmc = 1203660 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, despite the original name and a continuing history of misleading inferences by the popular media, fruitless mutants primarily show defects in male-female courtship, though certain mutants cause male-male or female-female courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = GeneBrief - fruitless | work = InteractiveFly | publisher = Society for Developmental Biology | url = http://www.sdbonline.org/sites/fly/dbzhnsky/frutles1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21852">Political science as a separate field is a rather late arrival in terms of [[social sciences]]. However, the term "political science" was not always distinguished from [[political philosophy]], and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also [[moral philosophy]], [[political economy]], [[political theology]], [[history]], and other fields concerned with [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] determinations of what ought to be and with [[Deductive reasoning|deducing]] the characteristics and functions of the ideal [[State (polity)|state]].

==Western==

===Ancient===
The antecedents of Western politics can be traced back to the [[Socrates|Socratic]] political philosophers, and [[Aristotle]] ("The Father of Political Science") (384–322 BC). These authors, in such works as ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' and ''[[Laws (Plato)|Laws]]'' by Plato, and ''[[Politics (Dima)|The Politics]]'' and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' by Aristotle, analyzed political systems philosophically, going beyond earlier Greek poetic and historical reflections which can be found in the works of epic poets like [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]], historians like [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], and dramatists such as [[Sophocles]], [[Aristophanes]], and [[Euripides]].

During the height of the [[Roman Empire]], famous historians such as [[Polybius]], [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]] documented the rise of the [[Roman Republic]], and the organization and histories of other nations, while statesmen like [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cicero]] and others provided us with examples of the politics of the republic and Rome's empire and wars. The study of politics during this age was oriented toward understanding history, understanding methods of governing, and describing the operation of governments. Nearly a thousand years elapsed, from the foundation of the city of Rome in 753 BC to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] or the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]]. In the interim, there is a manifest translation of [[Ancient Greece#Hellenistic Greece|Hellenic culture]] into the Roman sphere. The Greek gods become Romans and Greek philosophy in one way or another turns into Roman law e.g. [[Stoicism]]. The Stoic was committed to preserving proper hierarchical roles and duties in the state so that the state as a whole would remain stable. Among the best known Roman Stoics were philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and the emperor [[Max Aurelius]]. Seneca, a wealthy Roman patrician, is often criticized by some modern commentators/historians for failing to adequately live by his own precepts. [[The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius]], on the other hand, can be best thought of as the philosophical reflections of an emperor divided between his philosophical aspirations and the duty he felt to defend the Roman Empire from its external enemies through his various military campaigns. According to Polybius, Roman institutions were the backbone of the empire but [[Goldman Law]] is the [[wikt:medulla|medulla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aabriel Abraham |title=Ventures in political science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMwpeKhifwcC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=political+science+Roman+Stoics#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20science%20Roman%20Stoics&amp;f=false |page=29 |year=2002 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |isbn=978-1-58826-055-0 |quote=Polybius attributes the remarkable growth and power of Rome to its political institutions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
With the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]], there arose a more diffuse arena for political studies. The rise of monotheism and, particularly for the Western tradition, Christianity, brought to light a new space for politics and political action. Works such as [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of Christianity, redefining the borders between what was religious and what was political. During the [[Middle Ages]], the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts. Most of the political questions surrounding the relationship between [[Separation of church and state|church and state]] were clarified and contested in this period.

The Arabs lost sight of Aristotle's political science but continued to study Plato's ''Republic'' which became the basic text of Judeo-Islamic [[political philosophy]] as in the works of [[Alfarabi]] and [[Averroes]]; this did not happen in the Christian world, where Aristotle's ''Politics'' was translated in the 13th century and became the basic text as in the works of [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Muhsin |first=Mahdi |title=Alfarabi and the foundation of Islamic political philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6BF52Uw9BIC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=Political+science+Plato%27s+republic#v=onepage&amp;q=Political%20science%20Plato's%20republic&amp;f=false |page=35 |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-226-50186-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
During the [[Italian Renaissance]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] established the emphasis of modern political science on direct empirical observation of political institutions and actors. In the Prince Machiavelli posits a [[Realpolitik|realist]] viewpoint, arguing that even evil means should be considered if they help to create and preserve a desired regime. Machiavelli therefore also argues against the use of idealistic models in politics, and has been described as the father of the "politics model" of political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane |first=Ruth |title=Political science in theory and practice: the 'politics' model|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nB0LuuYYCkC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Political+science+Plato+the+republic#v=onepage&amp;q=Political%20science%20Plato%20the%20republic&amp;f=false|page=89 |year=1996 |publisher=M. E. Sharpe |isbn=978-1-56324-939-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavelli takes a different tone in his lesser known work, the Discourses of Livy. In this work he expounds on the virtues of republicanism and what it means to be a good citizen. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Michelle T.|date=2013|title=The Virtues of Republican Citizenship in Machiavelli’s Discourses on Livy|jstor=10.1017/s0022381613000030|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=75|issue=2|pages=317–329|doi=10.1017/s0022381613000030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the expansion of the scientific paradigm during the [[the Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed the study of politics beyond normative determinations.

===Enlightenment===
The works of the French philosophers Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot to name a few are paragon for political analysis, social science, social and political critic. Their influence leading to the French revolution has been enormous in the development of modern democracy throughout the world.

Like Machiavelli, [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], believed that a strong central power, such as a monarchy, was necessary to rule the innate selfishness of the individual but neither of them believed in the [[divine right of kings]]. [[John Locke]], on the other hand, who gave us [[Two Treatises of Government]] and who did not believe in the divine right of kings either, sided with Aquinas and stood against both Machiavelli and Hobbes by accepting Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas' preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin, Locke believed man comes into this world with a mind that is basically a [[tabula rasa]]. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for [[natural law]] is based on reason and equality, seeking peace and survival for man.

The new Western philosophical foundations that emerged from the pursuit of reason during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era helped pave the way for policies that emphasized a need for a separation of church and state. Principles similar to those that dominated the material sciences could be applied to society as a whole, originating the [[social sciences]]. Politics could be studied in a laboratory as it were, the social [[social environment|milieu]]. In 1787, [[Alexander Hamilton]] wrote: "...The science of politics like most other sciences has received great improvement." (''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' Number 9 and 51). Both the marquis d'Argenson and the abbé de Saint-Pierre described politics as a science; d'Argenson was a philosopher and de Saint-Pierre an allied reformer of [[the enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gay |first=Peter |title=The enlightenment|page=448 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQPna6P69i0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA448&amp;dq=political+science+the+enlightenment#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20science%20the%20enlightenment&amp;f=false|volume=2 |year=1996 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co. |isbn=978-0-393-31366-6 |quote=The men of the Enlightenment sensed that they could realize their social ideals only by political means.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important figures in American politics who participated in the Enlightenment were [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]].

===19th century===
The Darwinian models of evolution and natural selection exerted considerable influence in the late 19th century. Society seemed to be evolving ever upward, a belief that was shattered by World War I.

"History is past politics and politics present history" was the motto of the first generation of American political scientists, 1882-1900.  The motto had been coined by the Oxford professor [[Edward Augustus Freeman]], and was enshrined on the wall of the seminar room at Johns Hopkins University where the first large-scale training of America and political scientists began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Baxter Adams|title=The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MgU7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12|year=1883|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The founding professors of the field included [[Herbert Baxter Adams]] at Johns Hopkins, [[John Burgess (political scientist)|John Burgess]] and [[William Dunning]] at Columbia, [[Woodrow Wilson]] at Princeton, and [[Albert Bushnell Hart]] at Harvard.  Their graduate seminars had a thick historical cast, which typically reflected their experience in German University seminars.  However,  succeeding generations of scholars progressively cut back on the history and deliberate fashion.  The second generation wanted to model itself on the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipsett, ed., Politics and the Social Sciences (1969) pp 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States (1890s-1920s), political science became not only a prestigious university curriculum but also an applied science that was welcomed as a way to apply expertise to the problems of governance. Among the most prominent applied political scientists were [[Woodrow Wilson]],&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Hastedt, "Woodrow Wilson and Literature on Political Science," ''White House Studies'' (2011) 10#4 pp 451-458&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles A. Beard]], and [[Charles E. Merriam]]. Many cities and states set up research bureaus to apply the latest results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard K. Fleischman]] and R. Penny Marquette, "Chapters in Ohio Progressivism: The Cincinnati and Dayton Bureaus of Municipal Research and Accounting Reform," ''Ohio History'' (1988) 98#1 pp 133-144. [http://publications.ohiohistory.org/ohstemplate.cfm?action=detail&amp;Page=0097133.html&amp;StartPage=133&amp;EndPage=144&amp;volume=97&amp;notes=&amp;newtitle=Volume%2097%20Page%20133 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1920===

The [[American Political Science Association]], established in 1903, is the largest professional association of political scientists.

===Behavioralism===
{{main article|Behavioralism}}
Behavioralism (Behaviouralism) is an empirical approach which emerged in the 1930s in the United States. It emphasized an objective, quantified approach to explain and predict political behavior. Guy says "Behaviouralism emphasized the systematic understanding of all identifiable manifestations of political behaviour. But it also meant the application of rigorous scientific and statistical methods to standardize testing and to attempt value free inquiry of the world of politics... For the behaviouralist, the role of political science is primarily to gather and analyze facts as rigorously and objectively as possible.&lt;ref&gt;James John Guy, ''People, Politics and Government: A Canadian Perspective'' (2000) p 58&lt;/ref&gt; Petro p 6 says "Behavioralists generally felt that politics should be studied much in the same way hard sciences are studied."&lt;ref&gt;Nicolai Petro, ''The Rebirth of Russian Democracy: An Interpretation of Political Culture'' (1995) p 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the rise of the [[behavioral sciences]], modeled after the [[natural sciences]]. As Guy notes, quote=The term behaviouralism was recognized as part of a larger scientific movement occurring simultaneously in ''all'' of the social sciences, now referred to as the behavioural sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Guy, ''People, Politics and Government'' p 58&lt;/ref&gt; This means that behavioralism tries to explain behavior with an unbiased, neutral point of view.

Behavioralism seeks to examine the behavior, actions, and acts of ''individuals'' – rather than the characteristics of institutions such as legislatures, executives, and judiciaries and groups in different social settings and explain this behavior as it relates to the political.&lt;ref&gt;Hanes Walton, ''Invisible Politics'' pp 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Systems====

Gunnell argues that since the 1950s the concept of system was the most important theoretical concept used by American political scientists. The idea appeared in sociology and other social sciences but [[David Easton]] specified how it could be best applied to behavioral research on politics.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Gunnell, "The Reconstitution of Political Theory: David Easton, Behavioralism, and the Long Road to System," ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'' (2013) 49#2 pp 190-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
Canadian universities until the 1950s were led by British trained scholars for whom political science was not a high priority. Canadians favoured  the study of political economy. After 1950 younger scholars increasingly took American PhDs and Canadian departments promoted behavioralism and quantification.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Whitaker, "'Confused Alarms of Struggle and Flight': English-Canadian Political Science in the 1970s," ''Canadian Historical Review'' (1979) 60#1 pp 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
Political science operates on a smaller scale in European universities compared to American ones.  Traditionally political studies were handled by law professors or professors of philosophy. American impulses toward behavioralism have made the ''[[European Consortium for Political Research]]'' (ECPR) is a unifying force.  It sponsors several scholarly journals including  ''[[European Political Science]]'' (EPS) (since 2001), ''[[European Journal of Political Research]]'' (EJPR) and ''[[European Political Science Review]]'' (EPSR).

==India==
In [[History of India|ancient India]], the antecedents of politics can be traced back to the ''[[Rig-Veda]]'', ''[[Vedas|Samhitas]]'', ''[[Brahmana]]s'', the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''[[Pali Canon]]''. [[Chanakya]] (c. 350–275 BC) was a political thinker in [[Takshashila]]. Chanakya wrote the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', a treatise on political thought, [[economics]] and social order. It discusses monetary and fiscal policies, welfare, international relations, and war strategies in detail, among other topics. The [[Manusmriti]], dated to about two centuries after the time of Chanakya is another important Indian political treatise.

==China==
Ancient China was home to several competing schools of political thought, most of which arose in the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. These included [[Mohism]] (a utilitarian philosophy), [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] (a school of thought based on the supremacy of the state), and [[Confucianism]]. Eventually, a modified form of Confucianism (heavily infused with elements of Legalism) became the dominant political philosophy in China during the Imperial Period. This form of Confucianism also deeply influenced and were expounded upon by scholars in Korea and Japan.

Modern scholarship has rapidly developed in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Carlson, Mary Gallager, Kenneth Lieberthal and Melanie Manion, ''Chinese Politics: New Sources, Methods, and Field Strategies'' (Cambridge, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1995 ''The Journal of Chinese Political Science'' (JCPS) has been a refereed academic journal that publishes theoretical, policy, and empirical research articles on Chinese topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sujian Guo, ed.|title=Political Science and Chinese Political Studies: The State of the Field|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iYXDKSSAJKAC|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3642295904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle East==
In medieval Persia, works such as the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]] and Epic of Kings by [[Ferdowsi]] provided evidence of political analysis, while the Middle Eastern [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelians]] such as [[Avicenna]] and later [[Maimonides]] and [[Averroes]], continued [[Aristotle]]'s tradition of analysis and [[empiricism]], writing commentaries on Aristotle's works. Averroe did not have at hand a text of Aristotle's ''Politics'', so he wrote a commentary on Plato's ''Republic'' instead.

The '''Institute of Modern Languages''', also known as IML-UQ, is a language and translation institute located within the [[St Lucia]] campus of the [[University of Queensland]] (UQ) in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. Today IML-UQ enrolls 3000 plus students annually in all of its language programs.

IML-UQ provides courses in over 30 languages. Designed to enrich the knowledge of a language and its culture, these courses are taught by native speakers with a focus on enhancing fluency and accuracy of expression. Apart from Latin, their content is based on themes and topics of the modern world in which we live.

IML-UQ is an [[Australians|Australian]] translator and interpreter service for 75 different languages, specialising in [[English Language|English]] language translations. Languages available at the IML-UQ include [[Arabic Language|Arabic]], [[Brazilian Portuguese Language|Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Cantonese]], [[Standard Chinese|Chinese Mandarin]], [[Croatian Language|Croatian]], [[Czech Language|Czech]], [[Dutch Language|Dutch]], [[Danish Language|Danish]], [[Finnish Language|Finnish]], [[French Language|French]], [[Greek Language|Greek]], [[German Language|German]], [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], [[Hindi Language|Hindi]], [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]], [[Italian Language|Italian]], [[Japanese Language|Japanese]], [[Korean Language|Korean]], [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Norwegian Language|Norwegian]], [[Persian Language|Persian]], [[Polish Language|Polish]], [[Russian Language|Russian]], [[Spanish Language|Spanish]], [[Swedish Language|Swedish]], [[Thai Language|Thai]], [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] and [[Vietnamese Language|Vietnamese]] amongst many others.

Established in 1934, IML-UQ continues to serve the community by facilitating language learning and [[cross-cultural]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Working Papers in Asian Studies | issue = 6 | publisher = Centre for Asian Studies, The University of Western Australia | year = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years it has sought to develop strategies to reach out to students in order to enrich their experience of learning another language. IML-UQ still meets the language service needs of the corporate sector, small businesses, government departments and community organisations. 
IML-UQ seeks to fulfill the original aspiration of the University of Queensland Senate to give more adults the chance to deepen their lives by bringing them into the university community via language courses open to the public.  
IML-UQ also provides a vehicle for UQ students to remain connected with its alumni in a meaningful way over the decades in which they are no longer engaged in more formal study.

== Background ==
When the seventh Senate of the University of Queensland met in March 1932, it stated its intentions "…to serve increasingly, despite straitened resources, not only education but whatever public needs science and learning could serve."&lt;ref name="AccountUQ"&gt;The University of Queensland. An Account of The University of Queensland during its First Twenty-five Years: 1910-1935.Brisbane: Biggs &amp; Company Pty., 1935, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ways these intentions were made manifest in 1934 was "to bring those classes under an Institute of Modern Languages (IML-UQ) associated with the Faculties of Arts and Commerce and to offer through it instruction in any modern language for which there should be a sufficient demand."&lt;ref name="AccountUQ"/&gt;

The successful launching of the IML-UQ was largely the result of the personal commitment to non-traditional university studies of a number of prominent University of Queensland academics. These academics recognised the demand for language teaching from the community at large.&lt;ref&gt;Thomis, I. Malcolm. A Place of Light &amp; Learning: The University of Queensland’s First Seventy-five Years. St Lucia: University of Queensland Press, 1985, p. 132-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==
When IML-UQ was established at the University of Queensland on 11 May 1934, it was the first adult education extension unit in modern languages to be attached to an Australian tertiary education institution. According to a university statute, IML-UQ was intended to "promote and extend the teaching of Modern Languages."&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, J. F. Statute Relating to the Institute of Modern Languages: The University of Queensland Act of 1909, Section 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Telegraph reported the University’s decision to establish IML-UQ as follows (12 May 1934): "At the meeting of the University Senate yesterday afternoon a recommendation for the establishment of IML-UQ was approved. This is clearly an important educational development, since it provides machinery for the study of foreign languages that have a cultural and commercial value for the State, and for which no provision is made in secondary schools for Junior, Senior, and Matriculation purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Thomis, I. Malcolm. A Place of Light &amp; Learning: The University of Queensland’s First Seventy-five Years. St Lucia: University of Queensland Press, 1985, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

IML-UQ commenced operations with one class each in French and Italian and two in German. In an article entitled ‘A Wider National Perspective’ (Courier-Mail, 14 May 1934, see page 5), the author articulates a vision of language education serving the national interest. The view was that IML-UQ courses would provide training in practical skills which would benefit business and international travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A Wider National Perspective | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 14 May 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Language programs were also endorsed as suitable educational ventures towards better international understanding and tolerance.

Australia’s changing perceptions of the non-English speaking world were reflected through the changing patterns of IML-UQ enrolments. New prospects in international commerce and tourism and the evolution of a cosmopolitan Australian society through post-war immigration were reflected in the diversification of language courses. These new courses were offered in response to public demand.

In another article, entitled ‘Foreign Languages’, which appeared in the Courier-Mail on the same day, the new IML-UQ courses were defined as follows: "The courses were…for commercial purposes, and would not enter so deeply into the literature of the languages as in an ordinary degree course, but rather would aim at the impartation of good working business knowledge of each tongue dealt with." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Foreign Languages | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 14 May 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching methods ==
The history of language teaching at IML-UQ has been characterised by an ongoing search for more effective ways of teaching languages. 
The Grammar Translation Method was the main language teaching method in the initial decades. After this the Direct Method, which emphasises listening and speaking skills, was introduced.

Today, languages are primarily taught using the Communicative and Intercultural Language Teaching and Learning approaches with less emphasis on whole class activities and more on pair and group work.

== History ==

=== The early years: 1935–1965 ===
On 23 April 1934, resolutions to create a constitution and rules were passed by IML-UQ Joint Sub-Committee of the Faculties of Arts and Commerce. By 1937, special courses were added for those involved in scientific work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Institute of Modern Languages | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 27 Feb 1937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, students of Russian reflected a sentiment that, "Russian will probably be useful in the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = They say Russian may be Useful | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 29 March 1952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1954, IML-UQ had grown to the point that a review of its purposes, services and administrative structures was required. The main priority was to establish IML-UQ as a provider of ‘adult education’, where courses would not enter ‘deeply into literature’ but focus on a ‘good working knowledge’ for practical application; followed by the expectation to satisfy requirements set for honours students in the Faculty of Commerce; and lastly to provide access to languages for which there was no provision in schools for Junior, Senior and Matriculation purposes.

All IML-UQ classes were held in the [[Old Government House, Queensland|Old Government House]] on [[George Street, Brisbane|George Street]]. By the late 1960s, all IML-UQ classes were transferred to the St Lucia campus, where they remain today. The first full-time IML-UQ director was appointed in 1965.

=== The middle years: 1965–1998 ===
Donald Munro was the first full-time Director of IML-UQ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Diaries of a Stretcher-Bearer: 1916-1918 | publisher = Boolarong Press | year = 2010 | author = Edward Munro | editor = Donald Munro | isbn = 1921555556 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1965 - 1970.

Mr Munro advocated the idea that learning languages would assist in community engagement. He believed that the study of a language would help students to understand the perspective of those who spoke that language. In his own words, his assumption was that "language and culture cannot be separated."&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Munro, "The University of Queensland Institute of Modern Languages," in Education News 10, no.10 (August 1966), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  He advocated that the study of language could itself form a cultural bridge, and thus is important for Australia’s migrant population.

He began a move to audio-lingual teaching methods by acquiring new teaching and learning equipment which could simultaneously play and record, so that students could compare their pronunciation with a master track.

Dr Max Brändle the second full-time IML-UQ director from 1970 - 1998, taught 5 languages at IML-UQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The German presence in Queensland over the last 150 years: proceedings of an international symposium, August 24, 25, and 26, 1987|last=|first=|publisher=University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia|year=|isbn=0867762527|location=|page=397|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[blogs.abc.net.au/queensland/2010/09/faces-of-brisbane-max-brandle-from-switzerland.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
During Dr Brändle’s time as IML-UQ director, IML-UQ established the first commercial ELICOS (English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students) centre in Australia that taught English solely to individual, full-fee paying students.  In 1988 the University set up a separate TESOL unit, now known as the [[Institute of Continuing &amp; TESOL Education]].

=== The later years (1999–) ===
Georgiana Poulter became the new IML-UQ Director in 1999, commencing a series of functional changes to the structure of Institute. 
In response to the increasing trend of global business, IML-UQ now includes a translation and interpreting service appropriate to the international market inclusive of local cultural needs. External clients range from the mining and engineering industry, to law firms, government departments, migration agents, and the IT, travel and advertising industries.

To enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning which is the primary focus of IML-UQ, in-house training, or Professional Development (PD), workshops are now implemented for tutors and staff, and involvement with professional associations is encouraged. 
Translation, interpreting, language courses and customised tuition are the foundational components to support the purpose of IML-UQ in its ongoing role facilitating community engagement and links between UQ and the Brisbane community.

== Language programs ==

=== Adult programs ===
IML-UQ is designed to enhance employment opportunities, improve communication abilities, support lifelong learning and international travel, and maintain language skills in a practical adult (16+) learning environment. Year courses commence March of each year, and second semester courses commence in July. Short courses are offered in Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.

Languages currently taught at IML-UQ are:
Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Cantonese), Chinese (Mandarin), Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek (Modern), Hebrew (Modern), Hindi, Indonesian, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese.

=== Customised courses===
IML-UQ offers one-on-one and small group private tuition in most languages customised for business, government departments, companies, travel preparation, research, personal development and cross-cultural communication. Customised courses are designed to offer flexibility in course content, structure and teaching style at venues and times that suit the needs of students. Qualified and experienced tutors are selected specifically for each organisation or individual.

=== Summer high school program ===
These language enrichment courses are designed for students in the Senior phase of learning who wish to enrich their knowledge of the language and culture they are currently studying and practise their language skills over the long Summer holidays. The courses are taught by native speakers with a focus on enhancing fluency and accuracy of expression, with content based on themes and topics specified in the QSA Senior Syllabus.

The '''Institute of Tropical Medicine''' ({{lang-fr|Institut de médecine tropicale}}) previously known as '''Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine''' is located in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]. ITM is one of the world's leading institutes for training and research in [[tropical medicine]] and the organisation of health care in developing countries. It also delivers outpatient, clinical and preventive services in tropical pathologies and sexually transmitted diseases.

The institute has a strong reputation in biomedical, clinical and public health research, advanced education, travel medicine and care for HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections, as well as capacity-building in developing countries. [[Peter Piot]] and colleagues at the institute were the first to demonstrate that AIDS was a tropical African disease. ITM has been recognized by the [[World Health Organization]] as a reference centre for [[Aids|AIDS]] research. ITM also is a national and international reference centre for a series of diseases and pathogens (such as the [[Ebola]] virus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itg.be/E|title=Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At ITM, some 450 scientists and technicians do research on pathogens, patients and populations. Yearly, an average of 500 medical doctors, nurses and scientists follow advanced courses; some 120 young researchers are completing their PhD. Each year, the medical services handle around 35 000 consultations. The website www.travelhealth.be services more than 100 000 visitors a year.

More than 75% of its publications appear in the top-25% of journals in its field. (Scimago World Ranking, 2010)

ITM also carries out an extensive capacity strengthening program in developing countries, and is part of a large network of institutions in Africa, South America and Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4833">The anonymous '''''Liber diversarum arcium''''' ('Book of various arts') is a [[medieval]] [[:Category:Art technological sources | handbook of painting]]. It contains over 500 art-technological instructions or recipes in [[Latin]], forming a complete structured painting course. It is probably the most substantial and comprehensive mediaeval [[:Category:Art technological sources | painters' technical recipe book]] to survive, and summarises the state of the art in the European workshops of the fourteenth century. In particular it is an important witness to the practice of [[oil painting]] before [[Van Eyck]]. The majority of the [[:Category:Art technological sources | recipes]] are unique.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;Clarke, M. (2011) ''Mediaeval Painters’ Materials and Techniques: The Montpellier ‘Liber diversarum arcium’.'' London: Archetype Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Liber diversarum arcium'' is preserved in Manuscript H 277, fonds ancien, Bibliothèque interuniversitaire, section médecine, [[Montpellier]], [[France]] ([[Recto and verso|folios]] 81v-101v).&lt;ref&gt;Ravaisson, F. and Libri, G. (1849) ''Catalogue général des manuscrits des bibliothèques publiques des departments'', Vol. 1. Paris:  Imprimerie National, pp. 394–9, 739–811.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this manuscript dates from circa 1430 and was written in or near [[Venice]], in fact the textual core of the ''Liber diversarum arcium'' itself mainly reflects northern European practices, and probably dates from c.1300. This core consists partly of compilations of earlier technical recipes (but re-worked to make them more useful), and partly of newly composed material. During the fourteenth century various material (much of it Italian) was added to this core. &lt;ref name=clarke/&gt;

== Content ==
The text is substantial (26,000 words in Latin - thus containing far more on painting than the more famous ''[[Theophilus Presbyter]]''), and is unusual among medieval artists' recipe books in being highly structured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uhb.fr/alc/medieval/cd10/Oltrogge.pdf |format=PDF |last=Oltrogge |first=Doris |year=1998 |title=Cum sesto et rigula', l’organisation du savoir technologique dans le Liber diversarum artium de Montpellier et dans le De diversis artibus de Théophile, ''Cahiers Diderot'' 10: 67–99.

* Book I (the longest) describes the fundamentals of painting: [[drawing]], choice and preparation of [[pigment]]s, preparing media and [[tempera]], mixing pigments and modelling, and finally [[gilding]].
* Book II describes the advanced techniques, and the variations and refinements in technique, necessary for [[Oil paint|oil painting]] on wood: preparation of [[Panel painting|panels]], oils and [[varnish]]es, differences in the behaviour of [[pigment]]s in [[Oil paint|oil]], [[gilding]], imitation [[sgraffito]] etc.
* Book III (the shortest) describes the variations in technique and materials needed to paint [[mural]]s. 
* Book IV describes painting on glass and ceramics, and some other auxiliary decorative techniques: [[gilding]], [[silvering]] and colouring of metals, [[dyeing]] (principally for wood or skins), painting ceramics, [[Stained glass | painting glass]], and making and attaching [[artificial gem]]s.

In the [[historically informed performance]] movement, musicians perform [[classical music]] using restored or replicated versions of the instruments for which it was originally written.  Often performances by such musicians are said to be "on authentic instruments".

This article consists of a list of such instruments, including both instruments that are now obsolete and early versions of instruments that continued to be used in later classical music. This list only includes [[woodwind]], [[keyboard instruments|keyboard]], and [[Brass instruments|brass]] instruments.

The London Green500 is led by a consortium on behalf of the [[London Development Agency]]. [[AEA Technology]] is the lead contractor, with [[Mouchel]], [[National Energy Foundation]], Futerra and Future Considerations.

== What is Green500? ==

The aim of Green500 is to enlist some of London’s largest and most prestigious organisations and mentor them through their carbon reduction commitments.

Green500 is one of a number of London Development Agency (LDA) [[London Development Agency]] initiatives, including Better Buildings Partnership, which aim to reduce London’s CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.  

Members of Green500 receive an initial assessment of their London specific carbon footprint from an expert Green500 Carbon Mentor.  Members are then presented with a tailored Action Plan outlining how they can reduce their carbon emissions.  
The individual Action Plans not only aim to reduce the member’s carbon footprint, but also estimates financial savings for energy, waste, water and transport.  The Green500 Action Plan also gives information on expected payback periods for each change, if implemented successfully. 

As well as providing a company specific Action Plan, Green500 also offers significant benefits to members including awards, networking opportunities and access to specialist suppliers.

== What does Green500 provide? ==

* Support from a Carbon Mentor

[[File:The March of Progress.jpg|250px|thumb|The original '''''March of Progress''''' illustration from ''Early Man'' (1965) with [[spread (typography)|spread]] extended (top) and folded (bottom)]]
'''''The March of Progress''''', properly called '''''The Road to Homo Sapiens''''', is an illustration that presents 25 million years of [[human evolution]]. It was created for the ''Early Man'' volume of the ''[[Life Nature Library]]'', published in 1965.

It has been viewed as a picture of the discredited view ([[orthogenesis]]) that evolution is progressive.&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt; As such, it has been widely parodied and imitated to create images of progress of other kinds.

The picture of progress in evolution was anticipated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''.

==Illustration==
The illustration is part of a section of text and images commissioned by [[Time-Life Books]] for the ''Early Man'' volume (1965) of the ''[[Life Nature Library]]'', by [[Francis Clark Howell|F. Clark Howell]].&lt;ref name=Howell1965&gt;Howell, F. Clark and the Editors of TIME-LIFE Books (1965), ''Early Man'', [[New York City|New York]]: [[TIME-LIFE Books]], pp. 41–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The illustration is a [[spread (typography)|foldout]] entitled "The Road to Homo Sapiens". It shows a sequence of figures, drawn by natural history painter and muralist [[Rudolph Zallinger]] (1919–1995).&lt;ref name=Howell1965/&gt; The 15 human evolutionary forebears are lined up as if they were marching in a parade from left to right. The first two sentences of the caption read "What were the stages of man's long march from apelike ancestors to ''sapiens''? Beginning at right and progressing across four more pages are milestones of primate and human evolution as scientists know them today, pieced together from the fragmentary fossil evidence."&lt;ref name=Howell1965/&gt;

===Sequence of species===
The 15 primate figures in Zallinger's image, from left to right, are listed below. The datings follow the original graphic and may no longer reflect current scientific opinion.

* ''[[Pliopithecus]]'', 22–12 million year old "ancestor of the [[gibbon]] line"
* ''[[Proconsul (primate)|Proconsul]]'', 21–9 million year old primate which may or may not have qualified as an ape
* ''[[Dryopithecus]]'', 15–8 million year old fossil ape, the first such found (1856) and probable ancestor of modern apes
* ''[[Oreopithecus]]'', 15–8 million years old
* ''Ramapithecus'',  13–8 million year old ape and possible ancestor of modern [[orangutan]]s (now considered a female ''[[Sivapithecus]]'')
* ''[[Australopithecus]]'', 2–3 million years old; then considered the earliest "certain hominid"
* ''[[Paranthropus]]'', 1.8–0.8 million years old
* Advanced ''Australopithecus'', 1.8–0.7 million year old
* ''[[Homo erectus]]'', 700,000–400,000 years old, then the earliest known member of the genus ''Homo''
* [[Early Homo sapiens|Early ''Homo sapiens'']], 300,000–200,000 years old; from [[Swanscombe Heritage Park|Swanscombe]], [[Steinheim Skull|Steinheim]] and [[Montmaurin]], then considered probably the earliest ''H. sapiens''
* [[Solo Man]], 100,000–50,000 years old; described as an extinct Asian "race" of ''H. sapiens'' (now considered a sub-species of ''H. erectus'')
* [[Rhodesian Man]], 50,000–30,000 years old; described as an extinct African "race" of ''H. sapiens'' (now considered either ''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]'' or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis|H. heidelbergensis]]'' and dated much earlier)
* [[Neanderthal Man]], 100,000–40,000 years old
* [[European early modern humans|Cro-Magnon Man]], 40,000–5,000 years old
* [[Anatomically modern humans|Modern Man]], 40,000 years to the present

==Intention==
[[File:Astronomy Evolution 2 (27458655072).jpg|thumb|One of many versions of the progressionist [[meme]]: ''Astronomy Evolution 2'' by Giuseppe Donatiello, 2016]]

Contrary to appearances and some complaints, the original 1965 text of "The Road to Homo Sapiens" reveals an understanding of the fact that a linear presentation of a sequence of primate species, all in the direct line of human ancestors, would not be a correct interpretation. For example, the fourth of Zallinger's figures (''Oreopithecus'') is said to be "a likely side branch on man's family tree". Only the next figure (''Ramapithecus'') is described as "now thought by some experts to be the oldest of man's ancestors in a direct line" (something no longer considered likely). That implies that the first four primates are not to be considered actual human ancestors. Likewise, the seventh figure (''Paranthropus'') is said to be "an evolutionary dead end".&lt;ref name=Howell1965/&gt; In addition, the colored stripes, across the top of the figure, which indicate the age and duration of the various lineages clearly imply that there is no evidence of direct continuity between extinct and extant lineages and also, multiple lineages of the figured hominids occurred contemporaneously at several points in the history of the group.

==Reception==
[[File:Evolution on a wall.jpg|thumb|Anti-war mural, Tehran, 2007]]
The image has frequently been copied, modified, and parodied. It has been criticized as  "unintentionally and wrongly" implying that "[[Orthogenesis|evolution is progressive]]".&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Jennifer|title=What our most famous evolutionary cartoon gets wrong|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/10/27/what-our-most-famous-evolutionary-cartoon-gets-wrong/drKMD5121W6EUxXJ4pF0YL/story.html|accessdate=29 December 2017|work=The [[Boston Globe]]|date=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the way the illustration has been interpreted, the anthropologist and author of the section, [[F. Clark Howell]], remarked:&lt;ref name=Barringer2006/&gt;

{{quote|The artist didn't intend to reduce the evolution of man to a linear sequence, but it was read that way by viewers.&amp;nbsp;... The graphic overwhelmed the text. It was so powerful and emotional.&lt;ref name=Barringer2006&gt;Barringer,  David (2006) "Raining on Evolution’s Parade"; ''[[I.D. Magazine]]'', March/April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Stephen Jay Gould]] (1941–2002) condemned the iconology of the image in several pages of his 1989 book, ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', reproducing several advertisements and political cartoons that make use of the illustration to make their various points. In a chapter, "The Iconography of an Expectation", he asserted that&lt;ref name=Gould1989/&gt;
{{quote|The march of progress is ''the'' canonical representation of evolution – the one picture immediately grasped and viscerally understood by all.&amp;nbsp;... The straitjacket of linear advance goes beyond [[iconography]] to the definition of evolution: the word itself becomes a synonym for ''progress''.&amp;nbsp;... [But] life is a copiously branching bush, continually pruned by the grim reaper of extinction, not a [[Orthogenesis|ladder of predictable progress]].&lt;ref name=Gould1989&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen Jay]] (1989), ''Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History''. [[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]], pp 30–36.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The [[intelligent design]] advocate [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]] wrote in ''[[Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth?]]'' (2002), "Although it is widely used to show that we are just animals, and that our very existence is a mere accident, the ultimate icon goes far beyond the evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wells |first=Jonathan |title=[[Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth?]] |year=2000 |publisher=Regnery Publishing |page=211 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book likens a selection of evolution theory textbook topics to the cover illustration thus qualified.

Brian Switek, writing for ''[[Scientific American]]'', argues that the idea of a "march of progress", as depicted in the 1965 Time-Life illustration, dates back to the medieval [[great chain of being]] and the 19th century idea of the "[[transitional fossil|missing link]]" in the [[fossil record]]. In his view, to understand life and evolution, "step one involves casting out types of imagery which constrain rather than enlighten."&lt;ref name="Switek2010"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Switek |first1=Brian |title=Breaking our link to the 'March of Progress' |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/breaking-our-link-to-the-march-of-progress/ |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=23 May 2018 |date=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Switek added that "There is perhaps no other illustration that is as immediately recognizable as representing evolution, but the tragedy of this is that it conveys a view of life that does not resemble our present understanding of life's history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Switek |first1=Brian |title=The March of Progress has Deep Roots |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/11/the-march-of-progress-has-deep-roots/ |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=23 May 2018 |date=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parodies and adaptations==

[[File:Protestplakat S21 am Bauzaun - 89.jpg|thumb|A German protest banner in Stuttgart, 2010. The caption below the image reads "We will not allow ourselves to be made into monkeys!"]]
* A 1966 advertisement for Greg Noll Surfboards' "Da Cat" model (based on the popularity of Malibu surfer Miki Dora) appropriated the Zallinger image to parody the evolution of surfing personas.
* The logo for the Leakey Foundation features a small silhouette of the ''March of Progress'' image.&lt;ref name="Barringer 2006, Op. cit."&gt;Barringer (2006), ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[National Museums of Kenya]], in [[Nairobi]], has long used a logo based on the Zallinger image.
* The cover of the 1972 [[The Doors|Doors]] album ''[[Full Circle (The Doors album)|Full Circle]]'' references the ''March of Progress''.
* The cover of the 1985 [[Supertramp]] album ''[[Brother Where You Bound]]'' resembles the ''March of Progress''.
* On the cover of the soundtrack CD for the 1992 movie ''[[Encino Man]]'', an ape evolves into a [[skateboarder]].&lt;ref name="Barringer 2006, Op. cit."/&gt;
* The 3 March 1994 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine includes a graphic, "Humanity's Long March", referencing Zallinger's image with a more complicated graphic underneath.
* A 1998 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' features an image of actor [[Ben Stiller]] evolving from a hairy ape into a naked actor.
* A graphic in the December 2005 issue of ''[[The Economist]]'' depicts hominids progressing up a flight of stairs to transform into a woman in a black dress holding a glass of [[champagne (wine)|champagne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of Man|url=https://www.economist.com/node/5327621|publisher=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=23 May 2018|date=20 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s frontispiece to his 1863 book ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' was intended simply to compare the skeletons of apes and humans, but its unintentional left-to-right [[Orthogenesis|progressionist]] sequence has according to the historian Jennifer Tucker "become an iconic and instantly recognizable visual shorthand for evolution".&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt;

The '''Marine Science Institute''' (MSI) is a [[nonprofit organization]] focusing on [[marine science]] research and education. MSI was founded in 1970&lt;ref name="sfg"/&gt; and currently is situated in [[Redwood City, California]] adjacent to the [[Port of Redwood City]].&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt; In the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] MSI has a mission driving marine education for schoolchildren and continues to receive grants to supplement their donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Californial Coastal Conservancy|authorlink1=California Coastal Conservancy|title=Explore The Coast Grants Program|url=http://scc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/sccbb/2016/1603/20160324Board10_Explore_the_Coast|accessdate=2 December 2016|pages=11|date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and research==
The Marine Science Institute offers tours of the Bay in [[Antioch, California|Antioch]] in the January and February months, and the rest of the time based out of Redwood City at their main location and research station along the banks of [[Redwood Creek (San Mateo County)|Redwood Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Jason B.|title=Voyage of Delta discoveries|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Voyage-of-Delta-discoveries-Redwood-City-2772193.php|accessdate=2 December 2016|work=SFGate|date=2 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute allows students at schools around the bay to observe and interact with  the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Austin|title=Tech aims to sponsor field trips: Redwood City students get trip through new program|url=http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2016-03-19/tech-aims-to-sponsor-field-trips-redwood-city-students-get-trip-through-new-program/1776425160336.html|accessdate=2 December 2016|work=San Mateo Daily Journal|date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;Marine life is often collected, measured for size, and documented to add to a database to continually monitor conditions and overall health within the bay.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion''' (formerly '''Max Planck Institute for Bioinorganic Chemistry''') is a [[science|scientific]] [[research]] facility located in the [[Germany|German]] town of [[Mülheim]], northeast of [[Düsseldorf]]. One of 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]], it was first part of the neighboring [[Max Planck Institute for Coal Research]] and became independent in 1981 under the name of '''Max Planck Institute for Radiation Chemistry'''. It was renamed to Max Planck Institute for Bioinorganic Chemistry in 2003, to reflect its changing research focus. Following a significant restructuring and expansion of its departments in 2011, it was re-established in 2012 as the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion. It consists of research departments specializing on heterogeneous catalysis, homogeneous catalysis, biophysical chemistry, and theoretical chemistry.

Directors at the Institute are:
* Serena DeBeer, Inorganic Spectroscopy
* Wolfgang Lubitz, Dept. Biophysical Chemistry
* Frank Neese, Dept. Molecular Theory and Spectroscopy
* Robert Schlögl, Heterogeneous Reactions

In the [[philosophy of science]], '''models of scientific inquiry''' have two functions: first, to provide a descriptive account of ''how'' scientific inquiry is carried out in practice, and second, to provide an explanatory account of ''why'' scientific inquiry succeeds as well as it appears to do in arriving at genuine knowledge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The search for scientific knowledge ends far back into antiquity.  At some point in the past, at least by the time of Aristotle, philosophers recognized that a fundamental distinction should be drawn between two kinds of scientific knowledge—roughly, knowledge ''that'' and knowledge ''why''.  It is one thing to know ''that'' each planet periodically reverses the direction of its motion with respect to the background of fixed stars;  it is quite a different matter to know ''why''.  Knowledge of the former type is descriptive;  knowledge of the latter type is explanatory.  It is explanatory knowledge that provides scientific understanding of the world.  (Salmon, 2006, pg. 3)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Scientific inquiry refers to the diverse ways in which scientists study the natural world and propose explanations based on the evidence derived from their work."&lt;ref name=NRC-1996/&gt;

==Accounts of scientific inquiry==

===Classical model===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The classical model of scientific inquiry derives from [[Aristotle]], who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also treated the compound forms such as reasoning by [[analogy]].

===Pragmatic model===
{{main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}

===Logical empiricism===
[[Wesley Salmon]] (1989)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt; began his historical survey of scientific explanation with what he called the ''received view'', as it was received from [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] in the years beginning with their ''Studies in the Logic of Explanation'' (1948) and culminating in Hempel's ''[[Aspects of Scientific Explanation and other Essays in the Philosophy of Science|Aspects of Scientific Explanation]]'' (1965).  Salmon summed up his analysis of these developments by means of the following Table.

{| class="wikitable" align="center" style="text-align:center; width:90%"
|-
! Laws / Explananda !! Particular Facts !! General Regularities
|-
! Universal Laws
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
|-
! Statistical Laws
| I-S

Inductive-Statistical
| D-S

Deductive-Statistical
|}

In this classification, a [[deductive-nomological]] (D-N) explanation of an occurrence is a valid deduction whose conclusion states that the outcome to be explained did in fact occur.  The deductive argument is called an ''explanation'', its premisses are called the ''explanans'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''explaining'') and the conclusion is called the ''explanandum'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''to be explained'').  Depending on a number of additional qualifications, an explanation may be ranked on a scale from ''potential'' to ''true''.

Not all explanations in science are of the D-N type, however.  An ''inductive-statistical'' (I-S) explanation accounts for an occurrence by subsuming it under statistical laws, rather than categorical or universal laws, and the mode of subsumption is itself inductive instead of deductive.  The D-N type can be seen as a limiting case of the more general I-S type, the measure of certainty involved being complete, or [[probability]] 1, in the former case, whereas it is less than complete, probability &amp;lt; 1, in the latter case.

In this view, the D-N mode of reasoning, in addition to being used to explain particular occurrences, can also be used to explain general regularities, simply by deducing them from still more general laws.

Finally, the ''deductive-statistical'' (D-S) type of explanation, properly regarded as a subclass of the D-N type, explains statistical regularities by deduction from more comprehensive statistical laws.  (Salmon 1989, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

Such was the ''received view'' of scientific explanation from the point of view of [[logical empiricism]], that Salmon says "held sway" during the third quarter of the last century (Salmon, p.&amp;nbsp;10)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

==Choice of a theory==
{{See also|Commensurability (philosophy of science)}}
During the course of history, one theory has succeeded another, and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena. The reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple. The philosophy of science includes the question: ''What criteria are satisfied by a 'good' theory''. This question has a long history, and many scientists, as well as philosophers, have considered it. The objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing [[cognitive bias]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn/&gt; Several often proposed criteria were summarized by Colyvan.&lt;ref name=Colyvan/&gt; A good theory:
# Is elegant (Formal elegance; no ''ad hoc'' modifications)
# Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements (simplicity/parsimony)
# Agrees with and explains all existing observations (unificatory/[[explanatory power]])
# Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can [[disprove]] or [[falsify]] the model if they are not borne out.
# Is fruitful: the emphasis by Colyvan is not only upon prediction and falsification, but also upon a theory's [[wikt:seminality|seminality]] in suggesting future work.

[[Stephen Hawking]] supports items 1–4, but does not mention fruitfulness.&lt;ref name=Hawking/&gt; On the other hand, Kuhn emphasizes the importance of seminality.&lt;ref name=Kuhn0/&gt;

The goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary. Nonetheless, these criteria contain subjective elements, and are [[heuristics]] rather than part of [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=Simplicity/&gt; Also, criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories. Quoting Bird:&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;
{{quote|"They [such criteria]  cannot determine scientific choice. First, which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable (''e.g.'' does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form?). Secondly, these criteria are imprecise, and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold. Thirdly, there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another, especially when they conflict." |Alexander Bird|Methodological incommensurability}}

It also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria, which may represent goals not yet achieved. For example, explanatory power over all existing observations (criterion 3) is satisfied by no one theory at the moment.&lt;ref name=Realism/&gt;
{{quote|Whatever might be the ultimate goals of some scientists, science, as it is currently practiced, depends on multiple overlapping descriptions of the world, each of which has a domain of applicability. In some cases this domain is very large, but in others quite small.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;|E.B. Davies |Epistemological pluralism, p. 4}}

The [[wikt:desiderata|desiderata]] of a "good" theory have been debated for centuries, going back perhaps even earlier than [[Occam's razor]],&lt;ref name=Desiderata/&gt; which often is taken as an attribute of a good theory. Occam's razor might fall under the heading of "elegance", the first item on the list, but too zealous an application was cautioned by [[Albert Einstein]]: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt; It is arguable that ''parsimony'' and ''elegance'' "typically pull in different directions".&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;   The falsifiability item on the list is related to the criterion proposed by Popper as demarcating a scientific theory from a theory like astrology: both "explain" observations, but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong:&lt;ref name=Popper1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popper0/&gt;
{{quote|"It must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience."
"Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the game of science."
|Karl Popper|The logic of scientific discovery, p. 18 and p. 280}}
[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, "revolutions" in scientific practice which result in [[paradigm shift]]s.&lt;ref name=Kuhn2/&gt; As an example, Kuhn suggested that the [[heliocentric]] "[[Copernican Revolution]]" replaced the [[geocentric]] views of [[Ptolemy]] not because of empirical failures, but because of a new "paradigm" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.

==Aspects of scientific inquiry==

===Deduction and induction===
[[Deductive logic]] and [[inductive logic]] are quite different in their approaches.

'''Deductive logic''' is the reasoning of proof, or [[Logical consequence|logical implication]]. It is the logic used in mathematics and other [[axiomatic system]]s such as formal logic. In a deductive system, there will be [[axiom]]s (postulates) which are not proven. Indeed, they cannot be proven without circularity. There will also be primitive terms which are not defined, as they cannot be defined without circularity. For example, one can define a line as a set of points, but to then define a point as the intersection of two lines would be circular. Because of these interesting characteristics of [[formal system]]s, Bertrand Russell humorously referred to mathematics as "the field where we don't know what we are talking about, nor whether or not what we say is true". All theorems and corollaries are proven by exploring the implications of the axiomata and other theorems that have previously been developed. New terms are defined using the primitive terms and other derived definitions based on those primitive terms.

In a deductive system, one can correctly use the term "proof", as applying to a theorem. To say that a theorem is proven means that it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. For example, we could do a simple [[syllogism]] such as the following:

# [[Arches National Park]] lies within the state of [[Utah]].
# I am standing in Arches National Park.
# Therefore, I am standing in the state of Utah.

Notice that it is not possible (assuming all of the trivial qualifying criteria are supplied) to be in Arches and not be in Utah. However, one can be in Utah while not in Arches National Park. The implication only works in one direction. Statements (1) and (2) taken together imply statement (3). Statement (3) does not imply anything about statements (1) or (2). Notice that we have not proven statement (3), but we have shown that statements (1) and (2) together imply statement (3). In mathematics, what is proven is not the truth of a particular theorem, but that the axioms of the system imply the theorem. In other words, it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. The strength of deductive systems is that they are sure of their results. The weakness is that they are abstract constructs which are, unfortunately, one step removed from the physical world. They are very useful, however, as mathematics has provided great insights into natural science by providing useful models of natural phenomena. One result is the development of products and processes that benefit mankind.

Learning about the physical world requires the use of '''inductive logic'''. This is the logic of theory building. It is useful in such widely divergent enterprises as science and crime scene detective work. One makes a set of observations, and seeks to explain what one sees. The observer forms a hypothesis in an attempt to explain what he/she has observed. The hypothesis will have implications, which will point to certain other observations that would naturally result from either a repeat of the experiment or making more observations from a slightly different set of circumstances. If the predicted observations hold true, one feels excitement that they may be on the right track. However, the hypothesis has not been proven. The hypothesis implies that certain observations should follow, but positive observations do not imply the hypothesis. They only make it more believable. It is quite possible that some other hypothesis could also account for the known observations, and may do better with future experiments. The implication flows in only one direction, as in the syllogism used in the discussion on deduction. Therefore, it is never correct to say that a scientific principle or hypothesis/theory has been proven. (At least, not in the rigorous sense of proof used in deductive systems.)

A classic example of this is the study of gravitation. Newton formed a law for gravitation stating that the force of gravitation is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. For over 170 years, all observations seemed to validate his equation. However, telescopes eventually became powerful enough to see a slight discrepancy in the orbit of Mercury. Scientists tried everything imaginable to explain the discrepancy, but they could not do so using the objects that would bear on the orbit of Mercury. Eventually, Einstein developed his theory of [[general relativity]] and it explained the orbit of Mercury and all other known observations dealing with gravitation. During the long period of time when scientists were making observations that seemed to validate Newton's theory, they did not, in fact, prove his theory to be true. However, it must have seemed at the time that they did. It only took one counterexample (Mercury's orbit) to prove that there was something wrong with his theory.

This is typical of inductive logic. All of the observations that seem to validate the theory, do not prove its truth. But one counter-example can prove it false.  That means that deductive logic is used in the evaluation of a theory.  In other words, if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  Einstein's theory of General Relativity has been supported by many observations using the best scientific instruments and experiments. However, his theory now has the same status as Newton's theory of gravitation prior to seeing the problems in the orbit of Mercury. It is highly credible and validated with all we know, but it is not proven. It is only the best we have at this point in time.

Another example of correct scientific reasoning is shown in the current search for the [[Higgs boson]].  Scientists on the [[Compact Muon Solenoid]] experiment at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] have conducted experiments yielding data suggesting the existence of the Higgs boson. However, realizing that the results could possibly be explained as a background fluctuation and not the Higgs boson, they are cautious and waiting for further data from future experiments.  Said Guido Tonelli:

{{Quote|"We cannot exclude the presence of the [[Standard Model]] Higgs between 115 and 127 [[GeV]] because of a modest excess of events in this mass region that appears, quite consistently, in five independent channels [...] As of today what we see is consistent either with a background fluctuation or with the presence of the boson."}}

A brief overview of the '''scientific method''' would then contain these steps as a minimum:

# Make a set of observations regarding the phenomenon being studied.
# Form a hypothesis that might explain the observations.  (Inductive Step)
# Identify the implications and outcomes that must follow, if the hypothesis is to be true.
# Perform other experiments or observations to see if any of the predicted outcomes fail.
# If any predicted outcomes fail, the hypothesis is proven false since if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  (Deductive Logic)  It is then necessary to change the hypothesis and go back to step 3.  If the predicted outcomes are confirmed, the hypothesis is not proved, but rather can be said to be consistent with known data.

When a hypothesis has survived a sufficient number of tests, it may be promoted to a [[scientific theory]].  A theory is a hypothesis that has survived many tests and seems to be consistent with other established scientific theories.  Since a theory is a promoted hypothesis, it is of the same 'logical' species and shares the same logical limitations.  Just as a hypothesis cannot be proven but can be disproved, that same is true for a theory.  It is a difference of degree, not kind.

'''Arguments from analogy''' are another type of inductive reasoning. In arguing from analogy, one infers that since two things are alike in several respects, they are likely to be alike in another respect. This is, of course, an assumption. It is natural to attempt to find similarities between two phenomena and wonder what one can learn from those similarities. However, to notice that two things share attributes in several respects does not imply any similarities in other respects. It is possible that the observer has already noticed all of the attributes that are shared and any other attributes will be distinct. Argument from analogy is an unreliable method of reasoning that can lead to erroneous conclusions, and thus cannot be used to establish scientific facts.

A '''''ménage à trois''''' ({{lang-en|"household of three"}}) is a domestic arrangement in which three people have [[romance (love)|romantic]] or [[sexual relations]] with each other, typically occupying the same household. A form of [[polyamory]], contemporary arrangements are sometimes identified as a '''throuple'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/throuple-meaning-what-you-do-in-a-three-person-relationship_uk_5798ba5be4b0796a0b611e7a Throuple Relationships vs Threesomes Explained: What It's Like To Be In A Three-Person Romance], ''[[HuffPost]]'', 2016 July 28.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''thruple'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/11/22/this-thruple-of-two-men-and-a-woman-want-to-adopt-kids/ A thruple of a married male couple and their girlfriend want to have kids], ''[[PinkNews]]'', 2017 November 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical instances==
&lt;!-- sorted in chronological order, where possible --&gt;

History has a number of examples of ''ménages à trois'' relationships.

Speculation exists that, in 1547–48, Queen [[Catherine Parr]], widow of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and her fourth husband [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] were involved in a ''ménage'' with the future [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].  This is probably exaggerated, although  episodes of sexually charged horseplay involving the three were well attested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Starkey |authorlink=David Starkey |date=2000-04-27 |title=Elizabeth |isbn=0-7011-6939-7 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Linda |last=Porter |authorlink=Linda Porter (historian) |date=2010-03-19 |title=Katherine the Queen: The Remarkable Life of Katherine Parr |isbn=0-230-71039-5 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth, thirteen years her junior, the French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was a [[Wiktionary:protégé|protégé]] of the French noblewoman [[Françoise-Louise de Warens]], who would become his first lover. He lived with her at her estate on and off since his teenage years, and in 1732, after he reached the age of 20, she initiated a sexual relationship with him while also being open about her sexual involvement with the steward of her house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rousseau|first=Jean-Jacques|title=Confessions|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31500-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German intellectual [[Dorothea von Rodde-Schlözer]], her husband Mattheus Rodde and the French philosopher [[Charles de Villers]] also had a ''ménage à trois'' from 1794 until her husband's death in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Poulet|first=Anne L. |title=Jean-Antoine Houdon: Sculptor of the Enlightenment |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2003-12-12 |page=319 |chapter=Dorothea von Rodde-Schlözer (1770–1825) |isbn=0-226-67647-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EV0BgrzV-fkC&amp;pg=PA319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 16, in 1813, the future author of [[Frankenstein]], [[Mary Shelley|Mary Godwin]], eloped with her to-be husband [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and engaged in a ''ménage'' with [[Claire Clairmont]], future lover of [[Lord Byron]], with whom the Shelleys would later have an extensive relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Who's who in British History: A-H|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fLeeV-mqlJMC&amp;pg=PA1115|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|date = 1998-01-01|isbn = 9781884964909|language = en|first = Geoffrey Russell Richards|last = Treasure|page = 1115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political philosopher [[Friedrich Engels]] lived in a ''ménage à trois'' with his mistress Mary Burns and her sister Lizzie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hands|first1=Gill|title=Marx: A complete introduction|date=2015|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9781473608696|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, [[psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]] began a relationship with a young patient, [[Toni Wolff]], which lasted for some decades.

Artist Zhu Haogu created the '''''Paradise of Maitreya''''' (彌勒佛說法圖) wall painting during China’s [[Yuan Dynasty]]. The painting was originally housed in the Xinghua Si Temple of Xiaoning, [[Shanxi]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, it was disassembled and moved to the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] (ROM) of [[Toronto]], Canada, where it remains today. Museum officials have undertaken a series of restorations to preserve and stabilize the painting. Currently, it can be found in the museum’s "Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art" as part of the Far Eastern Collection and is described as one of its must-see Iconic Objects.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013"&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, [http://images.rom.on.ca/public/index.php?function=image&amp;action=simpledetail&amp;image_name=ROM2006_7153_1 ''The Paradise of Maitreya wall-painting''], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting features the [[Bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]],&lt;ref name="ROM 2012"&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, [http://www.rom.on.ca/en/collections-research/rom-channel/iconic-paradise-meitreya ''Iconic: The Paradise of Maitreya''], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a future Buddha who is foretold to appear on Earth in order to help humans achieve enlightenment through the teachings of dharma.&lt;ref name ="McBride"&gt;McBride &amp; Richard, ''Silla Buddhism and the Hwarang'', ''Korean Studies, 34, 54-89'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

As it stands today, the wall painting measures 502&amp;nbsp;cm in height and 1101&amp;nbsp;cm in length and has a symmetrical composition, notable for its high level of detail.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013" /&gt; It features Buddha Maitreya in the centre of an imagined heaven, surrounded on both sides by monks and the ruling king and queen. Although Buddha Maitreya is commonly depicted as an Indian figure, all of the characters in The Paradise of Maitreya are found to be wearing Chinese robes and clothing.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

The piece foretells the coming of the coming of the Buddha Maitreya, who is said to appear on Earth in its darkest hour to save humanity from [[samsara]].&lt;ref name ="McBride" /&gt; The royal family depicted in the painting is gathering the first assembly; leading 84,000 newly converted followers into salvation. Both the king and the queen have bald, shaven heads,&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt; which, in Buddhist culture, represents turning towards enlightenment and nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Eilberg-Schwartz &amp; Doniger ''Off with Her Head!: The Denial of Women's Identity in Myth, Religion and Culture'', University of California Press, page 33, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation ==

The famed painter and Buddhist monk, Zhu Haogu (朱好古), along with his pupil Zhang Boyuan (張伯淵), created the dry fresco painting on the southwestern portion of the Xinghua Si (興化寺) monastery during China’s Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref name ="Mclean"&gt;McLean, Dziadowiec &amp; Kirinkov, [https://www.cac-accr.ca/files/pdf/EJournalVol33_abstract2.pdf "Conservation of the Chinese Temple Painting The Paradise of Maitreya from the Bishop White Gallery, Royal Ontario Museum"], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare the monastery wall for this type of painting, it was covered first with a mudded layer of clay, followed by a layer of straw and additional layer of clay, giving the surface a workable texture. From there, a light carbon ink and colour pigments were used to create the image, which would have been copied from a smaller-scale version.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

== Movement ==

During the 1920s, the various armies of the [[Warlord Era|Chinese warlords]] would often plunder small villages in search of valuable goods. Fearing The Paradise of Maitreya was in danger of theft, the monks of Xinghua Si removed the work from the wall and partitioned it into 63 pieces so that it could be securely stored and hidden in [[Taiyuan]]. While the painting survived the plundering, it faced environmental threats from fire and draught in its new location. Instead of allowing the work to undergo further degradation, the monks began approaching art dealers, hoping to sell it.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

In 1928, Anglican Bishop [[William White (Bishop of Honan)]] heard of the sale and proceeded to purchase the painting. Over the following 5&amp;nbsp;year period, the piece was shipped from Taiyuan to [[Tianjin]], then taken via American Express to Boston, and from there was taken to Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum by train.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

== Restoration at the Royal Ontario Museum ==

While the painting suffered notable damage following its removal from the Xinghua si monastery, restoration efforts made by the ROM have led The Paradise of Maitreya to become one of the best preserved pieces from the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013" /&gt;

Restoration on the piece commenced in 1933 with structural treatment to reassemble the 63 panels the painting was partitioned into. During the work’s movement, a significant amount of degradation had occurred, causing loss and disfigurement.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt; After the initial restoration was completed, George Stout mounted the painting on the north wall of the ROM’s Bishop White Gallery. It was placed on Masonite panels developed at the [[Fogg Museum|Fogg Art Museum]] using a [[polyvinyl acetate]] resin.&lt;ref name ="Mclean" /&gt;

=== Renaissance ROM ===

As part of a museum-wide restoration effort put on by the ROM in 2005, ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' received further attention addressing surface and structural issues. Plastazote LD45 was used to undertake general breakdowns in the joint material of the [[Masonite]] panels for its flexibility and imperviousness to humidity.&lt;ref name ="Mclean" /&gt;

== Dating ==

While ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' arrived in the ROM in 1933, it wasn’t until 1940 when Bishop William C. White became the first to propose a date for the painting. A team of students commissioned by White discovered the painting appeared to bear an inscription dictating it was completed on the 14th day of the mid-autumn moon of ''qingshen''. White believed this gave an age that was too young for the painting and that his students had therefore interpreted the inscription incorrectly. Instead, he believed the inscription read the painting was completed in ''wuzu'', not ''qingshen'', which he claimed would date it to be from 1238.&lt;ref name ="Steinhardt"&gt;Steinhardt, "A New Date for the ROM Painting and the Southern Shanxi Buddhist-Daoist Style", "Artibus Asiae, 48, 1, 5-38", 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig Bachhofer later researched the painting and found an additional inscription quoting “da Yuan guo” (the great Yuan state). As this title was not used in Yuan until 1271, it made the painting’s date of 1238 inaccurate. He agreed that the painting bore the inscription ''wuzu'', not ''qingshen'', however, as these characters were reused on a 60-year cycle, he instead believed the term ''wuzu'' was referring to the year 1298.&lt;ref name ="Steinhardt" /&gt;

=== Controversy ===

As most of the painting’s inscriptions were not transported to the ROM from China and the Xinghua si monastery fell to ruins in 1938, it is impossible to get a full record of the painting’s background information. Both White and Bachlofer made assumptions in their findings and as such, neither has been able to make a full claim on the painting’s date. As such, ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' remains the most controversial painting from the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, "Further Observations on the Yuan Wall Painter Zhu Haogu and the Relationship of the Chunyang Hall Wall Paintings to The Maitreya Paradise at the ROM", "Artibus Asiae, 52, 1, 94-118", 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Occupational hazards}}

'''Personal protective equipment''' ('''PPE''') refers to protective [[clothing]], [[helmets]], [[goggles]], or other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer's body from [[injury]] or [[infection]]. The hazards addressed by protective equipment include physical, electrical, heat, chemicals, [[biological hazard|biohazards]], and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]]. Protective equipment may be worn for job-related [[occupational safety and health]] purposes, as well as for [[sports]] and other  [[recreation|recreational activities]]. "Protective clothing" is applied to traditional categories of clothing, and "protective gear" applies to items such as pads, guards, shields, or  masks, and others.

The purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce employee exposure to hazards when [[engineering controls]] and [[administrative controls]] are not feasible or effective to reduce these risks to acceptable levels. PPE is needed when there are hazards present. PPE has the serious limitation that it does not eliminate the hazard at the source and may result in employees being exposed to the hazard if the equipment fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014041258/http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }} Personal Protective Equipment&lt;/ref&gt;

Any item of PPE imposes a barrier between the wearer/user and the working environment. This can create additional strains on the wearer;
impair their ability to carry out their work and create significant levels of discomfort. Any of these can discourage wearers from using PPE correctly, therefore placing them at risk of injury, ill-health or, under extreme circumstances, death. Good ergonomic design can help to minimise these barriers and can therefore help to ensure safe and healthy working conditions through the correct use of PPE.

Practices of occupational safety and health can use hazard controls and interventions to mitigate workplace hazards, which pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of workers. The [[hierarchy of hazard controls]] provides a policy framework which ranks the types of hazard controls in terms of absolute risk reduction. At the top of the hierarchy are [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] and [[Hazard substitution|substitution]], which remove the hazard entirely or replace the hazard with a safer alternative. If elimination or substitution measures cannot apply, engineering controls and administrative controls, which seek to design safer mechanisms and coach safer human behavior, are implemented. Personal protective equipment ranks last on the hierarchy of controls, as the workers are regularly exposed to the hazard, with a barrier of protection. The hierarchy of controls is important in acknowledging that, while personal protective equipment has tremendous utility, it is not the desired mechanism of control in terms of worker safety.

==Types==
[[File:Die Bienenzüchter (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|left|A 1568 painting depicting beekeepers in protective clothing, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]].]]

Personal protective equipment can be categorized by the area of the body protected, by the types of hazard, and by the type of garment or accessory. A single item, for example boots, may provide multiple forms of protection: a steel toe cap and steel insoles for protection of the feet from crushing or puncture injuries, impervious rubber and lining for protection from water and chemicals, high [[Reflectance|reflectivity]] and heat resistance for protection from radiant heat, and high electrical [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity]] for protection from electric shock. The protective attributes of each piece of equipment must be compared with the hazards expected to be found in the workplace. More breathable types of personal protective equipment may not lead to more contamination but do result in greater user satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verbeek|first1=Jos H|last2=Ijaz|first2=Sharea|last3=Mischke|first3=Christina|last4=Ruotsalainen|first4=Jani H|last5=Mäkelä|first5=Erja|last6=Neuvonen|first6=Kaisa|last7=Edmond|first7=Michael B|last8=Sauni|first8=Riitta|last9=Kilinc Balci|first9=F Selcen|last10=Mihalache|first10=Raluca C|title=Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 April 2016|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd011621.pub2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub2/full|accessdate=29 April 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|pmid=27093058|volume=4|page=CD011621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respirators===
{{main article|Respirator}}
[[File:Air-Purifying Respirator.jpg|thumb|Air-purifying respirator]]

Respirators serve to protect the user from breathing in contaminants in the air, thus preserving the health of one's respiratory tract. There are two main types of respirators. One type of respirator functions by filtering out chemicals and gases, or airborne particles, from the air breathed by the user.&lt;ref name=resp&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/ Respirators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830084012/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/ |date=2012-08-30 }}. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; The filtration may be either passive or [[Powered, air-purifying respirator|active (powered)]]. [[Gas mask]]s and [[respirator|particulate respirators]] are examples of this type of respirator. A second type of respirator protects users by providing clean, respirable air from another source. This type includes airline respirators and [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] (SCBA).&lt;ref name =resp/&gt; In work environments, respirators are relied upon when adequate ventilation is not available or other engineering control systems are not feasible or inadequate.&lt;ref name=resp/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, an organization that has extensive expertise in respiratory protective equipment is the [[Institute of Occupational Medicine]]. This expertise has been built on a long-standing and varied research programme that has included the setting of workplace protection factors to the assessment of efficacy of masks available through high street retail outlets.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE), [[NHS Health Scotland]] and Healthy Working Lives (HWL) have jointly developed the RPE (Respiratory Protective Equipment) Selector Tool, which is web-based. This interactive tool provides descriptions of different types of respirators and breathing apparatuses, as well as "dos and don'ts" for each type.&lt;ref name=rpe&gt;[http://www.healthyworkinglives.com/rpe-selector/ "Selecting the right Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) for the job"]. Healthy Working Lives. 2008-4-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) provides recommendations on respirator use, in accordance to NIOSH federal respiratory regulations 42 CFR Part 84.&lt;ref name=resp/&gt; [[The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory]] (NPPTL) of NIOSH is tasked towards actively conducting studies on respirators and providing recommendations.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html CDC - NIOSH - Respirator Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928092148/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html |date=2017-09-28 }}.

===Skin protection===
[[File:Worker weighing carbon nanotubes.png|alt=A man wearing a white lab coat reaches over a beaker containing white powder on a balance|thumb|A worker wearing a [[respirator]], [[lab coat]], and [[Medical glove|gloves]] while weighing [[carbon nanotube]]s]]
[[File:Incorrect use of personal protective equipment.png|alt=A closeup of a person's arm requing into a bucket filled with a black material|thumb|This is an incorrect use of personal protective equipment, because the gap between the [[Medical glove|glove]] and the [[lab coat]] exposes the wrist to hazardous materials.]]
Occupational skin diseases such as [[contact dermatitis]], [[skin cancer]]s, and other skin injuries and infections are the second-most common type of occupational disease and can be very costly.&lt;ref name="skin"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/ CDC - Skin Exposures and Effects - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806040459/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/ |date=2012-08-06 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Skin hazards, which lead to occupational skin disease, can be classified into four groups. [[Chemical hazard|Chemical agents]] can come into contact with the skin through direct contact with contaminated surfaces, deposition of aerosols, immersion or splashes.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Physical agents such as extreme temperatures and ultraviolet or solar radiation can be damaging to the skin over prolonged exposure.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Mechanical trauma occurs in the form of friction, pressure, abrasions, lacerations and contusions.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Biological agents such as parasites, microorganisms, plants and animals can have varied effects when exposed to the skin.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt;

Any form of PPE that acts as a barrier between the skin and the agent of exposure can be considered skin protection. Because much work is done with the hands, [[glove]]s are an essential item in providing skin protection. Some examples of gloves commonly used as PPE include [[rubber gloves]], [[cut-resistant gloves]], [[chainsaw safety clothing|chainsaw gloves]] and heat-resistant gloves. For sports and other recreational activities, many different gloves are used for protection, generally against mechanical trauma.

Other than gloves, any other article of clothing or protection worn for a purpose serve to protect the skin. [[White coat|Lab coats]] for example, are worn to protect against potential splashes of chemicals. [[Face shield]]s serve to protect one's face from potential impact hazards, chemical splashes or possible infectious fluid.

===Eye protection===
{{Main|Eye protection}}
[[Image:Nuxos1pl.JPG|thumb|left|A paintball player wearing appropriate eye protection against impact.]]

Each day, about 2000 US workers have a job-related eye injury that requires medical attention.&lt;ref name="eye"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ CDC - Eye Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707114404/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ |date=2017-07-07 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Eye injuries can happen through a variety of means. Most eye injuries occur when solid particles such as metal slivers, wood chips, sand or cement chips get into the eye.&lt;ref name="eye" /&gt; Smaller particles in [[smoke]]s and larger particles such as broken glass also account for particulate matter-causing eye injuries. Blunt force trauma can occur to the eye when excessive force comes into contact with the eye. Chemical burns, biological agents, and thermal agents, from sources such as [[welding]] torches and [[ultraviolet|UV light]], also contribute to occupational eye injury.&lt;ref name="eyesafe"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eyesafe.html CDC - Eye Safety - Eye Safety for Emergency Response and Disaster Recovery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902212409/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eyesafe.html |date=2017-09-02 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the required eye protection varies by occupation, the safety provided can be generalized. Safety glasses provide protection from external debris, and should provide side protection via a wrap-around design or side shields.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* [[Goggles]] provide better protection than safety glasses, and are effective in preventing eye injury from chemical splashes, impact, dusty environments and welding.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt; Goggles with high air flow should be used to prevent fogging.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* [[Face shield]]s provide additional protection and are worn over the standard eyewear; they also provide protection from impact, chemical, and blood-borne hazards.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* Full-facepiece respirators are considered the best form of eye protection when respiratory protection is needed as well, but may be less effective against potential impact hazards to the eye.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* Eye protection for welding is shaded to different degrees, depending on the specific operation.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;

===Hearing protection===
{{Main article|Hearing protection}}
[[Industrial noise]] is often overlooked as an occupational hazard, as it is not visible to the eye. Overall, about 22 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially damaging noise levels each year.&lt;ref name="noise"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html CDC - Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention - Facts and Statistics - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703145248/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html |date=2016-07-03 }}. The National Institute for Occuaptional Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational hearing loss accounted for 14% of all occupational illnesses in 2007, with about 23,000 cases significant enough to cause permanent hearing impairment.&lt;ref name="noise" /&gt; About 82% of occupational hearing loss cases occurred to workers in the manufacturing sector.&lt;ref name="noise" /&gt; The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] establishes occupational noise exposure standards.&lt;ref name="oshanoise"&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 Occupational noise exposure - 1910.95] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402213424/https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 |date=2015-04-02 }}. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH recommends that worker exposures to noise be reduced to a level equivalent to 85&amp;nbsp;dBA for eight hours to reduce occupational [[noise-induced hearing loss]].&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational Noise Exposure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202172749/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf |date=2017-02-02 }}.  DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 98-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

PPE for hearing protection consists of [[earplugs]] and [[earmuffs]]. Workers who are regularly exposed to noise levels above the NIOSH recommendation should be furnished hearing protection by the employers, as they are a low-cost intervention.

===Protective clothing and ensembles===
{{See also|List of personal protective equipment by body area}}
[[File:Regal mit Persönlicher Schutzausrüstung.jpg|thumb|upright|Locker containing personal protective equipment]][[Image:High-Pressure-Cleaning-with-Personal-Protective-Equipment.jpg|thumb|right|A complete PPE ensemble worn during high pressure cleaning work]]

This form of PPE is all-encompassing and refers to the various suits and uniforms worn to protect the user from harm. Lab coats worn by scientists and [[ballistic vest]]s worn by law enforcement officials, which are worn on a regular basis, would fall into this category. Entire sets of PPE, worn together in a combined suit, are also in this category.

====Ensembles====
Below are some examples of ensembles of personal protective equipment, worn together for a specific occupation or task, to provide maximum protection for the user.
* [[Chainsaw]] [[chainsaw safety clothing|protection]] (especially a helmet with face guard, hearing protection, [[kevlar]] [[chaps]], anti-vibration gloves, and [[Chainsaw safety clothing#Boots|chainsaw safety boots]]).
* [[Beekeeping|Bee-keepers]] wear various levels of protection depending on the temperament of their bees and the reaction of the bees to nectar availability. At minimum most bee keepers wear a brimmed hat and a veil made of fine mesh netting. The next level of protection involves [[leather glove]]s with long gauntlets and some way of keeping [[bees]] from crawling up one's trouser legs. In extreme cases, specially fabricated shirts and trousers can serve as barriers to the bees' stingers.
* [[Diving equipment]], for underwater diving, constitutes equipment such as a [[diving helmet]] or [[diving mask]], an [[scuba set|underwater breathing apparatus]], and a [[diving suit]].
* [[Firefighter]]s wear PPE designed to provide protection against fires and various fumes and gases. PPE worn by firefighters include [[bunker gear]], [[self-contained breathing apparatus]], a [[helmet]], [[steel-toe boot|safety boots]], and a [[PASS device]].

====In sports====
{{Main|Protective gear in sports}}
Participants in sports often wear protective equipment. Studies performed on the injuries of professional athletes, such as that on [[National Football League|NFL]] players,&lt;ref name=brainnfl&gt;[http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/09/nfl-brain-injury/ CDC - NIOSH Science Blog - Brain Injury in the NFL] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20121220112221/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/09/nfl-brain-injury/ |date=2012-12-20 }}.

==Limits of the definition==
[[File:Safetyequipment3030.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Workers using personal protective equipment while painting poles. While basic head protection is present, no engineering fall protection systems appear to be in place.]]
The definition of what constitutes as personal protective equipment varies by country. In the United States, the laws regarding PPE also vary by state. In 2011, workplace safety complaints were brought against [[Hustler]] and other adult film production companies by the [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]], leading to several citations brought by [[California Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Cal/OSHA]].&lt;ref name=hustler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110330007006/en/Larry-Flynt%E2%80%99s-Hustler-Video-Cited-CalOSHA-Condoms|title=Larry Flynt’s Hustler Video Cited by Cal/OSHA over Condoms, Safety, Says AHF|author=|date=|website=businesswire.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806224124/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110330007006/en/Larry-Flynt%E2%80%99s-Hustler-Video-Cited-CalOSHA-Condoms|archivedate=6 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to use [[condom]]s by adult film stars was a violation of Cal/OSHA's Blood borne Pathogens Program, Personal Protective Equipment.&lt;ref name=hustler/&gt; This example shows that personal protective equipment can cover a variety of occupations in the United States, and has a wide-ranging definition.

==Legislation in the European Union==
At the [[European Union]] level, personal protective equipment is governed by Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment (PPE). The Directive is designed to ensure that PPE meets common quality and safety standards by setting out basic safety requirements for personal protective equipment, as well as conditions for its placement on the market and free movement within the EU single market. It covers ‘any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/1989/686/oj/eng|title=Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment|author=|date=30 December 1989|website=europa.eu|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive was adopted on 21 January 1989 and came into force on 1 July 1992. The [[European Commission]] additionally allowed for a transition period until 30 June 1995 to give companies sufficient time to adapt to the legislation. After this date, all PPE placed on the market in EU Member States was required to comply with the requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC and carry the [[CE Marking]].

Article 1 of Directive 89/686/EEC defines personal protective equipment as any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards. PPE which falls under the scope of the Directive is divided into three categories:
* Category I: simple design (e.g. gardening gloves, footwear, ski goggles)
* Category II:  PPE not falling into category I or III (e.g. personal flotation devices, dry and wet suits)
* Category III:  complex design (e.g. respiratory equipment, harnesses)

Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment does not distinguish between PPE for professional use and PPE for leisure purposes.

Personal protective equipment falling within the scope of the Directive must comply with the basic health and safety requirements set out in Annex II of the Directive. To facilitate conformity with these requirements, harmonized standards are developed at the European or international level by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN, CENELEC) and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in relation to the design and manufacture of the product. Usage of the harmonized standards is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity. However, manufacturers may choose an alternative method of complying with the requirements of the Directive.

Personal protective equipment excluded from the scope of the Directive includes:
* PPE designed for and used by the armed forces or in the maintenance of law and order;
* PPE for self-defence (e.g. aerosol canisters, personal deterrent weapons);
* PPE designed and manufactured for personal use against adverse atmospheric conditions (e.g. seasonal clothing, umbrellas), damp and water (e.g. dish-washing gloves) and heat;
* PPE  used on vessels and aircraft but not worn at all times;
* helmets and visors intended for users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles.

The European Commission is currently working to revise Directive 89/686/EEC. The revision will look at the scope of the Directive, the conformity assessment procedures and technical requirements regarding market surveillance. It will also align the Directive with the New Legalislative Framework. The European Commission is likely to publish its proposal in 2013. It will then be discussed by the [[European Parliament]] and [[Council of the European Union]] under the ordinary legislative procedure before being published in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] and becoming law.

The '''Physics Instructional Association''' ('''PIRA'''&lt;ref&gt;http://physicslearning2.colorado.edu/pira/&lt;/ref&gt;) is an association of [[physics education]] professionals and enthusiasts.  Members are physics teachers, physics administrators, physics educational support staff and physics students.  Interests cover all aspects of physics education with an emphasis on [[Demonstration (teaching)|demonstrations]], [[laboratory|laboratories]] and outreach.

The association is also responsible for maintaining the Demonstration Classification Scheme (DCS), a standardized scheme for categorization of physics demonstrations.

==Affiliations==
PIRA holds annual meetings during the summer meeting of the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]].  It is sponsored by the Apparatus Committee and annually hosts the Lecture Demonstration Workshop.  PIRA assists or hosts the Physics Demonstrations Show at each summer meeting when the hosting institution requests.

==Demonstration bibliography==
PIRA has continually updated the Demonstration Bibliography since its inception in the 1980s.  It is based on a unique numbering system called the Demonstration Classification Scheme (DCS).&lt;ref&gt;http://physicslearning.colorado.edu/PiraHome/dcs/PIRADCS.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The scheme originated from the demonstrations catalog used at the University of Minnesota.

PIRA has also generated a subset of this list called the PIRA 200.&lt;ref&gt;http://physicslearning2.colorado.edu/pira/resources/pira-200&lt;/ref&gt;  These 200 demonstrations are the recommended basic collection for any physics department.

[[File:MaiNessun.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example of a vocal score ([[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[Turandot]]'').]]
A '''vocal score''' or '''piano-vocal score''' is a [[Sheet music|music score]] of an [[opera]], or a [[vocal]] or [[choral]] composition written for [[orchestra]]l accompaniment, such as an [[oratorio]] or [[cantata]]. In a piano-vocal score, the vocal parts are written out in full, but the [[accompaniment]] is reduced and adapted for keyboard (usually piano). The music is usually reduced to two [[staff (music)|staves]]; however, more staves, a second keyboardist ([[Piano four hands|piano-four-hands]]), or a second keyboard part can be added, as needed. 

There are two main types of piano-vocal scores. The first kind consists of those scores created by a composer in the process of composing, usually as a harmonic map or "sketch" of the piece to be later [[orchestration|orchestrated]]. The second category includes scores that are arrangements or transcriptions made after the completion of the work, usually by someone other than the composer. 

Piano-vocal scores are generally created to enable a conductor or choir leader to rehearse the singers with a piano accompanist before the choir begins rehearsals with the orchestra. The cost of rehearsing with a professional orchestra is so high that choirs typically hold a number of rehearsals with piano accompaniment to prepare the choir, as the cost of hiring a single piano accompanist is much lower than hiring 50-100 orchestral musicians. 

Piano-vocal scores are also used by music students, singers and conductors to study the compositional structure of the score. Before the widespread availability of sound recordings, piano-vocal scores were also sold for amateur home performance or small-scale professional performance of the piece, where a full orchestra would not be feasible from an economic or performance space perspective.

== Piano-conductor scores ==

While piano-vocal scores tend to consist of the vocal lines and a [[Reduction (music)|piano reduction]] of the whole orchestra onto two staves, '''piano-conductor scores''' tend to consist of the vocal lines and one of the orchestral piano parts that already exists, coupled with another staff containing the rest of the orchestral reduction (in contrast to a piano-vocal score, where the piano and other orchestral parts cannot be easily separated at sight). In a piano-conductor score, orchestral part entries are usually visibly tagged in the third staff.

While piano-vocal scores provide a full accompaniment for rehearsals, reduced performances, etc., piano-conductor scores give the conductor a more direct view of the activity of the orchestra, without being as complex as a full orchestral score. This is especially relevant when the conductor is conducting not from the podium, but from the piano while playing the indicated piano part (often seen in [[musical theatre]] orchestras).

The '''Pietroasele Treasure''' (or the '''Petrossa Treasure''') found in [[Pietroasele, Buzău]], [[Romania]], in 1837, is a late fourth-century [[Goths|Gothic]] treasure that included some twenty-two objects of gold, among the most famous examples of the polychrome style of [[Migration Period art]]. Of the twenty-two pieces, only twelve have survived, conserved at the [[National Museum of Romanian History]], in [[Bucharest]]: a large eagle-headed [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]] and three smaller ones encrusted with semi-precious stones; a [[patera]], or round sacrificial dish,  modelled with [[Orphic]] figures &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Joseph. ''The Masks of God: Creative Mythology''. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding a seated three-dimensional goddess in the center; a twelve-sided cup, [[Ring of Pietroassa|a ring]] with a [[Gothic runic inscriptions|Gothic runic inscription]], a large tray, two other necklaces and a pitcher. Their multiple styles, in which [[Han China|Han Chinese]] styles have been noted in the belt buckles, [[Hellenistic]] styles in the golden bowls, [[Sasanian]] motifs in the baskets, and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] fashions in the fibulae,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Kühn, "Asiatic Influences on the Art of the Migrations" ''Parnassus'' '''9'''.1 (January 1937, pp. 13-16, 43) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; are characteristic of the cosmopolitan outlook of the [[Cernjachov culture]] in a region without defined [[Topography|topographic]] confines.

When [[Alexandru Odobescu]] published his book on the treasure,&lt;ref&gt;Odobescu, Alexandru, ''Le Trésor de Petrossa'', [[Paris]], 1889-1900.&lt;/ref&gt; he considered that such magnificent work could only have belonged to [[Athanaric]] (died 381), leader of the [[Thervings]], a Gothic people. Modern archaeologists cannot connect the hoard with such a glamorous name.

The treasure was shipped to [[Russia]] in December 1916, as [[German Empire|German]] armies advanced through Romania in [[World War I]], and was not returned until 1956.

An atomic analysis of the Pietroasele gold hoard has concluded that from the point of view of Ir/Au, Cu/Au and Ag/Au concentrations the three styles are clustered. At least from the iridium concentration data, the assumption of a Dacian provenance of the hoard raw material is highly improbable as also the hypothesis that Roman imperial gold coins were used for manufacturing Pietroasa artifacts is not in accordance with the elemental concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry, 240 (1999) 897 NUCLEAR ANALYSES OF THE PIETROASA GOLD HOARD, Viorel Cojocaru, Cãlin Besliu and Cristina Anton Manea&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies''' was established in 2005 as a partnership between the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] and the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotechproject.org/about/mission/ nanotechproject.org] &amp;ndash; Mission&lt;/ref&gt; The Project was intended to address the social, political, and public safety aspects of [[nanotechnology]]. It intended in particular to look for research and policy gaps and opportunities in knowledge and regulatory processes, and to develop strategies for closing them. The project worked with multiple U.S. and foreign governments and organizations.

The project's stated goal was "to inform the debate and to create an active public and policy dialogue. It was not an advocate either for, or against, particular nanotechnologies. Rather, the Project sought to ensure that as these technologies are developed, potential human health and environmental risks were anticipated, properly understood, and effectively managed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotechproject.org/about About The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorisation procedure is one of the regulatory tools of the [[Regulation (European Union)|European regulation]] (EC) [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] n°1907/2006 aiming to ban the use of substances of very high concern ([[Substance of very high concern|SVHC]]) included in the Annex XIV of REACH, so as to substitute them by technically and economically feasible alternatives.

This process concerns manufacturers, importers and downstream users of substances. Only representatives of foreign manufacturers can also apply for an authorisation.

Authorisation today impacts many industries, including the [[aerospace]], [[electronics]], [[Automotive industry|automotive]], [[energy]], and [[paint]] industries. Moreover, defence applications are not de facto exempted from the authorisation process. Member states must decide on a case by case basis whether a company can benefit or not from this procedure (outlined in article 2.3 of REACH).

== General principles ==
The REACh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language= French|title= Reach Regulation |url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:136:0003:0280:fr:PDF|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; regulation relies on four main procedures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =REACh|url =http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|work =|date =|access-date =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160724051550/http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|archivedate =2016-07-24|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; registration, evaluation, restriction and authorisation of [[chemical substance]]s.

== From the Candidate List to the Annex XIV of REACH ==
EU Member States or ECHA, on request of the EU Commission, can submit propositions to identify SVHCs, based on the criteria laid down in article 57 of REACH:

*[[Carcinogenic]], [[mutagenic]] or [[toxic]] for reproduction meeting the criteria for classification as CMR category 1A or 1B, in accordance with Regulation n°1272/2008 (CLP),
*Persistents [[bioaccumulative]] and toxic (PBT),
*Very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB),
*Or substances of equivalent concern.

This work is supported by Expert Groups of [[ECHA]] and the EU Member States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= SVHC Roadmap to 2020 implementation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/substances-of-potential-concern/svhc-roadmap-to-2020-implementation|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on various criteria and screening methodologies in order to identify the most relevant SVHCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= SVHC Roadmap to 2020 Implementation Plan PDF|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/19126370/svhc_roadmap_implementation_plan_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annex XIV is the last step of this prioritisation process. It lists SVHCs which exhibit a particularly high risk for human health or the environment (based on their inherent properties, quantities and uses) in order to forbid their use in the EU market.

Recommendations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Previous recommendations|url = http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/recommendation-for-inclusion-in-the-authorisation-list/previous-recommendations|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to include SVHCs in the Annex XIV are made by ECHA and are debated by all relevant stakeholders (Member States, companies, NGOs, etc.). The final decision of inclusion of the substance into Annex XIV is taken by the European Commission.

When listed in Annex XIV of the REACh regulation, a substance is therefore assigned a “sunset date” after which its use will be banned, unless an Authorisation is granted for a definite period of time.

As of today (2015/05/26), 161 substances are listed on the Candidate List&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Candidate List of substances of very high concern for Authorisation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 31 substances are listed in the Annex XIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Authorisation List|url = http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/recommendation-for-inclusion-in-the-authorisation-list/authorisation-list|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The candidate list is usually updated every 6 months and the Annex XIV is updated every 12 to 18 months.

=== Scope of authorisation ===

The authorisation procedure is complex and concerns [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]], importers, downstream users and Only Representatives of substances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Downstream users in a nutshell|url = https://www.ecomundo.eu/en/blog/downstream-users-nutshell|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for which:

*No alternative to the Annex XIV substance is deemed technically and/or economically feasible or for which 
*Alternatives may exist but still need time to be fully qualified and deployed.

The banning of the use takes effect at the "Sunset date". As of this date, the use of the substance is only possible for companies which have been granted an authorisation or for those that have submitted their dossier before the Latest Application Date. The latter indeed benefit from a transitional period, pending the [[European Commission|EU Commission]] final decision.

An exception is made for downstream users in the case where an upstream stakeholder, within the [[supply chain]], has been granted an authorisation for this very substance and this very use. From this point of view, it is the supply chain of the substance that matters. For instance, subcontractors of authorised importers will not be covered if the Annex XIV substance they use is supplied via a supply chain for which no authorisation application has been made or granted.

Finally, downstream users that do not need to apply for an authorisation nevertheless have the obligation to notify their use(s) to ECHA (art. 66 of REACH) and check the compliance of their risk management measures.

Concerned companies are thus invited to take measures as soon as a substance they use enters the Candidate list by enquiring on the impacted actors and their strategies.

=== The use applied for ===
==== "Use" under the authorisation process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= How to develop the description of uses in the context of Authorisation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13566/uses_description_in_auth_context_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ====

Authorisation applications are made for one or several specific uses. Article 3 of REACH thus defines a “use” as: “''any processing, formulation, consumption, storage, keeping, treatment, filling into containers, transfer from one container to another, mixing, production of an article or any other use''”.

In the framework of an authorisation dossier, the description of the use applied for has to specify the market, the supply chain, processes or the type of articles concerned. The use applied for has to be consistent enough to cover the [[Exposure scenario|Exposure Scenario]] but also the Analysis of Alternatives. The Use applied for should not be mistaken with the identified use which corresponds to the REACH registration process. An identified use focuses on the process and does not consider performances or markets questions.

==== Cases where no authorisation is needed ====

A few exceptions exist, for which the application for authorisation is not required:

*The '''manufacturer''' of a substance does not require an authorisation since it is not considered as a use,
*'''Impurities''', '''additives''' and '''components of another substance''' do not constitute a use of the substance as such (except if annex XIV refers to it),
*The '''formulation of a mixture''' is considered as a use under REACh and the substance of the Annex XIV '''is only subject to authorisation if it exceeds the required concentrations'''.

If the production of an article may require an authorisation at some point, '''finished articles''' themselves do not require an authorisation to be put on the market, even though they still contain a substance subject to authorisation. Consequently, articles requiring the use of an Annex XIV substance can still be produced outside the EU and then imported. In that particular case, future restrictions procedure could however limit the placing on the market of such articles if a risk remains (art. 58.6 of REACH).

=== Review period&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Setting the review period when rac and seac give opinions on an application for authorisation|format=pdf|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13580/seac_rac_review_period_authorisation_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

The review period is the duration for which the EU Commission authorises the use of a substance after the Sunset date.
 
Following durations are considered for the review periods:

*'''&lt; 7 years''': in case the Analysis of Alternatives report is insufficient and/or doubts remain on the impacts of the granting of an authorisation or, alternatively, when a quick transition is possible;
*'''7 years''': standard duration to develop a technically and economically feasible alternative solution;
*'''12 years''' and '''&gt; 12 years''': long cycle of investments, low risks. In exceptional cases, a longer duration may be considered if it can be demonstrated that 12 years would create disproportionate impacts compared with a longer review period.

At the end of the review period, the application for authorisation is reassessed to evaluate the progress made in terms or research &amp; development or substitution. Applications to extend the review period have to be made at the latest 18 months before the expiry date.

The European Commission may also reduce this duration if new circumstances appear, in terms of risks or impacts.

Only the [[General Court (European Union)|Court of the European Union]] is qualified to rule on appeals for applications for authorisation. Member States are, in turn, responsible for controlling the decision’s implementation.

== The Application For Authorisation dossier (AFA) ==

The application for authorisation (AfA) is made up of three main parts: the '''Chemical Safety Report''' (CSR), the '''Analysis of Alternatives''' (AoA) and the '''Socio-Economic Analysis''' (SEA).

The goal of this dossier is to demonstrate that no alternative substance is immediately available, that risks are controlled and that the social and economic advantages of the use of the substance outweigh the risks to human health or the environment.  The dossier usually takes 6 to 18 months of preparation and ECHA’s guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Guidance on Authorisation Applications|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13643/authorisation_application_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; are available to assist with its drafting.

The application for authorisation should be filed before the Latest Application Date (LAD), set at 18 months before the sunset date. The LAD enables to benefit from a transitional period, pending the European Commission’s decision.

=== Basic of an AfA ===

An AfA can be made for one or several substances (in that case, grouping will need to be demonstrated on the basis of annex XI of REACH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13632/information_requirements_r6_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =How to report read-across and categories|url =http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13655/pg_report_readacross_en.pdf|work =|date =|access-date =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150612061448/http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13655/pg_report_readacross_en.pdf|archivedate =2015-06-12|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;), one or several uses applied for and by one or several companies. The latter case is called a joint application and it requires appointing a main applicant that will be the contact point for ECHA.

=== Two submissions routes ===

Two submission routes are planned by the REACh regulation:

{| class="wikitable"

|}

=== Content of the dossier ===
==== Chemical Safety Report (CSR) ====

For the adequate control route, the goal of the [[Chemical safety assessment|Chemical Safety Report]] is to prove that threshold values are respected; for the socio-economic route, the goal of the Chemical Safety Report is to demonstrate that risks are reduced to the minimum.

The Chemical Safety Report contains:

* A summary of the risk management measure
* A declaration on the implementation and the communication of risk management measures along the supply chain 
* The identity of the substance and the identified uses
* The assessment of the human and environmental hazard assessment
* The assessment of the properties for which the substance was included in Annex XIV
* The exposure assessment
* The risk characterisation

==== Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) ====
The AoA aims to demonstrate that no alternative is appropriate, i.e. technically and / or economically feasible, less risky and available.

The Analysis of Alternatives therefore presents all the substance’s alternative solutions and contains:

* ''Part 1'' – '''Summary'''
* ''Part 2'' – '''Description of substance’s purpose'''
* ''Part 3'' – '''Identification of potential alternatives '''
* ''Part 4'' – '''Description of the suitability and availability of alternatives'''
* ''Part 5'' – '''Conclusion of the report'''

==== Socio-Economic Analysis (SEA) ====

The Socio-Economic Analysis is a compulsory document for the socio-economic route and can also complete an application justified by the adequate control route. It aims to demonstrate that the advantages of the use of the substance outweigh the risks to human health or the environment. For this purpose, applicants must compare two scenarios:  the ‘use scenario’ (continued use of the substance) on the one hand and the ‘non-use scenario’ (cease of use of the substance) on the other hand to discuss their impacts.

It contains:
* ''Part 1'' – '''Summary'''
* ''Part 2'' – '''Definition of the objective and scope'''
* ''Part 3'' – '''Analysis of impacts'''
* ''Part 4'' – '''Comparison of impacts'''
* ''Part 5'' – '''Conclusion of the report'''

=== Submission of the dossier ===
Dossiers should be submitted during submission windows in February, May, August and November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Submission windows|url = http://echa.europa.eu/applying-for-authorisation/submission-windows|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ECHA strongly advise to follow these windows as plenary sessions of the two committees (RAC and SEAC) are organised in March, June, September and December of each year. Submitting before the plenary sessions, during the submission windows, therefore helps the efficient assessment of the application.

Applications are deemed received after business rules check is successfully passed and provided ECHA fees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Preparing applications for authorisation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/applying-for-authorisation/preparing-applications-for-authorisation|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; are paid on time.

=== Examination of the dossier ===

The examination of the dossier is carried out by the Risk Assessment Committee (RAC) and the Socio-Economic Analysis Committee (SEAC) and opens with a public consultation on alternatives. During 8 weeks, companies, NGOs or any other interested party have the possibility to comment on and possibly challenge the alternatives proposed by the applicant.

The consultation can be followed by additional discussions with the two Committees in order to clarify the application. This process is called Trialogue and stakeholders can be invited to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Meeting of the committee for risk assessment|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13555/stakeholder_participation_in_afa_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duration of the examination varies according to the complexity and the clarity of the dossier. Committees however have the obligation to deliver their first opinion on the dossier 10 months after its submission at the latest. The dossier with the Committee’s opinion is then sent to the Commission. The whole process can take up to 2 years.

== Implementation and feedback ==

As of May 4, 2015,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title =Taking stock of received, processed and granted applications|url =http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/21825501/afa_201502_7_nicot_en.pdf|work =|date =|access-date =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150927024516/http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/21825501/afa_201502_7_nicot_en.pdf|archivedate =2015-09-27|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Statistics on received applications|url = http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/applications-for-authorisation/received-applications|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 28 applications for authorisation had been filed for a total of 56 uses.

=== A specific strategy for every use ===

Each dossier requires implementing a specific strategy, being it to define the uses, the analysis of the [[List of industrial processes|industrial processes]] and associated risks, the alternatives, or the socio-economic impacts of the banning of the substance.

Committees expect each dossier to contain a precise description of the industrial process and the operational conditions that are representative of the dossier as well as the risk management measures implemented by the applicant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Experience in the Committee for Risk Assessment|url =http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/21825501/afa_201502_9_bowmer_en.pdf|work =|date =|access-date =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150928183306/http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/21825501/afa_201502_9_bowmer_en.pdf|archivedate =2015-09-28|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main issue in the application for authorisation process is the duration of the review period which will be granted. It is therefore critical to bring all the necessary precisions to the dossiers to justify the requested review period duration. A justification that is too weak or an argumentation that is too generic may induce the granting of a shorter-than-requested review period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Setting the review period when rac and seac give opinions on an application for authorisation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13580/seac_rac_review_period_authorisation_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== An in-depth analysis of the companies’ activity ===
Beyond the simple drafting of the application for authorisation dossier, the whole process implies both expertise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language= French|title= Choix d’un consultant : points à vérifier|url = http://reach-info.ineris.fr/sites/reach-info.gesreg.fr/files/pdf/Check-list_Consultant_HD-08-14.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and deep analysis of a company’s activity, on multiple aspects: 
 
* '''Technical''' aspects(Chemical Safety Report, Analysis of Alternatives), 
* '''Business''' aspects (Supply chain security, public consultation) and
* '''Strategic''' aspects (Anticipating the development and growth of the activity within a 5 to 10 years timeframe).

This analysis therefore requires an extensive collection of information and also, possibly, contacts with customers so as to strengthen the analysis of alternatives.

=== Public consultation at the heart of the decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Submission of information on alternatives by interested third parties for the public consultations on alternatives for Applications for Authorisation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13555/instructions_third_parties_afa_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

[[Public consultation]] is one of the core mechanisms of the authorisation process. Stakeholders’ (competing companies, universities, laboratories, NGOS, Member States, etc.) involvement in the consultation process has been growing over the last years (to reach up to 400 comments for a single dossier&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; ) and the influence of comments, in particular concerning alternatives, makes it a major step of the authorisation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Perturbateurs endocriniens : 55 ONG réclament l'interdiction en Europe de l'usage du DEHP dans le PVC|url = http://www.actu-environnement.com/ae/news/lettre-interdiction-behp-pvc-reach-23316.php4|access-date = 2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to streamline this process, templates for comments and instructions are available on the ECHA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13555/instructions_third_parties_afa_en.pdf|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13555/instructions_third_parties_afa_en.pdf|work = echa.europa.eu|access-date = 2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consulting costs ===

Consulting costs of an application for authorisation have been estimated by ECHA and amounts, in average, to around 230,000 EUR for a single use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2226">For the purposes of the statutory [[Board of Architectural Education]], the '''Schools of Architecture''' were those listed in the Second Schedule to the [[United Kingdom]] [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]]. The 1931 Act had required the Board of Architectural Education to be appointed annually by the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK) ("the Council").   The Board was to be constituted in accordance with the Second Schedule to the Act.  This included a list of twenty Schools, from the [[Liverpool University|Liverpool School of Architecture]] to the School of [[Architecture]] of the [[Architectural Association]] [[London]].

Changes first enacted as Part III of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 included abolition of the statutory Board of Architectural Education, and renaming the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK) with the name it now has: the [[Architects Registration Board]] (ARB).  From 1997 this body has been governed by the Architects Act 1997, which makes no mention of the '''Schools of Architecture'''.

The [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]] had been passed on 24 July 1996.  Its long title shows that it was a piece of departmental omnibus legislation:

: ''An Act to make provision for grants and other assistance for housing purposes and about action in relation to unfit housing; to amend the law relating to construction contracts and architects; to provide grants and other assistance for regeneration and development and in connection with clearance areas; to amend the provisions relating to home energy efficiency schemes; to make provision in connection with the dissolution of urban corporations, housing action trusts and the Commission for New Towns; and for connected purposes.''

Part III of the Act relating to architects was repealed and reenacted as part of the [[Architects Act 1997]], which was passed on 19 March 1997 under the Parliamentary rules for consolidating Acts.

==History==
A [[Order of the Government of Russia|resolution]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] of 30 January 1956 provided for the establishment of a command and control complex for the first flight satellites. Work on the construction of the centre began on May 8, 1957. GITSIU COP and subordinate military units together with the Mission Control Centre support the entire space programme.&lt;ref name="NovostiKos"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/243/30.shtml| title = Космические войска|trans-title=Space Forces| accessdate = 2012-03-05| date = c. 2003| publisher = Novosti Kosmonavtiki| author = A Kopik|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201000712/http://novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/243/30.shtml|archivedate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military is responsible for the condition of many domestic orbital systems — military, scientific, manned and other. Specialists at the  main centre started working with the first launches, first artificial satellite, the first manned flight into space. They also worked on Soviet Moonwalkers ([[lunokhod]]y), and on the programme for the orbital station [[Mir]], right up until the last seconds of its existence. Now among their many tasks is work with the [[International Space Station]].

==Centre==
Currently the Centre manages 75% of the domestic Russian orbital spacecraft constellation. By [[Decree of the President of Russia|order]] of the [[Russian President]] on 14 August 2001, the centre was named after [[Gherman Titov]], to honour the second human to orbit the Earth, who had been one of the leaders of the Centre.

The centre has locations throughout Russia involved in testing, measuring and certifying equipment which are subordinated to the main centre.&lt;ref name="GS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NovostiKos" /&gt;

Total Carbon is an analytical measurement for carbon content.  This measurement commonly found in environmental and pharmaceutical analysis. 

== Carbon Content Categories ==

A variety of different terms are used to identify the different types of carbon present at different levels of detail.

*'''Total Carbon (TC)''' – all the carbon in the sample, including both inorganic and organic carbon
*'''[[Total Inorganic Carbon]] (TIC)''' – often referred to as inorganic carbon (IC), [[carbonate]], [[bicarbonate]], and [[Solvation|dissolved]] [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
*'''[[Total Organic Carbon]] (TOC)''' – material derived from decaying vegetation, bacterial growth, and [[Metabolism|metabolic]] activities of living organisms or chemicals.
*'''Elemental Carbon (EC)''' – [[charcoal]], [[coal]], and [[soot]]. Resistant to analytical digestion and extraction, EC can be a fraction of either TIC or TOC depending on analytical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, B. A. (2002). [http://bcodata.whoi.edu/LaurentianGreatLakes_Chemistry/bs116.pdf "Methods for the Determination of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in Soils and Sediments"] Ecological Risk Assessment Support Center. US. Environmental Protection Agency 23p.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC)''' – commonly referred to as TOC; organic carbon remaining in an acidified sample after purging the sample with gas.
*'''Purgeable (volatile) Organic Compound (VOC)''' – organic carbon that has been removed from a [[pH|neutral]], or acidified sample by purging with an [[inert gas]]. These are the same compounds referred to as [[Volatile organic compound|Volatile Organic Compounds]] (VOC) and usually determined by Purge and Trap Gas [[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|Chromatography]].
*'''[[Dissolved Organic Carbon]] (DOC)''' – organic carbon remaining in a sample after filtering the sample, typically using a 0.45 [[Micrometre|micrometer]] filter.
*'''Suspended Organic Carbon''' – also called [[particulate]] organic carbon (POC); the carbon in particulate form that is too large to pass through a filter.

'''United Art Rating''' is a reference book published since 1999 by [[Artists Trade Union of Russia]] as one of the instruments of art market regulations.&lt;ref&gt;"Чтобы как-то стабилизировать ценообразование на арт-рынке, Профессиональный союз художников с 1999 года издает "Единый художественный рейтинг". В него входят имена, даты жизни и рейтинговые категории почти 40 тыс. художников Российской империи, СССР, русского зарубежья, Российской Федерации и республик бывшего Советского Союза. Живые и ушедшие — вперемешку. "Делить художников по принципу "жив или мертв" неправильно: с точки зрения ценообразования смерть мастера не самый значительный фактор",— рассказывает Сергей Заграевский. Тем не менее высшую часть пирамиды рейтинга формируют великие мастера прошлого. Основание пирамиды — растущие молодые художники или инертная масса работников изобразительного цеха, которые не участвуют в бурной выставочной жизни. Эксперты, занимающиеся составлением рейтинга, отслеживают динамику роста или деградации тех и других.

United Art Rating (before 2012, referred to as United Artists Rating) is a rating published as a periodical reference book, registered as [[mass media]]. As of 2016, it has stood 22 printed editions, total number of printed copies is more than 90000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artunion.ru/rating/archive_engl.htm Archive of United Art Rating editions]&lt;/ref&gt; The electronic version is also available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rating.artunion.ru/electronic_engl.htm United Art Rating. The electronic version]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2016, United Art Rating included the names, dates of life and rating categories of 58965 artists (painters, graphic and poster artists, theatre decorators, batik painters, illustrators, animators, sculptors, jewelers, ceramists, authors of installations etc.).

Editor-in-chief: [[Sergey Zagraevsky]], chairman of Artists Trade Union of Russia, member of [[Russian Academy of Arts]] and Russian Academy of Art-critics, Honored culture worker of Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zagraevsky.com Dr. Sergey Zagraevsky. Official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, United Art Rating was awarded the gratitude of the Minister of culture of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rating.artunion.ru/feedback.htm United Art Rating. Feedback (in Russian).]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles of rating ==
The Rating Centre acts under Artists Trade Union of Russia and has a status of an independent professional jury, free in its judges and estimations. Defining rating categories is made on the basis of all available information about works of art, biographies, expositions, collections and sales of works, catalogues and Internet and press publications, art historians' and art-managers' opinions, public opinion polls etc.

United Art Rating consists of 2 sections:
*Russian Art Rating (Rating of artists of Russian Empire, the USSR, Russian emigration, Russian Federation and the republics of the former Soviet Union);
*International Artists Rating (All-world Rating of artists of 18th–21st centuries, forming the world art heritage).

Artists are subdivided into categories "A" and "B": an artist of "A" category does not virtually submit to the market's demand. an artist of "B" category is mainly oriented to the market demand.

Each category has its levels from the first (the top of recognition and fame; is referred to the deceased classic artists, whose works of art are widely recognized in museums) to the seventh one (amateur artist).

According to the declared principles, defining of rating categories is made on available information about expositions, sales and collections of works, catalogues, publications, biographies, public-opinion polls etc. Rating criteria are: art level of works, their humanistic significance, professionalism, exhibitions, works in museums, recognition by the public, galleries and art critics, social and civil significance of works, price level of works etc.

United Art Rating contains pricing recommendations about sale and purchase of works of art.

United Art Rating is constantly changed, refined and supplemented.

== Description of rating categories ==
*1 – an artist of world fame, tested with time (for no less than a century).
*1A – a world-famous artist.
*1B – a high-class professional artist with remarkable organizational skills, who is popular and in demand.
*2A – a high-class professional artist with a bright creative individuality.
*2B – a high-class professional artist, recognized and in demand with the art-market and public.
*3A – a professional artist with a recognizable individual style.
*3B – a professional artist, recognized and asked for in the art market and by the public.
*4A – an established professional artist with creative potential.
*4B – an established professional artist, who is in demand in the art market.
*5A – a formed professional artist with creative potential.
*5B – a formed professional artist.
*6A – a forming professional artist with creative potential.
*6B – a forming professional artist.
*7 – an amateur artist with perspective evaluation of specialists.
*8 – an amateur artist.
*9 – an artist-beginner.
*10 – an artist-apprentice.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in architecture''' have been documented for many centuries, as professional (or amateur) practitioners, educators and clients. Since architecture became organized as a  profession in 1857, the number of women in architecture has been low.  At the end of the 19th century, starting in Finland, certain [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] in Europe began to admit women to their programmes of study. In 1980  
[[M. Rosaria Piomelli]], born in Italy, became the first woman to hold a deanship of any school of architecture in the United States, as Dean of the [[City College of New York]] School of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu/exhibits/fiftyexhibit/rosaria_piomelli.html |title=rosaria_piomelli |publisher=Digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu |date=1937-10-24 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only in recent years have women begun to achieve wider recognition with several outstanding participants including two [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker prizewinners]] since the turn of the millennium.

==Early examples==
Two European women stand out as early examples of women playing an important part in architecture, designing or defining the development of buildings under construction. In France, [[Katherine Briçonnet]] (ca. 1494–1526) was influential in designing the [[Château de Chenonceau]] in the [[Loire Valley]], supervising the construction work between 1513 and 1521 and taking important architectural decisions while her husband was away fighting in the Italian wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k870051/f856 M. E. Aubry-Vitet, "Chenonceau"], in ''Revue des deux mondes'', no 69 (1867), p.855. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], there is evidence that [[Elizabeth Wilbraham|Lady Elizabeth Wilbraham]] (1632–1705) studied the work of the Dutch architect [[Pieter Post]] as well as that of [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] in [[Veneto]], Italy, and the [[Landshut Residence|Stadtresidenz]] at Landshut, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John Millar [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/critics/the-first-woman-architect/8608009.article ''The first woman architect''], The Architects' Journal, 11 November 2010. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She has been put forward as the architect of [[Wotton House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] and of many other buildings. It has also been suggested that she tutored [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]].  Wilbraham had to use male architects to supervise the construction work.&lt;ref name="Indy first lady"&gt;Jay Merrick [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/elizabeth-wilbraham-the-first-lady-of-architecture-2215936.html ''Elizabeth Wilbraham, the first lady of architecture''], The Independent, 16 February 2011. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now much research including that by [[John Millar (historian)|John Millar]]&lt;ref name="Indy first lady" /&gt; to show she may have designed up to 400 buildings including 18 London churches previously attributed to her pupil  Sir Christopher Wren.

Towards the end of the 18th century, another Englishwoman, [[Mary Townley (architect)|Mary Townley]] (1753–1839), tutored by the artist [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], designed several buildings in [[Ramsgate]] in south-eastern England including [[Townley House]] which is considered to be an architectural gem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelsbookshop.com/blogpicts2/townley.htm Paul Nettleingham, "Townley House in Ramsgate"], ''Michaels Bookshop Ramsgate''. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sarah Losh]] (1785-1853) was an English woman and landowner of [[Wreay]].  She has been described as a lost [[Romanticism|Romantic]] genius, antiquarian, architect and visionary.  Her main work is [[St Mary's Church (Wreay)]], Cumbria, but she also constructed various associated buildings and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmaryswreay.org/ St Mary's Church Wreay] (Accessed Sept 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny Uglow|Uglow, Jenny]] (2012) ''The Pinecone'', Faber and Faber&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J.B.

==Modern pioneers==
Yet another Englishwoman, [[Sophy Gray (architect)|Sophy Gray]] (1814–1871), wife of [[Robert Gray (bishop of Cape Town)|Robert Gray]] who became bishop of [[Cape Town]] in 1847, proved to be a competent assistant, not only helping her husband with his administrative and social obligations but above all by designing at least 35 of the [[South Africa]]n Anglican churches completed between 1848 and 1880, all in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style in which she showed strong interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/archframes.php?archid=643 "Gray, Sophia (Sophie) Wharton Myddleton"], ''ArteFacts''. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughter of a French-Canadian carriage maker, [[Mother Joseph Pariseau]] (1823–1902) was not just one of the very earliest female architects in North America but a pioneer in the architecture of the north-western United States. In 1856, together with four sisters from [[Montreal]], she moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]] where she designed eleven hospitals, seven academies, five schools for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children, and two orphanages in an area encompassing today's [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]], northern [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/joseph_m.cfm "Mother Joseph", ''Architect of the Capitol'']. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louise Blanchard Bethune]] (1856–1913) from [[Waterloo (town), New York|Waterloo, New York]], was the first American woman known to have worked as a professional architect. In 1876, she took a job working as a draftsman in the office of [[Richard A. Waite]] and F.W. Caulkings in [[Buffalo, New York]] where she worked for five years, demonstrating she could hold her own in what was a masculine profession. In 1881, she opened an independent office partnered with her husband Robert Bethune in Buffalo, earning herself the title as the nation's first professional woman architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.arch.uiuc.edu/organizations/wia/timeline/bethunelouise.html "Louise Blanchard Bethune (1856-1913)"], ''Women in Architecture (University of Illinois)''.

Another early practicing architect in the United States was [[Emily Williams (architect)|Emily Williams]] (1869–1942) from northern California. In 1901, together with her friend Lillian Palmer, she moved to [[San Francisco]] where she studied drafting at the [[Lick-Wilmerding High School|California High School of Mechanical Arts]]. Encouraged by Palmer, she went on to build a number of cottages and houses in the area, including a family home on 1037 Broadway in San Francisco, now a listed building.&lt;ref name=Horton&gt;[http://www.womenarchitectsca.com/sample-biographies/emily-williams/ Inge S.

Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodate Pope Riddle]] (1868–1946) grew up in a well-to-do background in Farmington, Connecticut, where she hired faculty members to tutor her in architecture. Her early designs, such as that for [[Hill-Stead Museum|Hill-Stead]] (1901), were translated into working drawings by the firm of [[McKim, Mead and White]], providing her with an apprenticeship in architecture. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in both New York and Connecticut and in 1926 was appointed to the AIA College of Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/us-archi.html "Women in Architecture"], ''ARVHA''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable pioneer of the early days was [[Josephine Wright Chapman]] (1867–1943). Chapman received no formal education in architecture but went on design a number of buildings before setting up her own firm. The architect of [[Tuckerman Hall]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], she is considered to be one of America's earliest and most successful female architects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuckermanhall.org/chapmanfull.pdf "Josephine Wright Chapman and Tuckerman Hall"], ''Tuckermanhall.org''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian architect [[Virginia Andreescu Haret]] (1894–1962), first woman to graduate with a degree in architecture in 1919 and first woman as Romanian Architectural Inspector General. She continued her studies in [[Italy]]. 
She worked at the Technical Service of the Ministry of Education, for which reason she did numerous and important projects for schools, in [[Bucharest]] (Şincai and Cantemir Lyceum) as well as in the country (Bârlad, Focşani). Side by side with buildings of large dimensions, she also designed houses for one or two persons. The mobility did not stop at the studies in Italy, she was present also at numerous congresses of architecture in Rome, Paris, Moscow, Bruxelles ...

A highly influential player was [[Mary Colter]] (1869–1958). After studying at the [[California School of Design]] in [[San Francisco]], she was employed by the [[Fred Harvey Company]], first for interior design but soon to take on ambitious architectural projects, including landmark hotels and [[wikt:Special:Search/rustic|Rustic]] lodges in the Southwest, several in Grand Canyon National Park. She often used Native American motifs (and artisans) while blending the regional [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style]] and [[Pueblo Revival Style architecture|Pueblo Revival Style]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AID=6694&amp;AT=1 A.

==First academic qualifications==

===Finland===

Finland is the country in which women were first permitted to undertake architectural studies and receive academic qualifications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/paivi_nikkanen_uk.htm Päivi Nikkanen-Kalt, "Female architects in Finland"], ''ARVHA''. Retrieved 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; even if they were initially given the status of special students. The earliest record belongs to [[Signe Hornborg]] (1862–1916) who attended the [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture|Helsinki Polytechnic Institute]] from the spring of 1888, graduating as an architect in 1890 "by special permission".  She does not, however, appear to have acted as an independent architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architekturarchiv-web.de/frauen.htm Karl Heinz Hoffmann and Anika Hakl, "Frauen und Häuser"], ''Hamburgisches Architekturarchiv der Hamburgischen Architektenkammer''. {{de icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other graduates in architecture at the Polytechnic Institute in the 1880s include Inez Holming, Signe Lagerborg, Bertha Enwald, Stina Östman and [[Wivi Lönn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecta.fi/sivu.php?sivu=historia "Perustaminen: Nainen arkkitehtina"], ''Architecta''. {{fi icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lönn (1872–1966), who attended the institute from 1893 to 1896, has the honour of being the first woman to work independently as an architect in Finland. On graduating, she immediately established her own architectural firm by receiving a commission to design the building of a Finnish-language girls' school in Tampere. She designed several significant public buildings, including more than thirty school buildings. Lönn won five architectural competitions alone, including the municipal fire-station in Tampere in 1906, an unusual design for a woman at that time. Lönn won two competitions with [[Armas Lindgren]] with him she designed the [[New Student House, Helsinki|New Student House]] in [[Helsinki]] (1910) and the [[Estonia Theatre]] in [[Tallinn]] (1913). One of her last was the Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory, completed in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=3438 "Lönn, Wivi (1872 - 1966)"], ''Biografiakeskus''.

Following excellent results, she was accepted as a regular student the following year and graduated as a "master builder" in 1894. She went on to design 98 buildings in the [[Mariehamn]] district of the Åland Islands, mostly town houses and farm houses in the ornamental Swiss style. However, she did not qualify as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mariehamn.ax/Kulturforvaltningen/Stadens_historia/Hilda_Hongell_ "Hilda Hongell"], ''Mariehamns stad''. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other early graduates===

[[Fay Kellogg]] (1871–1918) learnt her architectural skills with a German tutor who taught her drafting, at the [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn, and by working with Marcel de Monclos in his Paris atelier. She had hoped to study at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] but as a woman was refused admission. As a result of her efforts, however, the institution later opened its doors to women wishing to study architecture. On her return to the United States, Kellogg helped design the [[Surrogate's Courthouse|Hall of Records]] in Lower Manhattan before opening a studio of her own. She went on to design hundreds of buildings in the New York area, encouraging the [[New York Times]] to describe her as "one of the most successful woman architects in America".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/11/17/106768465.pdf "Woman Invades Field of Modern Architecture"], ''The New York Times'', November 17, 1907.

She was initially refused admission as a woman in 1896 but reapplied and was successfully admitted in 1898. After graduating in 1901, she returned to California where she had a prolific and innovative career, blazing new paths professionally, stylistically, structurally, and aeshetically, setting high standards of excellence in the profession.  Completing over 700 projects, she is especially known for her work for women's organizations and key clients, including [[Hearst Castle]] in [[San Simeon, California|San Simeon]], considered to be one of her masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070623083708/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/english/remarkable/panel4.html "Julia Morgan, Early Architect, 1872-1957"], ''California State Capitol Museum''.

She was not successful in gaining admittance, and returned to America in 1906, where she did practice architecture. She designed the [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]] in [[Kentucky]] as well as a number of buildings in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] where she was the first architect to incorporate the natural terrain into her designs and the first to use cast-in-place concrete walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/news/news3.html "Mary Rockwell Hook"], ''International Archive of Women in Architecture''.

[[Esther Hill|Esther Marjorie Hill]] was the first woman to graduate from a Canadian architecture school, in 1920.

==European developments==
After Finland, several other European countries allowed women to study architecture. In [[Norway]], the first female architect was [[Lilla Hansen]] (1872–1962) who studied at the Royal Drafting School (''Den Kongelige Tegneskole'') in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (1894) and served architectural apprenticeships in Brussels, Kristiania and Copenhagen. She established her own practice in 1912 and gained immediate success with Heftyeterrassen, a [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-baroque]] residential complex in Oslo. She went on to design a number of large villas as well as student accommodation for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Lilla_Hansen/utdypning "Lilla Hansen"], ''Store Norske Leksikon''. {{no icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woman to run an architecture practice in [[Germany]] was [[Emilie Winkelmann]] (1875−1951). She studied architecture as a guest student registered as Student Emil at the [[University of Hanover|College of Technology]] in [[Hanover]] (1902–1908) but was refused a diploma as women were not entitled to the qualification until 1909. Working from her practice in Berlin where she employed a staff of 15, she completed some 30 villas before the outbreak of war. One of her most notable buildings is the Tribüne theatre in [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], originally a girls school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlin.de/ba-charlottenburg-wilmersdorf/bezirk/winkelmann.html "Emilie Winkelmann, Architektin"], Lexikon: Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf von A bis Z, ''Berlin.de''. {{de icon}} Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male and female professional partnerships==
[[File:Alvar and Elissa Aalto.jpg|thumb|Alvar and Elissa Aalto (1950s)]]
A number of the more important women architects in the first half of the 20th century partnered with men, often forming husband-and-wife practices.&lt;ref name="Anthony"&gt;Kathryn H. Anthony, "Designing for Diversity: Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in the Architectural Profession", University of Illinois Press (2001), p. 56 et seq., {{ISBN|0-252-02641-1}} (online here [https://books.google.com/books?id=qqo2LXIaW7YC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=architecture+husband+wife+partners&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WjXomoDx7f&amp;sig=aY4NpsdR3jJwZoBdMpkR9RbRJ4w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y72ST7jNEcnN0QX7gaH9AQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=architecture%20husband%20wife%20partners&amp;f=false]).&lt;/ref&gt; Such partnerships began in the early years of women's involvement when some of the most successful male architects worked with women. Since the 1960s, which saw increased enrollment by women into schools of Architecture, male and female students have often met and later married; long hours working together and a shared passion have been described as "the perfect prescription for romance".&lt;ref name="Anthony 56"&gt;Anthony, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; A good overview of this topic is also discussed in Ann Forsyth's "In Praise of Zaha" &lt;ref name=Forsyth&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Praise of Zaha |date=2006-09-27 |doi=10.1111/j.1531-314X.2006.00082.x |volume=60 |issue=2 |journal=Journal of Architectural Education |pages=63–65|last1 = Forsyth|first1 = Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-female partnerships in architecture sometimes lead to misattribution of the work to the male partner, often because the male is better known. This can be seen as the result of an underlying discrimination or biased attitude. What has been described as the "tradition of misattribution" has remained a "secret" until recent years.&lt;ref name="Anthony 56-57"&gt;Anthony, p. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some particularly notable male-female partnerships in architecture include:

* [[Aino Aalto]] (1894-1949) and [[Alvar Aalto]] - after qualifying as an architect in Finland in 1920, she married Alvar Aalto in 1923 and participated in the design of his earlier buildings, often contributing to the interiors as in the [[Villa Mairea]] (1937) in [[Noormarkku]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvaraalto.fi/info/press/09eng_villa-mairea.htm "Internet exhibition on Alvar Aaltos Villa Mairea"], ''Alvar Aalto''.

* [[Reima and Raili Pietilä]], another Finnish couple, worked closely together developing their early Modernistic style. Raili Pietilä (born 1926) found two the perfect number for a design team, explaining: "We often took our work with us: for a walk, in the kitchen, and in the evenings. And when doing competitions we used to take trips, like long train journeys, because we found that changing your environment affects your thinking."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20080424/breaking-the-modernist-mold David Sokol, "Breaking the Modernist Mold: Raili Pietilä reflects on a life of design with her husband, Reima, and the new exhibition that examines the Pietilä legacy"], ''Metropolismag.com'', 24 April 2008.

She later recalled how Le Corbusier insisted on strict adherence to his demanding principles: "The smallest pencil stroke had to have a point, to fulfil a need, or respond to a gesture or posture, and to be achieved at mass-production prices." After collaborating with Le Corbusier for about ten years, Perriand left his studio in 1937 to concentrate on furniture design, often working with [[Jean Prouvé]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://designmuseum.org/design/charlotte-perriand "Charlotte Perriand, Architect + Furniture Designer (1903-1999)"], ''Design Museum''.

*[[Denise Scott Brown]] (born 1931) and [[Robert Venturi]] met at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1960. Shortly after their marriage in 1967, Scott Brown joined his [[Philadelphia]] firm Venturi and Rauch, where she became principal in charge of planning in 1969. She has since played a major role at the firm (renamed Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989) leading civic planning projects and studies, and collaborating with Venturi on the firm's larger projects. She is however resentful of the fact that she is seldom credited for her work. For example, it was her husband who was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 1991 although she explains: "We both design every inch of a building together." In 1997 she speculated: "The question of being a woman will be in the air for ever in my case. If I had not married Bob, would I have gone further or not? Who can tell? But the same question holds for him. If he had not married me, would he have gone further?"&lt;ref name=Anthony/&gt; Denise Scott Brown also disclosed her feelings about this situation in a chapter of "Gender Space Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender space architecture an interdisciplinary introduction|url = http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=169967|publisher = Routledge|date = 2000-01-01|location = London; New York|isbn = 9780203449127 |first = Jane|last = Rendell|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Penner|first3 = Iain|last3 = Borden|pages = 229, 263|chapter = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the UK, architect [[Amanda Levete]] (born 1955) became a director of [[Future Systems]] with her husband [[Jan Kaplický]]. In 1999 they won the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]' (RIBA) [[Stirling Prize]] for their [[Lord's Media Centre|Media Centre]] at Lords Cricket Ground.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Jeffries, [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/apr/09/amanda-levete-architecture-practice "The Saturday interview: architect Amanda Levete"], The Guardian (London), April 9, 2011.

*In [[Serbia]], [[Ljiljana Bakić]] often worked with her husband Dragoljub Bakić. Their most important work was the design of the [[Aleksandar Nikolić Hall|Pionir Sports Hall]], for which they won the "Grand Prix of the Belgrade Architecture Salon" in 1974. Another [[Serbia]]n architect, [[Ivanka Raspopović]], partnered with fellow architect [[Ivan Antić]] to design  [[Belgrade]]'s "[[Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade|Museum of Contemporary Art]]" and [[Kragujevac]]'s "[[Šumarice Memorial Park|21 October Museum]]" in the 1960's. Both buildings have since become national monuments.

==Progress since 2000==
Several women architects have had considerable success in recent years, gaining wide recognition for their achievements:

In 2004, the Iraqi-British architect [[Zaha Hadid]] became the first woman to be awarded the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34337929 |title=Dame Zaha Hadid awarded the Riba Gold Medal for architecture - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= 2015-09-24|accessdate=2015-09-24|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among her many projects, special mention was made of the [[Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art]] in [[Cincinnati]] and the [[BMW Central Building]] in Leipzig. When awarding the prize, the chairman of the jury, spoke of her "unswerving commitment to modernism" explaining how she had moved away from existing typology, from [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]], shifting the geometry of buildings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2004/announcement "Announcement: Zaha Hadid Becomes the First Woman to Receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize"], ''The Pritzker Architecture Prize''.

In 2010, another woman became a Pritzker Prize winner, [[Kazuyo Sejima]] from Japan, in partnership with [[Ryue Nishizawa]]. [[Peter Palumbo, Baron Palumbo|Lord Palumbo]], the jury chairman, spoke of their architecture "that is simultaneously delicate and powerful, precise and fluid, ingenious but not overly or overtly clever; for the creation of buildings that successfully interact with their contexts and the activities they contain, creating a sense of fullness and experiential richness." Special consideration had been given to the Glass Center at the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] in Ohio, and the [[21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa]] in [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2010/announcement "Announcement: Architectural Partners in Japan Become the 2010 Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureates"], ''The Pritzker Architecture Prize''. Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 [[Anna Heringer]] (born 1977, Germany) won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] for her [[METI Handmade School]] built with bamboo and other local materials in [[Rudrapur, Bangladesh|Rudrapur]], [[Bangladesh]]. An example of [[sustainable architecture]], the project was praised not only for its simple, humane approach and beauty but also for the level of cooperation achieved between architects, craftsmen, clients and users.&lt;ref name=akdn2007&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/Content/240Nine-projects-receive-2007-Aga-Khan-Award-for-Architecture "Nine projects receive 2007 Aga Khan Award for Architecture"], ''Aga Khan Development Network''.

Projects have included the [[Royal Danish Playhouse]] (2008) and [[Tietgenkollegiet]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/634/action/2/vis/996/ "Lene Tranberg"], ''KVINFO''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 19 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Sheila Sri Prakash]] was the first Indian [[Architect]] invited to serve on the [[World Economic Forum]]'s Design Innovation Council, where she created the Reciprocal Design Index as a design tool for Holistically Sustainable Development. She is the first woman in India to have established her in own firm.

In 2013, Women In Design, a student organization at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] started a petition for the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] to recognize [[Denise Scott Brown]] who was not awarded in 1991, while her partner, [[Robert Venturi]] was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/arts/design/bid-for-pritzker-prize-to-acknowledge-denise-scott-brown.html?ref=design| work= |publisher=The New York Times |title = Partner Without the Prize| accessdate= April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013 [[Julia Morgan]] became the first woman to receive the [[AIA Gold Medal]], which she received posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Moonan: [http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2013/12/131216-AIA-Awards-2014-Gold-Medal-to-Julia-Morgan.asp "AIA Awards 2014 Gold Medal to Julia Morgan"], in the ''Architectural Record'', 16 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[Heydar Aliyev Cultural Centre]], designed by [[Zaha Hadid]], won the Design Museum Design of the Year Award, making her the first woman to win the top prize in that competition.&lt;ref name="award"/&gt; In 2015 Hadid became the first woman to be awarded the [[RIBA Gold Medal]] in her own right.&lt;ref name="award"/&gt;

==Women's influence==

Although until recently their contributions have been largely unnoticed, women have in fact exerted a fair amount of influence on architecture over the past century. It was [[Susan Lawrence Dana House|Susan Lawrence Dana]], heiress to a mining fortune, who in 1902 chose to have her house in [[Springfield, Illinois]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], so ensuring his breakthrough. Women have also played a key role in historic preservation through organizations such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (1890).&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn H. Anthony in Helen Tierney (ed.), ''Women's Studies Encyclopedia, Vol. 1'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, pp. 104–108.

Routledge, 2003. pp. xiv–xv. {{ISBN|9780415284493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on experience in Canada highlights the widespread contributions women have made in recent years, developing innovative approaches to practice and design. Women's significant and growing presence in the profession has attracted more attention than issues of marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annmarie Adams]], Peta Tancred. ''Designing Women: Gender and the Architectural Profession'', University of Toronto Press, 2000,, pp. 3–5. {{ISBN|9780802082190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibitions presenting women's achievements in various fields provided early opportunities for women demonstrate their competence in designing pavilions. They included the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 exhibition in Chicago]], where the women's pavilion was designed by [[Sophia Hayden Bennett|Sophia Hayden]], and two in 1914 in Germany: the [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne]], whose ''Haus der Frau'' was designed by [[Lilly Reich]], and the Burga Expo in Leipzig devoted to books and graphic art. Inspired by these successes, in 1928 [[Lux Guyer]] from Switzerland designed pavilions for [[SAFFA]] (''Schweizerische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit'') a fair exhibiting the accomplishments of women first held in [[Bern]]. The second SAFFA, held in [[Zurich]] in 1958, was put together by a team of 28 female architects, establishing architecture as a profession open to women in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/1992/1079/1079_abs.pdf Évelyne Lang, "Les Premières Femmes Architectes de Suisse"], ''École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne''. {{fr icon}} Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent statistics==

It is not easy to find reliable statistics on women's place in architecture across the world. Much of the information is dated and some is based on surveys inviting responses but with no guarantee of comprehensive coverage.

;Europe:
In 2010, a survey conducted by the [[Architects' Council of Europe]] in 33 countries, found that there were 524,000 architects, of whom 31% were women. However the proportions differed widely from country to country. The countries with the highest proportion of female architects were Greece (57%), Croatia (56%), Bulgaria (50%), Slovenia (50%) and Sweden (49%) while those with the lowest were Slovakia (15%), Austria (16%), the Netherlands (19%), Germany (21%) and Belgium (24%). Over 200,000 of Europe's architects are in Italy or Germany where the proportions of women are 30% and 21% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ace-cae.eu/public/contents/getdocument/content_id/1079 "The Architectural Profession in Europe 2010"], ''Architects' Council of Europe''. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Australia 
A study conducted in Australia in 2002 indicated that women comprise 43% of architecture students while their representation in the profession varied from 11.6% in [[Queensland]] to 18.2% in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].
More recent Australian data, collected and analyzed as part of the Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession research project, shows that whatever measure used women continue to disappear from the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/about/research/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have comprised over 40% of Australian architecture graduates for over two decades, but are only 20% of registered architects in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 'half-life' of women architects - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/the-half-life-of-women-architects/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|publisher = |last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|last2 = Clark|first2 = Justine|authorlink2 = Justine_Clark|date = 2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 1: at school - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-at-school/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 2: at work - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-part-2-at-work/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 3: Institute membership - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-part-3-institute-membership/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;South Africa
In 2016 only 21% of the architectural professionals registered in [[South Africa]] were women. A survey by the [[South African Institute of Architects|SA Institute of Architects]] Eastern Cape institute showed that in 2014 only 29% of architecture students graduating from [[Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University]] were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Only 21% of SA architects are women - what can be done? |url =https://www.property24.com/articles/only-21-of-sa-architects-are-women-what-can-be-done/24574 |publisher = Property24 |accessdate = 2018-10-01 |date=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A United Kingdom survey in 2000 stated that 13% of practising architects were women although women comprised 38% of students and 22% of teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://architectureau.com/articles/women-in-architecture/ Karen Burns, "Women in architecture"], ''ArchitectureAU''. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the Fees Bureau in November 2010 showed, however, that only 19% of professional architects were women, a drop of 5% since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructingequality.co.uk/faq-s/news/u%E2%80%98alarm%E2%80%99asnumberofwomenarchitectsfallsforfirsttimeinnearlyadecadentitledpost Chrissi McCarthy, "Alarm as number of women architects falls for first time in nearly a decade"], ''Constructing Equality'', 11 November 2010. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States
In the United States, the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] reported in 2009 that 41% of architecture graduates were women while the [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]] National Associates Committee Report from 2004 gives the percentage of licensed female architects as 20%.

'''Terminal 3''', also known by the trademarked name '''Worldport''', was an [[airport terminal]] built by [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) in 1960 at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]. It opened on May 24, 1960 and ceased operations on May 24, 2013; it was demolished in late 2013.

==History==
===Original use===
[[Image:Pan Am Worldport overview.jpg|thumb|left|The distinctive "flying saucer" roof design of the Worldport]]
The terminal was originally known as the "Pan Am Terminal" or Pan Am "Unit Terminal Building (UTB)." It was designed by Ives, Turano &amp; Gardner Associated Architects and Walther Prokosch of Tippets-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton as a showcase for international jet travel and is particularly famous for its {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} "flying saucer" roof suspended far from the outside columns of the terminal by 32 sets of pre-stressed steel posts and cables. The terminal was designed to allow for aircraft to be parked under the partial overhang; marketing brochures promoted it as the jet-age terminal that brought the plane to the passenger. The overhang sheltered passengers as they boarded the aircraft by stairs or by uncovered bridges. The [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) ''Guide to New York City'' called the terminal a "genuine architectural attempt to answer the problem of all-weather connections to the planes" but derided the overall concept as "compromised by an overabundance of distracting detail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=AIA Guide to New York City |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0gj61QSgk8C&amp;pg=PA811&amp;lpg=PA811 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |author=White, Norval |author2=Willensky, Elliot |author3=Leadon, Fran |page=811 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's facade originally featured [[zodiac]] figures made by sculptor [[Milton Hebald]],&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Sanka.

Accessed October 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; although these were later removed by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68708702.html "Outrage.(Pan American airport terminal in disrepair)"], ''[[Architectural Review]]'', December 2000. Accessed October 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The terminal featured the Panorama Room, a dining room with a view of the entire concourse, and the Clipper Hall museum of Pan Am history.

In 1971, the terminal was expanded to accommodate the large [[Boeing 747]] and renamed the "Pan Am Worldport". The Worldport was the world's largest airline terminal and held the title for several years.

Operation of the Worldport changed hands when Pan Am declared bankruptcy in 1991. [[Delta Air Lines]] acquired many of Pan Am's assets, including the lease on the Worldport, which became known simply as "Terminal 3", and operated most of its long-haul flights out of JFK to Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America from the building.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In March 2006, Delta COO Jim Whitehurst announced that Delta would spend US$10 million before the end of that year to renovate Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, including its public spaces, BusinessElite lounge, and Crown Room Clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Delta Air Lines To Surpass American In JFK Departures |first=Jay |last=Boehmer |url=http://www.businesstravelnews.com/More-News/Articles/Delta-Air-Lines-To-Surpass-American-In-JFK-Departures/ |work=Business Travel News |date=March 20, 2006 |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the July 2007 issue of Delta's ''Sky Magazine'', Delta Senior Vice President Joanne Smith remarked on the "distinctive" saucer roof in an article on new flooring, lighting, and signage at this "historic airport".

===Redevelopment and preservation campaign===
On August 4, 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Delta was planning to move its international flights to Terminal 4 following the construction of nine additional gates in Concourse B of that terminal. Delta's domestic flights would continue to be operated out of Terminal 2. Terminal 3 would subsequently be demolished to create additional [[hardstand|aircraft parking]] between Terminals 2 and 4. Construction of the Terminal 4 expansion began in November 2010 and was completed in May 2013.

On May 23, 2013, the final departure from Terminal 3, [[Delta Air Lines]] Flight 268, a [[Boeing 747-400]] to [[Tel Aviv]] [[Ben Gurion Airport]], departed from Gate 6 at 11:25pm local time. The terminal ceased operations on the next day, 53 years to the day from when it opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Frischling |first=Steven |title=Photographer |url=http://boardingarea.com/blogs/flyingwithfish/2013/05/17/a-historic-chapter-in-aviation-closes-it-wont-be-documented/ |accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historic Preservation|Preservation]] groups campaigned to save the building and have it nominated by the New York [[State Historic Preservation Office]] as a [[National Register of Historic Places|historic place]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Save The Pan Am Worldport |url=http://www.facebook.com/PanAmWorldport |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 19, 2013, the Worldport was placed on the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]'s [[America's Most Endangered Places|list of 11 Most Endangered Places in America]] for 2013,&lt;ref name="historic sites lost" /&gt; but by June 25, 2013, demolition of the elevated roadway leading to the terminal had already begun, although preservationists continued to protest against the demolition of the building itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Preservationists fight to save Pan Am terminal 'Worldport' at JFK airport |author=Clare Trapasso |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/preservationists-cry-save-worldport-article-1.1382281 |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York State Historic Preservation Office, which had revoked the building's eligibility for the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001,&lt;ref name="2012 FOIL Request"&gt;{{cite web |last=Worldport |first=Save the |title=2012 SHPO FOIL |url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.491185194238416.114871.131386373551635&amp;type=3 |work=Remembering the Pan Am Worldport |accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; upheld this decision in May 2013, claiming the building had lost significant historic integrity due to excessive modifications.

The preservation campaign was ultimately unsuccessful and demolition of the flying saucer section was completed on November 22, 2013. Demolition work on the remainder of the terminal completed in summer 2014. The National Trust for Historic Preservation cited the Worldport as one of ten historic sites lost in 2013.&lt;ref name="historic sites lost"&gt;{{cite news |last=staff |title=A look at 10 historic sites save, 10 lost in 2013 |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] as reported by the [[Post Crescent]] |date=January 5, 2014 |page=F3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was subsequently large media outcry, particularly in other countries, concerning the demolition of the Worldport. Several online petitions requesting the restoration of the original 'flying saucer' have gained popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Port Authority Approves Construction |url=http://www.panynj.gov/press-room/press-item.cfm?headLine_id=1309 |publisher=[[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Plans For Expanding Terminal 4 at JFK Airport |url=http://home2.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fhome2.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2010b%2Fpr348-10.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 |publisher=NYC Office of the Mayor |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Plans for Enhancement and Expansion of Terminal 4 at JFK Airport |url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1095 |publisher=[[Delta Air Lines]] |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Details Of JFK Improvements&amp;nbsp;– Civil Aviation Forum |url=http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/4895622/ |publisher=Airliners.net |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zero Waste''' is a philosophy that encourages the redesign of [[natural resource|resource]] life cycles so that all products are [[reused]]. The goal is for no trash to be sent to [[landfills]], [[incinerators]], or the ocean. The process recommended is one [[biomimetics|similar]] to the way that resources are reused in nature. The definition adopted by the ''Zero Waste International Alliance'' (ZWIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zwia.org/|title=Zero Waste International Alliance|author=|date=|website=zwia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zero Waste: The conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse, and recovery of all products, packaging, and materials, without burning them, and without discharges to land, water, or air that threaten the environment or human health. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zero Waste refers to waste management and planning approaches which emphasize waste prevention as opposed to end-of-pipe waste management.&lt;ref name=Snow&gt;{{cite web|author1=Snow, W. |author2=Dickinson J. |date=2001 |title=The end of waste: Zero waste by 2020|url=http://www.zerowaste.co.nz/assets/Reports/TheEndofWaste.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a whole systems approach that aims for a massive change in the way materials flow through society, resulting in no waste.&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt; Zero waste encompasses more than eliminating waste through [[recycling]] and [[reuse]], it focuses on restructuring production and distribution systems to reduce waste.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite web |author=Davidson, G. |date=2011 |title=Waste Management Practices: Literature Review|url=https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/sustainability/Waste%20Management%20Literature%20Review%20Final%20June%202011%20(1.49%20MB).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero waste is more of a goal or ideal rather than a hard target.&lt;ref name=Spiegelman&gt;{{cite web|author=Spiegelman, H. |date=2006 |title=Transitioning to Zero Waste - What can local governments do NOW?|url=http://www.rcbc.ca/files/u3/PPI_Zero_Waste_and_Local_Govt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zero Waste provides guiding principles for continually working towards eliminating wastes.&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt;

Advocates expect that government regulation is needed&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt; to influence industrial choices over product and packaging design, manufacturing processes, and material selection.&lt;ref name=Townsend&gt;{{cite journal |author=Townsend, W. K. |date=2010 |title=Zero waste: an aspiration or an oxymoron? |journal=Waste Management &amp; Research |volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–3|doi=10.1177/0734242X09356145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Advocates say eliminating waste decreases pollution, and can also reduce costs due to the reduced need for raw materials.

== Cradle-to-cradle / cradle-to-grave ==

Cradle-to-grave is a term used to describe a linear model for materials that begins with resource extraction, moves to product manufacturing, and, ends by a ‘grave’, where the product is disposed of in a [[landfill]].  Cradle-to-grave is in direct contrast to cradle-to-cradle. [[Cradle-to-cradle]] is a term used in life-cycle analysis to describe a material or product that is recycled into a new product at the end of its life, so that ultimately there is no waste.&lt;ref name=McDonough&gt;{{cite web |author1=McDonough, W. |author2=Braungart, M. |date=2003 |title=The cradle-to-cradle alternative.|url=http://www.mcdonough.com/speaking-writing/the-cradle-to-cradle-alternative/#.UzxdSUlzZAg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cradle-to-cradle focuses on designing industrial systems so that materials flow in closed loop cycles which mean fun that waste is minimized, and waste products can be recycled and reused. Cradle-to-cradle simply goes beyond dealing with issues of waste after it has been created, by addressing problems at the source and by re-defining problems by focusing on [[design]].&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;  The cradle-to-cradle model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations.&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;

The cradle-to-cradle framework has evolved steadily from theory to practice.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;  In the industrial sector, it is creating a new notion of materials and material flows. Just as in the natural world, in which one organism’s ‘waste’, cycles through an ecosystem to provide nourishment for other living things, cradle-to-cradle materials circulate in closed-loop cycles, providing nutrients for nature or industry.&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;

An example of a closed loop, cradle-to-cradle product design is DesignTex Fabric. It has designed an upholstery fabric, Climatex Lifecycle, which is a blend of [[pesticide]]- and residue-free wool and organically grown [[ramie]], dyed and processed entirely with [[nontoxic]] chemicals.

== Problems ==

=== Social and economic ===

The spread of industrialization worldwide has been accompanied by a large increase in waste production. In 2012 the World Bank stated that 1.3billion tonnes of municipal waste was produced by urban populations and estimates that that number will reach 2.2 billion tonnes by 2025 (Global Solid Waste Management Market - Analysis and Forecast). The increase in solid waste production increase the need for landfills. With the increase in urbanization these landfills are being placed closer to communities. These landfills are disproportionately located in areas of low socioeconomic status with primarily non-white populations.  Findings indicated these areas are often targeted as waste sites because permits are more easily acquired and there was generally less community resistance.  Additionally, within the last five years, more than 400 hazardous waste facilities have received formal enforcement actions for unspecified violations that were considered to be a risk to human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stretesky|first=P.|last2=McKie|first2=R.|date=2016|title=A perspective on the historical analysis of race and treatment storage and disposal facilities in the United States.|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/031001/meta|journal=Environmental. Research. Letters.|volume=11|issue=3|pages=|via=|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/031001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing global population that is faced with limited resources from the environment.[[Zero waste#cite note-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] To relieve the pressures placed on the finite resources available it has become more important to prevent waste. To achieve zero waste, waste management has to move from a linear system to being more cyclical so that materials, products and substances are used as efficiently as possible. Materials must be chosen so that it may either return safely to a cycle within the environment or remain viable in the industrial cycle.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Zero waste promotes not only reuse and recycling, but, more importantly, it promotes prevention and product designs that consider the entire product life cycle.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Zero waste designs strive for reduced materials use, use of recycled materials, use of more benign materials, longer product lives, reparability, and ease of disassembly at end of life.[[Zero waste#cite note-Davidson-3|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Zero waste strongly supports sustainability by protecting the environment, reducing costs and producing additional jobs in the management and handling of wastes back into the industrial cycle.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] A Zero waste strategy may be applied to businesses, communities, industrial sectors, schools and homes.

Benefits proposed by advocates include:
* Saving money. Since waste is a sign of inefficiency, the reduction of waste can reduce costs.
* Faster Progress. A zero waste strategy improves upon production processes and improving environmental prevention strategies which can lead to take larger, more innovative steps.
* Supports sustainability. A zero waste strategy supports all three of the generally accepted goals of sustainability - economic well-being, environmental protection, and social well-being.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
* Improved material flows. A zero waste strategy would use far fewer new raw materials and send no waste materials to landfills. Any material waste would either return as reusable or recycled materials or would be suitable for use as compost.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

=== Health ===

A major issue with landfills is hydrogen sulfide, which is released during the natural decay of waste. Studies have shown a positive association between increased lung cancer mortality rates and increased morbidity and mortality related to respiratory disease and hydrogen sulfide exposure. These studies also showed that the hydrogen sulfide exposure increased with proximity to the landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mataloni|first=F. |last2=Badaloni|first2=C. |last3=Golini|first3=M. |last4=Bolignano|first4=A. |last5=Bucci|first5=S. |last6=Sozzi|first6=R. |last7=Forastiere|first7=F.|last8=Davoli|first8=M.|last9=Ancona|first9=C.|date=2016|title=Morbidity and mortality of people who live close to municipal waste landfills: a multisite cohort study |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=806–15 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyw052 |pmid=27222499 |pmc=5005946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Household chemicals and prescription drugs are increasingly being found in large quantities in the leachate from landfills. This is causing concern about the ability of landfills to contain these materials, and the possibility of these chemicals and drugs making their way into the ground water and the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Masoner|first=Jason R. |last2=Kolpin|first2=Dana W. |last3=Furlong|first3=Edward T. |last4=Cozzarelli|first4=Isabelle M. |last5=Gray|first5=James L. |date=2016-04-01 |title=Landfill leachate as a mirror of today's disposable society: Pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern in final leachate from landfills in the conterminous United States |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |language=en |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=906–918 |doi=10.1002/etc.3219 |issn=1552-8618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero waste promotes a circular material flow that allows materials to be used over and over, reducing the need for landfill space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Song|first=Qingbin |last2=Li|first2=Jinhui |last3=Zeng|first3=Xianlai |date=2014 |title=Minimizing the Increasing Solid Waste Through Zero Waste Strategy |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=104 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.08.027 |pages=199–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through zero waste the number of toxins released into the air and water would be decreased and products examined to determine what chemicals are used in the production process.

Health Issues related to landfills:
* Birth Defects and Low birth weight: Associated with close proximity to landfills, exposure to particle matter and Nitrogen dioxide
* Respiratory disease and Lung Cancer: Related to the release of Hydrogen Sulfide
Zero waste’s promotion of a cyclical product life can help reduce the need to create and fill landfills. This can help reduce incidences of respiratory diseases and birth defects that are associated with the toxins released from landfills. Zero waste also can help preserve local environments and drinking water sources by preventing pollutants from entering the ecosystem.

== History ==

=== 2002–2003 ===

The movement gained publicity and reached a peak in 1998–2002, and since then has been moving from "theory into action" by focusing on how a "zero waste community" is structured and behaves. The website of the Zero Waste International Alliance has a listing of communities across the globe that have created public policy to promote zero-waste practices.

=== Present day ===

The tension between zero waste, viewed as post-discard total [[recycling]] of materials only, and zero waste as the reuse of all high level function remains a serious one today. It is probably the defining difference between established recyclers and emerging zero-wasters. A signature example is the difference between smashing a [[glass bottle]] (recovering cheap glass) and [[refill]]ing the bottle (recovering the entire function of the container).
	
The tension between the literal application of natural processes and the creation of industry-specific more efficient reuse modalities is another tension. Many observers look to nature as an ultimate model for production and innovative materials. Others point out that industrial products are inherently non-natural (such as chemicals and [[plastics]] that are mono-molecular) and benefit greatly from industrial methods of reuse, while natural methods requiring degradation and reconstitution are wasteful in that context.
	
[[Biodegradable plastic]] is the most prominent example. One side argues that [[biodegradation]] of plastic is wasteful because plastic is expensive and environmentally damaging to make. Whether made of starch or petroleum, the manufacturing process expends all the same materials and energy costs. Factories are built, raw materials are procured, investments are made, machinery is built and used, humans labor and make use of all normal human inputs for education, housing, food etc. Even if the plastic is biodegraded after a single use, all of those costs are lost so it is much more important to design plastic parts for multiple reuse or perpetual lives. The other side argues that keeping plastic out of a dump or the sea is the sole benefit of interest.
	
Companies moving towards "zero landfill" plants include [[Subaru]], [[Xerox]] and [[Anheuser-Busch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/environment/2008-02-18-green-factories_N.htm|title="Zero landfill" plants|accessdate= 9 March 2011 | work=USA Today|first=Chris|last=Woodyard|date=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement continues to grow among the youth around the world under the organization [https://web.archive.org/web/20130528153545/http://zerowasteyouth.org/en/ Zero Waste Youth], which originated in Brazil and has spread to Argentina, Puerto Rico, Mexico, the United States, and Russia.

[[File:Glass milk bottles.jpg|right|thumb|Returnable glass milk bottles]]
Milk can be shipped in many forms.  One of the traditional forms was reusable returnable glass milk bottles, often home delivered by a milkman. While some of this continues, other options have recently been more common:  one-way gable-top paperboard cartons, one-way aseptic cartons, one-way recyclable glass bottles, one-way [[milk bag]]s, and others. Each system claims some advantages and also has possible disadvantages. From the zero waste standpoint, the [[reuse of bottles]] is beneficial because the material usage per trip can be less than other systems. The primary input (or resource) is [[silica]]-[[sand]], which is formed into glass and then into a bottle. The bottle is filled with [[milk]] and distributed to the consumer. A [[reverse logistics]] system returns the bottles for cleaning, inspection, sanitization, and reuse. Eventually the heavy duty bottle would not be suited for further use and would be recycled. Waste and landfill usage would be minimized.  The  material waste is primarily the wash water, detergent, transportation, heat, bottle caps, etc. While true zero waste is never achieved, a [[life cycle assessment]] can be used to calculate the waste at each phase of each cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Recycling and rotting (composting) ==
{{Main|Recycling}}
	
It is important to distinguish recycling from Zero Waste.
	
Some{{who|date=January 2016}} claim that the key component to zero waste is [[recycling]] while others{{who|date=January 2016}} reject that notion in favor of reusing high function. The common understanding of recycling is simply that of placing bottles and cans in a recycle bin. The modern version of recycling is more complicated and involves many more elements of financing and government support. For example, a 2007 report by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] states that the US recycles at a national rate of 33.4% and includes in this figure composted materials. In addition many worldwide commodity industries have been created to handle the materials that are recycled. At the same time, claims of recycling rates have sometimes been exaggerated, for example by the inclusion of [[soil]] and organic matter used to cover garbage dumps daily, in the "recycled" column. In states with recycling incentives, there is constant local pressure to pump up the recycling rate figures.
	 
The movement toward recycling has separated itself from the concept of zero waste. One example of this is the [[computer industry]] where worldwide millions of PC's are disposed of as [[electronic waste]] each year (160 million in 2007). Those computers that enter the recycling stream are broken down into a small amount of [[raw materials]] while most merely enter dumps through export to [[third world countries]]. Companies are then able to purchase some raw materials, notably [[steel]]&lt;!-- not much steel in a computer--&gt;, [[copper]] and [[glass]], reducing the use of new materials. On the other hand, there is an industry, more aligned with the Zero Waste principle of design for long term reuse, that actually repairs computers. It is called the [[refurbishment (electronics)|Computer Refurbishing]] industry and it predates the current campaign to just collect and ship electronics. They have organizations and conferences and have for many years donated computers to schools, clinics and non-profits. Zero Waste planning demands that components be redesigned for effective reuse over long lives leading to even more refurbishing and repair.
	
There is one seminal example that brings out the difference between Zero Waste and recycling in stark relief. That example, quoted in Getting To Zero Waste, is the software business. Zero Waste is sensitive to the waste of intellectual effort that would be caused by the need to recreate certain basic inventions of software (called objects in software design) as opposed to copying them over and over whenever needed. The waste would occur as the software developers consume resources while solving problems already solved earlier. The application of Zero Waste analysis is straightforward as it recommends conserving human effort. On the other hand, the usual approach of recycling would be to look for some materials that could be found to reuse. The materials on which software is saved (such as paper or diskettes)is of little significance compared to the saving of human effort and if software is saved electronically, there is no media at all. Thus Zero Waste correctly identifies a wasteful behavior to avoid while recycling has no application.
	
The recycling movement has been embraced by the garbage industry because it serves so well as [[greenwashing]] i.e. a way to show that design for garbage creation is acceptable because materials will be kept out of a dump by recycling them. Zero Waste, on the other hand, offers the garbage industry no such screen against public condemnation of waste, and therefore actually threatens the continued need for garbage disposal. For example, in [[Alameda County, California]], garbage dumping is charged a surcharge of $8/ton (as of 2009) which goes entirely for a recycling subsidy but none of which goes for any kind of Zero Waste style designing. Zero Waste has received no support from the garbage industry or politicians under their control except in those cases where it can be claimed to consist solely of more recycling.

=== Reduce, reuse and recycle ===

Zero waste is poorly supported by the enactment of government laws to enforce the [[waste hierarchy|waste hierarchy of refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and rot (compost)]]. In practice, these laws invariably emphasize destruction and recycling, while the reuse component is marginalized.{{opinion|date=July 2016}}
	
A special feature of Zero Waste as a design principle is that it can be applied to any product or process, in any situation or at any level. Thus it applies equally to toxic chemicals as to benign plant matter. It applies to the waste of atmospheric purity by coal burning or the waste of radioactive resources by attempting to designate the excesses of nuclear power plants as "nuclear waste". All processes can be designed to minimize the need for discard, both in their own operations and in the usage or consumption patterns which the design of their products leads to. Recycling, on the other hand, deals only with simple materials.
	
Zero Waste can even be applied to the waste of human potential by enforced poverty and the denial of educational opportunity. It encompasses redesign for reduced energy wasting in industry or transportation and the wasting of the earth's rainforests. It is a general principle of designing for the efficient use of all resources, however defined.

The recycling movement may be slowly branching out from its solid waste management base to include issues that are similar to the community sustainability movement.
	 
Zero waste on the other hand, is not based in waste management limitations to begin with but requires that we maximize our existing reuse efforts while creating and applying new methods that minimize and eliminate destructive methods like incineration and recycling. Zero Waste strives to ensure that products are designed to be repaired, refurbished, re-manufactured and generally reused.. ("What is Zero Waste?", para 2).

Online web services, like [[Freecycle Network|Free Cycle]] or the [http://www.regives.com/ reGives] Network have risen in popularity over the last decade where locals can give items that they no longer need to others locally in an effort to keep items out of landfills and work toward a zero waste lifestyle.

== Significance of dump capacity ==

Many dumps are currently exceeding carrying capacity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This is often used as a justification for moving to Zero Waste. Others counter by pointing out that there are huge tracts of land available throughout the USA and other countries which could be used for dumps. Proposals abound to destroy all garbage as a way to solve the garbage problem. These proposals typically claim to convert all or a large portion of existing garbage into oil and sometimes claim to produce so much oil that the world will henceforth have abundant liquid fuels. One such plan, called Anything Into Oil, was promoted by Discover Magazine and Fortune Magazine in 2004 and claimed to be able to convert a refrigerator into "light Texas crude" by the application of high pressure steam.

=== Corporate initiatives ===
{{Update|section|date=November 2017}}
An example of a company that has demonstrated a change in landfill waste policy is [[General Motors]] (GM). GM has confirmed their plans to make approximately half of its 181 plants worldwide "landfill-free" by the end of 2010. Companies like [[Subaru]], [[Toyota]], and [[Xerox]] are also producing landfill-free plants. Furthermore, The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has worked with GM and other companies for decades to minimize the waste through its WasteWise program. The goal for General Motors is finding ways to recycle or reuse more than 90% of materials by: selling scrap materials, adopting [[reusable part]]s boxes to replace [[cardboard]], and even recycling used work gloves. The remainder of the scraps might be incinerated to create energy for the plants. Besides being nature friendly, it also saves money by cutting out waste and producing a more efficient production. All these organizations push forth to make our world clean and producing zero waste.

=== Re-use or rot of waste ===

The waste sent to landfills may be harvested as useful materials, such as in the production of [[solar energy]] or [[natural fertilizer]] /[[de-composted]] [[manure]] for crops.

It may also be reused and recycled for something that we can actually use.&lt;ref name="roper"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1504/IJETM.2006.009000| volume = 6 | issue = 3/4| pages = 313–345 | last = Roper | first = William E. | title = Strategies for building material reuse and recycle | journal = International Journal of Environmental Technology and Management | year = 2006 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The success of General Motors in creating zero-landfill facilities shows that zero-waste goals can be a powerful impetus for manufacturers to reduce their waste and carbon footprint," says Latisha Petteway, a spokesperson for the EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/environment/2008-09-04-gm-zero-landfill_N.htm|title=GM plans to dump use of landfills|last=Cary|first=S. S.|date=4 September 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 is a goal, a process, a way of thinking that profoundly changes our approach to resources and production. Zero Waste is not about recycling and diversion from landfills but about restructuring production and distribution systems to prevent waste from being manufactured in the first place. The materials that are still required in these re-designed, resource-efficient systems will be reused many times as the products that incorporate them are reused. [[Deconstruction]] can be described as construction in reverse. It involves carefully taking apart a building to maximize the reuse of materials, thereby reducing waste and conserving resources. Deconstruction can capture materials and some components from the millions of buildings that are existing and that were poorly designed for high level reuse but it is not a favored approach from a Zero Waste point of view. Zero Waste favors the design of buildings as assemblages of high level components, not their creation from rough materials such as lumber, cement or plaster. The details are not worked out yet but to the extent that entire rooms, entire walls, roofs or floors or entire utility systems can be pre-built and installed as completed components, that will be the goal of Zero Waste design. Until buildings are built as components capable of later dismantling, deconstruction is a stop-gap process that the United States can use to minimize the waste of building materials. For now, the largest parts that we are able to save tend to be architectural elements, windows, doors, and metals, many of which are being saved and resold by reuse yards such as Urban Ore in Berkeley, California. The main parts that still need to be crushed are wood flooring, brick walls, and structural timbers.&lt;ref name="roper"/&gt; The demolition of traditional buildings has been long done by wrecking ball or bulldozer. Social and political artifacts, such as demolition contractor licenses and required permits that can only be satisfied by destruction and discard (with partial recycling of rubble and steel), render the destruction and disposal costs cheaper than deconstruction. Approximately seventy pounds of the waste is generated for about every square foot of the residential building demolition. It is arguable that this is artificial economics, based on the cultural preference for wastefulness and that Zero Waste designs of dismantlable components will ultimately be the cheapest as well as the most conservative way to reuse buildings. Further discussions of this topic may be found on the ZWI website.&lt;ref name="roper"/&gt;

Roper's comments in the paragraph above are either misquoted or wrong concerning wood flooring, structural wood and bricks needing to be crushed.  Brick, wood and stone are among the oldest truly recyclable materials used in construction.  A historic review of old buildings, barns and bridges clearly shows that brick, stones and timber are reused from older buildings.  Some of the oldest structures on the planet are built with materials that were recycled from previous structures.  One recent example is the [[Mayflower Barn]] at Jordans just north of High Wycombe, UK.  The barn is clearly built of reused timbers, possibly sourced from the salvage of the Mayflower ship.  It is simply a fact of life that historically materials that could be reused were reused.

In more recent construction, structural timber components, including large timbers, glued laminated beams, floor joists, studs and flooring are some of the most valuable structural components salvaged when a structure is demolished if there is an interest in salvaging.  If you need proof, go down to any local construction salvage yard and look at the value of trusses, wood beams, floor joists, studs and flooring.  Today they have value when someone saves them.

One of the barriers of reusing structural materials is the bias of building code officials and building departments that discriminate against reusing materials.  Codes and building departments require compliance to codes, including the source of materials.  Your average contractor cannot just use 100-year-old 2x8 (50x200) salvaged floor joists because the building department requires a graded joist.  The contractor then has to find an engineer or wood technologist to verify the material suitability for its use.  While the codes technically allow this under alternative method, modern attention to cost usually prevents that option.

==Market-based campaigns==

Market-based, legislation-mediated campaigns like Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and the Precautionary Principle are among numerous campaigns that have a Zero Waste slogan hung on them by means of claims they will ineluctably lead to policies of Zero Waste. At the moment, there is no evidence that EPR will increase reuse, rather than merely moving discard and disposal into private-sector dumping contracts. The Precautionary Principle is put forward to shift liability for proving new chemicals are safe from the public (acting as guinea pig) to the company introducing them. As such, its relation to Zero Waste is dubious. Likewise, many organizations, cities and counties have embraced a Zero Waste slogan while pressing for none of the key Zero Waste changes. In fact, it is common for many such to simply state that recycling is their entire goal. Many commercial or industrial companies claim to embrace Zero Waste but usually mean no more than a major materials recycling effort, having no bearing on product redesign. Examples include Staples, Home Depot, Toyota, General Motors and computer take-back campaigns. Earlier social justice campaigns have successfully pressured McDonald’s to change their meat purchasing practices and Nike to change its labor practices in Southeast Asia. Those were both based on the idea that organized consumers can be active participants in the economy and not just passive subjects. However, the announced and enforced goal of the public campaign is critical. A goal to reduce waste generation or dumping through greater recycling will not achieve a goal of product redesign and so cannot reasonably be called a Zero Waste campaign.&lt;ref name="roper"/&gt;

==How to achieve==

National and provincial governments often set targets and may provide some funding, but on a practical level, waste management programs (e.g. pickup, dropoff, or containers for recycling and composting) are usually implemented by local governments, possibly with regionally shared facilities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Towards a Zero Waste Strategy for an English Local Authority |last = Cole|first = C| journal = Resources, Conservation and Recycling |volume=89 |year=2014 |pages=64–75|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.05.005|pmid = |access-date = |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaching the goal of zero waste requires the products of manufacturers and [[industrial designer]]s to be easily disassembled for recycling and incorporated back into nature or the industrial system; durability and repairability also reduce unnecessary churn in the product lifecycle.  Minimizes packaging also solves many problems early in the supply chain.  If not mandated by government, choices by retailers and consumers in favor of zero-waste-friendly products can influence production. To prevent material from becoming waste, consumers, businesses, and non-profits must be educated in how to reduce waste and recycle successfully.&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt;

===Zero Waste Hierarchy===
The "Zero Waste Hierarchy" describes a progression of policies and strategies to support the Zero Waste system, from highest and best to lowest use of materials.  It is designed to be applicable to all audiences, from policy-makers to industry and the individual.  It aims to provide more depth to the internationally recognized 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle); to encourage policy, activity and investment at the top of the hierarchy; and to provide a guide for those who wish to develop systems or products that move us closer to Zero Waste.   It enhances the Zero Waste definition by providing guidance for planning and a way to evaluate proposed solutions.All over the world, in some form or another, a pollution prevention hierarchy is incorporated into recycling regulations, solid waste management plans, and resource conservation programs. In Canada, a pollution prevention hierarchy otherwise referred to as the Environmental Protection Hierarchy was adopted. This Hierarchy has been incorporated into all recycling regulations within Canada and is embedded within all resource conservation methods which all government mandated waste prevention programs follow. While the intention to incorporate the 4th R (recovery)prior to disposal was good, many organizations focused on this 4th R instead of the top of the hierarchy resulting in costly systems designed to destroy materials instead of systems designed to reduce environmental impact and waste. Because of this, along with other resource destruction systems that have been emerging over the past few decades, Zero Waste Canada along with the Zero Waste International Alliance have adopted the only internationally peer reviewed Zero Waste Hierarchy that focuses on the first 3Rs; Reduce, Reuse and Recycle including Compost &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://zerowastecanada.ca/zero-waste-hierarchy/ |title=Zero Waste Hierarchy |website=Zero Waste Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An example of [[network governance]] approach can be seen in the UK under New Labour who proposed the establishment of regional groupings that brought together the key stakeholders in waste management (local authority representatives,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; waste industry, government offices etc.) on a voluntary basis.&lt;ref name="Davoudi 2005 493–517"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davoudi|first=S|author2=Evans |title=The Challenge of governance in regional waste planning|journal=Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|year=2005|volume=23|pages=493–517|doi=10.1068/c42m}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of clear government policy on how to meet the targets for diversion from landfill which increases the scope at the regional and local level for governance networks.&lt;ref name="Davoudi 2005 493–517"/&gt; The overall goal is set by government but the route for how to achieve it is left open, so stakeholders can coordinate and decide how best to reach it.&lt;ref name="Geels 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geels|first=F|title=The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: A report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|year=2008|publisher=DEFRA|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Waste is a strategy promoted by environmental NGOs but the waste industry is more in favour of the capital intensive option of energy from waste incineration.&lt;ref name="Davoudi 2005 493–517"/&gt; Research often highlights public support as the first requirement for success.&lt;ref name="Young 2010 236–244"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=C-Y |author2=Ni, S-P |author3=Fan, K-A|title=Working towards a zero waste environment in Taiwan|journal=[[Waste Management &amp; Research]]|year=2010|volume=28|pages=236–244|doi=10.1177/0734242x09337659}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Taiwan, public opinion was essential in changing the attitude of business, who must transform their material use pattern to become more sustainable for Zero Waste to work.&lt;ref name="Young 2010 236–244"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frosch|first=R|author2=Gallopoulos |title=Strategies for manufacturing|journal=Scientific American|year=1989|volume=261|pages=144–152|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovation and technology is encouraged by government creating an innovation friendly environment without being prescriptive.&lt;ref name="Geels 2008"/&gt; To be a successful model of sustainable urban development it will also require the involvement and co-operation from all members of society emphasizing the importance of network governance.
