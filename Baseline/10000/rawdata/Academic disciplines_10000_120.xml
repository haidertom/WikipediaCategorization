'''AM stereo''' is a term given to a series of mutually incompatible techniques for [[radio broadcasting]] [[stereophonic|stereo]] [[Audio frequency|audio]] in the [[mediumwave|AM]] band in a manner that is compatible with standard [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]s. There are two main classes of systems: [[independent sideband]] (ISB) systems, promoted principally by [[United States|American]] [[broadcast engineer]] [[Leonard R. Kahn]]; and [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] (QAM) [[multiplexing]] systems (conceptually closer to [[FM stereo]]).

Initially adopted by many commercial AM broadcasters in the mid to late 1980s, AM stereo broadcasting soon began to decline due to a lack of receivers (most "AM/FM stereo" radios only receive in stereo on FM), a growing exodus of music broadcasters to FM, concentration of ownership of the few remaining stations in the hands of large corporations and the removal of music from AM stations in favour of news/talk or sports broadcasting. By 2001, most of the former AM stereo broadcasters were no longer stereo or had left the AM band entirely.

==History==
Early experiments with stereo AM radio involved two separate stations (both AM or sometimes one AM and one FM) broadcasting the left and right audio channels. This system was not very practical, as it required the listener to use two separate receivers. Synchronization was problematic, often resulting in "ping-pong" effects between the two channels. Reception was also likely to be different between the two stations, and many listeners used mismatching models of receivers.

After the early experiments with two stations, a number of systems were invented to broadcast a stereo signal in a way which was compatible with standard AM receivers.

[[FM stereo]] was first implemented in 1961. In the [[United States]], FM overtook AM as the dominant broadcast radio band in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

===Timeline===
* 1924: WPAJ (now [[WDRC (AM)]]) broadcast in stereo from [[New Haven, Connecticut]], using two transmitters: one on 1120&amp;nbsp;kHz and the other on 1320&amp;nbsp;kHz. However stereo separation was poor, to preserve compatibility for mono listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wa2fnq.com/fnq/amstrdoc.htm | title = AM Stereo | work = WA2FNQ web site | first = Gerald J. | last = Mehrab | location = [[Northport, New York]] | date = 2008-02-01 | accessdate = 2010-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1950s, several AM stereo systems were proposed (including the original RCA AM/FM system which later became the Belar system in the 1970s) but the FCC did not propose any standard as AM was still dominant over FM at the time.
* 1960: AM stereo first demonstrated on [[XETRA-AM]], [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]], using the Kahn [[independent sideband]] system.
* 1963: [[WHAZ (AM)|WHAZ]] runs a stereo program on eight AM stations, four on each channel.
* 1980: After five years of testing the five systems, the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) selected the [[Magnavox]] system as the official AM stereo standard. The FCC's research is immediately accused of being flawed and incomplete.
* 1982: After a series of lawsuits and accusations, the FCC decides to let the marketplace decide and revokes the [[Magnavox]] certification as the AM stereo standard for political reasons. Belar had dropped out of the AM stereo race due to receiver distortion problems, leaving [[Motorola]] [[C-QUAM]], [[Harris Corporation]], Magnavox, and the Kahn/Hazeltine [[independent sideband]] system.
* 1984: [[General Motors]], [[Ford]], [[Chrysler]], and a number of import automakers begin installing C-QUAM AM stereo receivers in automobiles, beginning with the 1985 model year. [[Harris Corporation]] abandons its AM stereo system and puts its support behind C-QUAM (Harris continues to manufacture C-QUAM equipment today).
* 1985: AM stereo broadcasting officially begins in [[Australia]], with the C-QUAM standard.
* 1988: [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] adopt C-QUAM as their standard for AM stereo.
* 1992: [[Japan]] adopts C-QUAM as its standard for AM stereo.
* 1993: The FCC makes C-QUAM the AM stereo standard for stations in the U.S., and also grants "stereo preference" for radio stations requesting to move to the [[AM expanded band]] (1610–1700&amp;nbsp;kHz), although such stations have never actually been required to transmit in stereo.
* 1993: The [[AMAX]] certification program begins. This was to set an official manufacturing standard for high-quality AM radio receivers, with a wider audio bandwidth for higher fidelity reception of strong signals, and optionally C-QUAM AM stereo. Despite the availability of AMAX receivers from companies like [[Sony]], [[General Electric]], [[Denon]], and AMAX-certified car radios from the domestic and Japanese automakers, most electronics manufacturers did not wish to implement the more costly AMAX [[tuner (radio)|tuner]] design in their radios, so most AM radios today remain in mono with limited fidelity.
* 2006 to present: AM stereo gains new life through the support for C-QUAM decoding in most receivers designed for [[HD Radio]].{{clarify|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- other articles say HD Radio and C-QUAM are mutually incompatible. --&gt;  These new digital radios receive AM stereo signals, although the AM transmitters are now limited to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz audio bandwidth and the HD receivers flip Left and Right channels in decoding C-QUAM stereo.

==Broadcasting systems==
The Magnavox PMX, Harris Corporation V-CPM, and Motorola C-QUAM (Compatible—Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) were all based around modulating the phase and amplitude of the carrier, placing the stereo information in the phase modulated portion, while the standard mono (L+R) information is in the amplitude modulation. The systems all did this in similar (but not completely compatible) ways. The original Harris Corporation system was later changed to match the Motorola C-QUAM pilot tone for indicating the station was in stereo, thus making it compatible with all C-QUAM receivers.

===Harris System===
This system, known as V-CPM for Variable Angle Compatible Phase Multiplex, was developed by [[Harris Corporation]], a major manufacturer of radio/TV transmitters. It incorporated a left minus right component which was frequency modulated by about 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. Harris is the successor to the pioneer Gates radio line, which has changed its name in 2014 to Gates-Air. The Harris system eventually changed their pilot tone to be compatible with C-QUAM, after C-QUAM became the more popular and eventually, the FCC approved standard. [[CKLW (AM)|CKLW]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]], [[Canada]] (also serving nearby [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]) was among the first stations to broadcast in Harris AM stereo. The Harris system is currently no longer used in its original form.

===Magnavox System===
This system was developed by electronics manufacturer, [[Magnavox]]. It is a [[phase modulation]] system. It was initially declared the AM stereo standard by the FCC in 1980, but the FCC later declared that stations were free to choose any system. As with the Harris system, it was popular in the 1980s, but most stations stopped broadcasting in stereo, or downgraded to the C-QUAM system as time went on. 1190 [[WOWO (AM)|WOWO]] in [[Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]] was the (then) 50,000-watt clear channel Magnavox flagship station.

===Motorola C-QUAM===
[[C-QUAM]] was developed and promoted primarily by Motorola, a longtime manufacturer of two-way radio equipment. It became the dominant system by the late 1980s, and was declared the official standard by the FCC in 1993. While many stations in the USA have since discontinued broadcasting in stereo, many still have the necessary equipment to do so. C-QUAM is still popular in other parts of the world, such as [[Canada]], [[Japan]], and [[Australia]] which it was declared the official standard.

QUAM uses [[quadrature phase]] and [[amplitude modulation]]: the phase of the audio is rotated ahead or behind the carrier and the amplitude of each phase is also changed; thus giving 16 points for reference (used also in dialup modems to get past the 9,600 bit/s limit on analog lines). The QUAM signal (left minus right, or "L-R", information) is then phase modulated on the transmitter (the QUAM exciter replaced the crystal in the AM transmitter) and the left plus right (or "L+R") still modulated the transmitter as it had in the past. C-QUAM is a modified QUAM and thus called "compatible" (the "C-" in "C-QUAM").

C-QUAM had been long criticized by the Kahn-Hazeltine system's creator, Leonard Kahn as being inferior to his system. First generation C-QUAM receivers suffered from "platform motion" effects when listening to stations received via [[skywave]]. Later improvements by Motorola minimized the platform motion effect and increased audio quality and stereo separation, especially on [[AMAX]]-certified receivers in the 1990s.

===Kahn-Hazeltine===
The Kahn-Hazeltine system also called [[Independent sideband|ISB]] was developed by American engineer [[Leonard R. Kahn]] and the [[Hazeltine Corporation]]. This system used an entirely different principle—using independently modulated upper and lower sidebands. While a station using the system would sound best with proper decoding, it was also possible to use two standard AM radios (one tuned above and the other below the primary carrier) to achieve the stereophonic effect, although with poor stereo separation and fidelity compared to a proper Kahn system AM stereo receiver. One of the best known stations to use the Kahn system was 890/[[WLS (AM)|WLS]], Chicago. WLS still transmits in AM stereo today but uses the Motorola C-QUAM system instead.

However, the Kahn system suffered from lower stereo separation above 5&amp;nbsp;kHz (reaching none at 7&amp;nbsp;kHz whereas FM stereo has 40&amp;nbsp;dB or more separation at 15&amp;nbsp;kHz) and the [[radio antenna]] array on directional AM (common on a lot of nighttime and some daytime stations) had to have a flat response across the entire 20&amp;nbsp;kHz AM channel. If the array had a higher reactance value (leading to a higher [[Standing wave ratio]]) on one side of the frequency vs the other, it would affect the audio response of that channel and thus the stereo signal would be affected. Also, Kahn refused to license any radio receivers manufacturers with his design, although multi-system receivers were manufactured by various companies such as [[Sony]], [[Sansui Electric|Sansui]], and [[Sanyo]], which could receive any of the four AM stereo systems.

Nonetheless, this system remained competitive with C-QUAM into the late 1980s and Kahn was very vocal about its advantages over Motorola's system. Kahn filed a lawsuit claiming that the Motorola system did not meet FCC emission bandwidth specifications, but by that time, C-QUAM had already been declared as the single standard for AM stereo in the USA.

Kahn's AM stereo design was later revamped for monaural use and used in the Power-Side system, in which a decreased signal in one sideband is used to improve coverage and loudness, especially with directional antenna arrays. Power-Side became the basis for [[CAM-D]], Compatible AM Digital, a new digital system being promoted by Leonard Kahn and used on several AM stations.

Kahn receiver chips have also been used as an inexpensive method for providing high frequency ([[world band]]) receivers with synchronous detection technology.

===Belar System===
The Belar system was used in limited number of stations, such as [[WJR]]. The Belar system, originally designed by [[RCA]] in the 1950s, was a simple FM/AM modulation system,&lt;ref&gt;AM Stereo articles from Radio-Electronics Dec77, Popular-Electronics Dec78, and Popular-Electronics Aug80 [http://www.amstzone.org/RE77,PE78,PE80-AM_Stereo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; with an attenuated L-R signal frequency modulating the carrier (with a 400&amp;nbsp;µs pre-emphasis) in the extent of +/- 320&amp;nbsp;Hz around the center frequency, and the L+R doing the normal "high level" AM modulation (usually referred to as [[Amplitude modulation#High-level generation|plate modulation]] in transmitters using a tube in the final stage, where the audio is applied to the plate voltage of the tube; in solid state transmitters, various different techniques are available that are more efficient at lower power levels). The Belar system (by the company of the same name) was dropped due to issues with its design though it was much easier to implement than the other systems. It and the Kahn system did not suffer from platform motion (which was a killer for AM stereo at night; platform motion is where the stereo balance would shift from one side to the other and then back to center) but the use of low level frequency modulation did not permit a high separation of L and R channels.

==Adoption in the United States==
In 1975, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) started a series of five-year tests to determine which of the five competing standards would be selected. By the end of the testing period, the Belar system was dropped. In 1980, the FCC announced that the [[Magnavox]] system would become the standard. This announcement was met with harsh criticism and a series of lawsuits. On March 4, 1982, the FCC revoked their endorsement to the Magnavox standard and let the marketplace decide, meaning that all four standards were allowed. After the 1982 decision, many stations implemented one of the four standards. Initially, all systems remained competitive, but by the later 1980s, [[Motorola]] [[C-QUAM]] had a clear majority of stations and receivers. Around this same time, [[Harris Corporation]] dropped their system and instead endorsed C-QUAM. During this time, radio manufactures either made receivers which decoded just one system, or decoded all four. The multiple systems used greatly confused consumers and severely impacted consumer adoption. As a result of this confusion, and the continued growth of the FM band, interest in AM stereo dwindled.

In 1993, the FCC declared Motorola's C-QUAM system the standard. To ensure that all AM stereo receivers maintained the same sound quality, the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] and the [[Electronic Industries Association]] started the [[AMAX]] certification program.

==Global adoption==
In the early 1980s, other countries, most notably [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[Japan]] approved and implemented AM stereo systems. Most governments approved a single standard, usually Motorola's C-QUAM, which greatly reduced confusion and increased user adoption.

Following the launch of the American-owned, ship-based [[pirate radio]] station [[Laser 558]] off the British coast, there were announcements that another such station, provisionally called Stereo Hits 576, would soon follow, using AM stereo on an adjacent frequency to Laser. Nothing ever came of this project and 576&amp;nbsp;kHz was adopted by [[Radio Caroline]] instead.

In many countries, especially those where the AM band is still dominant, AM stereo radios are still manufactured and stations still broadcast stereo signals.

==Current status==
Globally, interest in and use of AM stereo has been declining steadily since the 1990s, as many music stations have continued to move to the FM band. As a result, the vast majority of AM stations broadcast [[Talk radio|news/talk]] or [[Sports radio|sports/sports talk]] formats. Many of the stations that initially implemented AM stereo are [[clear-channel station|clear-channel]] 50,000-watt stations, and are more concerned with listening range than stereo sound (although there is no proof that use of AM stereo affects listening range){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. As a result, these stations still have the necessary equipment to broadcast in stereo, but it is left unused (or converted to [[HD Radio]]). Also, many former AM stereo stations were bought up by broadcasting conglomerates, which generally discourage AM stereo broadcasting. In the United States, most stations currently using AM stereo are small, independently owned and broadcast a variety or music format.

* United States: AM Stereo radio stations in the United States
* Japan: Between 1992 and 1996, 16 commercial broadcasting companies in [[Japan]] adopted C-QUAM because of the narrow Japanese FM band; it covers only 14&amp;nbsp;MHz (76-90&amp;nbsp;MHz), as opposed to the 20.5&amp;nbsp;MHz used in the rest of the world (87.5-108&amp;nbsp;MHz). However, it is now quite rare to see AM radios with the stereo function at appliance stores in Japan because of the decline in AM stereo stations and the limited available area, mainly in densely populated areas. 13 of the 16 stereo stations have since reverted to mono, 11 since the start of 2010 ([[:ja:AMステレオ放送]]), leaving only 3 stations broadcasting in stereo.
* Australia: AM stereo was popular in [[Australia]] because AM covers a wide geographic area compared to FM, in addition to the government's adoption of a single standard (Motorola C-QUAM) several years sooner than the USA, and Australia's relatively late adoption of FM (the frequencies in the FM band were originally allocated for TV). As of June 2008 no [[Melbourne]] AM stations broadcast C-QUAM AM stereo. At its peak popularity in the late 1980s the majority of stations did.
* Europe: After some experiments in the 1980s, AM stereo was deemed to be unsuitable for the crowded band conditions and narrow bandwidths associated with AM broadcasting in Europe. However, [[Motorola]] C-QUAM AM stereo remains in use today on a handful of stations in [[Italy]] and [[Greece]].
* Canada: AM stereo was more widely adopted in [[Canada]] than in the USA. This may have been due to the Canadian government's decision to use a single standard, and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) licensing stations by format and their hit/non-hit rules for FM (hence, more music stations on AM). However, unlike in the USA, some former AM stereo stations have moved to the FM band and left the AM band altogether instead of simply reverting to mono.
* Brazil: AM stereo was considered in the 90s, however it never was implemented because of economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtoncbraga.com.br/index.php/artigos/49-curiosidades/6246-tel053.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surround sound==
On February 26, 2010, [[KCJJ]] (AM 1630) in Coralville, Iowa, aired a four-hour [[quadraphonic]] radio broadcast of the Robb Spewak show. The show spotlighted music from the quadraphonic era on the 40th anniversary of the format's release in America and was engineered by Tab Patterson. All the music was from discrete 4-channel tapes, then encoded into [[Dolby Pro Logic#Dolby Pro Logic II|Dolby Pro-Logic II]] and transmitted using their stereo C-QUAM transmitter.

==Decline in use==
Radio stations around the world are converting to various systems of [[digital radio]], such as [[Digital Radio Mondiale]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] or [[HD Radio]] (in the United States). Some of these digital radio systems, most notably [[HD Radio]] have "hybrid modes" which let a station broadcast a standard AM signal along with the digital information. While these transmission modes allow standard AM, they are not compatible with any AM stereo system (meaning both cannot be broadcast at the same time).

Digital AM broadcasting systems, such as HD Radio have been criticized by supporters of AM stereo{{who|date=February 2014}} as sounding "harsh" and "artificial", but supporters of Digital systems argue that the extended frequency response, increased dynamic range, lack of noise and lower distortion make up for the compression artifacts. However, HD Radio also increases adjacent channel noise due to the digital sidebands, which pose serious problems for nighttime broadcasts. Some have proposed to use HD Radio in the daytime and AM stereo at night. Many HD radios are based on a common [[chipset]] that decodes C-QUAM.{{clarify|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- other articles say HD Radio and C-QUAM are mutually incompatible. --&gt;

The '''American Bar Foundation''' ('''ABF''') is an independent, [[nonprofit]] national [[research institute]] established in 1952 and located in [[Chicago]]. It conducts objective [[empirical]] research on [[law]] and legal institutions. This program of sociolegal research is conducted by an interdisciplinary staff of Research Faculty trained in such diverse fields as [[law]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[history]], and [[anthropology]].  

The ABF was initially located in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] on the [[University of Chicago]] campus. It subsequently moved to the American Bar Association building in [[downtown Chicago]], and remained there after the ABA departed, now sharing the building with part of the [[Northwestern University]] downtown professional schools.  The most recent directors (beginning in the 1970s) of the ABF were Spencer L. Kimball (also a professor of law at the [[University of Chicago]] and a former dean of the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]]), John P. Heinz (professor at [[Northwestern University School of Law]]), [[Bill Felstiner|William "Bill" Felstiner]], Bryant Garth (now dean of [[Southwestern Law School]]),  Robert Nelson (also a professor in the Department of Sociology, Northwestern University and MacCrate Research Chair in the Legal Professions at the ABF), and current director Ajay Mehrotra (also a professor of law at Northwestern University School of Law).

The American Bar Foundation Research Faculty produces ''[[Law and Social Inquiry]]'' (LSI), a peer-reviewed academic journal that publishes empirical research about law, legal institutions, and legal processes.  LSI currently is published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]].

The American Bar Foundation is a resource for [[lawyers]], [[scholars]], and policy makers who seek analyses of the theory and functioning of law, legal institutions, and the legal profession. The Foundation's work is supported by the American Bar Endowment, by The Fellows of the American Bar Foundation, and by grants for particular research projects from private foundations and government agencies.

In [[phytopathology]], '''antagonism''' refers to the action of any organism that suppress or interfere the normal growth and activity of a plant pathogen, such as the main parts of [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[fungus|fungi]].

These organisms can be used for [[pest control]] and are referred to as [[biological pest control|biological control agents]]. They may be [[predator]]s, [[parasite]]s, [[parasitoid]]s, or [[pathogen]]s that attack harmful insect, weed or plant disease or any other organism in its vicinity. The inhibitory substance is highly specific in its action affecting only a specific species. Many soil microorganisms are antagonistic. They secrete a potent [[enzyme]] which destroys other cells by digesting their cell walls and degrade the cellular material as well as released protoplasmic material serves as a nutrient for the inhibitor organism for example ''[[Aspergillus]]'' has an antagonistic effect on ''[[Penicillium]]'' and ''[[Cladosporium]]''. ''[[Trichoderma]]'' has an effect on [[actinomycetes]]. ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' show antagonism on ''Cladosporium''.

== Mechanism ==
* Antibiosis example- enzymes, toxins, antibiotics.
* Direct parasitism example- biotrophic or necrotrophic.
* competition example- for nutrients.
* Induced resistance (indirect).

'''Art''' is a diverse range of [[human behavior|human activities]] in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts ([[artworks]]), expressing the author's [[imagination|imaginative]], [[Concept|conceptual]] [[idea]], or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/art |title=Art: definition |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/art |title=art |publisher=Merriam-Websters Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. 

The three classical branches of art are [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=q8rvdsxGokwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vasari+lives+of+painters,+sculptors+and+painters&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTta2zrLreAhUGbBoKHdSoDUIQ6AEIKDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Music, theatre, film, dance, and other [[performing arts]], as well as literature and other media such as [[interactive media]], are included in a broader definition  of [[the arts]].&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Art, n. 1". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com. (Accessed 26 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 17th century, ''art'' referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from [[craft]]s or [[sciences]]. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or [[applied arts]].

Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Definitions of Art |author=Stephen Davies |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8014-9794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Artworks: Definition, Meaning, Value |author=Robert Stecker |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-271-01596-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theories of Art Today |editor=Noël Carroll |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-299-16354-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |archive-date=27 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427192624/http://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |title=What Is Art? |author=Dr. Robert J.

==Creative art and fine art==
{{wide image|Wang Ximeng - A Thousand Li of River (Bridge).jpg|1250px|Works of art can tell stories or simply express an aesthetic truth or feeling. Panorama of a section of ''A Thousand Li of Mountains and Rivers'', a 12th-century painting by Song dynasty artist [[Wang Ximeng]].}}

In the perspective of the history of art,&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]]; however, some theories restrict the concept of "artistic works" to modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James "Art History and Images That Are Not Art", ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (December 1995), with previous bibliography. "Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value". 553&lt;/ref&gt; One early sense of the definition of ''art'' is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft," as associated with words such as "artisan." English words derived from this meaning include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', ''medical arts'', and ''military arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].
[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|upright|20th-century Rwandan bottle. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]

Over time, [[Philosopher|philosophers]] like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]] and [[Kant]], among others, questioned the meaning of art.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 73-96&lt;/ref&gt; Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a–c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 40-72&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|mimetic]] or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, and more recent, sense of the word ''art'' as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' emerged in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;120&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or ''finer'' work of art.

Within this latter sense, the word ''art'' may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as [[Kant]], the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 287-326&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

The nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p. 1, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-29706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Levinson5/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.&lt;ref name="Levinson5"&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R.G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp. 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Kant]], and was developed in the early twentieth century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], "The Origin of the Work of Art", in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001). See also [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], "Cézanne's Doubt" in ''The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader'', Galen Johnson and Michael Smith (eds), (Northwestern University Press, 1994) and [[John Russon]], ''Bearing Witness to Epiphany'', (State University of New York Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] has offered an [[institutional theory of art]] that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the [[art world]]" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation".&lt;ref&gt;Kennick, William ed, and W. E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy: readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, p. 89. {{ISBN|0-312-05391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Shiner has described fine art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old."&lt;ref&gt;Shiner 2003. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]''Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 3. {{ISBN|978-0-226-75342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art may be characterized in terms of [[mimesis]] (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gombrich, Ernst. |url=http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |title=Press statement on The Story of Art |accessdate=18 November 2008 |year=2005 |website=The Gombrich Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006212330/http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |archivedate=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Olmec]]. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.83, pp.75-115 pp.132-141, pp.147-155, p.163, p.627.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.86-89, pp.135-141, p.143, p.179, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.&lt;ref name="Nichols2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Nichols|title=Renaissance Art: A Beginner's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzMRpHo0QHUC|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-178-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tugra Mahmuds II.gif|right|thumb|The stylized signature of [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was written in [[Islamic calligraphy]]. It reads "Mahmud Khan son of Abdulhamid is forever victorious".]]
[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan Panorama - Grande Mosquée de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, also called the Mosque of Uqba, is one of the finest, most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques.

Taylor &amp; Francis. 1983. p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the east, [[Islamic art]]'s rejection of [[iconography]] led to emphasis on [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 634-635&lt;/ref&gt;), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, [[Tang dynasty]] paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but [[Ming dynasty]] paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition.&lt;ref name="Watson1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Watson|title=The Arts of China 900-1620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-v5jUKaCxYC|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09835-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. [[Woodblock printing]] became important in Japan after the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.155, p.530.&lt;/ref&gt;

The western [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as [[William Blake|Blake]]'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer,&lt;ref name="Moore2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Moore|title=Propaganda Prints: A History of Art in the Service of Social and Political Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0KAlsQ2Yj4C|date=6 August 2010|publisher=A&amp;amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-0591-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s propagandistic paintings. This led to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of [[Goethe]]. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as [[academic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[fauvism]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.394-395, pp.519-527, pp. 573-575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of Enlightenment An Anthology Prepared for the Enlightenment Book Club|url=http://www.rosenfels.org/The_Age_Of_Enlightenment_Anthology.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2018|pages=1–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of twentieth-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of [[impressionism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, [[African art|African sculptures]] were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New York Times Book Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwEjAQAAMAAJ|volume=1, 84|year=1979|publisher=New York Times Company|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism]], the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. [[Theodor W. Adorno]] said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with [[skepticism]] and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.&lt;ref name="Sangeeta2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Sangeeta|title=Development of Modern Art Criticism in India after Independence: Post Independence Indian Art Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqs4DwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=6 October 2017|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-947697-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]'', [[Martin Heidegger]], a German philosopher and a seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which "that which is" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed.

It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., [[figurae]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monelle |first1=Raymond |title=Linguistics and Semiotics in Music |date=3 January 1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-3718652099 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMtQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;pg=PA202#q=figurae |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Color theory|color]], [[Contour drawing|contour]], [[Fourth dimension in art|dimension]], [[List of art mediums|medium]], [[melody]], [[Negative space|space]], [[Texture (painting)|texture]], and [[Lightness|value]]. Form may also include [[Visual design elements and principles#Principles of design|visual design principles]], such as arrangement, [[Formal balance|balance]], [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], [[harmony]], [[Hierarchical proportion|proportion]], [[Principles of grouping|proximity]], and rhythm.&lt;ref name="Belton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Belton |first1=Dr. Robert J. |title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook |chapter=The Elements of Art |date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Extreme [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Min |last2=Deng |first2=Guifang |title=Against Zangwill's Extreme Formalism About Inorganic Nature |journal=Philosophia |date=2 December 2014 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=249–57 |doi=10.1007/s11406-014-9575-1 |url=http://xy.cmsproxy.sysu.edu.cn/pub/hkmacc/docs/2014-12/20141215194213014875.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content – i.e., [[denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s – while others prefer terms like [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[Importance|significance]].&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Extreme Intentionalism holds that [[authorial intent]] plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1=Paisley |title=Intentionalism in Aesthetics |journal=New Literary History |date=1998 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=831–46 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1998.0042 |url=http://works.bepress.com/paisley_livingston/67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munk |first1=Eduard |last2=Beck |first2=Charles |last3=Felton |first3=Cornelius Conway |title=The Metres of the Greeks and Romans |date=1844 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxRgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content as the artist's experience of that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tolstoy |first1=Leo |title=What is Art? |date=1899 |publisher=Crowell |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the composition of [[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]] is partly borrowed from the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. As evidenced by the title, the subject is [[Napoleon]], and the content is [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s representation of Napoleon as "Emperor-God beyond time and space".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is "socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Finally, the developing theory of [[post-structuralism]] studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Melahat Küçükarslan |last1=Emiroğlu |first2=Fitnat Cimşit |last2=Koş |title=Design Semiotics and Post-Structuralism |conference=12th World Congress of Semiotics |date=16–20 September 2014 |location=New Bulgarian University |url=http://semio2014.org/en/design-semiotics-and-post-structuralism |access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. [[Art criticism]] continues to grow and develop alongside art.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.&lt;ref&gt;Breskin, Vladimir, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110901145415/http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf "Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art"], ''Signs – International Journal of Semiotics'' 3, pp. 1–28, 2010. {{ISSN|1902-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the [[Wikt:epithet|epithet]] "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for [[Leonardo da Vinci]], art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated London News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oc-AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=July 1872|publisher=Illustrated London News &amp; Sketch Limited|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt]]'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.&lt;ref name="NewtonNeil1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Newton|author2=William Neil|title=2000 Years of Christian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsSfAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of [[John Singer Sargent]] were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency,&lt;ref name="RichardsGjertson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kirk Richards|author2=Stephen Gjertson|title=For glory and for beauty: practical perspectives on Christianity and the visual arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaBGAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Classical Realism|isbn=978-0-9636180-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, [[Pablo Picasso]], was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.&lt;ref name="Leslie2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Leslie|title=Pablo Picasso: A Modern Master|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE8Es-9j3e0C|date=30 December 2005|publisher=New Line Books|isbn=978-1-59764-094-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DillenbergerHandley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Dillenberger|author2=John Handley|title=The Religious Art of Pablo Picasso|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uglDQAAQBAJ|date=17 April 2014|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27629-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art]] occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred S. Kleiner|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK_jTggtYl8C|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57364-7|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'', or [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Luke|title=Damien Hirst's Shark: Nature, Capitalism and the Sublime|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/luke-white-damien-hirsts-shark-nature-capitalism-and-the-sublime-r1136828|publisher=Tate|accessdate=26 May 2018|language=en|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating ''hands-on'' works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Belle Assemblée|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pucAAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|volume=V|year=1808|publisher=J.

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss).&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Schiuma|title=The Value of Arts for Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wyboE8aWDcC|date=19 May 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49665-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-motivated functions ===
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;
# '''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].''' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. - Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Experience of the mysterious.''' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. – Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. "The World as I See It". http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Expression of the imagination.''' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else—something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. - Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.''' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. - Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Motivated functions ===
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephanidis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constantine Stephanidis|title=HCI International 2011 Posters' Extended Abstracts: International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9-14, 2011,Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qble3WYcH0cC|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-22094-4|pages=529–533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Communication.''' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. – Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. ''The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science''. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as entertainment'''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.&lt;ref name="Resources2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Digital Arts and Entertainment: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BaXBQAAQBAJ|date=30 June 2014|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6115-8|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.''' One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others—are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. – André Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;André Breton, ''Surrealist Manifesto'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as a "free zone"''', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as "a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.": see {{Cite book |title=Postdigitale |url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm |year=2008 |author=Maurizio Bolognini |publisher=Carocci |location=Rome |isbn=978-88-430-4739-0}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.''' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|upright=3.2|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
# '''Art for social causes.''' Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of [[autism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Trotter |first=Jeramia |title=RiverKings raising autism awareness with art |url=http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WMC tv |date=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053732/http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |archivedate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Art exhibit aims to raise awareness of autism |url=http://www.newsminer.com/article_1a9b7e33-6ca0-56a5-89f3-c9c0798815a2.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Daily News-Miner |date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anchorage art exhibit to raise awareness about autism |url=http://dhss.alaska.gov/News/Documents/press/2011/Anchorage_art_exhibit_autism_PR033111.pdf |publisher=Alaska Department of Health and Social Services |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ruhl |first=Ashleigh |title=Photographer Seeks Subjects To Help Raise Cancer Awareness |url=http://www.gazettes.com/lifestyle/arts_and_entertainment/photographer-seeks-subjects-to-help-raise-cancer-awareness/article_10291db8-7614-11e2-be53-0019bb2963f4.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Gazettes |date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bra art raising awareness for breast cancer |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/videos/news/national/bra-art-raising-awareness-for-breast-cancer/vgBSm/ |accessdate=22 January 2015 |newspaper=The Palm Beach Post |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flynn |first=Marella |title=October art walk aims to raise money, awareness for breast cancer |url=http://gargoyle.flagler.edu/2007/10/october-art-walk-aims-to-raise-money-awareness-for-breast-cancer/ |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Flagler College Gargoyle |date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[human trafficking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Students get creative in the fight against human trafficking |url=http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness#.USb6vFeIqAg |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WDTN Channel 2 News |date=26 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630141018/http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness%23.UdA8P33LfK5 |archivedate=June 30, 2013}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Looking to raise awareness at ArtPrize |url=http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WWMT, Newschannel 3 |date=10 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006075346/http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |archivedate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SciCafe – Art/Sci Collision: Raising Ocean Conservation Awareness |url=http://www.amnh.org/calendar/scicafe-art-sci-collision-raising-ocean-conservation-awareness |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; human rights in [[Darfur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SMU students raise awareness with 'Art for Darfur' |url=http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |accessdate=21 February 2003 |newspaper=SMU News Release |date=4 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130403085335/http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |archivedate=3 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; murdered and missing Aboriginal women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Donnelly |first=Greg |title=Red dress art project to raise awareness of murdered and missing Aboriginal women |url=http://www.globaltvedmonton.com/red+dress+art+project+to+raise+awareness+of+murdered+and+missing+aboriginal+women/6442594504/story.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Global Edmonton |date=3 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; elder abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raising elder abuse awareness through intergenerational art |url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |publisher=Human Resources and Skills Development Canada |accessdate=21 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122162638/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mathema |first=Paavan |title=Trash to treasure: Turning Mt.

# '''Art for psychological and healing purposes.''' Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.&lt;ref name="Hogan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Hogan|title=Healing Arts: The History of Art Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzUuna6LPBIC|year=2001|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-799-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.''' Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art as a fitness indicator.''' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. "Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology" in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 161-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the [[ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a [[social elite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceramics of the Indigenous Peoples of South America: Studies of Production and Exchange using INAA|url=https://core.tdar.org/collection/58128/ceramics-of-the-indigenous-peoples-of-south-america-studies-of-production-and-exchange-using-inaa|website=core.tdar.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as [[Molding (process)|moulds]] made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality [[Ancient Roman pottery]] and Greek [[Tanagra figurine]]s to a very wide market. [[Cylinder seal]]s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref name="Kipfer2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Ann Kipfer|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C|date=30 April 2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-46158-3|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[coin]]s were widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Coins as Works of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34jbjgEACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1960|publisher=Museum Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when [[printmaking]] began with small [[woodcut]]s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by [[peasant]]s who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations.&lt;ref name="Tucker2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Hugo Tucker|title=Forms of the "medieval" in the "Renaissance": A Multidisciplinary Exploration of a Cultural Continuum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfbNzcqgYM4C|year=2000|publisher=Rookwood Press|isbn=978-1-886365-20-9|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular prints]] of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.&lt;ref name="Griffiths1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antony Griffiths|title=Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbxFOR8ujlYC|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20714-1|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public art|Public buildings and monuments]], secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. [[Egyptian temple]]s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.&lt;ref name="Vörös2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Győző Vörös|title=Egyptian Temple Architecture: 100 Years of Hungarian Excavations in Egypt, 1907-2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StEyE9jkMHEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-963-662-084-4|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the [[Palace of Versailles]], where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.&lt;ref name="Waldie1839"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Waldie|title=The Select Circulating Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBs7AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1839|publisher=A.

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the [[Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris|Orleans Collection]] mostly housed in a wing of the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="MeyerSavoy2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Meyer|author2=Benedicte Savoy|title=The Museum Is Open: Towards a Transnational History of Museums 1750-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhroBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=1 January 2014|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-029882-6|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British [[Royal Collection]] remains distinct, but large donations such as the [[Old Royal Library]] were made from it to the [[British Museum]], established in 1753. The [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before.&lt;ref name="Fossi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gloria Fossi|title=The Uffizi: The Official Guide : All of the Works|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYUh_6F-hc8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1999|publisher=Giunti Editore|isbn=978-88-09-01487-9|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building now occupied by the [[Prado]] in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in [[Vienna]], Munich and other capitals. The opening of the [[Musée du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Access to Art in Paris: A Documentary History from the Middle Ages to 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpD9NgeQozEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04434-7|pages=281–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. ([[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, for example, was created by [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.&lt;ref name="Findlay2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Findlay|title=The Value of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6jJ5FvdLjcC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2012|publisher=Prestel Verlag|isbn=978-3-641-08342-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Performance by [[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Everyone an artist – On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism'']]

There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys |journal=ArtForum |date=December 1969 |first=Willoughby |last=Sharp |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=45 |id= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as [[performance art]], [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object."&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, Anne: ''New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality'', p. 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mia |last=Fineman |title=YouTube for Artists The best places to find video art online. |date=21 March 2007 |publisher= |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2162382/ |work=Slate |pages= |accessdate=3 August 2007 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. "With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: ''Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980'', p. 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:JEAN LOUIS THÉODORE GÉRICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'', ''circa'' 1820]]

Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. [[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public. The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The ''Last Judgment'']] by [[Michelangelo]] was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of [[decorum]] through nudity and the [[Apollo]]-like pose of Christ.&lt;ref name="McCue2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maureen McCue|title=British Romanticism and the Reception of Italian Old Master Art, 1793-1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW43DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-17148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickerson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela K.

The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of [[Romanticism]], and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the [[nude]] woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world.&lt;ref name="RuprechtTaiana1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvina Ruprecht|author2=Cecilia Taiana|title=Reordering of Culture: Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada in the Hood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onoI0AI-JJYC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 November 1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-88629-269-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stout2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C.

The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) used arresting [[cubism|cubist]] techniques and stark [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic oils]], to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. [[Leon Golub]]'s ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.&lt;ref name="ChapmanCiment2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Chapman|author2=James Ciment|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints and Voices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XO9nBwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=17 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47351-0|page=594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Arthur Brown|title=Noah's Other Son: Bridging the Gap Between the Bible and the Qur'an|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjbUAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 October 2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2996-4|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of [[Realism (arts)|realism or truth to nature]] and the [[Idealism|ideal]]; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries.  This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art.  The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth". [[John Ruskin|Ruskin, John]]. ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, ''Essay VI''. pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Modernism===
[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1930 - Mondrian Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow.jpg|thumb|''Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow'' (1930) by [[Piet Mondrian]] (Dutch, 1872–1944)]]
The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; New York, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-06700-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]]. [[Clement Greenberg]]'s 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself".&lt;ref name = "Frascina"&gt;''Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology''. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:
{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting—the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment—were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.&lt;ref name = "Frascina" /&gt;}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as [[Michael Fried]], [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Clark]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Linda Nochlin]] and [[Griselda Pollock]] among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref name="Harris2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan P. Harris|title=Writing Back to Modern Art: After Greenberg, Fried, and Clark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TzAIu3LziIC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-32429-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kenneth Holt|title=The Search for Aesthetic Meaning in the Visual Arts: The Need for the Aesthetic Tradition in Contemporary Art Theory and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWedB7SA-KMC|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-89789-773-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pop art]]ists like [[Andy Warhol]] became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the [[art world]]. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.&lt;ref name="Gemünden1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerd Gemünden|title=Framed Visions: Popular Culture, Americanization, and the Contemporary German and Austrian Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mpfn_pue34C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08560-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Yorker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BcnAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2004|publisher=F-R Publishing Corporation|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.&lt;ref name="Duchamp Interview Clip"&gt;{{YouTube|haon2DXWvLk|Duchamp Two Statements}}{{Dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. Fine Art. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, [[horsemanship]], [[geometry]], [[carpentry]], [[prophecy]], and farming etc.&lt;ref name="BurgueteLam2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maria Burguete|author2=Lui Lam|title=Arts: A Science Matter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKmND2ImrGUC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4324-93-9|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Criticism and the "intentional fallacy"===
Following Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.&lt;ref name="Waugh2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Waugh|title=Literary Theory and Criticism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LXMA_7Ko9YC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929133-5|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colebrook1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Colebrook|title=New Literary Histories: New Historicism and Contemporary Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT-8AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4987-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.&lt;ref name="Roholt2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tiger C. Roholt|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6aAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=10 October 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3246-8|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hick2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Darren Hudson Hick|title=Introducing Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_S4DgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=24 August 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-350-00691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;Gaut and Livingston, ''The Creation of Art'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==="Linguistic turn" and its debate===
The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the "innocent eye debate", and generally referred to as the structuralism-[[poststructuralism]] debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled "The Innocent Eye" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 [[John Locke lectures]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist [[Roger Sperry]] who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, "Feasible Aesthetic Formalism", ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification disputes==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit. Stieglitz used a backdrop of ''The Warriors'' by [[Marsden Hartley]] to photograph the urinal. The exhibition entry tag can be clearly seen.&lt;ref name="Tomkins, p. 186"&gt;Tomkins, ''Duchamp: A Biography'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included [[cubist]] and [[impressionist]] paintings, [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', the movies, superlative imitations of [[J. S. G. Boggs|banknotes]], [[conceptual art]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deborah Solomon |title=2003: the 3rd Annual Year in Ideas: Video Game Art |newspaper=The New York Times Magazine |date=14 December 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-video-game-art.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin. ''Contemporary Art and the Home''. Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-85973-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Arthur Danto]], suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis [http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm "Tribal Art"] in ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]], edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur. "Artifact and Art" in ''Art/Artifact'', edited by Susan Vogel. New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-art]] is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art;&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; it is term associated with [[Dada]]ism and attributed to [[Marcel Duchamp]] just before World War I,&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=571 "Glossary: Anti-art"], [[Tate]].

Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the [[decorative arts]], or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glancey |first1=Jonathan |title=Is advertising art? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/is-advertising-art-1593252.html |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=The Independent |date=26 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value judgment===
[[File:Aboriginal hollow log tomb.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aboriginal hollow log tombs. National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia]]

Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist),&lt;ref name="Potts2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Potts|title=The Kahuna Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uu6lPR6EPQC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=8 August 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-8689-2|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd&amp;nbsp;of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.&lt;ref name="AddisonBurgess2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Addison|author2=Lesley Burgess|title=Debates in Art and Design Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOY10gcBeP8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=28 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-61887-8|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FergusonMansbach2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yale H. Ferguson|authorlink2=Richard W. Mansbach|author2=Richard W. Mansbach|title=A World of Polities: Essays on Global Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=adOTAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=20 March 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-98149-5|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Gordon |title=Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An association can be viewed as a real, integrated entity shaped either by species interactions or by similar habitat requirements, or it can be viewed as merely a common point along a continuum. The former view was championed by American ecologist [[Frederic Clements]], who viewed the association as a whole that was more than the sum of its parts, and by [[Josias Braun-Blanquet]], a Swiss-born phytosociologist. On the other end of the argument was American ecologist [[Henry Gleason]],&lt;ref name = "Barbour1999"/&gt;{{rp|182–183}} who saw these groupings of plant species as a coincidence produced by the "fluctuation and fortuitous immigration of plants, and an equally fluctuating and variable environment".&lt;ref&gt;Gleason (1935), cited in Barbour ''et al.'' 1999, p. 184{{verify source|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Gleason, H.A. |year=1926 |title=The Individualistic Concept of the Plant Association |journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=7–26 |jstor=2479933 |doi=10.2307/2479933}} p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saieh Hall for Economics.jpg|thumb|Saieh Hall for Economics, location of the Becker Friedman Institute]]
The '''Gary Becker Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics'''&lt;ref name="bfiannounce"&gt;{{cite web |date=June 17, 2011 |title=Becker Friedman Institute established at University of Chicago |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2011/06/17/becker-friedman-institute-established-university-chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; was established at the [[University of Chicago]] in June 2011 as a collaborative, cross-disciplinary center for research in economics. It brought together the activities of two formerly independent economic research centers at the University:  the [[Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics]] and the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory, founded by Richard O. Ryan, MBA ’66.

The institute is named for two globally influential economists: [[Gary S. Becker]] (1930–2014) and his mentor,  [[Milton Friedman]] (1912-2006), both winners of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. While they pursued different scholarly paths, Becker and Friedman shared a fundamental belief that economics, grounded in empirical research, is a powerful tool to understand human behavior. While Friedman is known for his lasting contributions to macroeconomics and monetary economics, Becker is recognized for extending microeconomic analysis to a wide range of fields and topics.

A collaboration of the University of Chicago [[Booth School of Business]], [[University of Chicago Law School|Law School]], [http://economics.uchicago.edu/ Department of Economics], and the [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies|Harris School for Public Policy]], the Institute builds bridges across disciplines and subfields of economics. Its research conferences, workshops, and initiatives bring economists and scholars from related fields together to share perspectives and refine ideas. The institute also sponsors an active visiting scholars program and offers programs and support for students and promising young researchers. 

The institute supports research initiatives in traditional Chicago strengths such as price theory, law and economics, and human capital, as well as topical inquiries into important policy issues such as fiscal imbalance, [[systemic risk]], [[policy uncertainty]], and economics of the family, and newer areas like field experiments in economics.

The institute is cochaired by [[Lars Peter Hansen]], a 2013 Nobel laureate who guides the intellectual agenda, and [[Kevin M. Murphy]], a distinguished microeconomist who focuses on public outreach activities  and development. An [https://bfi.uchicago.edu/about/leadership Institute Research Council] of distinguished faculty from collaborating university units advises the cochairs.

{{about|the conservation biology topic|other uses of "BAP"|BAP (disambiguation)}}

A '''biodiversity action plan''' ('''BAP''') is an internationally recognized program addressing [[threatened species]] and [[habitat]]s and is designed to protect and restore biological systems. The original impetus for these plans derives from the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD). As of 2009, 191 countries have ratified the CBD, but only a fraction of these have developed substantive BAP documents.

The principal elements of a BAP typically include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glowka |first=Lyle |author2=Françoise Burhenne-Guilmin |author3=Hugh Synge |author4=Jeffrey A. McNeely |author5=Lothar Gündling |title=Guide to the Convention on Biodiversity |year=1994 |publisher=IUCN |isbn=2-8317-0222-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a) preparing inventories of biological information for selected species or habitats; (b) assessing the [[conservation status]] of species within specified [[ecosystem]]s; (c) creation of targets for [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Restoration ecology|restoration]]; and (d) establishing budgets, timelines and institutional partnerships for implementing the BAP.

==Species plans==
[[File:Lightmatter snowleopard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Snow leopard]], Pakistan, an endangered species]]

A fundamental method of engagement to a BAP is thorough documentation regarding individual species, with emphasis upon the population distribution and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] status. This task, while fundamental, is highly daunting, since only an estimated ten percent of the world’s species are believed to have been characterized as of 2006,&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630000000/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of these unknowns being [[fungi]], [[invertebrate]] animals, micro-organisms and plants. For many bird, mammal and reptile species, information is often available in published literature; however, for fungi, invertebrate animals, micro-organisms and many plants, such information may require considerable local data collection. It is also useful to compile time trends of population estimates in order to understand the dynamics of population variability and vulnerability. In some parts of the world complete species inventories are not realistic; for example, in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]], many species are completely undocumented and much of the region has never even been systematically explored by scientists.

A species plan component of a country’s BAP should ideally entail a thorough description of the range, habitat, behaviour, breeding and interaction with other species. Once a determination has been made of conservation status (e.g. [[rare species|rare]], endangered, threatened, vulnerable), a plan can then be created to conserve and restore the species population to target levels. Examples of programmatic protection elements are: habitat restoration; protection of habitat from [[urban development]]; establishment of property ownership; limitations on grazing or other agricultural encroachment into habitat; reduction of [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural practises; outlawing killing or collecting the species; restrictions on pesticide use; and control of other environmental pollution. The plan should also articulate which public and private agencies should implement the protection strategy and indicate budgets available to execute this strategy.

==Habitat plans==
Where a number of threatened species depend upon a specific habitat, it may be appropriate to prepare a habitat protection element of the Biodiversity Action Plan. Examples of such special habitats are: raised acidic bogs of Scotland; [[Waterberg Biosphere]] [[bushveld]] in South Africa; California’s coastal [[wetland]]s; and Sweden’s [[Stora Alvaret]] on the island of [[Öland]]. In this case also, careful inventories of species and also the geographic extent and quality of the habitat must be documented. Then, as with species plans, a program can be created to protect, enhance and/or restore habitat using similar strategies as discussed above under the species plans.

==Specific countries==
Some examples of individual countries which have produced substantive Biodiversity Action Plans follow. In every example the plans concentrate on plants and vertebrate animals, with very little attention to neglected groups such as fungi, invertebrate animals and micro-organisms, even though these are also part of biodiversity. Preparation of a country BAP may cost up to 100 million pounds sterling, with annual maintenance costs roughly ten percent of the initial cost. If plans took into account neglected groups, the cost would be higher. Obviously costs for countries with small geographical area or simplified ecosystems have a much lesser cost. For example, the St. Lucia BAP has been costed in the area of several million pounds sterling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2001| author=Government of St. Lucia| title=National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan of St. Lucia| url=http://www.slubiodiv.org/The_Project/Information/Printed_Materials/NBSAP/nbsap.html| accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061105113956/http://www.slubiodiv.org/The_Project/Information/Printed_Materials/NBSAP/nbsap.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Daintree Rainforest]] in [[Queensland]], Australia]]
Australia has developed a detailed and rigorous Biodiversity Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2011| author=Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council| title=Australia's Biodiversity Conservation Strategy 2010-2030| url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/au/au-nbsap-v2-en.pdf| accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document estimates that the total number of indigenous species may be 560,000, many of which are endemic. A key element of the BAP is protection of the [[Great Barrier Reef]], which is actually in a much higher state of health than most of the world’s [[reef]]s, Australia having one of the highest percentages of treated [[wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=September 2005| author=Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Environment and Heritage| title=Great Barrier Reef Water Quality Protection Plan Annual Report 2004-2005| url=http://www.deh.gov.au/coasts/publications/annual-report/04-05/index.html| accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060822025646/http://www.deh.gov.au/coasts/publications/annual-report/04-05/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however,serious ongoing concerns, particularly in regards to the ongoing negative impact on water quality from land use practices. Also, climate change impact is feared to be significant.

Considerable analysis has been conducted on the [[Sustainable forestry|sustainable]] yield of firewood production, a major threat to [[deforestation]] in most tropical countries. Biological inventory work; assessment of harvesting practices; and computer modeling of the dynamics of treefall, rot and harvest; have been carried out to adduce data on safe harvesting rates. Extensive research has also been conducted on the relation of brush clearance to [[biodiversity]] decline and impact on [[water table]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Glanznig, ''Native Vegetation Clearance, Habitat Loss and Biodiversity Decline: an overview of recent native vegetation clearance in Australia and its implications for biodiversity'', Biodiversity Series, Paper No. 6, Biodiversity Unit, June 1995&lt;/ref&gt; for example, these effects have been analyzed in the [[Toolibin Lake]] wetlands region.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Biodiversity of New Zealand}}
New Zealand has ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity and as part of The New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy and Biodiversity Action Plans are implemented on ten separate themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Dept. of Conservation; Ministry for the Environment| isbn = 978-0-478-21919-7| title = The New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy| location = [Wellington, N.Z.]| date = February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local government and some companies also have their own Biodiversity Action Plan.

===St. Lucia===
The [[St. Lucia]] BAP recognizes impacts of large numbers of tourists to the marine and coastal diversity of the [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufrière]] area of the country. The BAP specifically acknowledges that the [[carrying capacity]] for human use and [[water pollution]] discharge of sensitive reef areas was exceeded by the year 1990. The plan also addresses conservation of the historic island fishing industry. In 1992, several institutions in conjunction with native fishermen to produce a sustainable management plan for fishery resources, embodied in the Soufrière Marine Management Area.

The St. Lucia BAP features significant involvement from the [[University of the West Indies]]. Specific detailed attention is given to three species of threatened marine turtles, to a variety of vulnerable birds and a number of [[pelagic fish]]es and [[cetacean]]s. In terms of [[habitat conservation]] the plan focusses attention on the biologically productive [[mangrove]] swamps and notes that virtually all mangrove areas had already come under national protection by 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Lucia National Marine Fisheries Act of 1984, Section 10'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanzania===
The Tanzania national BAP addresses issues related to sustainable use of [[Lake Manyara]], an extensive freshwater lake, whose usage by humans accelerated in the period 1950 to 1990. The designation of the [[Lake Manyara Biosphere Reserve]] under [[UNESCO]]'s [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]] in 1981 combines conservation of the lake and surrounding high value forests with sustainable use of the wetlands area and simple agriculture. This BAP has united principal lake users in establishing management targets. The biosphere reserve has induced sustainable management of the wetlands, including monitoring [[groundwater]] and the chemistry of the [[escarpment]] water source.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Manyara|url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=URT+01|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Fowlsheughclifftonorthsea.JPG|thumb|[[Fowlsheugh]] cliffs, [[Scotland]], a protected [[seabird]] breeding habitat]]
The [[United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan]] covers not only [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] species associated with lands within the UK, but also marine species and [[Bird migration|migratory]] birds, which spend a limited time in the UK or its offshore waters. The UK plan encompasses "391 Species Action Plans, 45 Habitat Action Plans and 162 Local Biodiversity Action Plans with targeted actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan| url=http://www.ukbap.org.uk/| author=Joint Nature Conservation Committee, London| year=2006| accessdate=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan is noteworthy because of its extensive detail, clarity of endangerment mechanisms, specificity of actions, follow up monitoring program and its inclusion of migrating cetaceans and pelagic birds.

On August 28, 2007, the new Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) [launched in 1997] identified 1,149 species and 65 habitats in the UK that needed conservation and greater protection. The updated list included the [[hedgehog]], [[house sparrow]], [[grass snake]] and the [[garden tiger moth]], while [[otter]]s, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s and [[red squirrel]]s remained in need of habitat protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6965681.stm BBC NEWS, Hedgehogs join 'protection' list]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the European Commission adopted a new strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the EU by 2020, in line with the commitments made at the 10th meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) held in Nagoya, Japan in 2010. In 2012 the UK BAP was succeeded by the 'UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework'.

==== UK BAP website ====
To support the work of the UK BAP, the UK BAP website was created by JNCC in 2001. The website contained information on the BAP process, hosted all relevant documents, and provided news and relevant updates. In March 2011, as part of the UK government’s review of websites, the UK BAP site was ‘closed’, and the core content was migrated into the JNCC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Biodiversity Action Plan| url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=5155| author=Joint Nature Conservation Committee, London| year=2012| accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content from the original UK BAP website has been archived by the [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] as snapshots from various dates (for example, UK ''BAP'': copy March 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Biodiversity Action Plan archive copy| url=http://www.ukbap.org.uk/default.aspx| author=National Archives, London| year=2011| accessdate=2012-10-28| deadurl=yes| archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110303145238/http://www.ukbap.org.uk/default.aspx| archivedate=March 3, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Twenty-six years prior to the international biodiversity convention, the United States had launched a national program to protect threatened species in the form of the 1966 [[Endangered Species Act]]. The legislation created broad authority for analyzing and listing species of concern, and mandated that Species [[Endangered Species Recovery Plan|Recovery Plan]]s be created. Thus, while the USA is an unratified signer of the accord, arguably it has the longest track record and most comprehensive program of species protection of any country. There are about 7000 listed species (e.g. endangered or threatened), of which about half have approved Recovery Plans. While this number of species seems high compared to other countries, the value is rather indicative of the total number of species characterized, which is extremely large.

===Uzbekistan===
Five major divisions of habitat have been identified in [[Uzbekistan]]’s BAP: Wetlands (including reed habitat and man-made [[marsh]]); desert ecosystems (including sandy, stony and clay); [[steppes]]; [[riparian]] ecosystems; and mountain ecosystems. Over 27,000 species have been inventoried in the country, with a high rate of [[endemism]] for fishes and reptiles. Principal threats to biodiversity are related to human activities associated with overpopulation and generally related to agricultural intensification.&lt;ref&gt;''Biodiversity Conservation National Strategy and Action Plan of Republic of Uzbekistan'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Major geographic regions encompassed by the BAP include the [[Aral Sea]] Programme (threatened by long-term drainage and [[salination]], largely for cotton production), the Nuratau Biosphere Reserve, and the Western [[Tien Shan Mountains]] Programme (in conjunction with [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]).

==Criticism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Some developing countries criticize the emphasis of BAPs, because these plans inherently favour consideration of [[wildlife]] protection above food and industrial production, and in some cases may represent an obstacle to population growth. The plans are costly to produce, a fact which makes it difficult for many smaller countries and poorer countries to comply. In terms of the plans themselves, many countries have adopted pro-forma plans including little research and even less in the way of natural resource management. Almost universally, this has resulted in plans which emphasize plants and vertebrate animals, and which overlook fungi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Micheli Guide to Fungal Conservation| url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/micheli.htm| author=International Society for Fungal Conservation| year=2012| accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; invertebrate animals and micro-organisms. With regard to specific world regions, there is a notable lack of substantive participation by most of the Middle Eastern countries and much of Africa, the latter of which may be impeded by economic considerations of plan preparation. Some governments such as the [[European Union]] have diverted the purpose of a biodiversity action plan, and implemented the convention accord by a set of economic development policies with referencing certain ecosystems' protection.

==Biodiversity planning: a new way of thinking==
The definition of biodiversity under the Convention on Biological Diversity now recognises that biodiversity is a combination of ecosystem structure and function, as much as its components e.g. species, habitats and genetic resources. Article 2 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''in addressing the boundless complexity of biological diversity, it has become conventional to think in hierarchical terms, from the genetic material within individual cells, building up through individual organisms, populations, species and communities of species, to the biosphere overall...At the same time, in seeking to make management intervention as efficient as possible, it is essential to take an holistic view of biodiversity and address the interactions that species have with each other and their non-living environment, i.e. to work from an ecological perspective.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The World Summit on Sustainable Development endorsed the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity to ''“achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of [[biodiversity loss]] at the global, regional and national level as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of life on Earth”.'' To achieve this outcome, biodiversity management will depend on maintaining structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, R.F. (1990) Indicators for Monitoring Biodiversity: A Hierarchical Approach. Conservation Biology 4 (4) 355–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity is not singularly definable but may be understood via a series of management principles under BAPs, such as:

1. that biodiversity is conserved across all levels and scales – structure, function and composition are conserved at site, regional, state and national scales. 
2. that examples of all ecological communities are adequately managed for conservation.  
3. ecological communities are managed to support and enhance viable populations of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants and ecological functions.

Biodiversity and wildlife are not the same thing. The traditional focus on threatened species in BAPs is at odds with the principles of biodiversity management because, by the time species become threatened, the processes that maintain biodiversity are already compromised. Individual species are also regarded as generally poor indicators of biodiversity when it comes to actual planning.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmayer, D. B., Manning, A. D., Smith, P. L., Possingham, Hugh P., Fischer, J., Oliver, I., McCarthy, M. A., (2002) The Focal-Species Approach and Landscape Restoration: A Conservation Biology 16(2) 338–345&lt;/ref&gt; A species approach to BAPs only serves to identify and at best, apply a patch to existing problems. Increasingly, biodiversity planners are looking through the lens of [[ecosystem services]]. Critics of biodiversity are often confusing the need to protect species (their intrinsic value) with the need to maintain ecosystem processes, which ultimately maintain human society and do not compromise economic development. Hence, a core principle of biodiversity management, that traditional BAPs overlook, is the need to incorporate cultural, social and economic values in the process.

Modern day BAPs use an analysis of [[ecosystem services]], key ecological process drivers, and use species as one of many indicators of change. They would seek to maintain structure and function by addressing habitat connectivity and resilience and may look at communities of species (threatened or otherwise) as one method of monitoring outcomes. Ultimately, species are the litmus test for biodiversity – viable populations of species can only be expected to exist in relatively intact habitats. However, the rationale behind BAPs is to "conserve and restore" biodiversity. One of the fastest developing areas of management is [http://www.bioenergywiki.net/index.php/Biodiversity_Offsets biodiversity offsets]. The principles are in keeping with ecological impact assessment, which in turn depends on good quality BAPs for evaluation. Contemporary principles of biodiversity management, such as those produced by the [http://www.forest-trends.org/biodiversityoffsetprogram/ Business Biodiversity Offsets Program]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://eianzecology.blogspot.com/2009/03/principles-in-biodiversity-offsets.html|title= Principles in Biodiversity Offsets}}&lt;/ref&gt; are now integral to any plans to manage biodiversity, including the development of BAPs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10874">The '''Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis''' ({{lang-nl|Centraal Planbureau}}, CPB, literal translation: Central Planning Bureau) is a part of the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (Netherlands)|Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy]] of the [[Netherlands]]. Its goal is to deliver economic analysis and forecasts. In this process, the CPB tries to be scientifically sound and up-to-date. The CPB is an independent government agency founded at 15 September 1945 by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Jan Tinbergen]]. On 21 April 1947, it obtained its legal basis. It is located in [[The Hague]], on Bezuidenhoutseweg.

Clients of the CPB are mainly the [[cabinet of the Netherlands]], [[politician]]s and [[List of political parties in the Netherlands|political parties]], [[ministries of the Netherlands]], [[labour union]]s and [[Employers' organization|employers' organisations]]. It also provides reports and advice for [[European Union]] initiatives. One of the government appointed members in the [[Social-Economic Council]] is Chair of the CPB.

==Status==
The CPB is financed by the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Netherlands)|Ministry of Economic Affairs]], but it operates independently. This means it does have a stable income but also does not have to follow the ministry. This combination is the foundation for the unique status of the CPB. The CPB is asked to analyze the election platforms of the major parties for the effects of proposed policies on the budget deficit, unemployment, inflation, income differentials, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Faludi A. 2005. “The Netherlands: A Country with a Soft Spot for Planning.” In Comparative Planning Cultures, edited by Sanyal B. 285–307. New York/London: Routledge. [http://homepage.univie.ac.at/andreas.faludi/2_1%20A%20Country%20with%20a%20Soft%20Spot_Proofs.doc Download]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes a clear guide for voters because of the following advantages:&lt;ref&gt;Bos, F. (2007). The Dutch fiscal framework: History, current practice and the role of the CPB. Current Practice and the Role of the CPB, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1000121 Available at SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The same underlying economics base scenario for the next government's term is used to evaluate each election program. This means that differences in the outcomes between the parties cannot be due to diverging assumptions about economic developments.
*The political parties have to elaborate and explain their proposals in such a way that the CPB is able to analyze them. This means that the parties cannot (on the basis of unfounded optimism) exaggerate the benefits and/or understate the costs of their proposals.
*The policy proposals and their financial consequences are presented in a comparable way. This means that the parties' commitments in the financial and economic sphere can be compared to each other
*The CPB systematically investigates the consistency of the programs. In their initial proposals there maybe some "miscalculations", but such issues are invariably resolved in the detailed discussions between the party in question and the CPB.
*The CPB only includes in its analysis measures which are expected to be technically and legally feasible. If the CPB does not have the in-house expertise to judge the feasibility or the legality of certain proposals, it obtains advice from other institutions.

It is also not uncommon to use the results of the CPB to defend attack or compare the different policies.

Parties voluntarily subject their programs to CPB analysis. However, after the elections of 1986, it became a custom that each major party asked the CPB to forecast the consequences of their election program. In general, the parties seem to worry more about being accused of not wanting to face the economic consequences of their proposals than showing negative results. In 2002, the party "List Pim Fortuyn" did not submit their elections platform, although it came in as second largest party.&lt;ref name=double&gt;Kraan, D. (2005). Typically Dutch. OECD Journal on Budgeting, 4(4), 103-125. [http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/typically-dutch_budget-v4-art23-en DOI:10.1787/16812336]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPB analyzes government budget proposals on its own initiative. The analysis is considered a key document when determining how successful a government is with it policies. The results of this analysis is the basis for the income and expenditure for the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Netherlands)|Ministry of Economic Affairs]]. Through the independent status of the CPS, it is in practice impossible for the Dutch government to use their own models and interpretations of statistics. This forces the government, regardless of who is in power, to stay within the given boundaries and lowers the chance of budget surprises. It also increases the credibility of the ministry estimates.

==Operations==
Twice a year, the CPB publishes a macroeconomic forecast called the "Central Economic Plan (CEP)" and the "Macroeconomic Explorations (MEV)".&lt;ref name="double" /&gt;

The CEP is published in March. It includes the forecast for all the major variables and the current policies. At this point in time, new policies are decided or changed and they have a chance to look at the coming economic situation. For this purpose, it updates the forecasts of the previous MEV about the effects of the policies. A provisional version of the CEP is supplied to the cabinet in January or February, which is used by the minister of finance for the expenditure targets.

The MEV is published in September simultaneously with the publication of government budgets for the following year. It includes forecast for all the major variables and the effects of the new policies since last year. A preliminary, confidential, draft is sent to the government in June. Some adjustments of expenditures and revenues between the draft and the final version can be made.

== Models ==
The CPB uses several models to analyze policies and the economy. Their main model is SAFFIER II, next to this there are several small models which can be attached to SAFFIER II.

In May 2010 the CPB changed from SAFFIER to SAFFIER II. It is an actualized and modernized version of SAFFIER and therefore the name is maintained. The special features of SAFFIER II are that it consist of one model, which has two time frames (quarterly and yearly) which is applied on three states (short term, medium term and long term). The major differences with SAFFIER are:&lt;ref&gt;SAFFIER II: 1 model voor de Nederlandse economie, in 2 hoedanigheden, voor 3 toepassingen (in dutch)[http://www.cpb.nl/sites/default/files/publicaties/download/doc217.pdf Download]&lt;/ref&gt;
*All behavioral equations have been re-estimated
*Some changes on the production function, wage rate, private consumption and export have been made

SAFFIER II is built around a core of 25 equations, the behavioral equations. Then there are 270 heuristics, which are non estimated, easy equations. The major part of the are 1455 identities{{clarify|date= April 2016}}, these are technical equations and definition equations, which do not change over time. The model thus uses a total of 1750 equations. Next to these equations, in the model itself, there are 1250 additional equations, which do not influence outcomes of the model but help analyzing and checking the results.

The models are constructed with high detail and a lot of attention. However, models do not always reflect reality and are based on theories. In the case of CPB models, there is a generally a deviation of up to 1 percentage point. The models are regularly updated to reflect new theoretical insights and needs for outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Don, F., &amp; Verbruggen, J. P.

== International coordination ==
The CPB is a member of the [[EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network]] set up by the EU in September 2015. In addition to the CPB, the Netherlands is also represented by the [[Council of State (Netherlands)|Council of State]].

==Controversy==
In 2011, the CPB conducted a study on the effects of the [[Euro]] for the Netherlands. The results were, among others, published in the book 'Europa in crisis' (Europe in crisis). One of the conclusions of the research was that the [[Euro]] had brought about a week's pay in benefits to the Dutch population (i.e. about 2% income). In an interview in 'De Telegraaf' (the Dutch The Telegraph) in May 2014, the former director [[Coen Teulings]] stated that the study performed under his supervision should be taken with a grain of salt, adding that the economic advantages "aren't very clear".&lt;ref&gt;Telegraaf.nl (2014) (in Dutch): [http://www.telegraaf.nl/dft/22634501/__CPB_overdreef_voordeel_euro__.html CPB overdreef voordeel euro]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centres de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine''' or '''CRNHs''' is a health research organisation based in [[France]]. Its goal is to improve the knowledge on the function properties of food, on metabolism and on human physiology, from basic research to the study of behaviours and their impact on health.  The French territory is now provided with four CRNH having common tools and complementary scientific skills that allow them to develop multi center programs using their platforms and their specific skills.

Nutritional issues are of major importance as populations around the world are considerably changing their diet and lifestyle with large health consequences. Food related-diseases such as [[obesity]], [[Diabetes insipidus|diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]]s, [[malnutrition]] and cancers are becoming major public health issues. 
CRNHs is the network of French research centres for human nutrition. CRNHs has the ambition to provide scientific answers to nutrition related health issues by promoting science and accelerating technology transfer to society. CRNHs aims to improve the knowledge on the functional properties of food and particularly its effects on metabolism and on human physiology by developing multi center programs using its platforms and its specific skills. CRNHs contributes to technology transfer between hospital sectors, research laboratories and industries. CRNHs’ expertise, its platforms for clinical exploration, analysis and data processing offer significant opportunities for collaborations. CRNHs develops research programs in nutrition within the framework of national, European and international research programs, working closely with industry partners and researchers worldwide.
To advise on strategic development, CRNHs has been endowed with an external scientific advisory board composed of experts from several European.

The '''comedy of humours''' is  a [[genre]] of [[drama]]tic [[comedy]] that focuses on a [[fictional character|character]] or range of characters, each of whom exhibits two or more overriding traits or '[[Humorism|humours]]' that dominates their personality, desires and conduct. This comic technique may be found in [[Aristophanes]], but the [[England|English]] [[playwright]]s [[Ben Jonson]] and [[George Chapman]] popularized the genre in the closing years of the sixteenth century. In the later half of the seventeenth century, it was combined with the [[comedy of manners]] in [[Restoration comedy]]. 

[[Image:Lavater1792.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The four '[[Humourism|humours]]' or temperaments (Clockwise from top right; [[choleric]]; [[Melancholia|melancholic]]; [[Four temperaments#Sanguine|sanguine]]; [[phlegmatic]]).]]
In Jonson’s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (acted 1598), which made this type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] popular, all the words and acts of Kitely are controlled by an overpowering suspicion that his wife is unfaithful; George Downright, a country squire, must be "frank" above all things; the country gull in town determines his every decision by his desire to "catch on" to the manners of the city gallant. 

In his [[Induction (play)|Induction]] to ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'' (1599) Jonson explains his character-formula thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some one peculiar quality&lt;br /&gt;Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw&lt;br /&gt;All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,&lt;br /&gt;In their confluctions, all to run one way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comedy of humours owes something to earlier vernacular comedy but more to a desire to imitate the classical comedy of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]] and to combat the vogue of [[Shakespearean comedy|romantic comedy]], as developed by [[William Shakespeare]]. The satiric purpose of the comedy of humours and its realistic method lead to more serious character studies with Jonson’s ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''. The humours each had been associated with physical and mental characteristics; the result was a system that was quite subtle in its capacity for describing types of personality.

[[File:Courtyard of the prison grounds.jpeg|thumb|The 18th century debtors' prison at the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] in [[Valletta]], now the offices of the Health Ministry in [[Malta]]]]
A '''debtors' prison''' is a [[prison]] for [[Natural person|people]] who are unable to pay [[debt]]. Through the mid 19th century, debtors' prisons (usually similar in form to locked [[workhouses]]) were a common way to deal with unpaid debt in places like [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="Cory"&gt;Cory, Lucinda. [http://www.rib.uscourts.gov/ONTHEDOCKET/vol2,%20iss2.PDF "A Historical Perspective on Bankruptcy"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228083132/http://www.rib.uscourts.gov/ONTHEDOCKET/vol2%2C%20iss2.PDF |date=February 28, 2008 }}, ''On the Docket'', Volume 2, Issue 2, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Rhode Island, April/May/June 2000, retrieved December 20, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; Destitute persons who were unable to pay a court-ordered judgment would be incarcerated in these prisons until they had worked off their debt via labor or secured outside funds to pay the balance. The product of their labor went towards both the costs of their incarceration and their accrued debt. Increasing access and lenience throughout the [[history of bankruptcy law]] have made prison terms for unaggravated [[indigence]] illegal over most of the world.

Since the late 20th century, the term ''debtors' prison'' has also sometimes been applied by critics to [[criminal justice system]]s in which a court can sentence someone to prison over willfully unpaid [[Criminal procedure|criminal fees]], usually following the order of a [[judge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justanswer.com/topics-contempt-of-court/|title=What is Contempt of Court and other Contempt of Court Questions Answered|work=JustAnswer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in some jurisdictions within the [[United States]], people can be held in [[contempt of court]] and jailed after willful non-payment of [[Child support in the United States|child support]], garnishments, confiscations, fines, or back taxes. Additionally, though properly served [[Civil procedure|civil duties]] over private debts in nations such as the United States will merely result in a [[default judgement]] being rendered ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' if the defendant willfully declines to appear by law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasonlawfirm.com/archives/548|title=What Happens If I Get Sued?|work=nasonlawfirm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a substantial number of indigent debtors are legally incarcerated for the crime of failing to appear at civil debt proceedings as ordered by a judge. In this case, the crime is not indigence, but disobeying the judge's order to appear before the court.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tampa1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calpen1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="minn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harrington1"/&gt;  Critics argue that the "willful" terminology is subject to individual [[mens rea]] determination by a judge, rather than statute, and that since this presents the potential for judges to incarcerate legitimately indigent individuals, it amounts to a de facto "debtors' prison" system.

== History ==

=== Medieval Europe ===
During Europe's [[Middle Ages]], debtors, both men and women, were locked up together in a single, large cell until their families paid their debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.articlesdepo.com/loans/56618.php Articlesdepo.com] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debt prisoners often died of diseases contracted from other debt prisoners. Conditions included starvation and abuse from other prisoners. If the father of a family was imprisoned for debt, the family business often suffered while the mother and children fell into poverty. Unable to pay the debt, the father often remained in debtors' prison for many years. Some debt prisoners were released to become [[serf]]s or [[indentured servant]]s ([[debt bondage]]) until they paid off their debt in labor.

== By region ==

=== Canada ===
{{main|Imprisonment for debt (Upper Canada)}}

=== Council of Europe ===
Article 1 of [[European Convention on Human Rights#Protocol 4 - civil imprisonment, free movement, expulsion|Protocol 4]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] prohibits the imprisonment of people for breach of a contract. Turkey and the United Kingdom (due to concerns over British nationality law) have signed but never ratified Protocol 4. Greece and Switzerland have neither signed nor ratified this protocol.

=== France ===

France allows for ''contrainte par corps'', now denominated ''contrainte judiciaire'', for money owed to the State by non-insolvant debtors aged from 18 to 65; its length is limited following the amount of the debt and aims to pressure the debtor to pay his debts, consequently the owed money stays owed to the State.

=== Germany ===
[[File:Nuernberg-maennereisen-v-nw.jpg|thumb|right|Schuldturm in [[Nuremberg]]]]
In the late Middle Ages, and at the beginning of the modern era, public law was codified in Germany. This served to standardize the coercive arrest (''Pressionshaft''), and got rid of the many arbitrary sanctions that were not universal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2006/0919/recht/0108/index.html Berlinonline.de] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222215014/http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2006/0919/recht/0108/index.html |date=December 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas (like Nürnberg) the debtor could sell or redistribute their debt.

In most of the cities, the towers and city fortifications functioned as jails. For certain sanctions there were designated prisons, hence some towers being called debtors' prison (''Schuldturm''). The term ''Schuldturm'', outside of the Saxon constitution, became the catchword for public law debtor’s prison.

In the early modern era, the debtor’s detainment or citizen’s arrest remained valid in Germany. Sometimes it was used as a tool to compel payment, other times it was used to secure the arrest of an individual and ensure a trial against them in order to garnish wages, [[replevin]] or a form of [[trover]]. This practice was particularly disgraceful to a person’s identity, but had different rules than criminal trials. It was more similar to the modern enforcement of sentences (''Strafvollzug'') e.g. the debtor would be able to work off their debt for a certain amount of days, graduated by how much they owed.

The [[North German Confederation]] eliminated debtors' prisons on May 29, 1868.

At present a comparable concept to debtors' prison still exists in various forms in Germany:{{fact|date=July 2017}}
* A maximum of 6 weeks coercive arrest for failure to pay fine (''Bußgeld'').
* A maximum of 6 months coercive arrest for failure to issue an oath of not being able to pay any kind of liability.
* As an alternative sentence, if a fine (''Geldstrafe'') is not paid, up to 6 months.
* As a personal arrest for the securing of a foreclosure or garnishment on wages.
* Failure to pay child support as ordered by court, which is a crime under the Penal Code.

=== Great Britain (later the United Kingdom) ===
[[File:St Briavels Castle Debtors Prison.jpg|thumb|right|A mid-Victorian depiction of the debtors' prison at [[St Briavels Castle]]]]
In England during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, 10,000 people were imprisoned for debt each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A 20th Century Debate About Imprisonment for Debt|last = Ware|first = Stephen|date = July 2014|journal = American Journal of Legal History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A prison term did not alleviate a person's debt, however; an inmate was typically required to repay the creditor in-full before being released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.historyextra.com/facts/nutshell-debtors’-prisons|title = In a Nutshell: Debtor's Prisons|date = February 10, 2015|accessdate = |website = History Extra|publisher = BBC|last = Wilkes|first = Jonny|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151212102229/http://www.historyextra.com/facts/nutshell-debtors%E2%80%99-prisons|archivedate = December 12, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the later [[United Kingdom]], debtors' prisons varied in the amount of freedom they allowed the debtor. With a little money, a debtor could pay for some freedoms; some prisons allowed inmates to conduct business and to receive visitors; others (including the [[Fleet Prison|Fleet]] and [[King's Bench Prison]]s) even allowed inmates to live a short distance outside the prison—a practice known as the 'Liberty of the Rules'—and the Fleet even tolerated clandestine '[[Fleet Marriage]]s'.

Life in these prisons, however, was far from pleasant, and the inmates were forced to pay for their keep. Samuel Byrom, son of the writer and poet [[John Byrom]], was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet in 1725, and in 1729 he sent a petition to his old school friend, the [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset|Duke of Dorset]], in which he raged against the injustices of the system. Some debtor prisoners were even less fortunate, being sent to prisons with a mixture of vicious criminals and petty criminals, and many more were confined to a single cell.

The father of the [[England|English]] author [[Charles Dickens]] was sent to one of these prisons (the [[Marshalsea Prison|Marshalsea]]), which were often described in Dickens's novels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charles-dickens.com/ Charles Dickens Bibliography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215121741/http://www.charles-dickens.com/ |date=2010-12-15 }} at charles-dickens.com&lt;/ref&gt; He became an advocate for debt prison reform, and his novel ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' dealt directly with this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Charles Dickens, Social Worker in His Time|last = Andrews|first = Arlene B.|date = October 2012|journal = Social Work|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Debtors' Act of 1869]] limited the ability of the courts to sentence debtors to prison, but it did not entirely prohibit them from doing so.  Debtors who had the means to pay their debt, but did not do so, could still be incarcerated for up to six weeks, as could those who defaulted on debts to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/32-33/62/part/I|title = Debtors Act of 1869|date = |accessdate = 6 December 2015|website = |publisher = The National Archives (UK)|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, there was a significant reduction in the number of debtors imprisoned following the passage of the 1869 Act.   By 1870, the total number of debtors imprisoned decreased by almost 2,000, dropping from 9,759 in 1869 to 6,605 in 1870.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Judicial Statistics, England and Wales, Part 2|last = |first = |publisher = Great Britain Home Office|year = 1907|isbn = |location = |pages = 35|url = https://books.google.com/?id=64AzAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=debt%20imprisonment%20statistics%20england&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=debt%20imprisonment%20statistics%20england&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, by 1905 that  number had increased to 11,427.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of London's debtors' prisons were the [[Coldbath Fields Prison]], [[Fleet Prison]], [[Giltspur Street Compter]], [[King's Bench Prison]], [[Marshalsea Prison]], [[Poultry Compter]], and [[Wood Street Counter]]. The most famous was [[The Clink|the Clink prison]], which had a debtor's entrance in Stoney Street. This prison gave rise to the British slang term for being incarcerated in any prison, hence "in the clink". Its location also gave rise to the term for being financially embarrassed, "stoney broke".

Ιmprisonment for debts, whether to the tax office or to a private bank, was still practiced until January 2008, when the law changed after imprisonment for unpaid taxes, as well as other debts to the government or to the social security office, was declared unconstitutional after having been practiced for 173 years; imprisonment was, however, still retained for debts to private banks.{{clarify|date=April 2009}} The situation regarding imprisonment (προσωποκράτηση (prosōpokrάtēsē): custody) for debts to the government is still unclear, as courts continue to have this ability for criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reporto.gr/news.asp?ID=7710 Reporto.gr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205184819/http://www.reporto.gr/news.asp?ID=7710 |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eighteenth century debtors' prison is found within the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] in [[Valletta]], Malta, now used as offices by the Ministry for Health.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Debtors in the [[United Arab Emirates]], including [[Dubai]], are imprisoned for failing to pay their debts. This is a common practice in the country. Banks are not sympathetic to the debtors once they are in prison, so many just choose to leave the country where they can negotiate for settlements later. The practice of fleeing UAE to avoid arrest because of debt defaults is considered a viable option to customers who are unable to meet their obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/middleeast/12dubai.html|work=The New York Times|title=Laid-Off Foreigners Flee as Dubai Spirals Down|first=Robert F.|last=Worth|date=2009-02-12|accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/how-the-world-is-dealing-with-the-issue-of-debtors|work=The National|title=How the world is dealing with the issue of debtors|first=Wayne|last=Arnold|date=2008-12-24|accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early debtors' prisons (colonization–1850) ====
Many Colonial American jurisdictions established debtors' prisons using the same models used in Great Britain.

Debtors' prisons were prevalent throughout the [[United States]] up until the mid-1800s. Economic hardships following the [[War of 1812]] with [[Great Britain]] helped swell prison populations with simple debtors. This resulted in significant attention being given to plights of the poor and most dependent jailed under the widespread practice, possibly for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Acquisition of Political, Social, and Industrial Rights of Man in America|last=McMaster|first=John B.|year=1903|publisher=Imperial Press|location=Cleveland|isbn=978-1-4097-7187-6|pages=63–66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2cUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=1816+debtors+prison#v=onepage&amp;q=1816%20debtors%20prison&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing disfavor over debtors' prisons along with the advent and early development of [[Bankruptcy in the United States|U.S. bankruptcy laws]] led states to begin restricting imprisonment for most civil debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G.

While the United States no longer has brick and mortar debtors' prisons, or "gaols for debtors" of private debts, the term "debtor's prison" in modern times sometimes refers to the practice of imprisoning indigent criminal defendants for matters related to either a fine or a fee imposed in criminal judgments.&lt;ref name="harrington1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/100075454/Judge-Hub-Harrington-Order-to-Harpersville|work=Scribd Research Law|location=[http://media.al.com/spotnews/other/Judge%20Hub%20Harrington%20order%20to%20Harpersville.pdf Shelby County, Harpersville .pdf] Alabama, USA|title=Circuit Court of Shelby County CV 2010-900183.00|date=July 2012|first=Shelby County|last=Circuit Court}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="think1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2011/12/13/388303/the-return-of-debtors-prisons-thousands-of-americans-jailed-for-not-paying-their-bills/|work=Think Progress|location=United States|title=The Return Of Debtor's Prisons|date=13 December 2011|first=Marie|last=Diamond}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To what extent a debtor will actually be prosecuted varies from state to state.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/opinion/06mon4.html|work=The New York Times|location=United States|title=The New Debtors’ Prisons|date=5 April 2009|first=Editorial|last=Writer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This modern use of the term debtors' prison arguably has its start with precedent rulings in 1970, 1971 and 1983 by the U.S. Supreme Court,&lt;ref name="tampa1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/article991963.ece|work=The Tampa Bay Times|location=United States|title=Debtors' prison - again|date=14 April 2009|first=Staff|last=Writer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706150424/http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/article991963.ece|archivedate=6 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aclu-wa.org/news/aclu-report-exposes-modern-day-debtors-prisons|work=ACLU, USA| location=[http://www.aclu-wa.org/sites/default/files/attachments/InForAPenny_web.pdf "In for a Penny" ACLU Report.PDF]|title=ACLU Report .pdf Source Page|date=October 2010|first=U.S.|last=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passage of the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978|Bankruptcy Reform Act]] of 1978.

* State laws that attempt to make criminal justice debt a condition of probation, parole, or other correctional supervision with failure to pay resulting in arrest and reimprisonment.&lt;ref name="oklahoma1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=84821|work=State Court Network|location=Oklahoma, United States|title=Section Article 2 section 13 - Imprisonment for debt (2 § 13)|year=2012|first=State of|last=Oklahoma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2013066985_debtor04m.html|work=The Seattle Times|location=Washington, USA|title=Unpaid court costs can bring cycle of debt, threat of jail, ACLU warns|date=3 October 2010|first=Susan|last=Kelleher}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* State laws that consider imprisonment as a penalty for failure to pay criminal justice debt.

* The routine jailing of persons who owe civil debt when such debts are related to child support arrears. Imprisonment for such debt is legally justified by the legal fiction that the incarceration is not for the debt, but rather for not obeying a court order to pay the debt.

In an article in ''[[The American Conservative]]'', Michael Shindler argues that another factor responsible for debtors' prison type arrests is that "Whereas indigent defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to a court-appointed lawyer in criminal cases involving incarceration, indigent debtors in state and local courts have no one to defend them against the error and abuse that characterizes debt collection litigation." Similarly, Shindler writes, regarding explicitly illegal debtors' prison type arrests ordered by local judges,"the reason these officials engage in this sort of excessive behavior is often due to ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shindler|first=Michael|date=September 17, 2018|title=Private Creditors Can Put You in Jail|url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-travesty-of-private-creditors-putting-people-in-jail/|journal=The American Conservative|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-A debtors' prison is a prison for people who are unable to pay debt. Through the mid 19th century, debtors' prisons (usually similar in form to locked workhouses) were a common way to deal with unpaid debt in Western Europe.[1] Destitute persons unable to pay a court-ordered judgment would be sentenced to these prisons until they had worked off their debt via labor or secured outside funds to pay the balance; the product of their labor went towards both the costs of their incarceration and their accrued debt. Increasing access and lenience throughout the history of bankruptcy law have made prison terms for unaggravated indigence illegal over most of the world.

== International agreements ==
In 1976 Article 11 of the ICCPR – [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] – came into effect stating, "No one shall be imprisoned merely on the ground of inability to fulfill a contractual obligation."

This international treaty contradicts many domestic laws of ratified states which allows for civil jail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15933">The '''decline effect''' may occur when scientific claims receive decreasing support over time. The term was first described by parapsychologist [[Joseph Banks Rhine]] in the 1930s to describe the disappearing of [[extrasensory perception]] (ESP) of psychic experiments conducted by Rhine over the course of study or time. In its more general term, Cronbach, in his review article of science "Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology" referred to the phenomenon as "generalizations decay."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0076829| title = Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology| journal = American Psychologist| volume = 30| issue = 2| pages = 116–127| year = 1975| last1 = Cronbach | first1 = L. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was once again used in a 2010 article by [[Jonah Lehrer]] published in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="Lehrer"&gt;{{Cite web | author = Jonah_Lehrer | title = The Truth Wears Off | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/13/101213fa_fact_lehrer | publisher = The New Yorker | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

In his article, Lehrer gives several examples where the decline effect is allegedly showing. In the first example, the development of second generation anti-psychotic drugs, reveals that the first tests had demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the subjects' psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt; However, after repeating tests this effect declined and in the end it was not possible to document that these drugs had any better effect than the first generation anti-psychotics.

A well-known example of the decline effect can be seen in early experiments conducted by Professor [[Jonathan Schooler]] examining the effects of verbalization on non-verbal cognition. In an initial series of studies Schooler found evidence that verbal rehearsal of previously seen faces or colors markedly impaired subsequent recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is referred to as ''[[verbal overshadowing]]''. Although verbal overshadowing effects have been repeatedly observed by Schooler, as well as other researchers, they have also proven to be somewhat challenging to replicate.&lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chin |first=J. M. |last2=Schooler |first2=J. W. |year=2009 |title=Why do words hurt? content, process, and criterion shift accounts of verbal overshadowing |journal=European Journal of Cognitive Psychology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=396–413 |doi=10.1080/09541440701728623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schooler&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbal overshadowing effects in a variety of domains were initially easy to find, but then became increasingly difficult to replicate indicating a decline effect in the phenomenon. Schooler has now become one of the more prominent researchers examining the decline effect. He has argued that addressing the decline effect may require a major revision to the scientific process whereby scientists log their protocols before conducting their research and then, regardless of outcome, report their findings in an open access repository (such as Brain Nosek's "Project Implicit").&lt;ref&gt;http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/&lt;/ref&gt; Schooler is currently working with the Fetzer Foundation to organize a major meeting of scientists from various disciplines to consider alternative accounts of the decline effect and approaches for rigorously addressing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/1047840X.2012.705246| title = Modernizing Science: Comments on Nosek and Bar-Anan (2012)| journal = Psychological Inquiry| volume = 23| issue = 3| pages = 281–284| year = 2012| last1 = Mooneyham | first1 = B. W. | last2 = Franklin | first2 = M. S. | last3 = Mrazek | first3 = M. D. | last4 = Schooler | first4 = J. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Danish zoologist Anders Møller discovered a connection between symmetry and sexual preference of female birds in nature. This sparked a huge interest in the topic and a lot of follow-up research was published. In three years following the original discovery, 90% of studies confirmed Møller's hypothesis. However, the same outcome was published in just four out of eight research papers in 1995, and only a third in next three years.&lt;ref name="Lehrer2"&gt;{{Cite news | author = Jonah Lehrer | title = The Mysterious Decline Effect | url = https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/12/the-mysterious-decline-effect | publisher = Wired | date=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==

One of the explanations of the effect is [[regression to the mean|regression toward the mean]] (this is a statistical phenomenon happening when a variable is extreme on the first experiments and by later experiments tend to regress towards average), although this does not explain why sequential results decline in a linear fashion, rather than fluctuating about the true mean as would be expected.&lt;ref name=schooler/&gt;

Another reason may be the [[publication bias]]: scientists and scientific journals prefer to publish positive results of experiments and tests over null results, especially with new ideas.&lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt;  As a result, the journals may refuse to publish papers that do not prove that the idea works. Later, when an idea is accepted, journals may refuse to publish papers that support it.

In the debate that followed the original article, Lehrer answered some of the questions by claiming that scientific observations might be shaped by one's expectations and desires, sometimes even unconsciously, thus creating a bias towards the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="Lehrer2" /&gt;

A significant factor contributing to the decline effect can also be the sample size of the scientific research, since smaller sample size is very likely to give more extreme results, suggesting a significant breakthrough, but also a higher probability of an error. Typical examples of this effect are the opinion polls, where those including a larger number of people are closer to reality than those with a small pool of respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = John Allen Paulos | authorlink = John Allen Paulos | title = The decline effect and why scientific 'Truth' so often turns out wrong | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/WhosCounting/decline-effect-scientific-truth-turns-wrong/story?id=12510202 | publisher = ABC News | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggestion would not appear to account for the observed decrease over time regardless of sample size. Researcher [[John Ioannidis]] offers some explanation. He states that early research is usually small and more prone to highly positive results supporting the original idea, including early confirmatory studies. Later, as larger studies are being made, they often show regression to the mean and a failure to repeat the early exaggerated results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J. P.

A 2012 report by National Public Radio's show "On The Media"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Brooke Gladstone |title=The 'Decline Effect' and Scientific Truth |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/2012/jun/29/decline-effect-and-scientific-truth/ |publisher=NPR On The Media |year=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704061146/http://www.onthemedia.org/2012/jun/29/decline-effect-and-scientific-truth/ |archivedate=2012-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; covered scientists who are exploring another option: that the act of observing the universe changes the universe, and that repeated measurement might actually be rendering earlier results invalid. In other words, antipsychotic drugs ''did'' work originally, but the more we measured their effectiveness, the more the laws governing those drugs changed so they ceased to be effective. Science fiction author [[Geoff Ryman]] explores this idea and its possible ramifications further in his 2012 short story &lt;u&gt;What We Found&lt;/u&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Geoff Ryman | title = The Year's Best Science Fiction | url = https://www.amazon.com/The-Years-Best-Science-Fiction/dp/1250003547 | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Mike Addelman | title = Ryman wins one of world’s top science fiction prizes | url = http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=8297 | publisher = University of Manchester | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contesting views==

Several commenters have contested Jonah Lehrer's view of the decline effect being a problematic side of the phenomenon, as presented in his ''New Yorker'' article. "The decline effect is troubling because it reminds us how difficult it is to prove anything. We like to pretend that our experiments define the truth for us. But that's often not the case. Just because an idea is true doesn't mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn't mean it's true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe." &lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt;

[[Steven Novella]] also challenges Lehrer's view of the decline effect, arguing that Lehrer is concentrating on new discoveries on the cutting edge of scientific research and applying the conclusions to all areas of science. Novella points out that most of the examples used by Lehrer come from medicine, psychology and ecology, scientific fields most influenced by a complex human aspect and that there is not much evidence of the decline effect in other areas of science, such as physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Steven Novella | title = The Decline Effect | url = http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2580/ | publisher = Neurologicablog | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scientist, [[Paul Zachary Myers]], is also contesting Lehrer's view on the decline effect being a surprising phenomenon in science, claiming that: "This isn't surprising at all. It's what we expect, and there are many very good reasons for the shift." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Paul Zachary Myers |title=Science is not dead |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/12/science_is_not_dead.php |publisher=Scienceblogs |year=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303224843/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/12/science_is_not_dead.php |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrer's statements about the difficulty of proving anything and publication bias find support from [[Jerry A. Coyne]]. Coyne holds that in the fields of genetics and evolutionary biology, almost no research is replicated and there is a premium motivation offered for publishing positive results of research studies. However, he also contests Lehrer's approach of applying conclusions on all fields of science, stating that in physics, chemistry or molecular biology, previous results are constantly repeated by others in order to progress in their own research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Jerry Allen Coyne | title = Why Evolution is True | url = http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/12/10/the-decline-effect-can-we-demonstrate-anything-in-science/ | publisher = Wordpress | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

One concern that some &lt;ref name="Horgan"&gt;{{Cite web | author = John Horgan | title = The truth we'll doubt: Does the decline effect mean that all science is "truthy"? | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=the-truth-well-doubt-does-the-decli-2010-12-13 | publisher = Scientific America | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have expressed is that Lehrer's article may further fuel people's skepticism about academic science. It was long believed that Lehrer's article originally hinted that academic science is not as rigid as people would like to believe. It is especially the article's ending that has upset many scientists and led to broad criticism of the article. Lehrer ends the article by saying: "Just because an idea is true doesn't mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn't mean it's true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe." This has upset scientists in the scientific community. Many have written back to Lehrer and questioned his agenda. Some have characterized Lehrer's assertion as "absurd", while others claiming that Lehrer is trying to use publication bias as an excuse for not believing in anything.&lt;ref name="Horgan" /&gt;

As an answer to the many comments Lehrer received upon publishing the article, Lehrer published a comment on his blog, The Frontal Cortex,&lt;ref name="Lehrer2" /&gt; where he denied that he was implicitly questioning science and scientific methods in any way. In the same blog comment, Lehrer stated that he was not questioning fundamental scientific theories such as the theory of evolution by natural selection and global warming by calling them "two of the most robust and widely tested theories of modern science".

A further clarification was published as a follow-up note in ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="Lehrer2" /&gt; In this note, entitled "More Thoughts on the Decline Effect", Lehrer tries mainly to answer the critics by giving examples where scientific research has both failed and succeeded. As an example, Lehrer uses [[Richard Feynman]]'s [[commencement speech]] at Caltech in 1974 as a starting point. In his commencement speech, Feynman used [[Robert Millikan]]'s and [[Harvey Fletcher]]'s [[oil drop experiment]] to measure the charge of an electron to illustrate how selective reporting can bias scientific results. On the other hand, Feynman finds solace in the fact that other scientists will repeat other scientists' experiments and hence, the truth will win out in the end.

Lehrer once again uses the follow-up note to deny that his original intention was to support people denying well verified scientific theories such as natural selection and climate change. Instead, he wishes that "we'd spend more time considering the value of second-generation antipsychotics or the verity of the latest gene-association study". In the other parts of the follow-up note, Lehrer briefly discusses some of the creative feedback he has received in order to reduce publication bias. He does not give explicit support to any specific idea. The follow-up article ends with Lehrer once again stating that the decline effect is a problem in today's science, but that science will eventually find a tool to deal with the problem.

The '''Digital Humanities conference''' is an [[academic conference]] for the field of [[digital humanities]]. It is hosted by [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] and has been held annually since 1989.

==History==
The first joint conference was held in 1989, at the [[University of Toronto]]—but that was the 16th annual meeting of [[ALLC]], and the ninth annual meeting of the [[Association for Computers and the Humanities|ACH]]-sponsored International Conference on Computers and the Humanities (ICCH).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chronicle of Higher Education has called the conference "highly competitive" but "worth the price of admission," praising its participants' focus on best practices, the intellectual community it has fostered, and the tendency of its organizers to sponsor attendance of early-career scholars (important given the relative expense of attending it, as compared to other academic conferences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An analysis of the Digital Humanities conference abstracts between 2004 and 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eichmann|first1=Nickoal|last2=Weingart|first2=Scott|title=What’s Under the Big Tent?

The '''ecological urbanism''' project draws from ecology to inspire an urbanism that is more socially inclusive and sensitive to the environment, as well as less ideologically driven, than [[green urbanism]] or [[Sustainable Urbanism|sustainable urbanism]]. In many ways, ecological urbanism is an evolution of, and a critique of, [[Landscape urbanism|Landscape Urbanism]] arguing for a more holistic approach to the design and management of cities. The term appeared first in 1998 as "EcoUrbanism" in a book by Architect and Planner Miguel Ruano,&lt;ref&gt;Eco-Urbanism: Sustainable Human Settlements, 60 Case Studies – Gustavo Gili, 1998 - 192 pages | http://www.abebooks.com/9788425217234/Eco-Urbanism-Sustainable-Human-Settlements-Case-8425217237/plp&lt;/ref&gt; who defined it as "the development of multi-dimensional sustainable human communities within harmonious and balanced built environments". The term was used later in April 2003 at a conference at the University of Oregon,&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.uoregon.edu/hopes/oldhopes/conf03/emailposter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2006 in a paper by Jeffrey Hou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOJPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ecological+urbanism#search_anchor |title=Proceedings of the ... ACSA Annual ... – Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture – Google Books |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was used by [[Mohsen Mostafavi]] in 2007 in ''Intervention Architecture''&lt;ref name="Intervention architecture"/&gt; and in a lecture at the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/education-events/247-sustainable |title=Sustainable? &amp;#124; Canadian Centre for Architecture |publisher=CCA |date=17 June 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ecological urbanism as a project was largely started at [[Harvard University Graduate School of Design]], with a conference, and exhibition, and book.&lt;ref name="Ecological Urbanism Harvard"/&gt;

Arguing for a "new ethics and aesthetics of the urban," the 656-page ''Ecological Urbanism'' book, edited by Mohsen Mostafavi with Gareth Doherty, was published in May 2010 by Lars Müller Publishers ({{ISBN|978-3-03778-189-0}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/catalogue-architecture |title=Architecture – Lars Müller Publishers |publisher=Lars-mueller-publishers.com |date=14 July 1938 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book follows the conference,&lt;ref name="conference"/&gt; and exhibition, held at the GSD in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2009/04/12/exhibit_provides_sense_of_the_future/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Robert | last=Campbell | title=Exhibit provides sense of the future | date=12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecologicalurbanism.gsd.harvard.edu/exhibition.php |title=Exhibition on Ecological Urbanism – Harvard Graduate School of Design |publisher=Ecologicalurbanism.gsd.harvard.edu |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/events/exhibitions/Ecological%20Urbanism/eco_urban_final.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708031955/http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/events/exhibitions/Ecological%20Urbanism/eco_urban_final.htm |date=8 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has a long list of contributors, including [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Mitchell Joachim]], [[Andrea Branzi]], and about 130 others. A blog during the conference is part of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsd-ecologicalurbanism.blogspot.com/ |title=GSD:ecologicalurbanism |publisher=Gsd-ecologicalurbanism.blogspot.com |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [http://www.architecturetoday.co.uk/ ''Architecture Today''], the book is "one of the few books that recognises and articulates how, if this systems-based approach is to be successful, it needs to design, integrate and express complex systems and social processes in ways that are fundamentally humane."&lt;ref name="AT Review"/&gt; The book has been reviewed and cited in many publications, including [''Metropolis Magazine''],&lt;ref name="Metropolis review"/&gt; [http://www.info-jola.de/ ''The Journal of Landscape Architecture''],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jola-lab.eu/www/issues.html |title=JoLA &amp;#124; Issue 11 &amp;#124; Spring 2011 |publisher=Jola-lab.eu |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [http://www.citiesthemagazine.com/ Cities magazine].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cities |url=http://vimeo.com/16500456 |title=Ecological Urbanism – Book Review On Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events and discussions on the book have been held at the 2010 Venice Biennale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abitare.it/biennale-to-the-people/anticipate/ |title=Anticipate? &amp;#124; Abitare |publisher=Abitare.it |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Storefront for Art and Architecture]] in New York, and at the Van Alen Institute in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanalen.org/projects/events/EcologicalExchange |title=Van Alen Institute – Events – Ecological Urbanism and Green Gone Wrong: An Exchange |publisher=Vanalen.org |accessdate=10 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129110856/http://www.vanalen.org/projects/events/EcologicalExchange |archivedate=29 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introduction to the ''Ecological Urbanism'', "Why Ecological Urbanism? Why Now?", extracted in [https://www.topos.de/ ''Topos: The International Review of Landscape Architecture and Urban Design''], Mostafavi asks: "Increased numbers of people and cities go hand in hand with a greater exploitation of the world’s limited resources. Every year, more cities are feeling the devastating impacts of this situation. What are we to do? What means do we have as designers to address this challenging reality?&lt;ref&gt;https://www.topos.de/Previous-issue/detail-991.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeb Brugmann in his book ''Welcome to the Urban Revolution: How Cities Are Changing the World'' (Bloomsbury Press, 2009) says we need to become "masters of a stable, just, and ecological urbanism." For Brugmann, "The first step towards ecological urbanism is increasing the energy and nutrient productivity within the city, but the only way to move sufficiently from extractive mode to a sustainable productive mode is to think, design, and develop at the scale of the City."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/innovations/data/000176 |title=Welcome to the Urban Revolution |publisher=Policyinnovations.org |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of recent conferences and lectures on the project of ecological urbanism, including: The New Aesthetics and Ecological Urbanism at Peking University in October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alicerawsthorn.com/talks_debates.php |title=Alice Rawsthorn |publisher=Alice Rawsthorn |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects Spring Lecture Series: Ecological Urbanism: A Prospectus for the Super City, in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinz.org.nz/Events/2010/October/46049 |title=Events – NZILA Spring Lecture Series: Ecological Urbanism – a prospectus for the super city |publisher=DINZ |date=1 October 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Washington’s urban initiative included a seminar on Now Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=21Oct10 |url=http://sawyerseminaratuw.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/ecological-urbanism-gradseminar/ |title=Ecological Urbanism [gradseminar&amp;#93; « Now Urbanism |publisher=Sawyerseminaratuw.wordpress.com |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and talks "on Ecological Urbanism, Ecological Design for Healthy Cities, Networked Urbanism, and America’s War on Immigrants.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roth |first=Rick |url=http://depts.washington.edu/geog/2010/10/city-making-in-the-21st-century-and-beyond/ |title=City Making In The 21st century and Beyond &amp;#124; Department of Geography |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-Urbanism: towards sustainable city living, was hosted by Nottingham University at the Shanghai Expo in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/.../eco-urbanismprogramme.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to courses at the GSD in 2008&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/courses/details.cgi?section_id=10874&amp;term=f2008&lt;/ref&gt; and 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/courses/details.cgi?section_id=12383&amp;term=s2011&lt;/ref&gt; there have been courses on ecological urbanism at the Bergen School of Architecture,&lt;ref name="BAS Course"/&gt; Oslo School of Architecture and Design,&lt;ref name="Univ Oslo Course"/&gt; and Yale University.&lt;ref name="YSOA Course"/&gt; It is on numerous course syllabi, including Advanced Design Theories 2010 at Florida International University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~readg/Courses/GradTheory/GradTheorySyllabus2010.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona State University expanded on the subject with a lecture by Charles Anderson, ASLA.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Morris Anderson]]&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson stated that "ecology is concerned with the relationships between all organisms and the environment. Together and coupled with aesthetic and expressionist design principles, they form the foundation for urban design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://design.asu.edu/events/lectures_archive.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of ecological urbanism==
Ecological urbanism has been criticized as an idea that is loosely defined from a set of flashy projects. These are expensive schemes with a commercial and esthetic purpose that satisfy a local or regional ambition to invest in ecology or sustainability without posing a more globally applicable approach. A true merger of landscape architecture with the field of Urban Ecology lacks. From this criticism Frederick Steiner introduced landscape ecological urbanism as an approach that can include the field of urban ecology and Wybe Kuitert has shown how such integrative planning and management of the city should rely on analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = F. R. | year = 2011 | title = Landscape Ecological Urbanism: Origins and Trajectories | url = | journal = Landscape and Urban Planning | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 333–337 | doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2011.01.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuitert | first1 = Wybe | year = 2013 | title = Urban landscape systems understood by geo-history map overlay | doi = 10.1080/18626033.2013.798929 | journal = Journal of Landscape Architecture | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 54–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discerning the potential quality of wild nature in the city is a first step to see how new urban ecology might be developed. Potential vegetation maps for a city are the tool to this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuitert | first1 =  | year = 2013 | title = The Nature of Urban Seoul: Potential Vegetation Derived from the Soil Map | doi = 10.1080/12265934.2013.766505 | journal = International Journal of Urban Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 95–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological Urbanism is explained as a successor to Landscape Urbanism without the difference between the two approaches, and the terms used in the new approach, being defined. Jason King sees it as an inadequately explained addition to a list of 61 other 'Fill-in-the-blank Urbanisms'.&lt;ref&gt;http://landscapeandurbanism.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/ecological-urbanism-introduction-part-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Turner]] welcomes landscape and ecological urbanism as 'the most significant contributions to landscape design theory since the landscape architecture profession was launched in the mid-nineteenth century' but is 'unpersuaded by the change of name' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gardenvisit.com/blog/2014/01/02/landscape-ecological-urbanism/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enterprise information security architecture (EISA)''' is a part of [[enterprise architecture]] focusing on information security throughout the enterprise.  The name implies a difference that may not exist between small/medium-sized businesses and larger organizations.

== Overview ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Enterprise information security architecture (EISA) is the practice of applying a comprehensive and rigorous method for describing a current and/or future structure and behavior for an organization's security processes, information security systems, personnel and organizational sub-units, so that they align with the organization's core goals and strategic direction. Although often associated strictly with [[information security]] technology, it relates more broadly to the security practice of business [[management science|optimization]] in that it addresses business security architecture, performance management and security process architecture as well.

Enterprise information security architecture is becoming a common practice within the [[financial institutions]] around the [[globe]]. The primary purpose of creating an enterprise information security architecture is to ensure that business strategy and IT security are aligned. As such, enterprise information security architecture allows [[traceability]] from the business strategy down to the underlying technology.

== Enterprise information security architecture topics ==

=== Positioning ===
[[Image:BITS.jpg|right|360px]]
Enterprise information security architecture was first formally positioned by [[Gartner]] in their [[whitepaper]] called “''Incorporating Security into the Enterprise Architecture Process''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incorporating Security Into the Enterprise Architecture Process|url=http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=g_search&amp;id=488575|publisher=www.gartner.com|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was published on 24 January 2006. Since this publication, security architecture has moved from being a silo based architecture to an enterprise focused solution that incorporates business, [[information]] and [[technology]]. The picture below represents a one-dimensional view of enterprise architecture as a [[service-oriented architecture]]. It also reflects the new addition to the enterprise architecture family called “Security”. Business architecture, information architecture and technology architecture used to be called BIT for short. Now with security as part of the architecture family it has become BITS.

Security architectural change imperatives now include things like
* Business roadmaps
* [[Legislative]] and [[legal]] [[requirements]]
* [[Technology roadmaps]]
* Industry trends
* Risk trends
* Visionaries

=== Goals ===
* Provide structure, coherence and cohesiveness.
* Must enable business-to-security alignment.
* Defined top-down beginning with business strategy.
* Ensure that all models and implementations can be traced back to the business strategy, specific business requirements and key principles.
* Provide abstraction so that complicating factors, such as geography and technology religion, can be removed and reinstated at different levels of detail only when required.
*  Establish a common "language" for information security within the organization

=== Methodology ===
The practice of enterprise information security architecture involves developing an architecture security framework to describe a series of "current", "intermediate" and "target" [[reference architecture]]s and applying them to align programs of change. These frameworks detail the organizations, roles, entities and relationships that exist or should exist to perform a set of business processes. This framework will provide a rigorous taxonomy and ontology that clearly identifies what processes a business performs and detailed information about how those processes are executed and secured. The end product is a set of artifacts that describe in varying degrees of detail exactly what and how a business operates and what security controls are required. These artifacts are often graphical.

Given these descriptions, whose levels of detail will vary according to affordability and other practical considerations, decision makers are provided the means to make informed decisions about where to invest resources, where to realign organizational goals and processes, and what policies and procedures will support core missions or business functions.

A strong enterprise information security architecture process helps to answer basic questions like:
* What is the information security risk posture of the organization?
* Is the current architecture supporting and adding value to the security of the organization?
* How might a security architecture be modified so that it adds more value to the organization?
* Based on what we know about what the organization wants to accomplish in the future, will the current security architecture support or hinder that?

Implementing enterprise information security architecture generally starts with documenting the organization's strategy and other necessary details such as where and how it operates. The process then cascades down to documenting discrete core competencies, business processes, and how the organization interacts with itself and with external parties such as customers, suppliers, and government entities.

Having documented the organization's strategy and structure, the architecture process then flows down into the discrete information technology components such as:

* Organization charts, activities, and process flows of how the IT Organization operates
* Organization cycles, periods and timing
* Suppliers of technology hardware, software, and services
* Applications and software inventories and diagrams
* Interfaces between applications - that is: events, messages and data flows
* Intranet, Extranet, Internet, eCommerce, EDI links with parties within and outside of the organization
* Data classifications, Databases and supporting data models
* Hardware, platforms, hosting: servers, network components and security devices and where they are kept
* Local and wide area networks, Internet connectivity diagrams

Wherever possible, all of the above should be related explicitly to the organization's strategy, [[Objective (goal)|goals]], and [[Business operations|operations]]. The enterprise information security architecture will document the current state of the technical security components listed above, as well as an ideal-world desired future state (Reference Architecture) and finally a "Target" future state which is the result of engineering tradeoffs and compromises vs. the ideal. Essentially the result is a nested and interrelated set of models, usually managed and maintained with specialised [[software]] available on the market.

Such exhaustive mapping of IT [[dependency (project management)|dependencies]] has notable overlaps with both [[metadata]] in the general IT sense, and with the [[ITIL]] concept of the [[configuration management database]]. Maintaining the [[accuracy]] of such data can be a significant challenge.

Along with the models and [[diagrams]] goes a set of best practices aimed at securing adaptability, [[scalability]], manageability etc. These systems engineering [[best practices]] are not unique to enterprise information security architecture but are essential to its success nonetheless. They involve such things as componentization, [[asynchronous communication]] between major components, [[standardization]] of key identifiers and so on.

Successful application of enterprise information security architecture requires appropriate positioning in the organization. The analogy of city-planning is often invoked in this connection, and is instructive.

An intermediate outcome of an architecture process is a comprehensive inventory of business security strategy, business security processes, [[organizational chart]]s, technical security inventories, system and interface diagrams, and network topologies, and the explicit relationships between them. The inventories and diagrams are merely tools that support decision making. But this is not sufficient. It must be a living process.

The organization must design and implement a process that ensures continual movement from the current state to the future state. The future state will generally be a combination of one or more

* Closing gaps that are present between the current organization strategy and the ability of the IT security dimensions to support it
* Closing gaps that are present between the desired future organization strategy and the ability of the security dimensions to support it
* Necessary upgrades and replacements that must be made to the IT security architecture based on supplier viability, age and performance of hardware and software, capacity issues, known or anticipated regulatory requirements, and other issues not driven explicitly by the organization's functional management.
* On a regular basis, the current state and future state are redefined to account for evolution of the architecture, changes in organizational strategy, and purely external factors such as changes in technology and customer/vendor/government requirements, and changes to both internal and external threat landscapes over time.

== High-level security architecture framework ==
[[File:Huxham Security Framework.jpg|thumbnail|right|Huxham Security Framework]]

Enterprise information security architecture frameworks is only a subset of enterprise architecture frameworks. If we had to simplify the [[concept]]ual [[abstraction]] of enterprise information security architecture within a generic framework, the picture on the right would be acceptable as a high-level conceptual security architecture framework.

== Relationship to other IT disciplines ==
Enterprise information security architecture is a key component of the [[information security]] technology governance process at any organization of significant size. More and more [[companies]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} are implementing a formal enterprise security architecture process to support the [[governance]] and [[management]] of IT.

However, as noted in the opening paragraph of this article it ideally relates more broadly to the practice of business optimization in that it addresses business security architecture, performance management and process security architecture as well. Enterprise Information Security Architecture is also related to IT security portfolio management and [[metadata]] in the enterprise IT sense.

'''Eternal return''' (also known as '''eternal recurrence''') is a theory that the [[universe]] and all existence and energy has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a [[self-similar]] form an [[infinity|infinite]] number of times across infinite time or space.
The theory is found in [[Indian philosophy]] and in [[ancient Egypt]] and was subsequently taken up by the [[Pythagoreans]] and [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoics]. With the decline of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the spread of [[Christianity]], the theory fell into disuse in the [[Western world]], with the exception of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who connected the thought to many of his other concepts, including ''[[amor fati]]''. Eternal return is based on the philosophy of pre-determinism in that people are predestined to continue repeating the same events over and over again.

==Premise==
The basic premise proceeds from the assumption that the [[probability]] of a world coming into existence exactly like our own is nonzero. If [[space]] and time are infinite, then it follows logically that our existence must recur an infinite number of times.&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark M., "Parallel universes". Sci. Am. 2003 May; 288(5):40–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], assuming a Newtonian cosmology where time and space are infinite, claimed to have demonstrated eternal recurrence as a mathematical certainty.&lt;ref&gt;

== Classical antiquity ==

[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scarabaeus sacer|Scarab]] on a [[fresco]].]]

In [[ancient Egypt]], the scarab ([[dung beetle]]) was viewed as a sign of eternal renewal and reemergence of life, a reminder of the life to come. (See also [[Atum]] and [[Ma'at]].)

The [[Maya calendar#Maya concepts of time|Mayans]] and [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] also took a cyclical view of time.

In [[ancient Greece]], the concept of eternal return was connected with [[Empedocles]], [[Zeno of Citium]], and most notably in [[Stoicism]] (see [[ekpyrosis]]).

== Indian religions ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=February 2018}}
{{See also|End time in Indian religions}}
The concept of cyclical patterns is prominent in [[Indian religions]], such as [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]] among others. The important distinction is that events don't repeat endlessly but souls take birth until they attain salvation. The [[Bhavacakra|wheel of life]] represents an endless cycle of birth, life, and death from which one seeks liberation.  In [[Tantric Buddhism]], a [[wheel of time]] concept known as the [[Kalachakra]] expresses the idea of an endless cycle of existence and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;!--linked from 'Amor fati'--&gt; ==
The concept of "eternal recurrence", the idea that with infinite time and a finite number of events, events will recur again and again infinitely, is central to the writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.lmu.edu/tshanahan/Nietzsche-Eternal_Recurrence.html&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Heidegger]] points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence, in aphorism 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (cited below), presents this concept as a [[Thought experiment|hypothetical ''question'']] rather than postulating it as a fact.  According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.' "&lt;ref&gt;See Heidegger ''Nietzsche. Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' trans. [[David Farrell Krell]]. New York: Harper and Row, 1984. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thought of eternal recurrence appears in a few of his works, in particular §285 and §341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' and then in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. The most complete treatment of the subject appears in the work entitled ''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'', a work which was published in 2007 alongside [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s own version of eternal return, which he calls 'repetition'. Nietzsche sums up his thought most succinctly when he addresses the reader with: "Everything has returned. Sirius,  and the spider, and thy thoughts at this moment, and this last thought of thine that all things will return". However, he also expresses his thought at greater length when he says to his reader:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever thou mayest be, beloved stranger, whom I meet here for the first time, avail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness around us, and above us, and let me tell thee something of the thought which has suddenly risen before me like a star which would fain shed down its rays upon thee and every one, as befits the nature of light. - Fellow man! Your whole life, like a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again, - a long minute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of which you were evolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these cycles of human life there will be one hour where, for the first time one man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all things:- and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon".&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'' - Vol. 16 of Oscar Levy Edition of Nietzsche's Complete Works (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This thought is indeed also noted in a posthumous fragment.&lt;ref&gt;1881 (11 [143])&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this thought is dated by Nietzsche himself, via posthumous fragments, to August 1881, at [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils-Maria]]. In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' (1888), he wrote that he thought of the eternal return as the "fundamental conception" of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, [[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]], "Why I Write Such Good Books", "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", §1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Am Stein der Ewigen Wiederkunft.JPG|thumb|Scene of Nietzsche's inspiration: „by a massive, pyramidally piled up block not far from [[Surlej|Surlei]]“.]]

Several authors have pointed out other occurrences of this hypothesis in contemporary thought. [[Rudolf Steiner]], who revised the first catalogue of Nietzsche's personal library in January 1896, pointed out that Nietzsche would have read something similar in [[Eugen Dühring]]'s ''Courses on philosophy'' (1875), which Nietzsche readily criticized. [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]] pointed out that Nietzsche referred to ancient cyclical conceptions of time, in particular by the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], in the ''Untimely Meditations''. [[Henri Lichtenberger]] and [[Charles Andler]] have pinpointed three works contemporary to Nietzsche which carried on the same hypothesis: J.G. Vogt, ''Die Kraft. Eine real-monistische Weltanschauung'' (1878), [[Auguste Blanqui]], ''[http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/blanqui_louis_auguste/eternite_par_les_astres/eternite_.html L'éternité par les astres]'' (1872) and [[Gustave Le Bon]], ''L'homme et les sociétés'' (1881). [[Walter Benjamin]] juxtaposes Blanqui and Nietzsche's discussion of eternal recurrence in his unfinished, monumental work ''[[The Arcades Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Benjamin]]. ''The Arcades Project''. Trans. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin. Cambridge: Belknap-Harvard, 2002. See chapter D, "Boredom Eternal Return," pp. 101-119.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gustave Le Bon is not quoted anywhere in Nietzsche's manuscripts; and Auguste Blanqui was named only in 1883. Vogt's work, on the other hand, was read by Nietzsche during this summer of 1881 in Sils-Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |title=? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116044517/http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |archivedate=November 16, 2006 }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn/catalogues.html |title=revision of previous catalogues }} on the [[École Normale Supérieure]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; Blanqui is mentioned by [[Albert Lange]] in his ''[[Geschichte des Materialismus]]'' (History of Materialism), a book closely read by Nietzsche.&lt;ref name=Fouillee&gt;Alfred Fouillée, [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Note_sur_Nietzsche_et_Lange_:_%C2%AB_le_retour_%C3%A9ternel_%C2%BB "Note sur Nietzsche et Lange: le "retour éternel"], in ''Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger''. An. 34. Paris 1909. T. 67, S. 519-525 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The eternal recurrence is also mentioned in passing by the Devil in Part Four, Book XI, Chapter 9 of Dostoevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is another possible source that Nietzsche may have been drawing upon.

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] suggests that Nietzsche may have encountered this idea in the works of [[Heinrich Heine]], who once wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]ime is infinite, but the things in time, the concrete bodies, are finite. They may indeed disperse into the smallest particles; but these particles, the atoms, have their determinate numbers, and the numbers of the configurations which, all of themselves, are formed out of them is also determinate. Now, however long a time may pass, according to the eternal laws governing the combinations of this eternal play of repetition, all configurations which have previously existed on this earth must yet meet, attract, repulse, kiss, and corrupt each other again...&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche; Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist.'' 1959, page 376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche calls the idea "horrifying and paralyzing",{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} referring to it as a burden of the "heaviest weight" ("''das schwerste Gewicht''")&lt;ref&gt;Kundera, Milan. ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being''. 1999, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; imaginable.  He professes that the wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.{{'}} [''[[The Gay Science]]'', §341]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', "love of fate":&lt;ref name=dudl&gt;Dudley, Will. ''Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom''. 2002, page 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My formula for human greatness is ''amor fati'': that one wants to have nothing different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely to bear the necessary, still less to conceal it—all idealism is mendaciousness before the necessary—but to ''love'' it.&lt;ref name=dudl /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Carl Jung's seminar on ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Jung claims that the dwarf states the idea of the eternal return before Zarathustra finishes his argument of the eternal return when the dwarf says, "'Everything straight lies,' murmured the dwarf disdainfully.  'All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.'" However, Zarathustra rebuffs the dwarf in the following paragraph, warning him against over-simplifications.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve, M. (2015). The Gay Science and the Rosarium Philosophorum. Agathos, 6(2), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Albert Camus ==
The philosopher and writer [[Albert Camus]] explores the notion of "eternal return" in his essay on "The Myth of Sisyphus", in which the repetitive nature of existence comes to represent life's absurdity, something the hero seeks to withstand through manifesting what [[Paul Tillich]] called "The Courage to Be".  Though the task of rolling the stone repeatedly up the hill without end is inherently meaningless, the challenge faced by Sisyphus is to refrain from despair.  Hence Camus famously concludes that, "one must imagine Sisyphus happy."

== Opposing argument ==

Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has described an argument originally put forward by [[Georg Simmel]], which rebuts the claim that a finite number of states must repeat within an infinite amount of time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even if there were exceedingly few things in a finite space in an infinite time, they would not have to repeat in the same configurations. Suppose there were three wheels of equal size, rotating on the same axis, one point marked on the circumference of each wheel, and these three points lined up in one straight line. If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the first, and if the speed of the third wheel was 1/π of the speed of the first, the initial line-up would never recur.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist''. (Fourth Edition)  Princeton University Press, 1974. p327&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus a system could have an infinite number of distinct physical configurations that never recur. However the example presupposes the possibility of perfect continuity: for instance, if the universe proves to have a [[quantum foam]] nature, then the exact quantity of an irrational number cannot be expressed by any physical object.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

{{God}}
'''Fideism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|d|eɪ|ɪ|z|əm|,_|ˈ|f|aɪ|d|i|-}}) is an [[epistemology|epistemological theory]] which maintains that [[faith]] is independent of [[reason]], or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular [[truth]]s (see [[natural theology]]). The word ''fideism'' comes from ''fides'', the Latin word for [[faith]], and literally means "faith[[-ism]]".{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005}}

[[Theology|Theologians]] and [[Philosophy|philosophers]] have responded in various ways to the place of faith and reason in determining the truth of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[idea]]s, [[morality]], and [[religious belief]]s. A fideist is one who argues for fideism. Historically, fideism is most commonly ascribed to four philosophers: [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[William James]], and [[Wittgenstein]]; with fideism being a label applied in a negative sense by their opponents, but which is not always supported by their own ideas and works or followers.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#2.2  section 2.2]}}  There are a number of different forms of fideism.&lt;ref name = Quinn2000&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Quinn | editor-first = Philip L | last = Taliaferro | first = Charles | year = 2000 | title = A companion to philosophy of religion | page = 376 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=9X-3sPj9m34C&amp;pg=PA376 | isbn = 0-631-21328-7 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Alvin Plantinga]] defines "fideism" as "the exclusive or basic reliance upon faith alone, accompanied by a consequent disparagement of reason and utilized especially in the pursuit of philosophical or religious truth". The fideist therefore "urges reliance on faith rather than reason, in matters philosophical and religious", and therefore may go on to disparage the claims of reason.{{Refn | Plantinga, Alvin (1983). "Reason and Belief in God" in Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff (eds.), ''Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God'', page 87. (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press).{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#1  section 1]}}}}  The fideist seeks [[truth]], above all: and affirms that reason cannot achieve certain kinds of truth, which must instead be accepted only by faith.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#1  section 1]}} Plantinga's definition might be revised to say that what the fideist objects to is not so much "reason" per se—it seems excessive to call [[Blaise Pascal]] anti-rational—but ''[[evidentialism]]'': the notion that no belief should be held unless it is supported by evidence.

=== History ===
{{main article |Relationship between religion and science}}

=== Theories of truth ===
{{main article |Truth#Major theories}}
The doctrine of fideism is consistent with some, and radically contrary to other theories of truth:
* [[Correspondence theory of truth]]
* [[Pragmatic theory of truth]]
* [[Constructivist epistemology]]
* [[Consensus theory of truth]]
* [[Coherence theory of truth]]
* [[Subjectivism]]

Some{{Which|date=June 2012}} forms of fideism outright reject the correspondence theory of truth, which has major philosophical implications. Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} only claim a few religious details to be [[axiom]]atic.

=== Tertullian ===

Tertullian's ''De Carne Christi'' (On the Flesh of Christ])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Beyond Fideism: Negotiable Religious Identities| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tyTSs_dqwkcC | publisher= Ashgate| year= 2010| first = Olli-Pekka | last = Vainio| page= 25 | series = Transcending boundaries in philosophy and theology | ISBN = 978-1-40940679-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is [[Absurdity|absurd]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0315.htm | last = Tertullian | publisher = New Advent | title = On the Flesh of Christ | series = Fathers}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The statement ''"[[Credo quia absurdum]]"'' ("I believe because it is absurd") is sometimes cited as an example of views of the [[Church Fathers]], but this appears to be a misquotation of Tertullian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/articles/sider_credo.htm|title=Tertullian:  Sider, R.D., Credo Quia Absurdum?, Classical World 73 (1980) pp.417-9|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian's statement, however, is not a fideist position; Tertullian was critiquing intellectual arrogance and the misuse of philosophy, but he remained committed to reason and its usefulness in defending the faith.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Tertullian, First Theologian of the West| first =Eric | last = Osborn | publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|page= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luther ===
[[Martin Luther]] taught that faith informs the Christian's use of reason. Regarding the mysteries of Christian faith, he wrote, "All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false." And "Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has." However, Luther conceded that, grounded upon faith in Christ, reason can be used in its proper realm, as he wrote, "Before faith and the knowledge of God reason is darkness in divine matters, but through faith it is turned into a light in the believer and serves piety as an excellent instrument. For just as all natural endowments serve to further impiety in the godless, so they serve to further salvation in the godly. An eloquent tongue promotes faith; reason makes speech clear, and everything helps faith forward. Reason receives life from faith; it is killed by it and brought back to life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Luther | first = Martin | year = 1883–2009 | ISBN = 0-85964-464-2 | place = Weimar | language = German | title = Tischreden |trans-title=Table talks | series = Werke: kritische Gesammtausgabe | publisher = Hermann Böhlau | volume = 3. aus den dreißiger Jahren | section = Die Sammlung von Konrad Cordatus (Schluß) | number = 2938a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blaise Pascal and fideism ===
[[File:Blaise Pascal Versailles.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Blaise Pascal]]]]
Another form of fideism is assumed by [[Pascal's Wager]]. Blaise Pascal invites the [[atheism|atheist]] considering [[faith]] to see faith in God as a cost-free choice that carries a potential reward.{{Sfn | Geisler | 1976 | p = 49}} He does not attempt to argue that God indeed exists, only that it might be valuable to assume that it is true. Of course, the problem with Pascal's Wager is that it does not restrict itself to a specific God, although Pascal did have in mind the Christian God as is mentioned in the following quote. In his ''[[Pensées]]'', Pascal writes:
{{Quote | Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give reasons for their beliefs, since they profess belief in a religion which they cannot explain? They declare, when they expound it to the world, that it is foolishness, ''stultitiam''; and then you complain because they do not prove it! If they proved it, they would not keep their word; it is through their lack of proofs that they show they are not lacking in sense. | ''Pensées'', no. 233}}

Pascal moreover contests the various proposed proofs of the existence of God as irrelevant. Even if the proofs were valid, the beings they propose to demonstrate are not congruent with the deity worshiped by historical faiths, and can easily lead to [[deism]] instead of revealed religion: "The God of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]—not the god of the philosophers!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Pensées | last = Pascal | first = Blaise | language = French |trans-title=Thoughts | publisher = Charles Louandre | place = Paris | year = 1854 | page = 40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamann and fideism ===
Considered to be the father of modern antirationalism, [[Johann Georg Hamann]] promoted a view that elevated faith alone as the only guide to human conduct. Using the work of [[David Hume]] he argued that everything people do is ultimately based on faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Redmond |first=M.|year=1987|title= The Hamann-Hume Connection|journal= Religious Studies|volume= 23|issue=1|pages= 97|publisher=Cambridge University Press|jstor= 20006314|doi=10.1017/s0034412500018564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without faith (for it can never be proven) in the existence of an external world, human affairs could not continue; therefore, he argued, all reasoning comes from this faith: it is fundamental to the human condition. Thus all attempts to base belief in God using reason are in vain. He attacks systems like [[Spinozism]] that try to confine what he feels is the infinite majesty of God into a finite human creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Isaiah | last = Berlin | title=Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder|author-link = Isaiah Berlin |page=297|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2000|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U1373duui04C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kierkegaard===
Natural theologians may argue that Kierkegaard was a fideist of this general sort: the argument that God's existence cannot be certainly known, and that the decision to accept faith is neither founded on, nor needs, rational justification, may be found in the writings of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and his followers in [[Christian existentialism]]. Many of Kierkegaard's works, including ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', are under [[pseudonym]]s; they may represent the work of fictional authors whose views correspond to hypothetical positions, not necessarily those held by Kierkegaard himself.

In ''Fear and Trembling'', Kierkegaard focused on Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac. The New Testament apostles repeatedly argued that Abraham's act was an admirable display of faith. To the eyes of a non-believer, however, it must necessarily have appeared to be an unjustifiable attempted [[murder]], perhaps the fruit of an insane delusion. Kierkegaard used this example to focus attention on the problem of faith in general.{{Sfn | Geisler | 1976 | pp = 50–51}} He ultimately affirmed that to believe in the incarnation of Christ, in God made flesh, was to believe in the "absolute paradox", since it implies that an eternal, perfect being would become a simple human. Reason cannot possibly comprehend such a phenomenon; therefore, one can only believe in it by taking a "[[leap of faith]]".

===James and "will to believe"===
{{expand section|date=May 2013}}
American [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosopher and psychologist [[William James]] introduced his concept of the "[[The Will to Believe|will to believe]]" in 1896. Following upon his earlier theories of truth, James argued that some religious questions can only be answered by believing in the first place: one cannot know if religious doctrines are true without seeing if they work, but they cannot be said to work unless one believes them in the first place.

William James published many works on the subject of religious experience. His four key characteristics of religious experience are: 'passivity', 'ineffability', 'a noetic quality', and 'transiency'. Due to the fact that religious experience is fundamentally ineffable, it is impossible to hold a coherent discussion of it using public language. This means that religious belief cannot be discussed effectively, and so reason does not affect faith. Instead, faith is found through experience of the spiritual, and so understanding of belief is only gained through the practice of it.

=== Wittgenstein and fideism&lt;!--Linked from 'Template:Wittgenstein'--&gt; ===
The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] did not write systematically about religion, though he did lecture on the topic. Some of his students' notes have been collected and published. On the other hand, it has been asserted that religion as a "form of life" is something that intrigued Wittgenstein to a great degree. In his 1967 article, entitled "Wittgensteinian Fideism", [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] argues that certain aspects of Wittgenstein's thought have been interpreted by Wittgensteinians in a "fideistic" manner. According to this position, religion is a self-contained—and primarily expressive—enterprise, governed by its own internal logic or "[[grammar]]". This view—commonly called '''Wittgensteinian fideism'''—states: (1) that religion is logically cut off from other aspects of life; (2) that religious concepts and discourse are essentially self-referential; and (3) that religion cannot be criticized from an external (i.e., non-religious) point of view.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#2.2 section 2.2]}} Although there are other aspects that are often associated with the phenomena of Wittgensteinian fideism, Kai Nielsen has argued that such interpretations are implausible misrepresentations of the position. It is worth noting, however, that no self-proclaimed Wittgensteinian actually takes Nielsen's analysis to be at all representative of either Wittgenstein's view, or their own.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} This is especially true of the best-known Wittgensteinian philosopher of religion, [[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips|D. Z. Phillips]], who is also the best-known "Wittgensteinan fideist". In their book ''Wittgensteinian Fideism?'' (SCM Press, 2005), D. Z. Phillips and Kai Nielsen debate the status of Wittgensteinian fideism. Both agree that the position "collapses", though they think it fails for different reasons. For Nielsen, the position is socially and politically irresponsible since it ignores prudential, practical, and pragmatic considerations as a basis for criticizing different language games. For Phillips, the position fails because it is not Wittgensteinian, and thus is a caricature of his position. Amongst other charges, Nielsen argues most forcefully in an article entitled "On Obstacles of the Will" that Phillips' Wittgensteinian view is relevantly fideistic and that it, therefore, fails on the grounds that it cannot account for the possibility of external, cultural criticism. Phillips, in turn, in the last article in the book, entitled "Wittgenstein: Contemplation and Cultural Criticism", argues that the position is not Wittgensteinian at all, and that Wittgenstein's considered view not only allows for the possibility of external, cultural criticism, but also "advances" philosophical discussion concerning it.

=== Fideism and presuppositional apologetics ===
[[Presuppositional apologetics]] is a Christian system of [[apologetics]] associated mainly with [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestantism]]; it attempts to distinguish itself from fideism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page= 117|title= Epistemological crises, dramatic narratives, and apologetics: the ''ad hominem'' once more| first = Michael W | last = Payne|url=http://files.wts.edu/uploads/pdf/publications/wtj/payne-spring-02.pdf|journal=Westminster Theological Journal|issue=63|year=2002|publisher=Westminster Theological Seminary | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that all human thought must begin with the proposition that the [[revelation]] contained in the [[Bible]] is [[axiom]]atic, rather than [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendentally]] necessary, else one would not be able to make sense of any human experience (see also epistemic [[foundationalism]]). To a non-believer who rejects the notion that the truth about God, the world, and themselves can be found within the Bible, the presuppositional apologist attempts to demonstrate the incoherence of the epistemic foundations of the logical alternative by the use of what has come to be known as the "Transcendental Argument for God's existence" (TAG). On the other hand, some presuppositional apologists, such as [[Cornelius Van Til]], believe that such a condition of true unbelief is impossible, claiming that all people actually believe in God (even if only on a subconscious level), whether they admit or deny it.

[[Presuppositional apologetics]] could be seen as being more closely allied with [[foundationalism]] than fideism, though it has sometimes been critical of both.

== Criticism ==

=== Fideism rejected by the Catholic Church ===
Catholic doctrine rejects fideism. The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', representing [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]'s great regard for [[Thomism]], the teachings of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], affirms that it is a Catholic doctrine that God's existence can indeed be demonstrated by reason. Aquinas' position, which is to be distinguished from [[rationalism]], has deep roots in Western Christianity; it goes back to St. [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s observation that the role of reason was to explain faith more fully: ''fides quaerens intellectum'', "faith seeking understanding", is his formula.

The official position of the Catholic Church is that while the existence of the one God can in fact be demonstrated by reason, nevertheless on account of the distortion of human nature caused by the first sin, humans can be deluded to deny the claims of reason that demonstrate God's existence. The [[Anti-Modernist oath]] promulgated by [[Pope Pius X]] required Catholics to affirm that:
{{Quote | God, the origin and end of all things, can be known with certainty by the natural light of reason from the created world (cf. Rom. 1:20), that is, from the visible works of creation, as a cause from its effects, and that, therefore, his existence can also be demonstrated&amp;nbsp;...}}

Similarly, the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' teaches that:
{{Quote | Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own natural power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator; yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it, they call for self-surrender and abnegation. The human mind, in its turn, is hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So it happens that men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would not like to be true is false or at least doubtful. | ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', ss. 37.}}

[[Pope John Paul II]]'s [[encyclical]] ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' also affirms that God's existence is in fact demonstrable by reason, and that attempts to reason otherwise are the results of sin. In the encyclical, John Paul II warned against "a resurgence of fideism, which fails to recognize the importance of rational knowledge and philosophical discourse for the understanding of faith, indeed for the very possibility of belief in God".

==== Fideist currents in Catholic thought ====
Historically, there have been a number of fideist strains within the Catholic orbit. Catholic traditionalism, exemplified in the nineteenth century by [[Joseph de Maistre]], emphasized faith in [[tradition]] as the means of divine revelation. The claims of reason are multiple, and various people have argued rationally for several contradictory things: in this environment, the safest course is to hold true to the faith that has been preserved through tradition, and to resolve to accept what the Church has historically taught. In his essay ''[[Du pape]]'' ("On the [[Pope]]"), de Maistre argued that it was historically inevitable that all of the Protestant churches would eventually seek reunification and refuge in the Catholic Church: [[science]] was the greater threat, it threatened all religious faith, and "no religion can resist science, except one".

Another refuge of fideist thinking within the Catholic Church is the concept of "[[sign of contradiction|signs of contradiction]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wojtyla | first = Carol | author-link = Pope John Paul II | title = Sign of contradiction | publisher = St. Paul Publications | year = 1979 | page = 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this belief, the holiness of certain people and institutions is confirmed by the fact that other people contest their claims: this opposition is held to be worthy of comparison to the opposition met by Jesus Christ himself. This opposition and contradiction does not inherently prove something is true in Catholic thought, but only acts an additional possible indication of its truth. The idea of the sign of contradiction is related to the conviction that, while human reason is still operative, the distortion of fallen human nature causes concrete instances of reasoning to grope and often to go astray.

=== As sin ===
Fideism has received criticism from theologians who argue that fideism is not a proper way to worship God. According to this position, if one does not attempt to understand what one believes, one is not really believing. "Blind faith" is not true faith. Notable articulations of this position include:
* [[Peter Abelard]]&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Sic et Non]]''
* [[Lord Herbert]]&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury#De Veritate|De Veritate]]''

=== As relativism ===
Fideism can lead to [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 1998|title = Rationality and cultural relativism|encyclopedia=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfRXYYhpLekC |editor-link = Edward Craig (philosopher)| editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of other religions puts a fundamental question to fideists—if faith is the only way to know the truth of God, how are we to know which God to have faith in? Fideism alone is not considered an adequate guide to distinguish true or morally valuable revelations from false ones. An apparent consequence of fideism is that all religious thinking becomes equal. The major monotheistic religions become on par with obscure [[fringe religions]], as neither can be advocated or disputed.

=== A case for reason ===
{{main article |Relationship between religion and science#Philosophy of science}}
These critics note that people successfully use reason in their daily lives to solve problems and that reason has led to progressive increase of knowledge in the sphere of science. This gives credibility to reason and argumentative thinking as a proper method for seeking truth. [[Galileo Galilei]], for example, said that "I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use."

On the other hand, according to these critics, there is no evidence that a religious faith that rejects reason would also serve us while seeking truth.

The '''Finno-Ugrian suicide hypothesis''' proposes to link genetic ties originating among [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] [[culture]]s and [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]] to high rate of [[suicide]], claiming an [[allele]] common among them is responsible.

[[Mari people|Mari]] and [[Udmurt people|Udmurts]] have been found to have a three times higher suicide rate than Finns and Hungarians. It has been thus theorized that such a possible allele may have arisen in those populations.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990–1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting. A proposal based on the geographical study approach is offered to further the progress of investigations into the genetics of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://pms.sagepub.com/content/103/2/543.full.pdf|title=Ancestry, genes, and suicide: a test of the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis in the United States|journal=Percept Mot Skills|year=2006|volume=103|issue=2|pages=543–50|pmid=17165419|author=Voracek M|doi=10.2466/pms.103.2.543-550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is named for [[Henry Ford]]. It is used in [[social theory|social]], [[economic theory|economic]], and [[management theory]] about [[economic production|production]], [[working conditions]], [[economic consumption|consumption]], and related phenomena, especially regarding the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.willamette.edu/~fthompso/MgmtCon/Fordism_&amp;_Postfordism.html |title=Fordism &amp; Postfordism |publisher=www.willamette.edu |accessdate=2008-12-26 |last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Fordism is "the eponymous manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized, low-cost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeG05|De Grazia 2005]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as "a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor."&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven"&gt;Tolliday, Steven &amp; Zeitlin, Jonathan. ''The Automobile Industry and its Workers: Between Fordism and Flexibility'', St. Martin's Press (New York: 1987) pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry, the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process. Major success stemmed from three major principles:

# The standardization of the product (nothing is handmade, but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers)
# The employment of [[assembly line]]s, which use special-purpose tools and/or equipment to allow unskilled workers to contribute to the finished product
# Workers are paid higher "living" wages so that they can afford to purchase the products they make&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven" /&gt;

The principles, coupled with a technological revolution during Henry Ford's time, allowed for his revolutionary form of labor to flourish. His assembly line was revolutionary though not original as it had previously been used at slaughterhouses. His most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones, with the help of specialised tools.&lt;ref name="Editedby"&gt;Edited by; Burrows, Rober; Gilbert, Nigel; Pollert, Anna. ''Fordism and Flexibility: Divisions and Change'' St. Martin's Press (New York: 1992) pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used the same every time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dt13as.html|title=A Science Odyssey: People and Discoveries: Ford installs first moving assembly line|author=|date=|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; That allowed for a very adaptable flexibility, creating an assembly line that could change its constituent components to meet the needs of the product being assembled.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; In reality, the assembly line had already been around before Ford although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create. His real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components, only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination, thereby producing an optimum method for the real world.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt;

The major advantages of such a change was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate, and it deskilled the labour itself, cutting down on costs of production.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; There are four levels of Fordism, as described by [[Bob Jessop]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Ford Motor Company assembly line.jpg|thumb|Ford cars (Model A shown) became a symbol of effective mass production. Efficiency both decreased the price of the cars and allowed Ford to increase his workers' wages. Hence, common workers could buy their own cars.]]

The [[Ford Motor Company]] was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between 1890 and 1910. After five years of producing automobiles, Ford introduced the [[Ford Model T|Model T]], which was simple and light but sturdy enough to drive on the country's primitive roads.&lt;ref name="FonerEric"&gt;Foner, Eric (2006). Give Me Liberty!: An American History. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, pp. 591–592.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass production of this automobile lowered its unit price, making it affordable for the average consumer. Furthermore, Ford substantially increased his workers' wages&lt;ref&gt;Sward, Keith (1948). The Legend of Henry Ford. New York: Rinehart &amp; Company, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover, which approached 400% annually, which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become customers. That led to massive consumption. In fact, the Model T surpassed all expectations because it attained a peak of 60% of the automobile output within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production system that Ford exemplified involved synchronization, precision, and specialization within a company.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford and his senior managers did not use the word "Fordism" themselves to describe their motivations or worldview, which they did not consider an "[[wikt:ism#Noun|ism]]". However, many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name Fordism to it.&lt;ref name="Hounshell_1984_pp263,376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pages=263, 376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term gained prominence when it was used by [[Antonio Gramsci]] in 1934 in his essay "Americanism and Fordism" in his ''[[Prison Notebooks]]''. Since then, it has been used by a number of writers on [[economics]] and society, mainly but not exclusively in the [[Marxist]] tradition.

According to historian [[Charles S. Maier]], Fordism proper was preceded in Europe by [[Taylorism]], a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization, based upon supposedly-scientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems. It attracted European intellectuals, especially in Germany and Italy, from the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

After 1918, however, the goal of Taylorist labor efficiency thought in Europe moved to "Fordism," the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line, standardization, and the mass market. The grand appeal of Fordism in Europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society, by subordinating the economy, society, and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; The [[Great Depression]] blurred the utopian vision of American [[technocracy]], but [[World War II]] and its aftermath revived the ideal.

The principles of Taylorism were quickly picked up by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and applied to the industrialization of the [[Soviet Union]].

Later, under the inspiration of Gramsci, Marxists picked up the Fordism concept in the 1930s and developed [[Post-Fordism]] in the 1970s. Antonio and Bonanno (2000) trace the development of Fordism and subsequent economic stages, from globalization to neoliberal globalization, during the 20th century, and emphasized America's role in globalization. "Fordism," for Gramsci, meant routine, intensified labor to promote production. Antonio and Bonanno argue that Fordism peaked in the post-World War II decades of American dominance and mass [[consumerism]] but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on the people in the 1970s.

Advances in technology and the end of the [[Cold War]] ushered in a new "neoliberal" phase of globalization in the 1990s. Antonio and Bonanno further suggest that negative elements of Fordism, such as economic inequality, remained, allowing related cultural and environmental troubles, which inhibited America's pursuit of democracy to surface.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio and Bonanno, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Thomas Hughes has detailed how the [[Soviet Union]], in the 1920s and the 1930s, enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism by importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]] and the centrally-[[planned economy]] can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. Hughes quotes [[Joseph Stalin]]:&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;Hughes, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"American efficiency is that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognizes obstacles; which continues on a task once started until it is finished, even if it is a minor task; and without which serious constructive work is inconceivable.... The combination of the Russian revolutionary sweep with American efficiency is the essence of Leninism."&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;{{rp|251}}}}

Hughes describes how, as the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both the Soviets and the Americans chose to ignore or deny the contribution of American ideas and expertise. The Soviets did so because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to their rivals. Americans did so because they did not wish to acknowledge, during the Cold War, their part in creating a powerful rival.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

==Regulation theory==
{{original research|date=November 2012}}

Fordism is a key concept in the theories of the [[Regulation school]], often in contrast to [[post-Fordism]], and the term is also used in [[Western Marxism|Western Marxist]] thought.

[[File:Mall culture jakarta36.jpg|thumb|Mass consumption is the other side of Fordism.]]

In Regulation theory, it is a "regime of accumulation" or a macroeconomic pattern of growth, developed in the US and diffused in various forms to Western Europe after 1945. It consisted of domestic [[mass production]] with a range of institutions and policies supporting mass consumption, including stabilizing [[economic policies]] and [[Keynesian]] demand management that generated national demand and social stability; it also included a class compromise or social contract entailing family-supporting wages, job stability and internal labor markets leading broadly shared prosperity: rising incomes were linked to national productivity from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. At the level of the labor process Fordism is [[Taylorist]] and as a national mode of regulation Fordism is [[Keynesianism]].

The social-scientific concept of "Fordism" was introduced by the French [[regulation school]], sometimes known as [[regulation theory]], which is a Marxist-influenced strand of political economy. According to the regulation school, capitalist production paradigms are born from the crisis of the previous paradigm; a newborn paradigm is also bound to fall into crisis sooner or later. The crisis of Fordism became apparent to Marxists in late 1960s.

Marxist regulation theory talks of Regimes of Capital Accumulation (ROA) and Modes of Regulation (MOR). ROAs are periods of relatively settled economic growth and profit across a nation or global region. Such regimes eventually become exhausted, falling into crisis, and are torn down as capitalism seeks to remake itself and return to a period of profit. Such periods of capital accumulation are "underpinned," or stabilised, by MOR. A plethora of laws, institutions, social mores, customs and hegemonies both national and international work together to create the environment for long-run capitalist profit.

Fordism is a tag used to characterise the post-1945 long boom experienced by western nations. It is typified by a cycle of mass production and mass consumption, the production of standardized (most often) consumer items to be sold in (typically) protected domestic markets, and the use of Keynesian economic policies. While the standard pattern is postwar America, national variations of this standard norm are well known. Regulation theory talks of National Modes of Growth to denote different varieties of Fordism across western economies.

Fordism as an ROA broke down, dependent on national experiences, somewhere between the late 1960s and the mid-1970s. Western economies experienced slow or nil economic growth, rising inflation and growing unemployment, much of this as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil shock]].

==Post-Fordism==
[[File:Office Worker with Two Monitors.JPG|thumb|Information technology, white-collar work, and specialization are some of the attributes of post-Fordism.]]

The period after Fordism has been termed [[Post-Fordism|Post-Fordist]] and Neo-Fordist. The former implies that global capitalism has made a clean break from Fordism, including overcoming its inconsistencies, but the latter implies that elements of the Fordist ROA continued to exist. The Regulation School preferred the term After-Fordism (or the French ''Après-Fordisme'') to denote that what comes after Fordism was or is not clear.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, S. Brave new world. ''Marxism Today'', October 1988, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Post-Fordist economies:&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;
* New information technologies are important.
* Products are marketed to [[niche market]]s rather than in mass consumption patterns based on [[social class]].
* [[Service industry|Service industries]] predominate over manufacturing.
* The workforce is feminized.
* Financial markets are globalized.

'''Forward anonymity''', analogous to [[forward secrecy]], in [[computer security]] and [[cryptography]] is the property which prevents an attacker who has recorded past communications from discovering the identities of the participants, even after the fact.

When speaking of forward secrecy, system designers attempt to prevent an attacker who has recorded past communications from discovering the contents of said communications later on. One example of a system which satisfies the perfect forward secrecy property is one in which a compromise of one key by an attacker (and consequent [[decryption]] of messages encrypted with that key) does not undermine the security of previously used keys. Forward secrecy does not refer to protecting the content of the message, but rather to the protection of keys used to decrypt messages.

One example of a system which uses forward anonymity is a [[public key cryptography]] system, where the public key is well-known and used to [[encrypt]] a message, and an unknown private key is used to decrypt it. In this system, one of the keys is always said to be compromised, but messages and their participants are still unknown by anyone without the corresponding private key.

==History==
Originally introduced by  [[Whitfield Diffie]], [[Paul van Oorschot]], and Michael James Wiener to describe a property of STS ([[station-to-station protocol]]) involving a long term secret, either a private key or a shared password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diffie |first1=Whitfield |last2=Van Oorschot |first2=Paul C. |last3=Wiener |first3=Michael J. |title=Authentication and authenticated key exchanges |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |date=June 1992 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=107–125 |doi=10.1007/BF00124891 |url=http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/papers/sts-final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Key Cryptography==
Public Key Cryptography is a common form of a forward anonymous system. It is used to pass encrypted messages, preventing any information about the message from being discovered if the message is intercepted by an attacker. It uses two keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is published, and is used by anyone to encrypt a [[plaintext]] message. The Private key is not well known, and is used to decrypt [[cyphertext]]. Public key cryptography is known as an asymmetric decryption algorithm because of different keys being used to perform opposing functions. Public key cryptography is popular because, while it is computationally easy to create a pair of keys, it is extremely difficult to determine the private key knowing only the public key. Therefore, the public key being well known does not allow messages which are intercepted to be decrypted. This is a forward anonymous system because one compromised key (the public key) does not compromise the anonymity of the system.

==Web of Trust==
A variation of the public key cryptography system is a [[Web of trust]], where each user has both a public and private key. Messages sent are encrypted using the intended recipient's public key, and only this recipient's private key will decrypt the message. They are also signed with the senders private key. This creates added security where it becomes more difficult for an attacker to pretend to be a user, as the lack of a private key signature indicates a non-trusted user.

==Limitations==
A forward anonymous system does not necessarily mean a wholly secure system. A successful [[cryptanalysis]] of a message or sequence of messages can still decode the information without the use of a private key or long term secret.

==News==
Forward anonymity, along with other cryptography related properties, received a burst of media attention after the leak of classified information by [[Edward Snowden]], beginning in June, 2013, which indicated that the [[NSA]] and [[FBI]] had practices of asking companies to leave in back doors for them, allowing the companies and agencies to decrypt information stored on phones and other devices more easily, with the intention of allowing them to more easily find and arrest various criminals, while occasionally mistakenly targeting innocent civilians. They especially publicized the aid this practice provided in catching predatory [[pedophiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pagliery |first1=Jose |title=FBI director: iPhones shields pedophiles from cops |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/13/technology/security/fbi-apple/ |publisher=CNN |date=14 October 2014 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116194600/http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/13/technology/security/fbi-apple/ |archivedate=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents to this practice argue that leaving in a back door to law enforcement increases the risk of attackers being able to decrypt information, as well as questioning its legality under the [[US Constitution]], specifically being a form of illegal [[Search and Seizure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=van den Heuvel |first1=Katrina |last2=Cohen |first2=Stephen |title=Edward Snowden: A ‘Nation’ Interview |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/186129/snowden-exile-exclusive-interview |work=[[The Nation]] |date=28 October 2014 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204105726/http://www.thenation.com/article/186129/snowden-exile-exclusive-interview |archivedate=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geotechnical engineering''' is the branch of [[civil engineering]] concerned with the engineering behavior of [[earth materials]]. Geotechnical     engineering is important in civil engineering, but also has applications in [[military engineer|military]], [[mining engineering|mining]], [[petroleum engineering|petroleum]] and other [[engineering disciplines]] that are concerned with construction occurring on the surface or within the ground. Geotechnical engineering uses principles of [[soil mechanics]] and [[rock mechanics]] to investigate subsurface conditions and materials; determine the relevant physical/mechanical and chemical properties of these materials; evaluate [[Slope stability|stability of natural slopes]] and man-made soil deposits; assess risks posed by site conditions; design [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] and structure [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]]; and monitor site conditions, earthwork and foundation construction.&lt;ref name=TerzaghiPeckMesri&gt;Terzaghi, K., Peck, R.B. and Mesri, G. (1996), ''Soil Mechanics in Engineering Practice'' 3rd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. {{ISBN|0-471-08658-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HoltzKovacs&gt;Holtz, R. and Kovacs, W. (1981), ''An Introduction to Geotechnical Engineering'', Prentice-Hall, Inc. {{ISBN|0-13-484394-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical geotechnical engineering project begins with a review of project needs to define the required material properties. Then follows a site investigation of [[soil]], rock, fault distribution and [[bedrock]] properties on and below an area of interest to determine their engineering properties including how they will interact with, on or in a proposed [[construction]]. [[Site investigation]]s are needed to gain an understanding of the area in or on which the engineering will take place. Investigations can include the assessment of the risk to humans, property and the environment from natural hazards such as [[earthquake]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[sinkhole]]s, [[soil liquefaction]], [[debris flow]]s and [[rockfall]]s.

A geotechnical engineer then determines and designs the type of foundations, earthworks, and/or pavement subgrades required for the intended man-made structures to be built. Foundations are designed and constructed for structures of various sizes such as high-rise buildings, [[bridge]]s, medium to large commercial buildings, and smaller structures where the soil conditions do not allow code-based design.

Foundations built for above-ground structures include shallow and deep foundations. Retaining structures include earth-filled [[dams]] and retaining walls. Earthworks include [[Embankment (transportation)|embankments]], [[tunnel]]s, [[levee|dikes and levees]], [[Channel (geography)|channels]], [[reservoir]]s, deposition of [[hazardous waste]] and sanitary landfills.

Geotechnical engineering is also related to [[coastal engineering|coastal]] and [[Offshore construction|ocean engineering]]. Coastal engineering can involve the design and construction of [[wharves]], [[marina]]s, and [[jetties]]. Ocean engineering can involve foundation and anchor systems for [[offshore construction|offshore structures]] such as [[oil platforms]].

The fields of geotechnical engineering and [[engineering geology]] are closely related, and have large areas of overlap.  However, the field of geotechnical engineering is a specialty of [[engineering]], where the field of engineering geology is a specialty of [[geology]].

==History==
Humans have historically used soil as a material for flood control, irrigation purposes, burial sites, building foundations, and as construction material for buildings. First activities were linked to irrigation and flood control, as demonstrated by traces of dykes, dams, and canals dating back to at least 2000 BCE that were found in ancient [[Egypt]], ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Fertile Crescent]], as well as around the early settlements of [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]] and Harappa in the [[Indus valley]]. As the cities expanded, structures were erected supported by formalized foundations; [[Ancient Greeks]] notably constructed pad footings and [[strip-and-raft foundations]]. Until the 18th century, however, no theoretical basis for soil design had been developed and the discipline was more of an art than a science, relying on past experience.&lt;ref name=das&gt;{{cite book | last = Das | first = Braja | title = Principles of Geotechnical Engineering | publisher = Thomson Learning | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several foundation-related engineering problems, such as the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]], prompted scientists to begin taking a more scientific-based approach to examining the subsurface. The earliest advances occurred in the development of [[lateral earth pressure|earth pressure]] theories for the construction of [[retaining walls]]. Henri Gautier, a French Royal Engineer, recognized the "natural slope" of different soils in 1717, an idea later known as the soil's [[angle of repose]]. A rudimentary soil classification system was also developed based on a material's unit weight, which is no longer considered a good indication of soil type.&lt;ref name=das/&gt;&lt;ref name=budhu&gt;{{cite book | last = Budhu | first = Muni | title = Soil Mechanics and Foundations | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc | year = 2007 | ISBN = 978-0-471-43117-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of the principles of mechanics to soils was documented as early as 1773 when [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Charles Coulomb]] (a physicist, engineer, and army Captain) developed improved methods to determine the earth pressures against military ramparts. Coulomb observed that, at failure, a distinct slip plane would form behind a sliding retaining wall and he suggested that the maximum shear stress on the slip plane, for design purposes, was the sum of the soil cohesion, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and friction &lt;math&gt;\sigma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \tan(\phi\,\!)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the normal stress on the slip plane and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the friction angle of the soil. By combining Coulomb's theory with [[Christian Otto Mohr]]'s [[Mohr's circle|2D stress state]], the theory became known as [[Mohr-Coulomb theory]]. Although it is now recognized that precise determination of cohesion is impossible because &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is not a fundamental soil property,&lt;ref name=schofield&gt;Disturbed soil properties and geotechnical design, Schofield, Andrew N., Thomas Telford, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7277-2982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Mohr-Coulomb theory is still used in practice today.

In the 19th century [[Henry Darcy]] developed what is now known as [[Darcy's Law]] describing the flow of fluids in porous media. [[Joseph Boussinesq]] (a mathematician and physicist) developed theories of stress distribution in elastic solids that proved useful for estimating stresses at depth in the ground; [[William Rankine]], an engineer and physicist, developed an alternative to Coulomb's earth pressure theory. [[Albert Atterberg]] developed the [[Atterberg limits|clay consistency]] indices that are still used today for soil classification.&lt;ref name=das/&gt;&lt;ref name=budhu/&gt; [[Osborne Reynolds]] recognized in 1885 that shearing causes volumetric dilation of dense and contraction of loose granular materials.

Modern geotechnical engineering is said to have begun in 1925 with the publication of ''Erdbaumechanik'' by [[Karl Terzaghi]] (a civil engineer and geologist). Considered by many to be the father of modern soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, Terzaghi developed the principle of effective stress, and demonstrated that the shear strength of soil is controlled by effective stress. Terzaghi also developed the framework for theories of bearing capacity of foundations, and the theory for prediction of the rate of settlement of clay layers due to [[consolidation (soil)|consolidation]].&lt;ref name=das/&gt;&lt;ref name=schofield/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lambe and Whitman"&gt;Soil Mechanics, Lambe, T.William and Whitman, Robert V., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, John Wiley &amp; Sons., 1969. {{ISBN|0-471-51192-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1948 book, Donald Taylor recognized that interlocking and dilation of densely packed particles contributed to the peak strength of a soil. The interrelationships between volume change behavior (dilation, contraction, and consolidation) and shearing behavior were all connected via the theory of [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] using [[critical state soil mechanics]] by Roscoe, Schofield, and Wroth with the publication of "On the Yielding of Soils" in 1958. [[Critical state soil mechanics]] is the basis for many contemporary advanced [[constitutive model]]s describing the behavior of soil.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;Soil Behavior and Critical State Soil Mechanics, Wood, David Muir, Cambridge University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-521-33782-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geotechnical centrifuge modeling]] is a method of testing physical scale models of geotechnical problems. The use of a centrifuge enhances the similarity of the scale model tests involving soil because the strength and stiffness of soil is very sensitive to the confining pressure. The centrifugal acceleration allows a researcher to obtain large (prototype-scale) stresses in small physical models.

==Practicing engineers==
Geotechnical engineers are typically graduates of a four-year civil engineering program and some hold a [[masters degree]]. In the USA, geotechnical engineers are typically licensed and regulated as Professional Engineers (PEs) in most states; currently only [[California]] and [[Oregon]] have licensed geotechnical engineering specialties. The [http://www.geoprofessionals.org Academy of Geo-Professionals] (AGP) began issuing Diplomate, Geotechnical Engineering (D.GE) certification in 2008.  State governments will typically license engineers who have graduated from an [[ABET]] accredited school, passed the [http://www.ncees.org/Exams/FE_exam.php Fundamentals of Engineering] examination, completed several years of work experience under the supervision of a licensed Professional Engineer, and passed the [[Professional Engineering]] examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncees.org/engineering/engineering-licensure/ |title=Engineering licensure |accessdate=2017-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soil mechanics ==
[[File:Soil-phase-diagram.svg|thumb|A phase diagram of soil indicating the weights and volumes of air, soil, water, and voids.]]
{{Main|Soil mechanics|Rock mechanics}}

In geotechnical engineering, soils are considered a three-phase material composed of: rock or [[mineral]] particles, water and air. The voids of a soil, the spaces in between mineral particles, contain the water and air.

The engineering properties of soils are affected by four main factors: the predominant size of the mineral particles, the type of mineral particles, the grain size distribution, and the relative quantities of mineral, water and air present in the soil matrix. Fine particles (fines) are defined as particles less than 0.075&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.

===Soil properties===
{{Main|Soil mechanics}}
Some of the important properties of soils that are used by geotechnical engineers to analyze site conditions and design earthworks, retaining structures, and foundations are:&lt;ref name=HoltzKovacs/&gt;
; [[Specific weight|Specific weight or Unit Weight]]: Cumulative weight of the solid particles, water and air of the unit volume of soil. Note that the air phase is often assumed to be weightless.
; [[Porosity]]: Ratio of the volume of voids (containing air, water, or other fluids) in a soil to the total volume of the soil. Porosity is mathematically related to void ratio the by&lt;ref name="nptel_Void"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nptel.ac.in/courses/105103097/web/chap2final/s3.htm | title=Void Ratio | publisher=NPTEL | accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
n=\frac{e}{1+e}
&lt;/math&gt;
:here ''e'' is void ratio and ''n'' is porosity
; [[Void ratio]]: The ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of solid particles in a soil mass. Void ratio is mathematically related to the porosity by&lt;ref name="nptel_Void" /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
e=\frac{n}{1-n}
&lt;/math&gt;

; [[Permeability (fluid)|Permeability]]: A measure of the ability of water to flow through the soil. It is expressed in units of velocity.&lt;ref name="nptel_P"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nptel.ac.in/courses/105103097/web/chap6final/s1.htm | title=Permeability | publisher=NPTEL | accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Compressibility]]: The rate of change of volume with effective stress. If the pores are filled with water, then the water must be squeezed out of the pores to allow volumetric compression of the soil; this process is called consolidation.
; [[Shear strength (soil)|Shear strength]]: The maximum [[shear stress]] that can be applied in a soil mass without causing shear failure.&lt;ref name="nptel_S"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nptel.ac.in/courses/105103097/web/chap9final/s1.htm | title=Shear strength | publisher=NPTEL | accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Atterberg Limits]]: [[Atterberg limits#Liquid limit|Liquid limit]], [[Atterberg limits#Plastic limit|Plastic limit]], and [[Atterberg limits#Shrinkage limit|Shrinkage limit]]. These indices are used for estimation of other engineering properties and for [[soil classification]].

== Geotechnical investigation ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
{{Main|Geotechnical investigation}}

Geotechnical engineers and engineering geologists perform geotechnical investigations to obtain information on the physical properties of soil and rock underlying (and sometimes adjacent to) a site to design earthworks and foundations for proposed structures, and for repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions. A geotechnical investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, [[Exploration geophysics|geophysical methods]] are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves in-situ testing (two common examples of in-situ tests are the [[standard penetration test]] and [[cone penetration test]]). In addition site investigation will often include subsurface sampling and laboratory testing of the soil samples retrieved. The digging of test pits and trenching (particularly for locating [[Fault (geology)|faults]] and [[landslide|slide planes]]) may also be used to learn about soil conditions at depth. Large diameter borings are rarely used due to safety concerns and expense, but are sometimes used to allow a geologist or engineer to be lowered into the borehole for direct visual and manual examination of the soil and rock stratigraphy.

A variety of [[Geotechnical investigation#Soil sampling|soil samplers]] exist to meet the needs of different engineering projects. The [[standard penetration test]] (SPT), which uses a thick-walled split spoon sampler, is the most common way to collect disturbed samples. Piston samplers, employing a thin-walled tube, are most commonly used for the collection of less disturbed samples. More advanced methods, such as [[ground freezing]] and the Sherbrooke block sampler, are superior, but even more expensive.

[[Atterberg limits]] tests, [[water content]] measurements, and grain size analysis, for example, may be performed on disturbed samples obtained from thick walled [[Geotechnical investigation#Soil sampling|soil samplers]]. Properties such as shear strength, stiffness  hydraulic conductivity, and coefficient of [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidation]] may be significantly altered by sample disturbance. To measure these properties in the laboratory, high quality sampling is required.  Common tests to measure the strength and stiffness include the [[Triaxial shear tests|triaxial shear]] and unconfined compression test.

Surface exploration can include [[geologic map]]ping, [[Exploration geophysics|geophysical methods]], and [[photogrammetry]]; or it can be as simple as an engineer walking around to observe the physical conditions at the site.  Geologic mapping and interpretation of geomorphology is typically completed in consultation with a [[geologist]] or [[engineering geologist]].

[[Exploration geophysics|Geophysical exploration]] is also sometimes used.  Geophysical techniques used for subsurface exploration include measurement of [[seismic waves]] (pressure, shear, and [[Rayleigh waves]]), surface-wave methods and/or downhole methods, and electromagnetic surveys (magnetometer, resistivity, and [[ground-penetrating radar]]).

== Building foundations ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
{{Main|Foundation (engineering)}}
A building's foundation transmits loads from buildings and other structures to the earth. Geotechnical engineers design foundations based on the load characteristics of the structure and the properties of the soils and/or bedrock at the site. In general, geotechnical engineers:
# Estimate the magnitude and location of the loads to be supported.
# Develop an investigation plan to [[geotechnical investigation|explore the subsurface]].
# Determine necessary soil parameters through field and lab testing (e.g., [[consolidation (soil)|consolidation test]], [[triaxial shear test]], vane shear test, [[standard penetration test]]).
# Design the foundation in the safest and most economical manner.

The primary considerations for foundation support are [[bearing capacity]], settlement, and ground movement beneath the foundations. Bearing capacity is the ability of the site soils to support the loads imposed by buildings or structures. Settlement occurs under all foundations in all soil conditions, though lightly loaded structures or rock sites may experience negligible settlements. For heavier structures or softer sites, both overall settlement relative to unbuilt areas or neighboring buildings, and differential settlement under a single structure, can be concerns. Of particular concern is settlement which occurs over time, as immediate settlement can usually be compensated for during construction. Ground movement beneath a structure's foundations can occur due to shrinkage or swell of expansive soils due to climatic changes, frost expansion of soil, melting of permafrost, slope instability, or other causes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} All these factors must be considered during design of foundations.

Many building codes specify basic foundation design parameters for simple conditions, frequently varying by jurisdiction, but such design techniques are normally limited to certain types of construction and certain types of sites, and are frequently very conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Geotechnical_engineering|title=Geotechnical engineering - New World Encyclopedia|website=www.newworldencyclopedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas of shallow bedrock, most foundations may bear directly on bedrock; in other areas, the soil may provide sufficient strength for the support of structures. In areas of deeper bedrock with soft overlying soils, deep foundations are used to support structures directly on the bedrock; in areas where bedrock is not economically available, stiff "bearing layers" are used to support deep foundations instead.

===Shallow foundations===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
{{Main|Shallow foundation}}
[[Image:Slab on grade.JPG|thumb|right|Example of a slab-on-grade foundation.]]
Shallow foundations are a type of foundation that transfers building load to the very near the surface, rather than to a subsurface layer. Shallow foundations typically have a depth to width ratio of less than 1.

====Footings====
Footings (often called "spread footings" because they spread the load) are structural elements which transfer structure loads to the ground by direct areal contact. Footings can be isolated footings for point or column loads, or strip footings for wall or other long (line) loads. Footings are normally constructed from [[reinforced concrete]] cast directly onto the soil, and are typically embedded into the ground to penetrate through the zone of frost movement and/or to obtain additional bearing capacity.

====Slab foundations====
A variant on spread footings is to have the entire structure bear on a single slab of concrete underlying the entire area of the structure. Slabs must be thick enough to provide sufficient rigidity to spread the bearing loads somewhat uniformly, and to minimize differential settlement across the foundation. In some cases, flexure is allowed and the building is constructed to tolerate small movements of the foundation instead. For small structures, like single-family houses, the slab may be less than 300&amp;nbsp;mm thick; for larger structures, the foundation slab may be several meters thick.

Slab foundations can be either [[slab-on-grade foundation]]s or embedded foundations, typically in buildings with basements. Slab-on-grade foundations must be designed to allow for potential ground movement due to changing soil conditions.

===Deep foundations===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
[[Image:PileDriving.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Pile driver|Pile-driving]] for a bridge in [[Napa, California]].]]
{{Main|Deep foundations}}

Deep foundations are used for structures or heavy loads when shallow foundations cannot provide adequate capacity, due to size and structural limitations. They may also be used to transfer building loads past weak or compressible soil layers. While shallow foundations rely solely on the [[bearing capacity]] of the soil beneath them, deep foundations can rely on end bearing resistance, frictional resistance along their length, or both in developing the required capacity. Geotechnical engineers use specialized tools, such as the [[cone penetration test]], to estimate the amount of skin and end bearing resistance available in the subsurface.

There are many types of deep foundations including [[Deep foundation|piles]], drilled shafts, [[caisson (engineering)|caissons]], piers, and earth stabilized columns. Large buildings such as [[skyscraper]]s typically require deep foundations. For example, the [[Jin Mao Tower]] in [[China]] uses tubular steel piles about 1m (3.3&amp;nbsp;feet) driven to a depth of 83.5m (274&amp;nbsp;feet) to support its weight.

In buildings that are constructed and found to undergo settlement, [[underpinning]] piles can be used to stabilise the existing building.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

There are three ways to place piles for a deep foundation.  They can be driven, drilled, or installed by use of an auger.  Driven piles are extended to their necessary depths with the application of external energy in the same way a nail is hammered.  There are four typical hammers used to drive such piles:  drop hammers, diesel hammers, hydraulic hammers, and air hammers.  Drop hammers simply drop a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it, while diesel hammers use a single cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the Earth.  Similarly, hydraulic and air hammers supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air forces.  Energy imparted from a hammer head varies with type of hammer chosen, and can be as high as a million foot pounds for large scale diesel hammers, a very common hammer head used in practice.  Piles are made of a variety of material including steel, timber, and concrete.   Drilled piles are created by first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth, and filling it with concrete.  Drilled piles can typically carry more load than driven piles, simply due to a larger diameter pile.  The auger method of pile installation is similar to drilled pile installation, but concrete is pumped into the hole as the auger is being removed.&lt;ref name="Coduto, et al 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coduto|first=Donald|title=Geotechnical Engineering Principles and Practices|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Higher Education|location=New Jersey|isbn=9780132368681|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lateral earth support structures ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
{{Main|Retaining wall}}
A retaining wall is a structure that holds back earth. Retaining walls stabilize soil and rock from downslope movement or erosion and provide support for vertical or near-vertical grade changes. Cofferdams and bulkheads, structures to hold back water, are sometimes also considered retaining walls.

The primary geotechnical concern in design and installation of retaining walls is that the weight of the retained material is  creates [[lateral earth pressure]] behind the wall, which can cause the wall to deform or fail. The lateral earth pressure depends on the height of the wall, the density of the soil, the strength of the [[soil mechanics|soil]], and the amount of allowable movement of the wall. This pressure is smallest at the top and increases toward the bottom in a manner similar to hydraulic pressure, and tends to push the wall away from the backfill.  [[Groundwater]] behind the wall that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes an additional horizontal hydraulic pressure on the wall.

===Gravity walls===
Gravity walls depend on the size and weight of the wall mass to resist pressures from behind. Gravity walls will often have a slight setback, or batter, to improve wall stability. For short, landscaping walls, gravity walls made from dry-stacked (mortarless) stone or segmental concrete units (masonry units) are commonly used.

Earlier in the 20th century, taller retaining walls were often gravity walls made from large masses of concrete or stone. Today, taller retaining walls are increasingly built as composite gravity walls such as: geosynthetic or steel-reinforced backfill soil with precast facing; gabions (stacked steel wire baskets filled with rocks), crib walls (cells built up log cabin style from precast concrete or timber and filled with soil or free draining gravel) or soil-nailed walls (soil reinforced in place with steel and concrete rods).

For ''reinforced-soil gravity walls'', the soil reinforcement is placed in horizontal layers throughout the height of the wall. Commonly, the soil reinforcement is ''geogrid'', a high-strength polymer mesh, that provide tensile strength to hold soil together. The wall face is often of precast, segmental concrete units that can tolerate some differential movement. The reinforced soil's mass, along with the facing, becomes the gravity wall. The reinforced mass must be built large enough to retain the pressures from the soil behind it. Gravity walls usually must be a minimum of 30 to 40 percent as deep (thick) as the height of the wall, and may have to be larger if there is a slope or surcharge on the wall.

===Cantilever walls===
Prior to the introduction of modern reinforced-soil gravity walls, cantilevered walls were the most common type of taller retaining wall. Cantilevered walls are made from a relatively thin stem of steel-reinforced, cast-in-place concrete or mortared masonry (often in the shape of an inverted T). These walls cantilever loads (like a beam) to a large, structural footing; converting horizontal pressures from behind the wall to vertical pressures on the ground below. Sometimes cantilevered walls are buttressed on the front, or include a counterfort on the back, to improve their stability against high loads. Buttresses are short [[wing wall]]s at right angles to the main trend of the wall. These walls require rigid concrete footings below seasonal frost depth. This type of wall uses much less material than a traditional gravity wall.

Cantilever walls resist lateral pressures by friction at the base of the wall and/or ''passive earth pressure'', the tendency of the soil to resist lateral movement.

Basements are a form of cantilever walls, but the forces on the basement walls are greater than on conventional walls because the basement wall is not free to move.

===Excavation shoring===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
Shoring of temporary excavations frequently requires a wall design which does not extend laterally beyond the wall, so shoring extends below the planned base of the excavation.  Common methods of shoring are the use of ''sheet piles'' or ''soldier beams and lagging''. Sheet piles are a form of driven piling using thin interlocking sheets of steel to obtain a continuous barrier in the ground, and are driven prior to excavation. Soldier beams are constructed of wide flange steel H sections spaced about 2–3 m apart, driven prior to excavation. As the excavation proceeds, horizontal timber or steel sheeting (lagging) is inserted behind the H pile flanges.

In some cases, the lateral support which can be provided by the shoring wall alone is insufficient to resist the planned lateral loads; in this case additional support is provided by walers or tie-backs. Walers are structural elements which connect across the excavation so that the loads from the soil on either side of the excavation are used to resist each other, or which transfer horizontal loads from the shoring wall to the base of the excavation. Tie-backs are steel tendons drilled into the face of the wall which extend beyond the soil which is applying pressure to the wall, to provide additional lateral resistance to the wall.

== Earthworks ==
[[Image:Seabees compactor roller.jpg|thumb|A [[compactor]]/[[road roller|roller]] operated by U.S. Navy Seabees]]

{{See also|Earthworks (engineering)}}
*Excavation is the process of training earth according to requirement by removing the soil from the site.
*Filling is the process of training earth according to requirement by placing the soil on the site.
*[[Soil compaction|Compaction]] is the process by which the density of soil is increased and permeability of soil is decreased. Fill placement work often has specifications requiring a specific degree of compaction, or alternatively, specific properties of the compacted soil. In-situ soils can be compacted by rolling, deep [[dynamic compaction]], vibration, blasting, gyrating, kneading, compaction grouting etc.

==Ground improvement==
Ground Improvement is a technique that improves the engineering properties of the treated soil mass. Usually, the properties modified are shear strength, stiffness and permeability. Ground improvement has developed into a sophisticated tool to support foundations for a wide variety of structures. Properly applied, i.e. after giving due consideration to the nature of the ground being improved and the type and sensitivity of the structures being built, ground improvement often reduces direct costs and saves time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ground Improvement Technologies and Case Histories | publisher=Research Publishing Services | author=RAJU, V. R. | id=Ground Improvement – Principles And Applications In Asia | year=2010 | location=Singapore | pages=809 | isbn=978-981-08-3124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slope stabilization==
[[Image:Slopslump2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Simple slope slip section.]]
{{Main|Slope stability}}

Slope stability is the potential of soil covered slopes to withstand and undergo [[mass wasting|movement]]. Stability is determined by the balance of [[shear stress]] and [[shear strength (soil)|shear strength]]. A previously stable slope may be initially affected by preparatory factors, making the slope conditionally unstable. Triggering factors of a [[slope failure]] can be climatic events can then make a slope actively unstable, leading to mass movements. Mass movements can be caused by increases in shear stress, such as loading, lateral pressure, and transient forces. Alternatively, shear strength may be decreased by weathering, changes in [[pore water pressure]], and organic material.

Several modes of failure for earth slopes include falls, topples, slides, and flows.  In slopes with coarse grained soil or rocks, falls typically occur as the rapid descent of rocks and other loose slope material.  A slope topples when a large column of soil tilts over its vertical axis at failure.  Typical slope stability analysis considers sliding failures, categorized mainly as rotational slides or translational slides.  As implied by the name, rotational slides fail along a generally curved surface, while translational slides fail along a more planar surface.  A slope failing as a flow would resemble a fluid flowing downhill.

===Slope stability analysis===
{{Main|Slope stability analysis}}

Stability analysis is needed for the design of engineered slopes and for estimating the risk of slope failure in natural or designed slopes.  A common assumption is that a slope consists of a layer of soil sitting on top of a rigid base.  The mass and the base are assumed to interact via friction.  The interface between the mass and the base can be planar, curved, or have some other complex geometry. The goal of a slope stability analysis is to determine the conditions under which the mass will slip relative to the base and lead to slope failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pariseau|first=William G.|title=Design analysis in rock mechanics|year=2011|publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the interface between the mass and the base of a slope has a complex geometry, slope stability analysis is difficult and numerical solution methods are required.  Typically, the exact geometry of the interface is not known and a simplified interface geometry is assumed.  Finite slopes require three-dimensional models to be analyzed.  To keep the problem simple, most slopes are analyzed assuming that the slopes are infinitely wide and can therefore be represented by two-dimensional models.  A slope can be drained or undrained. The undrained condition is used in the calculations to produce conservative estimates of risk.

A popular stability analysis approach is based on principles pertaining to the limit equilibrium concept.  This method analyzes a finite or infinite slope as if it were about to fail along its sliding failure surface. Equilibrium stresses are calculated along the failure plane, and compared to the soils shear strength as determined by [[Shear strength (soil)#Drained shear strength|Terzaghi’s shear strength equation]].  Stability is ultimately decided by a factor of safety equal to the ratio of shear strength to the equilibrium stresses along the failure surface.  A factor of safety greater than one generally implies a stable slope, failure of which should not occur assuming the slope is undisturbed. A factor of safety of 1.5 for static conditions is commonly used in practice.

{{Main|Offshore geotechnical engineering}}

[[File:Offshore platforms.jpg|thumb|Platforms offshore Mexico.]]
''Offshore'' (or ''marine'') ''geotechnical engineering'' is concerned with foundation design for human-made structures in the [[sea]], away from the [[coast]]line (in opposition to ''onshore'' or ''nearshore'').&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;Dean, E.T.R. (2010). Offshore Geotechnical Engineering – Principles and Practice. Thomas Telford, Reston, VA, 520 p.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oil platform]]s, [[artificial island]]s and [[submarine pipeline]]s are examples of such structures. There are number of significant differences between onshore and offshore geotechnical engineering.&lt;ref name="Dean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;Gourvenec"&gt;Randolph, M. and Gourvenec, S., 2011. Offshore geotechnical engineering. Spon Press, N.Y., 550 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, ground improvement (on the seabed) and site investigation are more expensive, the offshore structures are exposed to a wider range of [[geohazard]]s, and the environmental and financial consequences are higher in case of failure. Offshore structures are exposed to various environmental loads, notably [[wind]], [[wind wave|wave]]s and [[Ocean current|currents]]. These phenomena may affect the integrity or the serviceability of the structure and its foundation during its operational lifespan – they need to be taken into account in offshore design.

In [[subsea]] geotechnical engineering, seabed materials are considered a two-phase material composed of 1) rock or [[mineral]] particles and  2) water.&lt;ref name="Das"&gt;Das, B.M., 2010. Principles of geotechnical engineering. Cengage Learning, Stamfort, 666 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;Atkinson, J., 2007. The mechanics of soils and foundations. Taylor &amp; Francis, N.Y., 442 p.&lt;/ref&gt;  Structures may be fixed in place in the seabed—as is the case for [[pier]]s, [[jetty]]s and fixed-bottom wind turbines—or may be a floating structure that remain roughly fixed relative to its geotechnical anchor point. Undersea mooring of human-engineered floating structures include a large number of [[Offshore drilling rig|offshore oil and gas platforms]] and, since 2008, a few [[floating wind turbine]]s.  Two common types of engineered design for anchoring floating structures include [[Tension-leg platform|tension-leg]] and [[catenary]] [[Mooring (watercraft)|loose mooring]] systems.  "Tension
leg mooring systems have vertical tethers under tension providing large restoring [[Moment of inertia|moments]] in pitch and roll. [[Catenary]] mooring systems provide station keeping for an offshore structure yet provide little stiffness at low tensions."&lt;ref name=mit200710&gt;

==Geosynthetics==

[[Image:Geocollage.JPG|thumb|right|230px|A collage of geosynthetic products.]]
{{Main|Geosynthetics}}

Geosynthetics are a type of plastic polymer products used in geotechnical engineering that improve engineering performance while reducing costs. This includes [[geotextiles]], [[geogrids]], [[geomembranes]], [[geocells]], and [[geocomposites]]. The synthetic nature of the products make them suitable for use in the ground where high levels of durability are required; their main functions include: drainage, filtration, reinforcement, separation and containment. [[Geosynthetics]] are available in a wide range of forms and materials, each to suit a slightly different end use, although they are frequently used together. These products have a wide range of applications and are currently used in many civil and geotechnical engineering applications including: roads, airfields, railroads, embankments, piled embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals, dams, landfills, bank protection and coastal engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, R.

[[File:AT1403 map.png|thumb|right|Guinean mangroves]]
The '''Guinean mangroves''' are a coastal [[ecoregion]] of [[mangrove]] swamps in rivers and estuaries near the ocean of West Africa from [[Senegal]] to [[Sierra Leone]].

==Location and description==
{{see also|List of rivers of Guinea-Bissau}}
Guinean mangroves can be found: in the [[Saloum River]] and [[Casamance]] deltas in Senegal; in the lower [[Gambia]] River basin; much of the coast of [[Guinea-Bissau]], including the [[Cacheu River|Cacheu]] and [[Mansoa River]]s; across the border in northern [[Guinea]]; and much of the coast of [[Sierra Leone]] including the [[Sherbro River]]. Mangroves thrive on flat coastal inlets and [[estuary|estuaries]] where the ocean tides wash warm salt water high upriver, in this ecoregion as far as 100&amp;nbsp;km, for example in the [[Farim River|Cacheu River]] of [[Guinea-Bissau]].&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Guinean mangroves|id=at1403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/j1533e/J1533E33.htm |title=Sierra Leone  |work=Status And Trends In Mangrove Area Extent Worldwide |publisher=FAO |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The mangroves have a varied composition with ''[[Rhizophora]]'', ''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]'' and ''[[Conocarpus erectus]]'' growing up to 10m tall among larger areas of ''Rhizophora'' and ''[[Avicennia]]''. The tallest trees may be {{convert|40|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and form the equivalent of gallery forests along the creeks, the [[mudflat]]s between the creeks having much shorter trees. The inland fringes of the forest are clad in grasses, ferns and salt-loving plants.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; However, the flora in the ecoregion is not as biodiverse as that of East African mangrove forests.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

==Fauna==
Mangrove swamps are important feeding grounds for fish, birds and animals. Marine wildlife includes oysters and shrimps. Mammals found here include the [[African manatee]]. Birds in these wet habitats include  [[Goliath heron]], [[purple heron]], [[cattle egret]], [[striated heron]], [[western reef heron]], [[greater flamingo]], [[lesser flamingo]], [[African spoonbill]], and [[African sacred ibis]].&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; The forests also provide important habitat for migratory birds.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

==Threats and preservation==
Mangrove habitats are under threat as trees are cut down for timber and firewood or to clear land for agriculture including rice farming. This habitat is also under threat from the lower amounts of precipitation in the region over the last few decades.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; In southern Senegal, efforts are being made to replant the mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=80906 |title=Senegal: Protecting livelihoods through mangroves |date=14 October 2008 |publisher=IRIN Africa |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban areas near the mangroves include the Gambian capital, [[Banjul]] and the Guinea-Bissau capital [[Bissau]]. National parks in the region include [[Saloum Delta National Park]] and [[Basse Casamance National Park]] in Senegal, [[Niumi National Park]] in Gambia, and Tarafes de [[Cacheu]] Natural Park in Guinea-Bissau. The Saloum [[river delta]] can also be accessed from the village of [[Foundiougne Department|Foundiougne]] in Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/development/body/publications/courier/courier196/en/en_069_ni.pdf |title=Senegal's mangrove forests |author= |date= |work=Country report |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32909">'''Habitat destruction''' is the process by which natural [[habitat]] is rendered incapable of supporting its native species. In this process, the organisms that previously used the site are displaced or destroyed, reducing [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euram     eri                 ca | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12 | bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habitat destruction by human activity is mainly for the purpose of harvesting [[natural resources]] for industrial production and [[urbanization]]. Clearing habitats for [[agriculture]] is the principal cause of habitat destruction. Other important causes of habitat destruction include [[mining]], [[logging]], [[trawling]], and [[urban sprawl]]. Habitat destruction is currently ranked as the primary cause of species [[extinction]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Pimm &amp; Raven, 2000, pp. 843-845&lt;/ref&gt; It is a process of natural environmental change that may be caused by [[habitat fragmentation]], geological processes, [[climate change]]&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; or by human activities such as the introduction of [[invasive species]], ecosystem nutrient depletion, and other human activities.

The terms '''habitat loss''' and '''habitat reduction''' are also used in a wider sense, including loss of habitat from other factors, such as [[water pollution|water]] and [[noise pollution]].

==Impacts on organisms==
In the simplest term, when a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other organisms that occupied the habitat have a reduced [[carrying capacity]] so that populations decline and [[extinction]] becomes more likely.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes &amp; Biggs, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the greatest threat to organisms and biodiversity is the process of habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;Barbault &amp; Sastrapradja, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Temple (1986) found that 82% of [[Endangered species|endangered bird species]] were significantly threatened by habitat loss. Most amphibian species are also threatened by habitat loss,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beebee|first1=Trevor J.C.|last2=Griffiths|first2=Richard A.|title=The amphibian decline crisis: A watershed for conservation biology?|journal=Biological Conservation|date=31 May 2005|volume=125|issue=3|page=271|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.04.009|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320705001825}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some species are now only breeding in modified habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Jang|first2=Yikweon|title=Description of a seminatural habitat of the endangered Suweon treefrog Hyla suweonensis|journal=Animal Cells and Systems|date=28 April 2015|volume=19|issue=3|page=216|doi=10.1080/19768354.2015.1028442|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19768354.2015.1028442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[endemism|Endemic]] organisms with limited ranges are most affected by habitat destruction, mainly because these organisms are not found anywhere else within the world, and thus have less chance of recovering. Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem, resulting in their extinction. Extinction may also take place very long after the destruction of habitat, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]]. Habitat destruction can also decrease the range of certain organism populations. This can result in the reduction of genetic diversity and perhaps the production of [[infertile]] youths, as these organisms would have a higher possibility of mating with related organisms within their population, or different species. One of the most famous examples is the impact upon China's [[giant panda]], once found across the nation. Now it is only found in fragmented and isolated regions in the southwest of the country, as a result of widespread [[deforestation]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-sichuan-panda-deforestation-habitat-mountain-conservation|title=The Panda's Forest: Biodiversity Loss|date=24 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Bolivia-Deforestation-EO.JPG|thumb|right|Satellite photograph of [[deforestation in Bolivia]]. Originally dry tropical forest, the land is being cleared for [[soybean]] cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Biodiversity hotspot]]s are chiefly [[tropical]] regions that feature high concentrations of [[Endemism|endemic]] species and, when all hotspots are combined, may contain over half of the world’s [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] species.&lt;ref name="Cincotta"&gt;Cincotta &amp; Engelman, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These hotspots are suffering from habitat loss and destruction.
Most of the natural habitat on islands and in areas of high human population density has already been destroyed (WRI, 2003). Islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include [[New Zealand]], [[Madagascar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Primack"&gt;Primack, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; South and East Asia — especially [[China]], [[India]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and Japan — and many areas in [[West Africa]] have extremely dense human populations that allow little room for natural habitat. Marine areas close to highly populated [[coast]]al cities also face degradation of their [[coral reef]]s or other marine habitat. These areas include the eastern coasts of Asia and Africa, northern coasts of [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean Sea]] and its associated [[island]]s.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

Regions of un[[sustainable agriculture]] or unstable governments, which may go hand-in-hand, typically experience high rates of habitat destruction.  [[Central America]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and the [[Amazonian tropical rainforest]] areas of [[South America]] are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices and/or government mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

Areas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction.  In the U.S., less than 25% of native vegetation remains in many parts of the [[Eastern United States|East]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;Stein et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Only 15% of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of Europe.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

==Ecosystems==
[[File:Lacanja burn.JPG|thumb|Jungle burned for agriculture in southern Mexico]]
[[Tropical rainforest]]s have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat. From the approximately 16 million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide, less than 9 million square kilometers remain today.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; The current rate of [[deforestation]] is 160,000 square kilometers per year, which equates to a loss of approximately 1% of original forest habitat each year.&lt;ref name="Laurance"&gt;Laurance, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forest [[ecosystem]]s have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical [[rainforest]]s.  [[Farming]] and [[logging]] have severely disturbed at least 94% of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forests]]; many [[old growth forest]] stands have lost more than 98% of their previous area because of human activities.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|Tropical deciduous dry forests]] are easier to [[Slash and burn|clear and burn]] and are more suitable for agriculture and [[cattle ranching]] than tropical rainforests; consequently, less than 0.1% of [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry forests in Central America's Pacific Coast]] and less than 8% in [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|Madagascar]] remain from their original extents.&lt;ref name="Laurance"/&gt;

[[File:Farmland-batang bungo.jpg|thumb|left|Farmers near newly cleared land within Taman Nasional Kerinci Seblat ([[Kerinci Seblat National Park]]), [[Sumatra]].]]
Plains and [[desert]] areas have been degraded to a lesser extent. Only 10-20% of the world's [[drylands]], which include [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]], [[Scrubland|scrub]], and [[Temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forests]], have been somewhat degraded.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman &amp; Pyke, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  But included in that 10-20% of land is the approximately 9 million square kilometers of seasonally dry-lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; The [[tallgrass prairie]]s of North America, on the other hand, have less than 3% of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland.&lt;ref&gt;White et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wetland]]s and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction. More than 50% of wetlands in the U.S. have been destroyed in just the last 200 years.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; Between 60% and 70% of European wetlands have been completely destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenga et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in demand for coastal housing and tourism which has caused a decline in marine habitats over the last 60 years. The rising sea levels and temperatures have caused [[soil erosion]], [[coastal flooding]], and loss of quality in the UK [[marine ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=535|title=United Kingdom: Environmental Issues, Policies and Clean Technology|date=2015-06-08|website=AZoCleantech.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one-fifth (20%) of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Burke et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; One-fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed, and another fifth has been severely degraded by [[overfishing]], pollution, and [[invasive species]]; 90% of the Philippines’ coral reefs alone have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="MEA"&gt;MEA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, over 35% of the [[Coastal ecosystems|mangrove ecosystems]] worldwide have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

==Natural causes==
Habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism, [[fire]], and climate change is well documented in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; One study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

==Human causes==
[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|Deforestation and roads in Amazonia, the [[Amazon Rainforest]].]]

Habitat destruction caused by humans includes [[land conversion]] from forests, etc. to [[arable land]], [[urban sprawl]], [[Public works|infrastructure development]], and other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land. Habitat degradation, fragmentation, and [[pollution]] are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat, yet result in habitat collapse. [[Desertification]], [[deforestation]], and [[Coral bleaching|coral reef degradation]] are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas ([[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, [[coral reef]]s).

Geist and Lambin (2002) assessed 152 case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation. Their results, yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor, provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant. The proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of [[agricultural expansion]] (96%), [[infrastructure expansion]] (72%), and [[wood extraction]] (67%). Therefore, according to this study, [[forest conversion]] to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation. The specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation: transport extension (64%), commercial wood extraction (52%), [[permanent cultivation]] (48%), [[cattle ranching]] (46%), shifting ([[slash and burn]]) cultivation (41%), [[subsistence agriculture]] (40%), and [[fuel wood]] extraction for domestic use (28%). One result is that [[shifting cultivation]] is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions, while transport extension (including the [[Road construction|construction of new roads]]) is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt;

Rising global temperatures, caused by the [[greenhouse effect]], contribute to habitat destruction, endangering various species, such as the [[polar bear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Predicting 21st-century polar bear habitat distribution from global climate models|url=|journal=Ecological Monographs|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1890/07-2089.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melting [[ice cap]]s promote rising sea levels and floods which threaten natural habitats and species globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Jason D.|last2=Littnan|first2=Charles L.|last3=Johnston|first3=David W.|date=2006-05-24|title=Potential effects of sea level rise on the terrestrial habitats of endangered and endemic megafauna in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v2/p21-30/|journal=Endangered Species Research|volume=2|pages=21–30|doi=10.3354/esr002021|issn=1863-5407}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galbraith|first=H.|last2=Jones|first2=R.|last3=Park|first3=R.|last4=Clough|first4=J.|last5=Herrod-Julius|first5=S.|last6=Harrington|first6=B.|last7=Page|first7=G.|date=2002-06-01|title=Global Climate Change and Sea Level Rise: Potential Losses of Intertidal Habitat for Shorebirds|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1675/1524-4695%282002%29025%5B0173%3AGCCASL%5D2.0.CO%3B2|journal=Waterbirds|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–183|doi=10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0173:GCCASL]2.0.CO;2|issn=1524-4695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drivers==
[[File:Crowded Nanjing Road in Shanghai.jpeg|thumb|Nanjing Road in Shanghai]]
While the above-mentioned activities are the proximal or direct causes of habitat destruction in that they actually destroy habitat, this still does not identify why humans destroy habitat.  The forces that cause humans to destroy habitat are known as ''drivers'' of habitat destruction.  [[Demographic]], economic, sociopolitical, scientific and technological, and cultural drivers all contribute to habitat destruction.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

Demographic drivers include the [[Human overpopulation|expanding human population]]; rate of [[Population growth|population increase]] over time; [[Population density|spatial distribution]] of people in a given area ([[List of urban areas by population|urban]] versus rural), ecosystem type, and country; and the combined effects of poverty, age, family planning, gender, and education status of people in certain areas.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;  Most of the exponential human population growth worldwide is occurring in or close to [[biodiversity hotspots]].&lt;ref name="Cincotta"/&gt;  This may explain why human population density accounts for 87.9% of the variation in numbers of [[threatened species]] across 114 countries, providing indisputable evidence that people play the largest role in decreasing [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;McKee et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The boom in human population and migration of people into such species-rich regions are making [[conservation biology|conservation efforts]] not only more urgent but also more likely to conflict with local human interests.&lt;ref name="Cincotta"/&gt;  The high local population density in such areas is directly correlated to the poverty status of the local people, most of whom lacking an education and family planning.&lt;ref name="Geist"&gt;Geist &amp; Lambin, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Geist and Lambin (2002) study described in the previous section, the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows (with the percent of the 152 cases the factor played a significant role in): economic factors (81%), institutional or policy factors (78%), technological factors (70%), cultural or socio-political factors (66%), and demographic factors (61%).  The main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets (68%), which are driven by national and international demands; urban industrial growth (38%); low domestic costs for land, labor, fuel, and timber (32%); and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops (25%).  Institutional and policy factors included formal pro-deforestation policies on land development (40%), economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement (34%), and subsidies for land-based activities (26%); property rights and land-tenure insecurity (44%); and policy failures such as corruption, lawlessness, or mismanagement (42%).  The main technological factor was the poor application of technology in the wood industry (45%), which leads to wasteful logging practices.  Within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values (63%), individual/household behavior (53%), public unconcern toward forest environments (43%), missing basic values (36%), and unconcern by individuals (32%).  Demographic factors were the in-migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas (38%) and growing population density—a result of the first factor—in those areas (25%).

There are also feedbacks and interactions among the proximate and underlying causes of deforestation that can amplify the process. Road construction has the largest feedback effect, because it interacts with—and leads to—the establishment of new settlements and more people, which causes a growth in wood (logging) and food markets.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt;  Growth in these markets, in turn, progresses the commercialization of agriculture and logging industries. When these industries become commercialized, they must become more efficient by utilizing larger or more modern machinery that often has a worse effect on the habitat than traditional farming and logging methods. Either way, more land is cleared more rapidly for commercial markets. This common feedback example manifests just how closely related the proximate and underlying causes are to each other.

==Impact on human population==
[[File:KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded edit2.jpg|thumb|The draining and development of coastal wetlands that previously protected the Gulf Coast contributed to severe flooding in New Orleans, Louisiana in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;Tibbetts, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Habitat destruction vastly increases an area's vulnerability to [[natural disaster]]s like [[flood]] and [[drought]], [[crop failure]], [[spread of disease]], and [[water contamination]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; On the other hand, a healthy ecosystem with good management practices will reduce the chance of these events happening, or will at least mitigate adverse impacts.

Agricultural land can actually suffer from the destruction of the surrounding landscape. Over the past 50 years, the destruction of habitat surrounding agricultural land has degraded approximately 40% of agricultural land worldwide via [[erosion]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], [[Soil compaction|compaction]], [[Natural resource#Depletion|nutrient depletion]], [[pollution]], and [[urbanization]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; Humans also lose direct uses of natural habitat when habitat is destroyed. Aesthetic uses such as [[birdwatching]], recreational uses like [[hunting]] and [[fishing]], and [[ecotourism]] usually rely upon virtually undisturbed habitat. Many people value the complexity of the natural world and are disturbed by the loss of natural habitats and animal or plant species worldwide.

Probably the most profound impact that habitat destruction has on people is the loss of many valuable [[ecosystem services]]. Habitat destruction has altered nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and [[carbon cycle]]s, which has increased the frequency and severity of [[acid rain]], [[algal bloom]]s, and [[fish kill]]s in rivers and oceans and contributed tremendously to global [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; One ecosystem service whose significance is becoming better understood is [[Climate|climate regulation]]. On a local scale, trees provide windbreaks and shade; on a regional scale, [[Transpiration|plant transpiration]] recycles rainwater and maintains constant annual rainfall; on a global scale, plants (especially trees from tropical rainforests) from around the world counter the accumulation of [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere by [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestering carbon dioxide]] through [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; Other ecosystem services that are diminished or lost altogether as a result of habitat destruction include [[watershed management]], [[nitrogen fixation]], oxygen production, [[pollination]] (see [[pollinator decline]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=5|year=2013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0063421|pmc=3661593|title=Plant Pollinator Networks along a Gradient of Urbanisation|author1=Benoît Geslin|author2=Benoit Gauzens|author3=Elisa Thébault|author4=Isabelle Dajoz|pmid=23717421|page=e63421|bibcode=2013PLoSO...863421G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[waste treatment]] (i.e., the [[Decomposition|breaking down]] and immobilization of [[toxic]] pollutants), and [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient recycling]] of [[sewage]] or [[agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

The loss of trees from the tropical rainforests alone represents a substantial diminishing of the earth’s ability to produce oxygen and use up carbon dioxide. These services are becoming even more important as increasing [[carbon dioxide]] levels is one of the main contributors to global [[climate change]].

The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] may not directly affect humans, but the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous. When biodiversity is lost, the environment loses many species that perform valuable and unique roles in the ecosystem. The environment and all its inhabitants rely on biodiversity to recover from extreme environmental conditions. When too much biodiversity is lost, a catastrophic event such as an earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption could cause an ecosystem to crash, and humans would obviously suffer from that. Loss of biodiversity also means that humans are losing animals that could have served as biological control agents and plants that could potentially provide higher-yielding crop varieties, pharmaceutical drugs to cure existing or future diseases or cancer, and new resistant crop varieties for agricultural species susceptible to pesticide-resistant insects or virulent strains of [[fungi]], [[virus]]es, and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

The negative effects of habitat destruction usually impact rural populations more directly than urban populations.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; Across the globe, poor people suffer the most when natural habitat is destroyed, because less natural habitat means fewer natural resources per capita, yet wealthier people and countries simply have to pay more to continue to receive more than their per capita share of natural resources.

Another way to view the negative effects of habitat destruction is to look at the opportunity cost of destroying a given habitat. In other words, what are people losing out on by taking away a given habitat? A country may increase its food supply by converting forest land to row-crop agriculture, but the value of the same land may be much larger when it can supply natural resources or services such as clean water, timber, ecotourism, or flood regulation and drought control.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

==Outlook==
The [[Human overpopulation|rapid expansion of the global human population]] is increasing the world’s food requirement substantially. Simple logic dictates that more people will require more food. In fact, as the world’s population increases dramatically, agricultural output will need to increase by at least 50%, over the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Tilman"&gt;Tilman et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, continually moving to new land and soils provided a boost in food production to meet the global food demand. That easy fix will no longer be available, however, as more than 98% of all land suitable for agriculture is already in use or degraded beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The impending global [[food crisis]] will be a major source of habitat destruction. Commercial farmers are going to become desperate to produce more food from the same amount of land, so they will use more [[fertilizer]]s and show less concern for the environment to meet the market demand. Others will seek out new land or will convert other land-uses to agriculture. Agricultural intensification will become widespread at the cost of the environment and its inhabitants. Species will be pushed out of their habitat either directly by habitat destruction or indirectly by fragmentation, [[environmental degradation|degradation]], or [[pollution]]. Any efforts to protect the world’s remaining natural habitat and biodiversity will compete directly with humans’ growing demand for natural resources, especially new agricultural lands.&lt;ref name="Tilman"/&gt;

==Solutions==
[[File:Hawaii turtle.JPG|thumb|''[[Chelonia mydas]]'' on a Hawaiian coral reef. Although the endangered species is protected, habitat loss from human development is a major reason for the loss of [[green turtle]] nesting beaches.]]
In most cases of tropical deforestation, three to four underlying causes are driving two to three proximate causes.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; This means that a universal policy for controlling tropical deforestation would not be able to address the unique combination of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in each country.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; Before any local, national, or international deforestation policies are written and enforced, governmental leaders must acquire a detailed understanding of the complex combination of proximate causes and underlying driving forces of deforestation in a given area or country.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; This concept, along with many other results of tropical deforestation from the Geist and Lambin study, can easily be applied to habitat destruction in general. Governmental leaders need to take action by addressing the underlying driving forces, rather than merely regulating the proximate causes. In a broader sense, governmental bodies at a local, national, and international scale need to emphasize the following:

#Considering the many irreplaceable ecosystem services provided by natural habitats.
#Protecting remaining intact sections of natural habitat.
#Educating the public about the importance of natural habitat and biodiversity.
#Developing [[family planning]] programs in areas of rapid population growth.
#Finding ecological ways to increase agricultural output without increasing the total land in production.
#Preserving habitat corridors to minimize prior damage from fragmented habitats.
#Reducing [[human population]] and expansion. Apart from improving access to contraception globally, furthering gender equality also has a great benefit. When women have the same education (decision-making power), this generally leads to smaller families.

'''Health psychology''' is the study of psychological and behavioral processes in health, illness, and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M. (1994). Current trends in Health Psychology. ''The Psychologist, 7,'' 114-118.&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with understanding how [[psychological]], [[behavior]]al, and [[culture|cultural]] factors contribute to physical health and illness. Psychological factors can affect health directly&lt;ref name="Simandan"&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. For example, chronically occurring environmental stressors affecting the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]], cumulatively, can harm health. Behavioral factors can also affect a person's health. For example, certain behaviors  can, over time, harm (smoking or consuming excessive amounts of alcohol) or enhance health (engaging in exercise).&lt;ref name="Ogden, J. 2012"&gt;Ogden, J. (2012). ''Health Psychology: A Textbook (5th ed.).'' Maidenhead, UK: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists take a [[Biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial]] approach. In other words, health psychologists understand health to be the product not only of biological processes (e.g., a virus, tumor, etc.) but also of psychological (e.g., thoughts and beliefs), behavioral (e.g., habits), and social processes (e.g., [[socioeconomic status]] and [[ethnicity]]).&lt;ref name="Ogden, J. 2012"/&gt;

By understanding psychological factors that influence health, and constructively applying that knowledge, health psychologists can improve health by working directly with individual patients or indirectly in large-scale public health programs. In addition, health psychologists can help train other healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians and nurses) to take advantage of the knowledge the discipline has generated, when treating patients. Health psychologists work in a variety of settings: alongside other medical professionals in hospitals and clinics, in [[public health]] departments working on large-scale behavior change and health promotion programs, and in universities and medical schools where they teach and conduct [[research]].

Although its early beginnings can be traced to the field of [[clinical psychology]],&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;Rogers, R. W. (1983). Preventive health psychology: An interface of social and clinical psychology. ''Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 1''(2), 120-127. {{doi|10.1521/jscp.1983.1.2.120}}&lt;/ref&gt; four different divisions within health psychology and one related field, [[occupational health psychology]] (OHP),&lt;ref&gt;Everly, G. S., Jr. (1986). An introduction to occupational health psychology. In P. A. Keller &amp; L. G. Ritt (Eds.), ''Innovations in clinical practice: A source book, Vol. 5'' (pp. 331-338). Sarasota, FL: Professional Resource Exchange.&lt;/ref&gt; have developed over time. The four divisions include clinical health psychology, [[public health]] psychology, community health psychology, and critical health psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David F. Marks, Michael Murray &amp; Emee Vida Estacio  2018)''Health Psychology. Theory-Research-Practice'' (5th Ed.) Sage |url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/health-psychology/book256917|date=2018-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional organizations for the field of health psychology include Division 38 of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health-psych.org/ Division 38]&lt;/ref&gt; the Division of Health Psychology of the [[British Psychological Society]] (BPS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health-psychology.org.uk/ Division of Health Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Health Psychology Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehps.net/ European Health Psychology Society]&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced credentialing in the US as a clinical health psychologist is provided through the [[American Board of Professional Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpp.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3308 American Board of Professional Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Recent advances in psychological, medical, and physiological research have led to a new way of thinking about health and illness. This conceptualization, which has been labeled the [[biopsychosocial model]], views health and illness as the product of a combination of factors including biological characteristics (e.g., genetic predisposition), behavioral factors (e.g., lifestyle, stress, health beliefs), and social conditions (e.g., cultural influences, family relationships, [[social support]]).

[[Psychologists]] who strive to understand how biological, behavioral, and social factors influence health and illness are called health psychologists. Health psychologists use their knowledge of psychology and health to promote general well-being and understand physical illness.&lt;ref name='BPS'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). What is health psychology? A guide for the public.&lt;/ref&gt; They are specially trained to help people deal with the psychological and emotional aspects of health and illness. Health psychologists work with many different health care professionals (e.g., physicians, dentists, nurses, physician's assistants, dietitians, social workers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, and chaplains) to conduct research and provide clinical assessments and treatment services. Many health psychologists focus on prevention research and interventions designed to promote healthier lifestyles and try to find ways to encourage people to improve their health. For example, they may help people to lose weight or stop smoking.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Health psychologists also use their skills to try to improve the healthcare system. For example, they may advise doctors about better ways to communicate with their patients.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; 
Health psychologists work in many different settings including the UK's [[National Health Service]] (NHS), private practice, universities, communities, schools and organizations. While many health psychologists provide clinical services as part of their duties, others function in non-clinical roles, primarily involving teaching and research. Leading journals include ''[[Health Psychology (journal)|Health Psychology]]'', the ''[[Journal of Health Psychology]]'', the ''British Journal of Health Psychology'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)2044-8287 The ''British Journal of Health Psychology'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=1758-0846&amp;site=1 ''Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being'']&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists can work with people on a one-to-one basis, in groups, as a family, or at a larger population level.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

;Clinical health psychology (ClHP)
:ClHP is the application of scientific knowledge, derived from the field of health psychology, to clinical questions that may arise across the spectrum of health care.  ClHP is one of many specialty practice areas for clinical psychologists. It is also a major contributor to the prevention-focused field of [[behavioral health]] and the treatment-oriented field of [[behavioral medicine]]. Clinical practice includes education, the techniques of [[behavior modification|behavior change]], and psychotherapy. In some countries, a clinical health psychologist, with additional training, can become a [[medical psychologist]] and, thereby, obtain prescription privileges.

;Public health psychology (PHP)
:PHP is population oriented. A major aim of PHP is to investigate potential causal links between psychosocial factors and health at the population level. Public health psychologists present research results to educators, policy makers, and health care providers in order to promote better public health. PHP is allied to other public health disciplines including [[epidemiology]], [[nutrition]], [[genetics]] and [[biostatistics]]. Some PHP interventions are targeted toward at-risk population groups (e.g., undereducated, single pregnant women who smoke) and not the population as a whole (e.g., all pregnant women).

;Community health psychology (CoHP)
:CoHP investigates community factors that contribute to the health and well-being of individuals who live in communities. CoHP also develops community-level interventions that are designed to combat disease and promote physical and mental health. The community often serves as the level of analysis, and is frequently sought as a partner in health-related interventions.

;Critical health psychology (CrHP)
:CrHP is concerned with the distribution of power and the impact of power differentials on health experience and behavior, health care systems, and health policy. CrHP prioritizes social justice and the universal right to health for people of all races, genders, ages, and socioeconomic positions. A major concern is health inequalities. The critical health psychologist is an agent of change, not simply an analyst or cataloger. A leading organization in this area is the [[International Society of Critical Health Psychology]].

Health psychology, like other areas of applied psychology, is both a theoretical and applied field. Health psychologists employ diverse research methods. These methods include controlled randomized [[experiment]]s, [[quasi-experiments]], [[longitudinal studies]], [[time-series]] designs, [[cross-sectional studies]], [[case-control]] studies, qualitative research as well as [[action research]]. Health psychologists study a broad range of variables including [[heart disease|cardiovascular disease]], ([[cardiac psychology]]), [[smoking]] habits, the relation of [[religious beliefs]] to health, [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]] use, social support, living conditions, emotional state, social class, and more. Some health psychologists treat individuals with sleep problems, headaches, alcohol problems, etc. Other health psychologists work to empower community members by helping community members gain control over their health and improve quality of life of entire communities.

==Origins and development==

Psychological factors in health had been studied since the early 20th century by disciplines such as [[psychosomatic medicine]] and later [[behavioral medicine]], but these were primarily branches of medicine, not psychology. Health psychology began to emerge as a distinct discipline of psychology in the United States in the 1970s. In the mid-20th century there was a growing understanding in medicine of the effect of behavior on health. For example, the [[Alameda County Study]], which began in the 1960s, showed that people who ate regular meals (e.g., breakfast), maintained a healthy weight, received adequate sleep, did not smoke, drank little alcohol, and exercised regularly were in better health and lived longer.&lt;ref&gt;Belloc, N., &amp; Breslow, L. (1972). Relationship of physical health status and health practices. ''Preventive Medicine, 1''(3), 409-421.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, psychologists and other scientists were discovering relationships between psychological processes and physiological ones.&lt;ref name = "Sterling and Eyer"&gt;Sterling, P., &amp; Eyer, J. (1981). Biological basis of stress-related mortality. ''Social Science &amp; Medicine. Part E, Medical Psychology, 15''(1), 3-42.&lt;/ref&gt; These discoveries include a better understanding of the impact of psychosocial stress on the cardiovascular and immune systems,&lt;ref name = "Sterling and Eyer"/&gt; and the early finding that the functioning of the immune system could be altered by learning.&lt;ref&gt;Ader, R. &amp; Cohen, N. (1975). Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 37''(4), 333–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have been working in medical settings for many years (in the UK sometimes the field was termed [[medical psychology]]). Medical psychology, however, was a relatively small field, primarily aimed at helping patients adjust to illness. In 1969, William Schofield prepared a report for the APA entitled ''The Role of Psychology in the Delivery of Health Services''.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, W. (1969). The role of psychology in the delivery of health services. ''American Psychologist, 24(6),'' 565-584.&lt;/ref&gt; While there were exceptions, he found that the psychological research of the time frequently regarded mental health and physical health as separate, and devoted very little attention to psychology's impact upon physical health. One of the few psychologists working in this area at the time, Schofield proposed new forms of education and training for future psychologists. The APA, responding to his proposal, in 1973 established a task force to consider how psychologists could (a) help people to manage their health-related behaviors, (b) help patients manage their physical health problems, and (c) train healthcare staff to work more effectively with patients.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M., Weinman, J. &amp; Chater, A. (2011). A healthy contribution. ''The Psychologist, 24''(12), 890-892.&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by [[Joseph Matarazzo]], in 1977, APA added a division devoted to health psychology. At the first divisional conference, Matarazzo delivered a speech that played an important role in defining health psychology. He defined the new field in this way, "Health psychology is the aggregate of the specific educational, scientific and professional contributions of the discipline of psychology to the promotion and maintenance of health, the prevention and treatment of illness, the identification of diagnostic and etiologic correlates of health, illness and related dysfunction, and the analysis and improvement of the healthcare system and health policy formation."&lt;ref&gt;Matarazzo, J. D.  (1980). Behavioral health and behavioral medicine:  Frontiers for a new health psychology. ''American Psychologist, 35,'' 807-818.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, similar organizations were established elsewhere. In 1986, the BPS established a Division of Health Psychology. The European Health Psychology Society was also established in 1986. Similar organizations were established in other countries, including Australia and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Belar, C. D., Mendonca McIntyre, T. &amp; Matarazzo, J. D. (2003). Health psychology. In D. K. Freedheim &amp; I. Weiner (Eds.), ''Handbook of Psychology. Vol.1: History of Psychology.'' New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Universities began to develop doctoral level training programs in health psychology. In the US, post-doctoral level health psychology training programs were established for individuals who completed a doctoral degree in clinical psychology.

A number of relevant trends coincided with the emergence of health psychology, including:
*Epidemiological evidence  linking behavior and health.&lt;ref name='BPS3'&gt;Johnson, M., Weinman, J., &amp; Chater, A. (2011) A healthy Contribution. Health Psychology, 24 (12) 890-902&lt;/ref&gt;
*The addition of behavioral science to medical school curricula, with courses often taught by psychologists.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*The training of health professionals in communication skills, with the aim of improving patient satisfaction and adherence to medical treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;
*Increasing numbers of interventions based on psychological theory (e.g., [[behavior modification]]).&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*An increased understanding of  the interaction between psychological and physiological factors leading to the emergence of [[psychophysiology]] and [[psychoneuroimmunology]] (PNI).&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*The health domain having become a target of research by social psychologists interested in testing theoretical models linking beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, M., &amp; Ajzen, I. (1975). ''Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research.'' Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The emergence of [[AIDS/HIV]], and the increase in funding for behavioral research the epidemic provoked.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;

In the UK, the BPS’s reconsideration of the role of the Medical Section prompted the emergence of health psychology as a distinct field. Marie Johnston and John Weinman argued in a letter to the ''BPS Bulletin'' that there was a great need for a Health Psychology Section. In December 1986 the section was established at the BPS London Conference, with Marie Johnston as chair.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; At the Annual BPS Conference in 1993 a review of "Current Trends in Health Psychology" was organized, and a definition of health psychology as "the study of psychological and behavioural processes in health, illness and healthcare" was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M. (1994). Health psychology:Current trends. The Psychologist, 7,114–118.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Health Psychology Section  became a Special Group in 1993 and was awarded divisional status within the UK  in 1997. The awarding of divisional status meant that the individual training needs and professional practice of health psychologists were recognized, and  members were able to obtain chartered status with the BPS. The BPS went on to regulate training and practice in health psychology until  the regulation of professional standards and qualifications was taken over by statutory registration with the [[Health Professions Council]] in 2010.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;

==Objectives==

===Understanding behavioral and contextual factors===
Health psychologists conduct research to identify behaviors and experiences that promote health, give rise to illness, and influence the effectiveness of health care. They also recommend ways to improve health care policy.&lt;ref&gt;Sharman, S.J.; Garry, M.; Jacobsen, J.A.; Loftus, E.F.; &amp; Ditto, P.H. (2008). False memories for end-of-life decisions. ''Health Psychology'', 27, 291–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists have worked on developing ways to reduce smoking&lt;ref&gt;Dusseldorp, E.; van Elderen, T.; &amp; Maes, S.; [[Jacqueline Meulman|Meulman, J.]] &amp; Kraaij, V. (1999). A meta-analysis of psychoeducational programs for coronary heart disease patients. ''Health Psychology'', 18, 506–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and improve daily nutrition&lt;ref&gt;Resnicow, K.; Jackson, A.; Blissett, D.; Wang, T.; McCarty, F.; Rahotep, S.; &amp; Periasamy, S. (2005). Results of the Healthy Body Healthy Spirit Trial. ''Health Psychology'', 24, 339–48.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to promote health and prevent illness. They have also studied the association between illness and individual characteristics. For example, health psychology has found a relation between the personality characteristics of thrill seeking, impulsiveness, hostility/anger, emotional instability, and depression, on one hand, and high-risk driving, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Beirness, D.J. (1993). Do we really drive as we live? The role of personality factors in road crashes. ''Alcohol, Drugs &amp; Driving'', 9, 129–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychology is also concerned with contextual factors, including economic, cultural, community, social, and lifestyle factors that influence health&lt;ref name = "Simandan"/&gt;. The [[biopsychosocial model]] can help in understanding the relation between contextual factors and biology in affecting health&lt;ref name = "Martire"&gt;Martire, L.M. and Franks, M.M., 2014. The role of social networks in adult health: Introduction to the special issue. Health Psychology, 33(6), pp.501-504.&lt;/ref&gt;. Physical addiction impedes smoking cessation. Some research suggests that seductive advertising also contributes to psychological dependency on tobacco,&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, J.P.; &amp; Gilpin, E.A. (1995). A historical analysis of tobacco marketing and the uptake of smoking by youth in the United States: 1890–1977. ''Health Psychology'', 14, 500–508.&lt;/ref&gt; although other research has found no relationship between media exposure and smoking in youth.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson C.J. &amp; Meehan, D.C. (2011). With friends like these...: Peer delinquency influences across age cohorts on smoking, alcohol and illegal substance use. ''European Psychiatry'', 26(1), 6–12.&lt;/ref&gt; OHP research indicates that people in jobs that combine little decision latitude with a high psychological workload are at increased risk for [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenström, T., Hintsanen, M., Jokela, M., Keltikangas-Järvinen, L., Kivimäki, M., Juonala, M., &amp; ... Viikari, J. S. (2011). Change in job strain and progression of atherosclerosis: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 16''(1), 139-150. {{doi|10.1037/a0021752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J.V., Stewart, W., Hall, E.M., Fredlund, P., &amp; Theorell, T. (1996). Long-term psychosocial work environment and cardiovascular mortality among Swedish men. ''American Journal of Public Health, 86''(3), 324–31. {{doi|10.2105/AJPH.86.3.324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other OHP research reveals a relation between unemployment and elevations in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Ilies, R., Dimotakis, N., &amp; Watson, D. (2010). Mood, blood pressure, and heart rate at work: An experience-sampling study. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 15''(2), 120-130. {{doi|10.1037/a0018350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasl, S.V. &amp; Cobb, S. (1970). Blood pressure changes in men undergoing job loss: A preliminary report. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 32''(1), 19–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemiologic research documents a relation between social class and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;Marmot, M.G. &amp; Theorell, T. (1988). Social class and cardiovascular disease: The contribution of work. ''International Journal of Health Services, 18'', 659–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychologists also aim to change health behaviors for the dual purpose of helping people stay healthy and helping patients adhere to disease treatment regimens (also see [[health action process approach]]). Health psychologists employ [[cognitive behavior therapy]] and [[applied behavior analysis]] (also see [[behavior modification]]) for that purpose.

===Preventing illness===
Health psychologists promote health through behavioral change, as mentioned above; however, they attempt to prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people to make changes in their lives such as stopping smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol they consume, eating more healthily, and exercising regularly.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive [[emotional]] states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, C.K.; Jamner, L.D.; Henker, B. &amp; Delfino, R.J. (2001). Smoking and moods in adolescents with depressive and aggressive dispositions: Evidence from surveys and electronic diaries. ''Health Psychology'', 20, 99–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because many people do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is [[anti-smoking campaign]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, J.C.; Niederdeppe, J. &amp; Evans, W.D. (2005). The theory of 'truth': How counterindustry campaigns affect smoking behavior among teens. ''Health Psychology'', 24, 22–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychologists help to promote health and well-being by preventing illness.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Some illnesses can be more effectively treated if caught early. Health psychologists have worked to understand why some people do not seek early screenings or immunizations, and have used that knowledge to develop ways to encourage people to have early health checks for illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Health psychologists are also finding ways to help people to avoid risky behaviors (e.g., engaging in unprotected sex) and encourage health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., regular tooth brushing or hand washing).&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

Health psychologists also aim at educating health professionals, including physicians and nurses, in communicating effectively with patients in ways that overcome barriers to understanding, remembering, and implementing effective strategies for reducing exposures to risk factors and making health-enhancing behavior changes.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, J.; Bavalia, K.; Bull, M.; Frankum, S.; Goldie, C.; Gosslau, M.; et al. (2004) 'I want more time with my doctor': A quantitative study of time and the consultation. ''Family Practice'', 21, 479–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence from OHP that stress-reduction interventions at the workplace can be effective. For example, Kompier and his colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Kompier, M.A.J.; Aust, B.; van den Berg, A.-M. &amp; Siegrist, J. (2000). Stress prevention in bus drivers: Evaluation of 13 natural experiments. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology'', 5, 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that a number of interventions aimed at reducing stress in bus drivers has had beneficial effects for employees and bus companies.

===The effects of disease===
Health psychologists investigate how disease affects individuals' psychological well-being. An individual who becomes seriously ill or injured faces many different practical stressors. These stressors include problems meeting medical and other bills, problems obtaining proper care when home from the hospital, obstacles to caring for dependents, the experience of having one's sense of self-reliance compromised, gaining a new, unwanted identity as that of a sick person, and so on. These stressors can lead to depression, reduced self-esteem, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cassileth, B.R.; Lusk, E.J.; Strouse, T.B.; Miller, D.S.; Brown, L.L.; Cross, P.A. &amp; Tenaglia, A.N. (1984). Psychosocial status in chronic illness. ''New England Journal of Medicine, 311'', 506–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychology also concerns itself with bettering the lives of individuals with [[terminal illness]]. When there is little hope of recovery, health psychologist therapists can improve the quality of life of the patient by helping the patient recover at least some of his or her psychological well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Lander, D.A. &amp; Graham-Pole, J.R. (2008). Love medicine for the dying and their caregivers: The body of evidence. ''Journal of Health Psychology, 13'', 201–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists are also concerned with providing therapeutic services for the bereaved.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J.M.; Forrest, L.M. &amp; Austin, A.E. (2002). Death of a partner: Perspectives of heterosexual and gay men. ''Journal of Health Psychology, 7'', 317–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical analysis of health policy===
Critical health psychologists explore how health policy can influence inequities, inequalities and social injustice &lt;ref name = "Martire"/&gt;. These avenues of research expand the scope of health psychology beyond the level of individual health to an examination of the social and economic determinants of health both within and between regions and nations. The individualism of mainstream health psychology has been critiqued and deconstructed by critical health psychologists using qualitative methods that zero in on the health experience.&lt;ref name="Marks, D.F. 2011"&gt;Marks, D.F., Murray, M., Evans, B., &amp; Estacio, E.V. (2011). [http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book233714?contribId=516262&amp; ''Health psychology. Theory-research-practice''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006160053/http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book233714?contribId=516262&amp; |date=2011-10-06 }} (3rd Ed.) Thousand Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conducting research===
Like psychologists in the other main psychology disciplines, health psychologists have advanced knowledge of research methods. Health psychologists apply this knowledge to conduct research on a variety of questions.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; For example, health psychologists carry out research to answer questions such as: 
* What influences healthy eating?
* How is stress linked to heart disease? 
* What are the emotional effects of genetic testing?
* How can we change people’s health behavior to improve their health?&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

===Teaching and communication===
{{main|Health communication}}

Health psychologists can also be responsible for training other health professionals on how to deliver interventions to help promote healthy eating, stopping smoking, weight loss, etc. Health psychologists also train other health professionals in communication skills such as how to break bad news or support behavior change for the purpose of improving adherence to treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;

==Applications==

===Improving doctor–patient communication===
Health psychologists aid the process of communication between physicians and patients during medical consultations. There are many problems in this process, with patients showing a considerable lack of understanding of many medical terms, particularly anatomical terms (e.g., intestines).&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, C.M. (1970). Difference between patients' and doctors' interpretation of some common medical terms. ''British Medical Journal, 2'', 286–89.&lt;/ref&gt; One area of research on this topic involves "doctor-centered" or "patient-centered" consultations. Doctor-centered consultations are generally directive, with the patient answering questions and playing less of a role in decision-making. Although this style is preferred by elderly people and others, many people dislike the sense of hierarchy or ignorance that it inspires. They prefer patient-centered consultations, which focus on the patient's needs, involve the doctor listening to the patient completely before making a decision, and involving the patient in the process of choosing treatment and finding a diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Dowsett, S.M., Saul, J.L., Butow, P.N., Dunn, S.M., Boyer, M.J., Findlow, R., &amp; Dunsmore, J. (2000). Communication styles in the cancer consultation: Preferences for a patient-centred approach. ''Psycho-Oncology, 9'', 147–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improving adherence to medical advice===
Health psychologists engage in research and practice aimed at getting people to follow medical advice and adhere to their treatment regimens. Patients often forget to take their pills or consciously opt not to take their prescribed medications because of side effects. Failing to take prescribed medication is costly and wastes millions of usable medicines that could otherwise help other people. Estimated adherence rates are difficult to measure (see below); there is, however, evidence that adherence could be improved by tailoring treatment programs to individuals' daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, M.; Hampson, S.E.; Avery, L. &amp; Simpson, R. (2004). Effects of a tailored lifestyle self-management intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes. ''British Journal of Health Psychology'', 9 (Pt 3), 365–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, traditional cognitive-behavioural therapies have been adapted for people suffering from chronic illnesses and comorbid psychological distress to include modules that encourage, support and reinforce adherence to medical advice as part of the larger treatment approach.&lt;ref&gt;Safren, S., Gonzalez, J., Wexler, D., Psaros, C., Delahanty, L., Blashill, A., . . . Cagliero, E. (2014). A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adherence and Depression (CBT-AD) in Patients With Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes. Diabetes Care, 37 (3): 625-633. {{doi|10.2337/dc13-0816}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ways of measuring adherence====
Health psychologists have identified a number of ways of measuring patients' adherence to medical regimens:
* Counting the number of pills in the medicine bottle
* Using self-reports
* Using "Trackcap" bottles, which track the number of times the bottle is opened.&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, P. (2002). ''Psychology in practice: Health''. London, England: Hodder &amp; Stoughton Educational.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managing pain===
Health psychology attempts to find treatments to reduce or eliminate pain, as well as understand pain anomalies such as episodic [[analgesia]], [[causalgia]], [[neuralgia]], and [[phantom limb pain]]. Although the task of measuring and describing pain has been problematic, the development of the [[McGill Pain Questionnaire]]&lt;ref&gt;Melzack, R. (1975). The McGill Pain Questionnaire: Major properties and scoring methods. ''Pain, 1''(3), 277–299.&lt;/ref&gt; has helped make progress in this area. Treatments for pain involve patient-administered [[analgesia]], [[acupuncture]] (found to be effective in reducing pain for [[osteoarthritis]] of the knee&lt;ref&gt;Berman, B.; Singh B.B.; Lao, L.; Langenberg, P.; Li, H.; Hadhazy, V.; Bareta, J. &amp; Hochberg, M. (1999). A randomized trial of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy in osteoarthritis of the knee. ''Rheumatology, 38''(4), 346–54.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[biofeedback]], and [[cognitive behavior therapy]].

===Health psychologist roles===
Below are some examples of the types of positions held by health psychologists within applied settings such as the UK's NHS and private practice.
*'''Consultant health psychologist''': A consultant health psychologist will take a lead for health psychology within public health, including managing tobacco control and smoking cessation services and providing professional leadership in the management of health trainers.&lt;ref name='BPS1'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). Health psychology: A guide for employees.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Principal health psychologist''': A principal  health psychologist could, for example lead the health psychology service within one of the UK’s leading heart and lung hospitals, providing a clinical service to patients and advising all members of the multidisciplinary team.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Health psychologist''': An example of a health psychologist's role would be to provide health psychology input to a center for weight management. Psychological assessment of treatment, development and delivery of a tailored weight management program, and advising on approaches to improve adherence to health advice and medical treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Research psychologist''': Research health psychologists carry out health psychology research, for example, exploring the psychological impact of receiving a diagnosis of dementia, or evaluating ways of providing psychological support for people with burn injuries. Research can also be in the area of health promotion, for example investigating the determinants of healthy eating or physical activity or understanding why people misuse substances.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Health psychologist in training/assistant health psychologist''': As an assistant/in training, a health psychologist will gain experience assessing patients, delivering psychological interventions to change health behaviors, and conducting research, whilst being supervised by a qualified health psychologist.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;

==Training==
{{See also|List of universities with health psychology programs}}

In the UK, health psychologists are registered by the [[Health Professions Council]] (HPC) and have trained to a level to be eligible for full membership of the Division of Health Psychology within the BPS.&lt;ref name='BPS2'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). ''Health Psychology in applied settings: A guide for employers''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Registered health psychologists who are chartered with the BPS will have undertaken a minimum of six years of training and will have specialized in health psychology for a minimum of three years.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; Health psychologists in training must have completed BPS stage 1 training and be registered with the BPS Stage 2 training route or with a BPS-accredited university doctoral health psychology program. Once qualified, health psychologists can work in a range of settings, for example the NHS, universities, schools, private healthcare, and research and charitable organizations.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; A health psychologist in training might be working within applied settings while working towards registration and chartered status.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; A health psychologist will have demonstrated competencies in all of the following areas:
* professional skills (including implementing ethical and legal standards, communication, and teamwork),
* research skills (including designing, conducting, and analyzing psychological research in numerous areas),
* consultancy skills (including planning and evaluation),
* teaching and training skills (including knowledge of designing, delivering, and evaluating large and small scale training program),
* intervention skills (including delivery and evaluation of behavior change interventions).&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
All qualified health psychologists must also engage in and record their [[continuing professional development]] (CPD) for psychology each year throughout their career.&lt;ref name= 'BPS2' /&gt;

[[File:Plano formas.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hull form lines, lengthwise and in cross-section]]
The '''hull''' is the [[watertight]] body of a [[ship]] or boat. Atop the hull may be a [[deckhouse]] or some other form of superstructure, like a [[Mast (sailing)|mast]]. The line where the hull meets the water surface is called the [[waterline]].

The structure of the hull varies depending on the vessel type. In a typical modern steel ship, the structure consists of watertight and non-tight decks, major transverse and watertight (and also sometimes non-tight or longitudinal) members called [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]], intermediate members such as [[girders]], [[wikt:stringer|stringers]] and [[I-beam|webs]], and minor members called ordinary transverse frames, frames, or longitudinals, depending on the [[structural arrangement]]. The uppermost continuous deck may be called the "upper deck", "weather deck", "spar deck", "[[main deck]]", or simply "deck". The particular name given depends on the context—the type of ship or boat, the arrangement, or even where it sails. Not all hulls are decked (for instance a [[dinghy]]).

In a typical wooden sailboat, the hull is constructed of wooden planking, supported by transverse frames (often referred to as ribs) and bulkheads, which are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling. Often but not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a [[keel]]. In [[fiberglass]] or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or steel vessels to some extent, or be of a [[Monocoque#Boats and ships|monocoque]] arrangement. In many cases, composite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber-reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, balsa wood, impregnated paper honeycomb or other material.

==History==
[[File:Vasas hull profile.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the Swedish warship, [[Vasa (ship)|''Vasa'']].]]
{{expand section | examples and additional citations|date = June 2017}}
Rafts have a hull of sorts, however, hulls of the [[Stone Age|earliest design]] are thought to have each consisted of a hollowed out [[tree]] bole: in effect the first [[canoe]]s. Hull form then proceeded to the [[coracle]] shape and on to more sophisticated forms as the science of [[naval architecture]] advanced.

By around [[30th century BC|3000 BC]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ians knew how to assemble wooden [[plank (wood)|planks]] into a [[hull (ship)|hull]].&lt;ref name="AIA"&gt;Ward, Cheryl.  "World's Oldest Planked Boats," in ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' (Volume 54, Number 3, May/June 2001). [[Archaeological Institute of America]]. [http://www.archaeology.org/0105/abstracts/abydos3.html Archaeology.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==General features==
The shape of the hull is entirely dependent upon the needs of the design. Shapes range from a nearly perfect box in the case of scow barges, to a needle-sharp surface of revolution in the case of a racing multihull sailboat. The shape is chosen to strike a balance between cost, hydrostatic considerations (accommodation, load carrying and stability), hydrodynamics (speed, power requirements, and motion and behavior in a seaway) and special considerations for the ship's role, such as the rounded bow of an [[icebreaker]] or the flat bottom of a [[landing craft]].

==Hull shapes==
{{Further|Chine (boating)}}
Hulls come in many varieties and can have composite shape, (e.g., a fine entry forward and inverted bell shape aft), but are grouped primarily as follows:
* Chined and Hard-chined. Examples are the flat-bottom (chined), v-bottom, and multi-bottom hull (hard chined). These types have at least one pronounced knuckle throughout all or most of their length.
* Moulded, round bilged or soft-[[chine (boating)|chined]]. These hull shapes all have smooth curves. Examples are the round bilge, semi-round bilge, and s-bottom hull.

===Categorization===
&lt;!-- [[Waterline]] links to this section --&gt;

After this they can be categorized as:
* Displacement
The hull is supported exclusively or predominantly by [[buoyancy]]. Vessels that have this type of hull travel through the water at a limited rate that is defined by the waterline length. They are often, though not always, heavier than planing types.
* Planing
[[File:Royal Navy MTB 5.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Navy]] World War II [[Motor Torpedo Boat|MTB]] planing at speed on calm water showing its [[Chine (boating)#Various types of chine hulls|hard chine hull]] with most of the forepart of the boat out of the water.]]
The [[Planing (boat)|planing]] hull form is configured to develop positive dynamic pressure so that its draft decreases with increasing speed. The dynamic lift reduces the wetted surface and therefore also the drag. They are sometimes flat-bottomed, sometimes V-bottomed and more rarely, round-bilged. The most common form is to have at least one chine, which makes for more efficient planing and can throw spray down. Planing hulls are more efficient at higher speeds&lt;!-- Removed the suggestion that hull speed is a "maximum" speed which can't be overcome -- see [[Hull speed]] or &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boatdesign.net/forums/boat-design/hull-speed-1220.html|title=Hull speed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an explanation of this missconception --&gt;, although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds. An effective planing hull must be as light as possible with flat surfaces that are consistent with good sea keeping. Sail boats that plane must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds.
* Semi-displacement, or semi-planing
The hull form is capable of developing a moderate amount of dynamic lift; however, most of the vessel's weight is still supported through buoyancy.

===Most used hull forms===
At present, the most widely used form is the round bilge hull.&lt;ref&gt;Zeilen: Van beginner tot gevorderde by Karel Heijnen&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[inverted bell]] shape of the hull, with a smaller payload the [[waterline]] cross-section is less, hence the resistance is less and the speed is higher. With a higher payload the outward bend provides smoother performance in waves. As such, the inverted bell shape is a popular form used with planing hulls.

===Hull forms===

====Chined and hard-chined hulls====
{{Further|Chine (boating)}}

A chined hull consists of straight, smooth, tall, long, or short plates, timbers or sheets of ply, which are set at an angle to each other when viewed in transverse section. The traditional chined hull is a simple hull shape because it works with only straight planks bent into a curve. These boards are often bent lengthwise. Plywood chined boats made of 8'{{nbsp}}x{{nbsp}}4' sheets have most bend along the long axis of the sheet. Only thin ply 3–6&amp;nbsp;mm can easily be shaped into a compound bend. Most home-made constructed boats are chined hull boats. Mass-produced chine powerboats are usually made of sprayed chop strand fibreglass over a wooden mold. The Cajun "pirogue" is an example of a craft with hard chines. Benefits of this type of hull is the low production cost and the (usually) fairly flat bottom, making the boat faster at [[Planing (sailing)|planing]]. Sail boats with chined hull make use of a dagger board or keel.

Chined hulls can be divided up into three shapes:
* Flat-bottom chined hulls
* Multi-chined hulls
* V-bottom chined hulls. Sometimes called hard chine.

Each of these chine hulls has its own unique characteristics and use. The flat bottom hull has high initial stability but high drag. To counter the high drag  hull forms are narrow and sometimes severely tapered at bow and stern. This leads to poor stability when heeled in a sail boat. This is often countered by using heavy interior ballast on sailing versions. They are best suited to sheltered inshore waters. Early racing power boats were fine forward and flat aft. This produced maximum lift and a smooth,fast ride in flat water but this hull form is easily unsettled in waves. The multi chine hull approximates a curved hull form. It has less drag than a flat bottom boat. Multi chines are  more complex to build but produce a more seaworthy hull form. They are usually displacement hulls. V or arc bottom chine boats have a V{{nbsp}}shape between 6{{nbsp}}and 23{{nbsp}}degrees. This is called the deadrise angle. The flatter shape of a 6{{nbsp}}degrees hull will plane with less wind or a lower horse power engine but will pound more in waves. The deep V{{nbsp}}form (between 18{{nbsp}}and 23{{nbsp}}degrees) is only suited to high power planing boats. They require more powerful engines to lift the boat onto the plane but give a faster smoother ride in waves.
Displacement chined hulls have more wetted surface area, hence more drag, than an equivalent round hull form, for any given displacement.

====Smooth curve hulls====
{{Further|Smooth curve hull}}

Smooth curve hulls are hulls which use, just like the curved hulls, a sword or an attached keel.

Semi round bilge hulls are somewhat less round. The advantage of the semi-round is that it is a nice middle between the S-bottom and chined hull. Typical examples of a semi-round bilge hull can be found in the [[Centaur]] and [[Laser (sailboat)|Laser]] cruising [[dinghies]].

[[Image:Chine types.svg|thumb|right|100px|(A) S-bottom hull&lt;br&gt;compared to a&lt;br&gt;(B) hard and&lt;br&gt;(C) soft chine hull]]

S-bottom hulls are hulls shaped like an ''s'' . In the s-bottom, the hull runs smooth to the keel. As there are no sharp corners in the fuselage. Boats with this hull have a fixed keel, or a ''kielmidzwaard'' (literally "keel with sword"). This is a short fixed keel, with a swing keel inside. Examples of cruising dinghies that use this s-shape are the [[Yngling (keelboat)|Yngling]] and [[Randmeer]].

==Appendages==

:* Control devices such as a [[rudder]], [[Trim tab#Uses in boats|trim tabs]] or stabilizing fins may be fitted.
:* A [[keel]] may be fitted on a hull to increase the transverse stability, directional stability or to create lift.
:* A protrusion below the waterline forward is called a [[bulbous bow]] and is fitted on some hulls to reduce the [[wave making resistance]] [[drag (physics)|drag]] and thus increase [[fuel efficiency]]. Bulbs fitted at the stern are less common but accomplish a similar task.  (see also: [[Naval architecture]])

==Metrics&lt;!--linked from 'Ship measurements'--&gt;==
[[File:Ship's hull shape en.png|thumb|right|Principal hull measurements]]
[[Image:LOA-LWL.svg|thumb|right|''"LWL &amp; LOA"'']]
Hull forms are defined as follows:

:* '''Block measures''' that define the principal dimensions. They are:
::* [[Beam (nautical)|Beam]] or breadth ('''B''') is the width of the hull.  (ex: BWL is the maximum beam at the waterline)
::* [[Draft (hull)|Draft]] ('''d''') or ('''T''') is the vertical distance from the bottom of the keel to the [[waterline]].
::* [[Freeboard (nautical)|Freeboard]] ('''FB''') is '''depth''' plus the height of the keel structure minus '''draft'''.
::* [[Length at the waterline]] ('''LWL''') is the length from the forwardmost point of the waterline measured in profile to the stern-most point of the waterline.
::* [[Length between perpendiculars]] ('''LBP''' or '''LPP''') is the length of the summer load waterline from the [[stern]] post to the point where it crosses the [[stem (ship)|stem]]. (see also [[p/p]])
::* [[Length overall]] ('''LOA''') is the extreme length from one end to the other.
::* Moulded depth ('''D''') is the vertical distance measured from the top of the keel to the underside of the upper deck at side.&lt;ref name = 1969conv&gt;{{cite web | title = International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969|work =International Conventions | publisher = Admiralty and Maritime Law Guide | date = 1969-06-23|url =http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/tonnage1969.html |accessdate = 2007-10-27 }}, Annex 1, ''Regulations for determining gross and net tonnages of ships'', Reg. 2(2)(a). In ships with rounded [[gunwale]]s, the upper measurement point is take to the point at which the planes of the deck and side plating intersect.  ''Id.'', Reg. 2(2)(b). Ships with stepped decks are measured to a line parallel with the upper part.  ''Id.'', Reg. 2(2)(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

:*'''Form derivatives''' that are calculated from the shape and the block measures. They are:
::* [[Displacement (ship)|Displacement]] ('''Δ''') is the weight of water equivalent to the immersed volume of the hull.
::* Longitudinal centre of buoyancy ('''LCB''') is the longitudinal distance from a point of reference (often midships) to the centre of the displaced volume of water when the hull is not moving. Note that the longitudinal centre of gravity or centre of the weight of the vessel must align with the LCB when the hull is in equilibrium.
::* Longitudinal centre of flotation ('''LCF''') is the longitudinal distance from a point of reference (often midships) to the centre of the area of waterplane when the hull is not moving. This can be visualized as being the area defined by the water's surface and the hull.
::* Vertical centre of buoyancy ('''VCB''') is the vertical distance from a point of reference (often the baseline) to the centre of the displaced volume of water when the hull is not moving.
::* Volume ('''V''' or '''∇''') is the volume of water displaced by the hull.

:* '''Coefficients'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Rawson | first1=E.C. | last2=Tupper | title=Basic Ship Theory | volume=1 | publisher=Longman | edition=2nd | isbn=0-582-44523-X | date=1976 | pages=12–14 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; help compare hull forms as well:

::1) Block coefficient ('''C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the volume (V) divided by the  L&lt;sub&gt;WL&lt;/sub&gt;x  B&lt;sub&gt;WL&lt;/sub&gt; x T&lt;sub&gt;WL&lt;/sub&gt; . If you draw a box around the submerged part of the ship, it is the ratio of the box volume occupied by the ship. It gives a sense of how much of the block defined by the L&lt;sub&gt;WL&lt;/sub&gt;, beam (B) &amp; draft (T) is filled by the hull. Full forms such as oil tankers will have a high C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; where fine shapes such as sailboats will have a low C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;.
:::&lt;math&gt;
C_b = \frac {V}{L_{WL} \cdot B_{WL} \cdot T_{WL}}
&lt;/math&gt;

::2) Midship coefficient ('''C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' or '''C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the cross-sectional area (A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) of the slice at midships (or at the largest section for C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) divided by beam x draft. It displays the ratio of the largest underwater section of the hull to a rectangle of the same overall width and depth as the underwater section of the hull. This defines the fullness of the underbody. A low C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; indicates a cut-away mid-section and a high C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; indicates a boxy section shape. Sailboats have a cut-away mid-section with low C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; whereas cargo vessels have a boxy section with high C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; to help increase the C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;.
:::&lt;math&gt;
C_m = \frac {A_m}{ B_{WL} \cdot T_{WL}}
&lt;/math&gt;

::3) Prismatic coefficient ('''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the volume (V) divided by L&lt;sub&gt;WL&lt;/sub&gt;x A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. It displays the ratio of the immersed volume of the hull to a volume of a prism with equal length to the ship and cross-sectional area equal to the largest underwater section of the hull (midship section). This is used to evaluate the distribution of the volume of the underbody. A low or fine C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; indicates a full mid-section and fine ends, a high or full C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; indicates a boat with fuller ends. Planing hulls and other highspeed hulls tend towards a higher C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. Efficient displacement hulls travelling at a low [[Froude number]] will tend to have a low C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.
:::&lt;math&gt;
C_p = \frac {V}{L_{WL} \cdot A_m}
&lt;/math&gt;

::4) Waterplane coefficient ('''C&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the waterplane area divided by  L&lt;sub&gt;WL&lt;/sub&gt; x B&lt;sub&gt;WL&lt;/sub&gt;. The waterplane coefficient expresses the fullness of the waterplane, or the ratio of the waterplane area to a rectangle of the same length and width. A low C&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; figure indicates fine ends and a high C&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; figure indicates fuller ends. High C&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; improves stability as well as handling behavior in rough conditions.
:::&lt;math&gt;
C_w = \frac {A_w}{L_{WL} \cdot B_{WL}}
&lt;/math&gt;

::'''Note:'''
:::&lt;math&gt;
C_b = {C_{p} \cdot C_{m} }
&lt;/math&gt;

==Computer-aided design==
Use of [[computer-aided design]] has superseded paper-based methods of ship design that relied on manual calculations and lines drawing. Since the early 1990s, a variety of commercial and freeware software packages specialized for naval architecture have been developed that provide 3D drafting capabilities combined with calculation modules for hydrostatics and hydrodynamics. These may be referred to as geometric modeling systems for naval architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ventura|first1=Manuel|title=Geometric Modeling of the Hull Form|url=http://www.mar.ist.utl.pt/mventura/Projecto-Navios-I/EN/SD-1.5.3-Hull%20Geometric%20Modeling.pdf|website=Centre for Marine Technology and Ocean Engineering|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Immunodermatology''' studies [[skin]] as an organ of [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] in health and disease. Several areas have special attention, such as photo-immunology (effects of [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light on skin defense), [[inflammation|inflammatory]] diseases such as [[Hidradenitis suppurativa]], [[allergy|allergic]] contact [[dermatitis]] and [[atopic eczema]], presumably [[autoimmune]] skin diseases such as [[vitiligo]] and [[psoriasis]], and finally the [[immunology]] of [[microbial]] skin diseases such as [[retrovirus]] infections and [[leprosy]]. New therapies in development for the [[Immunosuppressant|immunomodulation]] of common immunological skin diseases include [[Biomolecule|biologicals]] aimed at neutralizing [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF-alfa]] and [[chemokine receptor]] inhibitors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3822">The '''International Association of Schools of Social Work''' ('''IASSW''') is the worldwide association of schools of social work, other tertiary level social work educational programs, and social work educators. The IASSW promotes the development of social work education throughout the world, develops standards to enhance quality of social work education, encourages international exchange, provides forums for sharing social work research and scholarship, and promotes human rights and social development through policy and advocacy activities.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Truell |first=Rory |date=7 July 2014 |title=What is social work? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2014/jul/07/what-is-social-work |newspaper=The Guardian |location=Manchester, England |access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Healy |first1=Lynne M. |last2=Link |first2=Rosemary J. |date=2012 |title=Handbook of International Social Work: Human Rights, Development, and the Global Profession |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195333616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IASSW was founded in 1928 at the First International Conference of Social Work, held in [[Paris]]. It initially comprised 51 schools, mostly in Europe, and was known as the International Committee. Revitalized after World War II, the organization expanded its membership to include a wider range of countries and was renamed the International Association of Schools of Social Work.&lt;ref name="Book1"/&gt;

Membership in the IASSW comprises social work educational programs at the post-secondary or tertiary level and interested individuals, mostly social work educators. The association has member schools in all parts of the world. Five 5 regional organizations in Africa; Asia and the Pacific; Europe; Latin America; and North America and the Caribbean are affiliated with the IASSW. IASSW is governed by the Board of Directors under a Constitution approved by the biennial General Assembly. IASSW holds consultative status with the United Nations and participates as an NGO in UN activities in Geneva, Vienna and New York. Through its work at the UN and with other international organizations, IASSW represents social work education at the international level.&lt;ref name="Book1"/&gt;

According to the current IASSW Constitution, the organization is governed by the Board of Directors, made up of both elected and appointed members. Starting from 1928 the IASSW had 12 Presidents.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''Interlacing patterns''' are patterns of lines and shapes that have traditionally dominated [[Islamic art]]. They can be broadly divided into the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], using curving plant-based elements, and the [[girih]], using mostly [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrical forms]] with straight lines or regular curves.  Both of these forms of [[Islamic art]] developed from the rich [[Interlace (visual arts)|interlacing patterns]]  of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and from [[Coptic art]].

==Overview==
Eva Baer, in her book ''Islamic Ornament'' (1998), describes the art:
&lt;blockquote&gt;....the intricate interlacings common in later medieval [[Islamic art]], are already prefigured in [[Umayyad architecture]] revetments: in floor [[mosaics]], window grilles, stone and [[stucco]] carvings and wall paintings(Khirbat al-Mafjar, Qusayr'Amra, Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi etc.), and in the decoration of a whole group of early east Iranian, eighth- to tenth-century metal objects.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Baer ''Islamic Ornament'' p. 41. New York University Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0-8147-1329-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the first Western studies of the subject was [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin|E. H. Hankin]]'s "The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art", published in ''Memoirs of the Archaeological Society of India'' in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamic-art.org/ArticlesOnline/BArchViewPage.asp?ArticleID=108&amp;PO=1#viewpage "The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art"], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/cosmolallie/2073854747/in/set-72157603842997257/ "Preface"]&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Hankin takes the view that the artists who created these designs used a method based on the use of the compass and the straight edge.&lt;ref&gt;E. H Hankin, ''The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art'', p.2&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported by the majority of contemporary authorities on the subject, such as [[Keith Critchlow]] in his book, ''Islamic Patterns: An Analytical and Cosmological Approach''.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Critchlow, ''Islamic Patterns: An Analytical and Cosmological Approach'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; This explains how ornamented objects as varied in size as a book or a mosque, were treated by artists using the same geometric methods adapted to the size and nature of the object being ornamented.&lt;ref&gt;Daud Sutton, ''Islamic Design: A Genius for Geometry'', Walker Publishing Company, 2007. p. 1. ({{ISBN|0-8027-1635-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] describes a method whereby interlace ornament is designed on a foundation of geometric [[wikt:grid|grids]], with the same grids re-drawn to the size of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Jones, ''The Grammar of Ornament'', p. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;
In his catalog for the ''[[The Great Exhibition|Crystal Palace]]'' exhibition, Jones wrote about the decorative art found in the [[Alhambra]], where much of the decoration consists of interwoven designs, that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The grace and refinement of Greek ornament is here surpassed. Possessing, equally with the Greeks, an appreciation of pure form, the Moors exceeded them in variety and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Iain Zaczek quoting Owen Jones, in his annotation of Owen Jones' ''The Grammar of Ornament'', p.206&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Arabesque==
{{main|Arabesque (Islamic art)}}

The Islamic arabesque is a form of artistic decoration consisting of "surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils" or plain lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fleming, John |author2=Honour, Hugh |title=Dictionary of the Decorative Arts |year=1977 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-670-82047-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; often combined with other elements. It usually consists of a single design which can be 'tiled' or seamlessly repeated as many times as desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Francis |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-66993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

==Girih==
{{main|Girih}}

'''Girih''' ({{lang-fa|[[wikt:گره#Persian|گره]]}}, "knot"), also '''''girih sāzī''''' ({{lang|fa|گره سازی}}, "knot making") or '''''girih chīnī''''' ({{lang|fa|گره چینی}}), is an [[Islamic art|Islamic decorative art]] form used in [[architecture]] and handicrafts (book covers, tapestry, small metal objects), consisting of  [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric lines]] that form an [[Interlace (art)|interlaced]] [[strapwork]]. In [[Iranian architecture]], ''gereh sazi'' patterns were seen in [[banna'i]] brickwork, [[stucco]], and [[mosaic]] [[faience]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gereh Sazi | work=Encyclopaedia Iranica Online| accessdate=15 December 2015| url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gereh-sazi }}&lt;/ref&gt; Girih has been defined as "geometric (often star-and-polygon) designs composed upon or generated from arrays of points from which construction lines radiate and at which they intersect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Allen, Terry |year=2004 | title=Islamic Art and the Argument from Academic Geometry | url=http://sonic.net/~tallen/palmtree/academicgeometry.htm | accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''The High Energy Accelerator Research Organization'''|高エネルギー加速器研究機構|Kō Enerugī Kasokuki Kenkyū Kikō}}, known as '''KEK''', is a Japanese organization whose purpose is to operate the largest [[particle physics]] laboratory in Japan, situated in [[Tsukuba]], [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]] prefecture. It was established in 1997.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kek.jp/en/About/History/|title=History|accessdate=2016-08-12|publisher=KEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "KEK" is also used to refer to the laboratory itself, which employs approximately 695 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kek.jp/ja/About/OrganizationOverview/Assessment/Statistics/|script-title=ja:各種データ|accessdate=2016-08-12|publisher=KEK|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; KEK's main function is to provide the [[particle accelerators]] and other infrastructure needed for [[high-energy physics]], [[material science]], [[structural biology]], [[radiation]] science, [[computing science]], [[nuclear transmutation]] and so on. Numerous experiments have been constructed at KEK by the internal and international collaborations that have made use of them. [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]], emeritus professor at KEK, is known globally for his work on [[CP-violation]], and was awarded the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].

==History==
KEK was established in 1997 in a reorganization of the Institute of Nuclear Study, [[University of Tokyo|the University of Tokyo]] (established in 1955), the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (established in 1971), and the Meson Science Laboratory of the University of Tokyo (established in 1988).&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; However, the reorganization was not a simple merge of the aforementioned laboratories.  As such, KEK was not the only new institute created at that time, because not all of the work of the parent institutions fell under the umbrella of high energy physics; for example, the Center for Nuclear Study, the University of Tokyo, was concurrently established for low energy nuclear physics in a research partnership with [[RIKEN]].

== Particle accelerators ==

=== Current complex ===
[[File:KEKB Belle Detector.jpg|thumb|200px|right|BELLE detector]]
* [[SuperKEKB]]: A electron-positron [[collider]] and upgrade to [[KEKB (accelerator)|KEKB]]. With two storage rings: a 7 GeV electron [[storage ring]] and a 4 GeV positron [[storage ring]]. The circumferential length is about 3.016&amp;nbsp;km. Large quantities of [[B-meson]]s and anti-[[B-meson]]s will be generated providing data for the [[Belle II experiment]].
* [[Photon Factory]] (PF): A electron [[storage ring]] is used for [[synchrotron light]] experiments. The circumferential length is about 187 m. The energy of the electron beam is 2.5 GeV.
* Photon Factory Advanced Ring (PF-AR): An electron [[storage ring]] is used for [[synchrotron light]] experiments. This [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]] generates high intensity and pulsed [[X-ray]] with the electron beam of 6.5 GeV. The circumferential length is about 377 m. This ring used to be operated as a booster [[synchrotron]] for TRISTAN, electron-positron collider, and called TRISTAN Accumulation Ring (AR) originally.

[[File:Linac straight for 600m.jpg|thumb|200px|right|KEK e+/e- Linac]]
* KEK e+/e- Linac: A [[linear accelerator]] complex had injected 8.0 GeV electrons and 3.5 GeV positrons to KEKB. The [[linac]] also provides 2.5 GeV electrons for PF and 6.5 GeV electrons for PF-AR. The Linac has been upgraded for [[SuperKEKB]].
* [[Accelerator Test Facility (Japan)|Accelerator Test Facility]] (ATF): A test accelerator is focused on generating a super low-emittance beam. This is one of the essential techniques for realizing a future electron-positron linear collider. The beam energy of electrons is 1.28 GeV in normal operation.
* Superconducting RF Test Facility (STF): A test facility to build and operate a test [[linac]] with high-gradient [[superconducting]] cavities, as a prototype of the main linac systems for [[International Linear Collider]] (ILC).
* Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex ([[J-PARC]]): A proton accelerator complex consisting primarily of a 600 MeV [[linac]], a 3 GeV [[synchrotron]] and 50 GeV [[synchrotron]]. J-PARC was built with a collaboration between KEK and [[JAEA]], and is used for [[nuclear physics]], [[particle physics]], [[muon]] science, [[neutron]] science, [[Accelerator-Driven System]] (ADS) and a range of other applications.
* [[KEK digital accelerator]] (KEK-DA) is a renovation of the KEK 500 MeV booster proton synchrotron, which was shut down in 2006. The existing 40 MeV drift tube linac and rf cavities have been replaced by an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source embedded in a 200 kV high-voltage terminal and induction acceleration cells, respectively. A DA is, in principle, capable of accelerating any species of ion in all possible charge states.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Shutdown complex ===
* Proton Synchrotron (PS): An accelerator complex to accelerate protons up to 12 GeV. PS had consisted primarily of a 750 keV pre-accelerator, a 40 MeV [[linac]], a 500 MeV booster [[synchrotron]] and a 12 GeV main ring. PS had been used for [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]]. PS also had provided the 12 GeV proton beam to a [[neutrino]] beam line in KEK for a KEK to [[Kamioka]] ([[K2K]]) experiment. PS was shut down in 2007.
* Neutrino Beam Line: A beam line to drive neutrinos into [[Super-Kamiokande]], which is about 250&amp;nbsp;km away from KEK, and a [[neutrino oscillation]] experiment named [[K2K]] had been conducted from 1999 to 2004. A [[neutrino oscillation]] experiment named [[Tōkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]] to [[Kamioka]] ([[T2K]]) has been conducted using [[J-PARC]] since 2009.
* Transposable Ring Intersecting Storage Accelerator in Nippon (TRISTAN): An electron-positron collider had been operated from 1987 to 1995. The main purpose was detecting [[top quark]]. The electron and positron energy were 30&amp;nbsp;GeV. TRISTAN had three detectors: TOPAZ, VENUS and AMY. KEKB was built through the use of the tunnel of TRISTAN.

=== Running and future plans ===
* [[SuperKEKB]]: An electron-positron collider, consisting of a 7 GeV electron [[storage ring]] and a 4 GeV positron [[storage ring]], to achieve higher [[Luminosity (scattering theory)|luminosity]] by means of increasing the beam current, focusing the beams at the interaction point and making the electromagnetic beam-beam interactions small. The target luminosity has been set to 8×10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, about 60 times higher than the KEKB's original design value. SuperKEKB has adopted a nano-beam scheme. KEK will build a new [[damping ring]] in order to generate the nano scale positron beam. On October, 2010 the Japanese government formally approved the SuperKEKB project, and on June, 2010 an initial budget of 100 million dollars (¥100 = $1) for a Very Advanced Research Support Program was assigned for 2010-2012. The total budget is about 315 million dollars (¥100 = $1) by the program. The upgrade will be completed, and the first collisions have been conducted in 2018. The highest luminosity will be achieved in 2021. [[Belle II experiment]] will be conducted using [[SuperKEKB]].
* Compact [[Energy Recovery Linac]] (cERL): A test accelerator for a future [[synchrotron light source]] named [[Energy Recovery Linac]] (ERL). cERL will study the uncertainty of the [[accelerator physics]] in the ERL through the beam experiments. The beam commissioning in cERL will be scheduled from 2013 with a 35 MeV electron beam. KEK has a plan that will build 5 GeV ERL, provides ultra-high brightness and ultra-short pulsed synchrotron light, after the cERL experiments.
* [[International Linear Collider]] (ILC): A future electron-positron linear collider consisting of superconducting cavities with a length of approximately 31 kilometers in length and two damping rings, for electrons and positrons, with a circumference of 6.7 kilometers. The electron and positron energy will be up to 500 GeV with an option to upgrade to 1 TeV. Nearly 300 laboratories and universities around the world are involved in the ILC: more than 700 people are working on the accelerator design, and another 900 people on detector development. The accelerator design work is coordinated by the Global Design Effort, and the physics and detector work by the World Wide Study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linearcollider.org/about/What-is-the-ILC/Facts-and-figures# ILC-Facts and figures]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computers&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccwww.kek.jp/ccsupport/index-e.html# Computing Research Center in KEK]&lt;/ref&gt; ==
[[File:20080831-R0012506.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Blue Gene]]]]
KEK has computers which are fastest class in Japan, and Computing Research Center in KEK manages the computer systems. The theoretical operation performance of SR16000, a [[super computer]] made by [[HITACHI]], is 46 T[[FLOPS]]. The theoretical operation performance of [[Blue Gene]] Solution, a super computer made by [[IBM]], is 57.3 TFLOPS. These super computers had been used to study [[quantum chromodynamics]] and numerical [[accelerator physics]] mainly, and these super computers have been shut down in order to introduce a next super computer in the future. Computing Research Center also manages the other computer systems: KEKCC, B-factory Computer System and Synchrotron Light Computer System.

KEK hosted the first web site in Japan on September 30, 1992. The original web site can still be seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibarakiken.gr.jp/www/index.html# First web site in Japan (Japanese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leibniz Institute for Polymer Research''' in [[Dresden]] ({{lang-de| Leibniz-Institut für Polymerforschung}}) – in short [[IPF Dresden]] – is a non-university [[research institute]] and a member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]]. The IPF is carrying out fundamental as well as application-oriented research in all areas of [[polymer science]] and investigates [[polymer]] materials with new or improved characteristics. In the material development, emphasis is given to [[nanotechnological]] aspects as well as to biosystem interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipfdd.de/en/home/], Homepage [[IPF Dresden]], retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The IPF’s research program is jointly set up and implemented by scientists of the different IPF institutes. It comprises the following four research areas:

* Functional nanostructured interfaces and polymer systems
* Biology-inspired interface and material design
* Polymer networks: Structure, theory, and application
* Process-controlled structure formation in polymer materials

==Structure==
The IPF consists of five research institutes
*Institute [[Macromolecular Chemistry]], Director: Prof. Dr. [[Brigitte Voit]]
*Institute of [[Physical Chemistry]] and Polymer Physics, Director: Prof. Dr. Andreas Fery
* Institute of Polymer Materials, Director: Prof. Dr.-Ing. Udo Wagenknecht (provisionally)
*Institute for Biofunctional Polymer Materials, Director: Prof. Dr. Carsten Werner
* Institute Theory of Polymers, Director: Prof. Dr. Jens-Uwe Sommer

Close ties exists to the [[TU Dresden]], one of eleven universities distinguished as a "University of Excellence" by the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]]. Common projects include the Max Bergmann Center of Biomaterials,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbc-dresden.de/], Homepage Max Bergmann Center of Biomaterials, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and two so-called Clusters of Excellence, the "Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden" (CRTD)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crt-dresden.de/about/], Homepage CRTD, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (cfaed) - TU Dresden|"Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden" (CfAED)]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/news], Homepage CfAED, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The IPF Dresden was founded on January 1, 1992 emerging from the largest polymer research center of the former [[GDR]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipfdd.de/en/home/history/], [[IPF Dresden]]: History, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; which was at the time already internationally acknowledged. Since then the IPF Dresden developed into a leading institute in selected topics of polymer science.
At present the IPF employs about 480 people, and about 100 guest scientists from all over the world come every year for some weeks or months to work at the IPF. The annual budget of 25 Million Euro is supplied in equal parts by the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] and the German [[federal states]]. In addition to institutional funding the IPF Dresden raises project resources of about 8 Million Euro per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipfdd.de/en/home/facts//], [[IPF Dresden]]: Facts, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2039">'''Microbial synergy''' is a phenomenon in which [[Aerobic microbe|aerobic]] and [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic microbes]] support each other's growth and proliferation. In this process aerobes invade and destroy host tissues, reduce tissue oxygen concentration and [[redox potential]], thus creating favorable conditions for anaerobic growth and proliferation. Anaerobes grow and produce short chain [[fatty acid]]s such as [[butyric acid]], [[propionic acid]]. These short chain fatty acids inhibit [[phagocytosis]] of aerobes. Thus aerobes grow, proliferate and destroy more tissues. Microbial synergy complicates and delays the healing of surgical and other chronic wounds or ulcers such as [[diabetic foot ulcers]], [[venous ulcers]], [[pressure ulcers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rotstein|first1=OD|last2=Pruett|first2=TL|last3=Simmons|first3=RL|date=1984|title=Mechanisms of microbial synergy in polymicrobial surgical infections.|journal=Reviews of infectious diseases|volume=7|issue=2|pages=151–70|doi=10.1093/clinids/7.2.151|pmid=3890095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eftimiadi|first1=C|last2=Tonetti|first2=M|last3=Cavallero|first3=A|last4=Sacco|first4=O|last5=Rossi|first5=GA|date=January 1990|title=Short-chain fatty acids produced by anaerobic bacteria inhibit phagocytosis by human lung phagocytes.|journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases|volume=161|issue=1|pages=138–42|doi=10.1093/infdis/161.1.138|pmid=2295846}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc. Microbial synergy also helps with eliminating oxygen redox. This allows the growth of organisms without the effects of oxygen reacting negatively. As a result, Microbial growth increases because other organisms can grow in the absence of Oxygen redox.

'''The Museum of Particularly Bad Art Exhibition''' (MOPBA) is an annual event held on [[Chapel Street]], [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] celebrating poor [[art]] forms, primarily in the forms of [[painting]]s and [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es. MOPBA relies on a core group of art pieces owned by [[Helen Round]] but the public are invited to enter pieces that are their own or that have been found that are considered poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/eish/kitsch-becomes-an-artform-in-australia-418024|title=Kitsch becomes an artform in Australia - IOL News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/er-dette-arets-verste-kunstverk_-1.7300495|title=Er dette årets verste kunstverk?|first=|last=NRK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event primarily is a charity event that funds three charities within the [[City of Stonnington|Stonnington]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/16/1089694559243.html|title=Art that's no oil painting - Arts - www.theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
The entries from the public are judged by meeting one point on the selection criteria. Selection points for entry of an art piece into MOPBA are:

* Completely devoid of technical skill ([[Colour]], [[Lightness (color)|tone]], [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and [[shading]]);
* Unusual, poor or tasteless subject matters;
* Passion of the [[artist]] but is driven by an [[Amateur|uneducated hand]];
* An instinctual feeling that the art piece is poor.

The founder of MOPBA is [[Helen Round]]. In the early 1990s, ''[[Foreign Correspondent (TV series)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' reported on the [[Museum of Bad Art]] in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], United States. At this point of her life, Round was in the process of establishing a retail shop named "Fat Helen’s Bric a Brac shop", that was to specialise in the [[kitsch]], inane and tasteless.  It was also a hobby of Round's to peruse [[op shop]]s, [[garage sale]]s and [[Market (place)|market]]s. She was inspired by what she came across in these places and commenced her pursuit of collecting and preserving the mediocre. Round started collecting in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Particularly Bad Art: About|url=http://www.mopba.org/?page_id=2|accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/reise/aktuell/kunst-in-melbourne-museum-der-haesslichkeiten-a-583180.html|title=Kunst in Melbourne: Museum der Hässlichkeiten|date=9 October 2008|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Round  has collected 200 examples of original art of poor taste. Of notable fame is the original portrait of [[actor]] [[Scott Baio]] that Round located in an op shop in the suburb of [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/suzanne-carbone/amanda-needs-love/2005/08/02/1122748636560.html|title=Amanda needs to be loved - Carbone &amp; Money - Opinion - theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;

The Exhibition awards the Itchiball Prize to the submitted art piece that is considered by the public to be the poorest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/deepend/dreadful-art/3339714|title=Dreadful art|date=8 August 2006|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name is a play on words and parody of the '[[Archibald Prize]]', Australia's most important [[portrait]]ure painting award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Itchyball Prize|url=http://www.mopba.org/?page_id=8|website=Museum of Particularly Bad Art|accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nacirema''' ("American" spelled backwards) is a term used in [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] in relation to aspects of the behavior and society of citizens of the [[United States|United States of America]]. The [[neologism]] attempts to create a deliberate sense of self-distancing in order that American anthropologists might look at their own culture more objectively.

=="Body Ritual among the Nacirema"==
{{wikisource|Body Ritual among the Nacirema|"Body Ritual among the Nacirema"}}
The original use of the term in a social science context was in "Body Ritual among the Nacirema", which [[satire|satirizes]] [[anthropology|anthropological]] papers on "other" cultures, and the [[culture of the United States]]. [[Horace Mitchell Miner]] wrote the paper and originally published it in the June 1956 edition of ''[[American Anthropologist]]''.&lt;ref name = "Miner"&gt;Miner, H.M., "Body Ritual Among the Nacirema", ''American Anthropologist'', vol 58: pp. 503-507, June 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dimsdale, Joel E. "The Nacirema Revisited." Annals Of Behavioral Medicine 23.1 (2001): 75. Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Sylvester A. "The Rise Of The Nacirema And The Descent Of European Man: A Response To Manuel A. Vásquez's More Than Belief." Method &amp; Theory In The Study Of Religion 24.4/5 (2012): 464-481. Religion and Philosophy Collection. 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the paper, Miner describes the Nacirema, a little-known tribe living in [[North America]]. The way in which he writes about the curious practices that this group performs distances readers from the fact that the North American group described actually corresponds to modern-day Americans of the mid-1950s. The article sometimes serves as a demonstration of a [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] shift with relation to [[sociology]].{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

Miner presents the Nacirema as a group living in the territory between the Canadian [[Cree]], the [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] and [[Tarahumara|Tarahumare]] of Mexico, and the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] and [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] of the [[Antilles]]. The paper describes the typical Western ideal for oral cleanliness, as well as providing an outside view on hospital care and on [[psychiatry]].&lt;ref name = Miner /&gt; The Nacirema are described as having a highly developed market economy that has evolved within a rich natural habit.&lt;ref&gt;Miner, Horace. "Body Ritual among the Nacirema." American Anthropologist 1956: 503. JSTOR Journals. 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miner's article became a popular work, reprinted in many introductory textbooks and used as an example [[process analysis]] in the literature text ''[[The Bedford Reader]]''. The article itself received the most reprint permission requests of any article in ''American Anthropologist'', but has become part of the [[public domain]].{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

Some of the popular aspects of Nacirema culture include: medicine men and women (doctors, psychiatrists, and pharmacists), a charm-box (medicine cabinet), the mouth-rite ritual ([[tooth brushing|brushing teeth]]), and a cultural hero known as Notgnihsaw ([[George Washington|Washington]] spelled backwards).&lt;ref name = Miner /&gt; These ritual practices are prescribed as how man should comport himself in the presence of sacred things. These sacred aspects are the rituals that the Nacirema partake in throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Robert Alun. "Myth And Symbol Among The Nacirema Tsigoloicos: A Fragment." American Sociologist 15.4 (1980): 207-212. SocINDEX with Full Text. 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The mysterious fall of the Nacirema==
In 1972 Neil B. Thompson revisited the Nacirema after the fall of their civilization. Thompson's paper, unlike Miner's, primarily offered a [[social commentary]] focused on [[environmental issue]]s. Thompson paid special attention to the [[Automobile|Elibomotua]] cult and its efforts to modify the environment.

{{quote|The high esteem of the cult is demonstrated by the fact that near every population center, when not disturbed by the accumulation of debris, archaeologists have found large and orderly collections of the Elibomotua cult symbol. The vast number of these collections has given us the opportunity to reconstruct with considerable confidence the principal ideas of the cult. The newest symbols seem to have nearly approached the ultimate of the Nacirema's cultural ideal. Their colors, material, and size suggest an enclosed mobile device that corresponds to no color or shape found in nature, although some authorities suggest that, at some early time in the development, the egg may have been the model. The device was provided with its own climate control system as well as a system that screened out many of the shorter rays of the light spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Thompson |first=Neil B. | title=The mysterious fall of the Nacirema | journal=Natural History | volume=81 | issue=11 | date=1 Jan 1972 | pages=412-7 | url=http://faculty.wwu.edu/oussele/331/The%20Mysterious%20Fall%20of%20the%20Nacirema.pdf | accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This article is reprinted and appears as the final chapter in an anthology called ''Nacirema: Readings on American Culture''. The volume contains an array of scholarly investigations into American social anthropology as well as one more article in the "Nacirema" series, by Willard Walker of Wesleyan University: (American Anthropologist, Volume 72, Issue 1, pages 102–105, February 1970) "The Retention of Folk Linguistic Concepts and the [[Teacher|TI'YCIR]] Caste in Contemporary Nacireman Culture." This article laments the corrosive and subjugating ritual of attending [[School|''sguwlz'']]. On [[English_phonology|phonology]], the anthropologist notes:

{{quote|The vowel system of Secular Nacireman consists of nine phonemically distinct vowels distinguished on the basis of three degrees of tongue height and three degrees of tongue advancement.... There can be no question as to the validity of these nine vocalic phonemes, for each is attested by a number of minimal pairs elicited independently from several [[Informant (linguistics)|informants]]. Curiously enough, however, most informants insist that only five vowels exist in the language: these are called ''ˀey, ˀiy, ˀay, ˀow,'' and ''yuw,'' and are invariably cited in precisely that order.... The discovery of the widespread myth of the five-vowel system prompted the present writer to conduct a series of intensive interviews and administer questionnaires to a sample of Nacireman informants with a view to mapping the general outlines of Nacireman folk linguistics. This research strategy ultimately provided compelling evidence that it is the ''ti'yčɨr'' caste that has disseminated the notion of the five-vowel system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Walker | first=Willard | date=1 Feb 1970 | title=The Retention of Folk Linguistic Concepts and the ''ti'yčɨr'' Caste in Contemporary Nacireman Culture | journal=American Anthropologist | volume=72 | issue=1 | pages=102–105 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1970.72.1.02a00130/pdf | accessdate=17 Jul 2016 | doi=10.1525/aa.1970.72.1.02a00130}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This refers to the conceptualization of the English vowel system based on orthography (with ''5'' vowels), which is in stark contrast to the actual system (with nine vowels and several diphthongs).

==Nacirema vs Teamsterville==
[[Gerry Philipsen]] (1992) studies what he terms "[[Speech code theory|speech code]]s" among the Nacirema, which he contrasts with the speech codes of another semi-fictionalized group of Americans, the inhabitants of Teamsterville culture. His Nacirema comprises primarily middle-class west-coast Americans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking Culturally Explorations in Social Communication|last=Philipsen|first=Gerry|publisher=SUNY|year=1992|isbn=978-0-7914-1163-6|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
Nacirema is the name of a fictional country in Ronald M. Green's role-playing game aimed at explaining to undergraduate students the fundamentals of [[John Rawls]]'s theory of [[justice as fairness]]. In "The Rawls Game" (1986), Green asks the students to take on the role of Nacireman citizens. Acting from unrestrained self-interest, the citizens vote on a series of public issues and attempt to find solutions that do not require anyone to be forced to act against their own will. The goal of the game is to show that the only way to obtain social fairness is to ignore one's own individual circumstances (race, sex, religion, income, etc.) when making deliberations that affect public life.

[[File:Fealtycover.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition, published by [[Phantasia Press]]. Art by [[Paul Lehr]].]]
'''''Oath of Fealty''''' is a 1981 novel by American writer [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]], published originally by [[Phantasia Press]], then by [[Timescape Books]], with numerous reprints.  Set in the near future, it involves an [[arcology]], a large inhabited structure, called Todos Santos, which rises above a crime-ridden [[Los Angeles, California]], but has little beyond casual contact with the city. The novel popularized the phrase "think of it as evolution in action," which occurs elsewhere in Niven's books. The novel anticipated the building of the [[Los Angeles County Metro Rail|Los Angeles Subway]]. It was included in [[David Pringle]]'s book ''[[Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels]]''.

==Plot summary==
In the near future, a race riot results in the destruction of an area just outside Los Angeles. The city sells the construction rights to a private company, which then constructs an arcology, named Todos Santos.  The higher standard of living enjoyed by Todos Santos residents causes resentment among Angelenos.  The arcology dwellers have evolved a different culture, sacrificing privacy - there are cameras (not routinely monitored) even in the private apartments - in exchange for security.  The residents are fiercely loyal to the arcology and its management, and the loyalty runs both ways.  During the course of the novel, Todos Santos is compared to a [[feudal society]], with loyalty and obligations running both ways, hence the title of the novel. The systems at the arcology are run by MILLIE, an advanced computer system, and some high-level executives have direct links to MILLIE via bio-electronic [[Brain-computer interface|implants]] in their brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pringle|first1=David|title=Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels|isbn=0-947761-11-X|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=8m_EAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT200&amp;lpg=PT200&amp;dq=MILLIE+oath+of+fealty|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other workers in the arcology work by [[telepresence]], including one woman who remotely operates construction equipment on a [[Colonization of the Moon|lunar base]].

Todos Santos causes resentment among Angelenos, but has improved their lives as well.  The company that owns the arcology tows icebergs in, solving the water shortage for all Southern Californians. Todos Santos has dug a Los Angeles subway using a digging machine, which uses an [[oxyhydrogen]] torch. Todos Santos is at the hub of the subway system, and contains a huge mall, which Angelenos may visit.  This easy access causes Los Angeles' city officials to complain about the shopping dollars and tax revenues going outside the city limits.

As the story opens, three young Angelenos sneak into the maintenance areas of Todos Santos.  When they are detected by Todos Santos' security systems and personnel, they give every appearance of being terrorists, including spoofing the correct electronic access codes.  When non-lethal means of stopping the three fail, Deputy Manager Preston Sanders orders lethal gas released rather than risk a bomb going off.  Two of the intruders are killed.  They turn out to be youths, with high tech equipment and boxes with such labels as "bomb", but without the actual means of harming the arcology.  It soon turns out that they were duped by the "Friends of Man and the Earth" (FROMATE), anti-technology zealots who want to see Todos Santos destroyed or abandoned, as a means of forcing the arcology to turn off its lethal defenses for a later real attack.

The deaths of the two youths cause political problems.  Sanders is charged with murder.  While arcology manager Art Bonner is quite prepared to defy the city authorities, Sanders turns himself in.  The arcology is forced to turn off its lethal defenses as the FROMATEs planned.  When that happens, they soon face a full-fledged attack by the FROMATEs, which they deter by non-lethal means, until the intruders prove they have deadly weapons, at which point Todos Santos security responds in kind, shooting and killing most of the intruders.  While city authorities are still reacting to this, the arcology launches a jailbreak, the idea of chief engineer (and resident genius) Tony Rand. They tunnel under the jail using the tunneling machine that the "Saints" used to build the L.A. subway, release sleep gas into the jail, and free Sanders.

Los Angeles soon retaliates with arrest and search warrants, but they are soon defeated by the sheer size of the arcology and the ability of the Todos Santos executives, aided in part by their direct links to MILLIE, to hide Rand and Sanders.  After Todos Santos shows that it can cause Los Angeles trouble, such as by contaminating the Los Angeles water supply with salt water, and by work stoppages among the telepresence operators, a truce is arrived at: Rand and Sanders will leave the country permanently, and relations between Los Angeles and Todos Santos will be restored. In effect, Todos Santos has won, if only by restoring the ''[[status quo|status quo ante]].''

Notable Quote: "Think of it as Evolution in Action" (Tony Rand)

==Reception==
It was chosen as one of the [[Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels|100 best science fiction novels from 1949-1984]], by critic [[David Pringle]]. It has been nominated numerous times for a [[Prometheus Award]] for best classic libertarian science fiction novel.

[[File:2017 Gianna Nannini - by 2eight - DSC3677.jpg|thumb|Italian singer Gianna Nannini was 56 years old when she gave birth in 2010]]'''Pregnancy over age 50''' has, over recent years, become possible for more [[woman|women]], and more easily achieved for many, due to recent advances in [[assisted reproductive technology]], in particular [[egg donor|egg donation]]. Typically, a woman's [[fecundity]] ends with [[menopause]], which by definition is 12 consecutive months without having had any menstrual flow at all. During [[perimenopause]], the menstrual cycle and the periods become irregular and eventually stop altogether, but even when periods are still regular, the egg quality of women in their forties is lower than in younger women, making the likelihood of conceiving a healthy baby also reduced, particularly after age 42.&lt;ref&gt;Advanced Fertility Center of Chicago, Female Age, Fertility and Infertility [http://www.advancedfertility.com/age.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note, that the female biological clock can vary greatly from woman to woman. A woman's individual level of fertility can be tested through a variety of methods.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.essentialparent.com/lesson/fertility-tests-for-women-1747/&lt;/ref&gt;

Men also experience a decline in fertility as they age though in a very gradual and later process in contrast to women's fertility as men's biological clock declines simply by each age (loses 1 percent every age) in comparison to women's biological clock where it begins drop sharply and rapidly after 38 years of age; for example, the average time to pregnancy if a man is under 25 is just over 4.5 months but nearly two years if a man is over 40 (if the woman is under 25).&lt;ref&gt;A man’s age matters https://yourfertility.org.au/for-men/age/&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of genetic defects is greatly increased due to the [[paternal age effect]]. Children with fathers aged 40 or older are more than five times as likely to have an autism spectrum disorder than children fathered by men aged under 30.&lt;ref name="yourfertility.org.au"&gt;https://yourfertility.org.au/for-men/age/&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers estimate that compared to a male fathering a child in his early 20s, there is double the chance of the child getting schizophrenia when the father is age 40, and triple the risk of schizophrenia when the father is age 50 (though, for most people this means the risk goes from approximately 1 in 121 when a man is 29, to 1 in 47 when a man is age 50 to 54).&lt;ref&gt;http://schizophrenia.com/prevention/older.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Men's fertility declines throughout the lifespan, with the volume and fecundity of a man’s semen quality and sperm motility (the ability of sperm to move towards an egg) decrease continually between the ages of 20 and 80.&lt;ref name="yourfertility.org.au"/&gt; The incidence of dwarfism&lt;ref&gt;https://www.llnl.gov/news/study-shows-genetic-quality-sperm-deteriorates-men-age&lt;/ref&gt; and miscarriage also increases as men age &lt;ref name="yourfertility.org.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929275-500-mens-sperm-quality-decreases-at-age-35/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical considerations ==
The risk of [[pregnancy]] complications increases as the mother's age increases. Risks associated with childbearing over the age of 50 include an increased incidence of [[gestational diabetes]], [[hypertension]], delivery by [[caesarean section]], [[miscarriage]], [[preeclampsia]], and [[placenta previa]].&lt;ref name="salihu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="james"&gt;Schienberg, Jonathan.

| Canada
| Aggie Ezekiel of [[Edmonton]], Alberta, already a mother of three adult daughters with her husband Johnny Ezekiel, gave birth in August 2010 to her own granddaughter Clare At the age of 50 years and 9 months. She chose to act as a surrogate mother for her daughter, Tinna (age 28), who happened to be born without a uterus and had one of her ovaries removed at the age of 21. Aggie had been premenopausal for two years and could not produce the child herself, so she had to undergo fertilization hormone to boost her menstrual cycles so that the matrix can accommodate two to seven eggs retrieved by her daughter and fertilized in vitro with the sperm from her daughter's partner, Wilson Brown.

It is against the law in France for post-menopausal women to receive IVF so she went to the USA for treatment. The case caused some ethical debate because the two eggs donated to Jeanine by a Californian woman were inseminated with sperm from Jeanine's brother, Robert: one was brought to term by Jeanine, the other by the donor as surogate, who will give birth the week after, on May 22, 2001, to Marie-Cécile, her biological daughter promised to Jeanine.

| Rosanna Della Corte of [[Canino]], [[Italy]] gave birth to a son, Riccardo, on July 18, 1994, at the age of 62.  After their first son was killed when a car crashed into his motorcycle in 1991, Rosanna Della Corte and her husband, Mauro, decided to attempt to have a second child. The couple tried to adopt, but were unable to, as under Italian law an adoptive parent could be no more than 40 years older than their potential child. Mauro read in the newspaper about an Italian doctor, [[Severino Antinori]], who had helped a woman in her late 50s have a child. With Dr. Antinori's help, the Della Cortes conceived through IVF with oocytes donation and Mauro's sperm. Rosanna, 60, became pregnant on the first attempt, but [[miscarriage|miscarried]] after 40 days, and it took 6 more attempts before there was success. She was then just 62.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio, Frances. (July 22, 1997).

== Debate ==
Pregnancies among older women have been a subject of controversy and debate. Some argue against motherhood late in life on the basis of the health risks involved, or out of concern that an older mother might not be able to give proper care for a child as she ages, while others contend that having a child is a fundamental right and that it is commitment to a child's wellbeing, not the parents' ages, that matters.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wiki.edu-research.info/infertile Motherhood At Mid-Life—A Medical and Ethical Dilema] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130929223342/http://wiki.edu-research.info/infertile |date=2013-09-29 }}."

A survey of attitudes towards pregnancy over age 50 among Australians found that 54.6% believed it was acceptable for a postmenopausal woman to have her own eggs transferred and that 37.9% believed it was acceptable for a postmenopausal women to receive donated [[ovum|ova]] or [[embryo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, M.

Governments have sometimes taken actions to regulate or restrict later-in-life childbearing. In the 1990s, [[France]] approved a bill which prohibited postmenopausal pregnancy, which the French Minister of Health at the time, [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], said was "...immoral as well as dangerous to the health of mother and child". In [[Italy]], the Association of Medical Practitioners and Dentists prevented its members from providing women aged 50 and over with fertility treatment. [[UK|Britain's]] then-[[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Virginia Bottomley]], stated, "Women do not have the right to have a child; the child has a right to a suitable home".&lt;ref name="hinman" /&gt; However, in 2005, age restrictions on IVF in the United Kingdom were officially withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Louise.

Legal restrictions are only one of the barriers confronting women seeking IVF, as many fertility clinics and hospitals set age limits of their own.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost" /&gt;

The '''Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute''' (QSMI) ({{lang-th|สถานเสาวภา}} ''Sathan Saovabha'') in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], is a [[institute]] that specialises in the [[husbandry]] of venomous [[snakes]], the extraction and [[research]] of [[snake venom]], and vaccines, especially [[rabies vaccine]]. It houses the '''[[snake farm]]''', a popular tourist attraction.

The origins of the institute can be traced back to 1912 when [[Vajiravudh|King Rama VI]] granted permission for a government institute to manufacture and distribute [[rabies]] vaccine at the suggestion of [[Damrong Rajanubhab|Prince Damrong]], whose daughter, [[:th:หม่อมเจ้าบันลุศิริศานต์ ดิศกุล|Princess Banlusirisarn]], died from rabies infection. It was officially opened on 26 October 1913 in the Luang Building on Bamrung Muang Road as the ''Pastura Institute'' after [[Louis Pasteur]], who discovered the first vaccine against rabies. In 1917 it was renamed the ''Pasteur Institute'' and placed under the supervision of the [[Thai Red Cross Society]]. The institute also produced vaccine against [[smallpox]]. The Travel and Immunization Clinic is now located here. If offers vaccines and pre-travel consultation. 

In the early-1920s the king offered his private property for the construction of a new home for the institute on Rama IV Road. The new buildings were officially opened on 7 December 1922, now named for the king's mother, [[Saovabha Phongsri|Queen Saovabha Phongsri]]. At the same time, the institute's first director, Dr. Leopold Robert, requested contributions from foreigners living in Thailand for the establishment of a snake farm, which would enable the institute to manufacture [[antivenom]] for snake bites. Reportedly the second snake farm in the world after the one in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, it was opened on 22 November 1923 by [[Savang Vadhana|Queen Savang Vadhana]], then President of the Thai Red Cross, on the institute's premises.

Research into snake venom is highly important, since many people fall victim to venomous snake bites. Normally only an [[antidote]] that is based from the same snake's venom can save the individual's life.

The snake farm houses thousands of some of the most venomous snakes in the world, such as the [[king cobra]] and all sorts of [[Viperidae|viper]]s. Visitors can see handlers interact with [[Pythonidae|python]]s, and venom extractions can be seen. There is also a museum, and lectures are given.

The QSMI and the snake farm are near [[Chulalongkorn Hospital]], on the corner of [[Henri Dunant Road]] and Rama IV Road.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31022">'''Runtime verification''' is a computing system analysis and execution approach based on extracting information from a running system and using it to detect and possibly react to observed behaviors satisfying or violating certain properties.  Some very particular properties, such as datarace and deadlock freedom, are typically desired to be satisfied by all systems and may be best implemented algorithmically.  Other properties can be more conveniently captured as formal specifications.  Runtime verification specifications are typically expressed in trace predicate formalisms, such as finite state machines, regular expressions, context-free patterns, linear temporal logics, etc., or extensions of these.  This allows for a less adhoc approach than normal testing.  However, any mechanism for monitoring an executing system is considered runtime verification, including verifying against test oracles and reference implementations {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}.  When formal requirements specifications are provided, monitors are synthesized from them and infused within the system by means of instrumentation.  Runtime verification can be used for many purposes, such as security or safety policy monitoring, debugging, testing, verification, validation, profiling, fault protection, behavior modification (e.g., recovery), etc.  Runtime verification avoids the complexity of traditional formal verification techniques, such as model checking and theorem proving, by analyzing only one or a few execution traces and by working directly with the actual system, thus scaling up relatively well and giving more confidence in the results of the analysis (because it avoids the tedious and error-prone step of  formally modelling the system), at the expense of less coverage.  Moreover, through its reflective capabilities runtime verification can be made an integral part of the target system, monitoring and guiding its execution during deployment.

==History and Context==
Checking formally or informally specified properties against executing systems or programs is an old topic (notable examples are dynamic typing in software, or fail-safe devices or watchdog timers in hardware), whose precise roots are hard to identify.  The terminology ''runtime verification'' was formally introduced as the name of a 2001 workshop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://runtime-verification.org/rv2001/index.html |title=RV'01 - First Workshop on Runtime Verification |date=23 July 2001 |website=Runtime Verification Conferences |access-date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at addressing problems at the boundary between formal verification and testing.  For large code bases manually writing test cases turns out to be very time consuming. In addition, not all errors can be detected during development.  Early constributions to automate verification have been made at the NASA Ames Research Center by Klaus Havelund and Grigore Rosu to archive high safety standards in spacecrafts, rovers and avionics technology.&lt;ref name="Havelund2001Overview"&gt;Klaus Havelund and Grigore Rosu. 2004. An Overview of the Runtime Verification Tool Java PathExplorer. Formal Methods in System Design, 24(2), March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  They proposed a tool to verify specifications in temporal logic and to detect [[race condition]]s and [[deadlock]]s in Java programs by analyzing single execution paths.

Currently, runtime verification techniques are often presented with various alternative names, such as runtime monitoring, runtime checking, runtime reflection, runtime analysis, dynamic analysis, runtime/dynamic symbolic analysis, trace analysis, log file analysis, etc., all referring to instances of the same high-level concept applied either to different areas or by scholars from different communities.  Runtime verification is intimately related to other well-established areas, such as testing (particularly model-based testing) when used before deployment and fault-tolerant systems when used during deployment.

Within the broad area of runtime verification, one can distinguish several categories, such as: 
* "specification-less" monitoring that targets a fixed set of mostly concurrency-related properties such as atomicity.  The pioneering work in this area is by Savage ''et al.'' with the Eraser algorithm&lt;ref name="SavageTCS1997"&gt;Stefan Savage, Michael Burrows, Greg Nelson, Patrick Sobalvarro, and Thomas Anderson. 1997. Eraser: a Dynamic Data Race Detector for Multithreaded Programs. ACM Trans. Comput. Syst. 15(4), November 1997, pp. 391-411.&lt;/ref&gt;
* monitoring with respect to temporal logic specifications; early contributions in this direction has been made by Lee, Kannan, and their collaborators,&lt;ref&gt;Moonjoo Kim, Mahesh Viswanathan, Insup Lee, Hanêne Ben-Abdellah, Sampath Kannan, and Oleg Sokolsky, Formally Specified Monitoring of Temporal Properties, Proceedings of the European Conference on Real-Time Systems, June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Insup Lee, Sampath Kannan, Moonjoo Kim, Oleg Sokolsky, Mahesh Viswanathan, Runtime Assurance Based On Formal Specifications, Proceedings of International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Processing Techniques and Applications, June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and Havelund and Rosu,.&lt;ref name="HavelundSPIN2000"&gt;Klaus Havelund, Using Runtime Analysis to Guide Model Checking of Java Programs, 7th International SPIN Workshop, August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HavelundRosuASE2001"&gt;Klaus Havelund and Grigore Rosu, Monitoring Programs using Rewriting, Automated Software Engineering (ASE'01), November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic approaches==
[[File:Runtime Verification Monitor.svg|250px|thumb|right|Overview of the monitor based verification process as described by Havelund et al. in ''A Tutorial on Runtime Verification''.]]
The broad field of runtime verification methods can be classified by three dimensions:&lt;ref name="havelundRVTutorial2012" /&gt;
* The system can be monitored during the execution itself (online) or after the execution e.g. in form of [[log analysis]] (offline).
* The verifying code is integrated into the system (as done in [[Runtime verification#Aspect-oriented Programming|Aspect-oriented Programming]]) or is provided as an external entity.
* The monitor can report violation or validation of the desired specification.

Nevertheless, the basic process in runtime verification remains similar:&lt;ref name="havelundRVTutorial2012"&gt;Yliès Falcone, Klaus Havelund and Giles, A Tutorial on Runtime Verification, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
# A monitor is created from some formal specification. This process usually can be done automatically if there is an equivalent automaton for the formal language the property is specified in. To transform a [[regular expression]] a [[finite-state machine]] can be used; a property in [[linear temporal logic]] can be transformed into a [[Büchi automaton]] (see also [[Linear temporal logic to Büchi automaton]]).
# The system is instrumented to send events concerning its execution state to the monitor.
# The system is executed and gets verified by the monitor.
# The monitor verifies the received event trace and produces a verdict whether the specification is satisfied. Additionally the monitor sends feedback to the system to possiblly correct false behaviour. When using offline monitoring the system of cause cannot receive any feedback, as the verification is done at a later point in time.

==Examples==
The examples below discuss some simple properties which have been considered, possibly with small variations, by several runtime verification groups by the time of this writing (April 2011).  To make them more interesting, each property below uses a different specification formalism and all of them are parametric.  Parametric properties are properties about traces formed with parametric events, which are events that bind data to parameters.  Here a parametric property has the form &lt;math&gt;\forall parameters : \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a specification in some appropriate formalism referring to generic (uninstantiated) parametric events.  The intuition for such parametric properties is that the property expressed by &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; must hold for all parameter instances encountered (through parametric events) in the observed trace.  None of the following examples are specific to any particular runtime verification system, though support for parameters is obviously needed.  In the following examples Java syntax is assumed, thus "==" is logical equality, while "=" is assignment.  Some methods (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;update()&lt;/tt&gt; in the UnsafeEnumExample) are dummy methods, which are not part of the Java API, that are used for clarity.

=== HasNext ===
[[File:Hasnext.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The HasNext Property]]
The Java [http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html  Iterator] interface requires that the &lt;tt&gt;hasNext()&lt;/tt&gt; method be called and return true before the &lt;tt&gt;next()&lt;/tt&gt; method is called.  If this
does not occur, it is very possible that a user will iterate "off the end of" a [http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html Collection].  The figure to the right shows a finite state machine that defines a possible monitor for checking and enforcing this property with runtime verification.  From the ''unknown'' state, it is always an error to call the &lt;tt&gt;next()&lt;/tt&gt; method because such an operation could be unsafe.  If &lt;tt&gt;hasNext()&lt;/tt&gt; is called and returns &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt;, it is safe to call &lt;tt&gt;next()&lt;/tt&gt;, so the monitor enters the ''more'' state.  If, however, the &lt;tt&gt;hasNext()&lt;/tt&gt; method returns &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;, there are no more elements, and the monitor enters the ''none'' state.  In the ''more'' and ''none'' states, calling the &lt;tt&gt;hasNext()&lt;/tt&gt; method provides no new information.  It is safe to call the &lt;tt&gt;next()&lt;/tt&gt; method from the ''more'' state, but it becomes unknown if more elements exist, so the monitor reenters the initial ''unknown'' state.  Finally, calling the &lt;tt&gt;next()&lt;/tt&gt; method from the ''none'' state results in entering the ''error'' state.  What follows is a representation of this property using parametric past time [[linear temporal logic]].

&lt;math&gt;\forall ~ \text{Iterator} ~ i \quad i.\text{next}() ~ \rightarrow ~ \odot (i.\text{hasNext}() == true)&lt;/math&gt;

This formula says that any call to the &lt;tt&gt;next()&lt;/tt&gt; method must be immediately preceded by a call to &lt;tt&gt;hasNext()&lt;/tt&gt; method that returns true.  The property here is parametric in the Iterator &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;.  Conceptually, this means that there will be one copy of the monitor for each possible Iterator in a test program, although runtime verification systems need not implement their parametric monitors this way.  The monitor for this property would be set to trigger a handler when the formula is violated (equivalently when the finite state machine enters the ''error'' state), which will occur when either &lt;tt&gt;next()&lt;/tt&gt; is called without first calling &lt;tt&gt;hasNext()&lt;/tt&gt;, or when &lt;tt&gt;hasNext()&lt;/tt&gt; is called before &lt;tt&gt;next()&lt;/tt&gt;, but returned &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== UnsafeEnum ===
[[File:Unsafeenumcode.png|right|thumb|350px|Code that violates the UnsafeEnum Property]]
The [http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Vector.html Vector] class in Java has two means for iterating over its elements.  One may use the Iterator interface, as seen in the previous example, or one may use the [http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Enumeration.html Enumeration] interface.  Besides the addition of a remove method for the Iterator interface, the main difference is that Iterator is "fail fast" while Enumeration is not.  What this means is that if one modifies the Vector (other than by using the Iterator remove method) when one is iterating over the Vector using an Iterator, a [http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html ConcurrentModificationException] is thrown.  However, when using an Enumeration this is not a case, as mentioned.  This can result in non-deterministic results from a program because the Vector is left in an inconsistent state from the perspective of the Enumeration.  For legacy programs that still use the Enumeration interface, one may wish to enforce that Enumerations are not used when their underlying Vector is modified.  The following parametric regular pattern can be used to enforce this behavior:

[[File:Unsafeenumform.jpg]]

This pattern is parametric in both the Enumeration and the Vector.  Intuitively, and as above runtime verification systems need not implement their parametric monitors this way, one may think of the parametric monitor for this property as creating and keeping track of a non-parametric monitor instance for each possible pair of Vector and Enumeration.  Some events may concern several monitors at the same time, such as &lt;tt&gt;v.update()&lt;/tt&gt;, so the runtime verification system must (again conceptually) dispatch them to all interested monitors.  Here the property is specified so that it states the bad behaviors of the program.  This property, then, must be monitored for the match of the pattern.  The figure to the right shows Java code that matches this pattern, thus violating the property.  The Vector, v, is updated after the Enumeration, e, is created, and e is then used.
&lt;!---
&lt;code lang=java&gt;
Vector&lt;String&gt; v = new Vector();
v.add("hello");
v.add("world");
v.add("again");
Enumeration&lt;String&gt; e = v.elements();
String s = ""; 
v.add("bad!");
while(e.hasMoreElements()){
   s = e.nextElement();
   System.out.println(s);
}   
&lt;/code&gt;
--&gt;

=== SafeLock ===
The previous two examples show finite state properties, but properties used in runtime verification may be much more complex.  The SafeLock property enforces the policy that the number of acquires and releases of a (reentrant) Lock class are matched within a given method call.  This, of course, disallows release of Locks in methods other than the ones that acquire them, but this is very possibly a desirable goal for the tested system to achieve.  Below is a specification of this property using a parametric context-free pattern:

[[File:Safelockform.jpg]]

[[File:Safelocktrace.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A trace showing two violations of the SafeLock property.]]
The pattern specifies balanced sequences of nested begin/end and acquire/release pairs for each Thread and Lock (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the empty sequence).  Here begin and end refer to the begin and end of every method in the program (except the calls to acquire and release themselves).  They are parametric in the Thread because it is necessary to associate the beginning and end of methods if and only if they belong to the same Thread.  The acquire and release events are also parametric in the Thread for the same reason.  They are, additionally, parametric in Lock because we do not wish to associate the releases of one Lock with the acquires of another.  In the extreme, it is possible that there will be an instance of the property, i.e., a copy of the context-free parsing mechanism, for each possible combination of Thread with Lock; this happens, again, intuitively, because runtime verification systems may implement the same functionality differently.  For example, if a system has Threads &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;t_3&lt;/math&gt; with Locks &lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l_2&lt;/math&gt;, then it is possible to have to maintain property instances for the pairs &lt;&lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;l_2&lt;/math&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;l_2&lt;/math&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;math&gt;t_3&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt;&gt;, and &lt;&lt;math&gt;t_3&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;l_2&lt;/math&gt;&gt;.  This property should be monitored for failures to match the pattern because the pattern specified correct behavior.  The figure to the right shows a trace which produces two violations of this property.  The steps down in the figure represent the beginning of a method, while the steps up are the end.  The grey arrows in the figure show the matching between given acquires and releases of the same Lock.  For simplicity, the trace shows only one Thread and one Lock.

==Research Challenges and Applications==
Most of the runtime verification research addresses one or more of the topics listed below.

===Reducing Runtime Overhead===
Observing an executing system typically incurs some runtime overhead (hardware monitors may make an exception).  It is important to reduce the overhead of runtime verification tools as much as possible, particularly when the generated monitors are deployed with the system.  Runtime overhead reducing techniques include:

* '''''Improved instrumentation'''''.  Extracting events from the executing system and sending them to monitors can generate a large runtime overhead if done naively.  Good system instrumentation is critical for any runtime verification tool, unless the tool explicitly targets existing execution logs.  There are many instrumentation approaches in current use, each with its advantages and disadvantages, ranging from custom or manual instrumentation, to specialized libraries, to compilation into aspect-oriented languages, to augmenting the virtual machine, to building upon hardware support.
* '''''Combination with static analysis'''''.  A common{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} combination of static and dynamic analyses, particularly encountered in compilers, is to monitor all the requirements which cannot be discharged statically.  A dual and ultimately equivalent approach tends to become the norm{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} in runtime verification, namely to use static analysis to reduce the amount of otherwise exhaustive monitoring.  Static analysis can be performed both on the property to monitor and on the system to be monitored.  Static analysis of the property to monitor can reveal that certain events are unnecessary to monitor, that the creation of certain monitors can be delayed, and that certain existing monitors will never trigger and thus can be garbage collected.  Static analysis of the system to monitor can detect code that can never influence the monitors.  For example, when monitoring the '''HasNext''' property above, one needs not instrument portions of code where each call &lt;tt&gt;i.next()&lt;/tt&gt; is immediately preceded on any path by a call &lt;tt&gt;i.hasnext()&lt;/tt&gt; which returns &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; (visible on the control-flow graph).
* '''''Efficient monitor generation and management'''''.  When monitoring parametric properties like the ones in the examples above, the monitoring system needs to keep track of the status of the monitored property with respect to each parameter instance.  The number of such instances is theoretically unbounded and tends to be enormous in practice.  An important research challenge is how to efficiently dispatch observed events to precisely those instances which need them.  A related challenge is how to keep the number of such instances small (so that dispatching is faster), or in other words, how to avoid creating unnecessary instances for as long as possible and, dually, how to remove already created instances as soon as they become unnecessary.  Finally, parametric monitoring algorithms typically generalize similar algorithms for generating non-parametric monitors.  Thus, the quality of the generated non-parametric monitors dictates the quality of the resulting parametric monitors.  However, unlike in other verification approaches (e.g., model checking), the number of states or the size of the generated monitor is less important in runtime verification; in fact, some monitors can have infinitely many states, such as the one for the '''SafeLock''' property above, although at any point in time only a finite number of states may have occurred.  What is important is how efficiently the monitor transits from a state to its next state when it receives an event from the executing system.

===Specifying Properties===
One of the major practical impediments of all formal approaches is that their users are reluctant to, or don't know and don't want to learn how to read or write specifications.  In some cases the specifications are implicit, such as those for deadlocks and data-races, but in most cases they need to be produced.  An additional inconvenience, particularly in the context of runtime verification, is that many existing specification languages are not expressive enough to capture the intended properties.

* '''''Better formalisms.''''' A significant amount of work in the runtime verification community has been put into designing specification formalisms that fit the desired application domains for runtime verification better than the conventional specification formalisms.  Some of these consist of slight or no syntactic changes to the conventional formalisms, but only of changes to their semantics (e.g., finite trace versus infinite trace semantics, etc.) and to their implementation (optimized finite state machines instead of Buchi automata, etc.).  Others extend existing formalisms with features that are amenable for runtime verification but may not easily be for other verification approaches, such as adding parameters, as seen in the examples above.  Finally, there are specification formalisms that have been designed specifically for runtime verification, attempting to achieve their best for this domain and caring little about other application domains.  Designing universally better or domain-specifically better specification formalisms for runtime verification is and will continue to be one of its major research challenges.
* '''''Quantitative properties.''''' Compared to other verification approaches, runtime verification is able to operate on concrete values of system state variables, which makes it possible to collect statistical information about the program execution and use this information to assess complex quantitative properties.  More expressive property languages that will allow us to fully utilize this capability are needed.
* '''''Better interfaces.''''' Reading and writing property specifications is not easy for non-experts.  Even experts often stare for minutes at relatively small temporal logic formulae (particularly when they have nested "until" operators).  An important research area is to develop powerful user interfaces for various specification formalisms that would allow users to more easily understand, write and maybe even visualize properties.
* '''''Mining specifications.''''' No matter what tool support is available to help users produce specifications, they will almost always be more pleased to have to write no specifications at all, particularly when they are trivial.  Fortunately, there are plenty of programs out there making supposedly correct use of the actions/events that one wants to have properties about.  If that is the case, then it is conceivable that one would like to make use of those correct programs by automatically learning from them the desired properties.  Even if the overall quality of the automatically mined specifications is expected to be lower than that of manually produced specifications, they can serve as a start point for the latter or as the basis for automatic runtime verification tools aimed specifically at finding bugs (where a poor specification turns into false positives or negatives, often acceptable during testing).

===Execution Models and Predictive Analysis===
The capability of a runtime verifier to detect errors strictly depends on its capability to analyze execution traces.  When the monitors are deployed with the system, instrumentation is typically minimal and the execution traces are as simple as possible to keep the runtime overhead low.  When runtime verification is used for testing, one can afford more comprehensive instrumentations that augment events with important system information that can be used by the monitors to construct and therefore analyze more refined models of the executing system.  For example, augmenting events with vector-clock information and with data and control flow information allows the monitors to construct a ''causal model'' of the running system in which the observed execution was only one possible instance.  Any other permutation of events which is consistent with the model is a feasible execution of the system, which could happen under a different thread interleaving.  Detecting property violations in such inferred executions (by monitoring them) makes the monitor ''predict'' errors which did not happen in the observed execution, but which can happen in another execution of the same system.  An important research challenge is to extract models from execution traces which comprise as many other execution traces as possible.

===Behavior Modification===
Unlike testing or exhaustive verification, runtime verification holds the promise to allow the system to recover from detected violations, through reconfiguration, micro-resets, or through finer intervention mechanisms sometimes referred to as tuning or steering.  Implementation of these techniques within the rigorous framework of runtime verification gives rise to additional challenges.

* '''''Specification of actions.'''''  One needs to specify the modification to be performed in an abstract enough fashion that does not require the user to know irrelevant implementation details. In addition, when such a modification can take place needs to be specified in order to maintain the integrity of the system.
* '''''Reasoning about intervention effects.'''''  It is important to know that an intervention improves the situation, or at least does not make the situation worse.
* '''''Action interfaces.'''''  Similar to the instrumentation for monitoring, we need to enable the system to receive action invocations.  Invocation mechanisms are by necessity going to be dependent on the implementation details of the system.  However, at the specification level, we need to provide the user with a declarative way of providing feedback to the system by specifying what actions should be applied when under what conditions.

==Related Work==

===Aspect-oriented Programming===
In recent years{{When|date=February 2016}}, researchers in Runtime Verification have recognized the potential of using [[Aspect-oriented Programming]] as a technique for defining program instrumentation in a modular way. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) generally promotes the modularization of crosscutting concerns. Runtime Verification naturally is one such concern and can hence benefit from certain properties of AOP. Aspect-oriented monitor definitions are largely declarative, and hence tend to be simpler to reason about than instrumentation expressed through a program transformation written in an imperative programming language. Further, static analyses can reason about monitoring aspects more easily than about other forms of program instrumentation, as all instrumentation is contained within a single aspect. Many current runtime verification tools are hence built in the form of specification compilers, that take an expressive high-level specification as input and produce as output code written in some  Aspect-oriented programming language (most often [[AspectJ]]).

===Combination with Formal Verification===
Runtime verification, if used in combination with provably correct recovery code, can provide an invaluable infrastructure for program verification, which can significantly lower the latter's complexity.  For example, formally verifying heap-sort algorithm is very challenging. One less challenging technique to verify it is to monitor its output to be sorted (a linear complexity monitor) and, if not sorted, then sort it using some easily verifiable procedure, say insertion sort.  The resulting sorting program is now more easily verifiable, the only thing being required from heap-sort is that it does not destroy the original elements regarded as a multiset, which is much easier to prove.  Looking at from the other direction, one can use formal verification to reduce the overhead of runtime verification, as already mentioned above for static analysis instead of formal verification.  Indeed, one can start with a fully runtime verified, but probably slow program.  Then one can use formal verification (or static analysis) to discharge monitors, same way a compiler uses static analysis to discharge runtime checks of type correctness or [[memory safety]].

===Increasing Coverage===
Compared to the more traditional verification approaches, an immediate disadvantage of runtime verification is its reduced coverage.  This is not problematic when the runtime monitors are deployed with the system (together with appropriate recovery code to be executed when the property is violated), but it may limit the effectiveness of runtime verification when used to find errors in systems.  Techniques to increase the coverage of runtime verification for error detection purposes include:

* '''''Input generation.''''' It is well known that generating a good set of inputs (program input variable values, system call values, thread schedules, etc.) can enormously increase the effectiveness of testing.  That holds true for runtime verification used for error detection, too, but in addition to using the program code to drive the input generation process, in runtime verification one can also use the property specifications, when available, and can also use monitoring techniques to induce desired behaviors.  This use of runtime verification makes it closely related to model-based testing, although the runtime verification specifications are typically general purpose, not necessarily crafted for testing reasons.  Consider, for example, that one wants to test the general-purpose ''UnsafeEnum'' property above.  Instead of just generating the above-mentioned monitor to passively observe the system execution, one can generate a smarter monitor which freezes the thread attempting to generate the second ''e.nextElement()'' event (right before it generates it), letting the other threads execute in a hope that one of them may generate a ''v.update()'' event, in which case an error has been found.
* '''''Dynamic symbolic execution.''''' In symbolic execution programs are  executed and monitored symbolically, that is, without concrete inputs.  One symbolic execution of the system may cover a large set of concrete inputs.  Off-the-shelf constraint solving or satisfiability checking techniques are often used to drive symbolic executions or to systematically explore their space.  When the underlying satisfiability checkers cannot handle a choice point, then a concrete input can be generated to pass that point; this combination of ''conc''rete and symb''olic'' execution is also referred to as concolic execution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15599">Although the subject of [[sexual dimorphism]] is not in itself controversial, the measures by which it is assessed differ widely. Most of the measures are used on the assumption that a [[random variable]] is considered so that [[probability distribution]]s should be taken into account. In this review, a series of '''sexual dimorphism measures''' are discussed concerning both their definition and the probability law on which they are based. Most of them are sample functions, or [[statistics]], which account for only partial characteristics, for example the [[mean]] or [[expected value]], of the distribution involved. Further, the most widely used measure fails to incorporate an [[Inferential statistics|inferential]] support.

==Introduction==
It is widely known that [[sexual dimorphism]] is an important component of the morphological [[variance|variation]] in biological populations (see, e.g., Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1983; Oxnard, 1987; Kelley, 1993). In higher Primates, sexual dimorphism is also related to some aspects of the social organization and behavior (Alexander ''et al.'', 1979; Clutton-Brock, 1985). Thus, it has been observed that the most dimorphic species tend to [[polygyny]] and a social organization based on male dominance, whereas in the less dimorphic species, [[monogamy]] and family groups are more common. Fleagle ''et al.'' (1980) and Kay (1982), on the other hand, have suggested that the behavior of extinct species can be inferred on the basis of sexual dimorphism and, e.g. Plavcan and van Schaick (1992) think that sex differences in size among primate species reflect processes of an ecological and social nature. Some references on sexual dimorphism regarding human populations can be seen in Lovejoy (1981), Borgognini Tarli and Repetto (1986) and Kappelman (1996).

These biological facts do not appear to be controversial. However, they are based on a series of different sexual dimorphism [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]], or indices. Sexual dimorphism, in most works, is measured on the assumption that a [[random variable]] is being taken into account. This means that there is a law which accounts for the behavior of the whole set of values that compose the domain of the random variable, a law which is called [[probability distribution|distribution function]]. Because both studies of sexual dimorphism aim at establishing differences, in some random variable, between sexes and the behavior of the random variable is accounted for by its distribution function, it follows that a sexual dimorphism study should be equivalent to a study whose main purpose is to determine to what extent the two distribution functions - one per sex - overlap (see shaded area in Fig. 1, where two [[normal distribution]]s are represented).
[[Image:Overlapnorm.jpg|thumb|Fig. 1. Two normal distributions.]]

==Measures based on sample means==
In Borgognini Tarli and Repetto (1986) an account of indices based on [[arithmetic mean|sample means]] can be seen. Perhaps, the most widely used is the quotient,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\bar{X}_m}{\bar{X}_f} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{X}_m&lt;/math&gt; is the sample mean of one sex (e.g., male) and &lt;math&gt;\bar{X}_f&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding mean of the other. Nonetheless, for instance,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{log}\frac {\bar{X}_m}{\bar{X}_f} ,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;100\frac {\bar{X}_m - \bar{X}_f}{\bar{X}_f} ,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;100\frac {\bar{X}_m - \bar{X}_f}{\bar{X}_f + \bar{X}_f} ,&lt;/math&gt;

have also been proposed.

Going over the works where these indices are used, the reader misses any reference to their [[parameter|parametric]] counterpart (see reference above). In other words, if we suppose that the quotient of two sample means is considered, no work can be found where, in order to make [[Inferential statistics|inferences]], the way in which the quotient is used as a point [[estimator|estimate]] of

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\mu_m}{\mu_f} ,&lt;/math&gt;

is discussed.

By assuming that differences between populations are the objective to analyze, when quotients of sample means are used it is important to point out that the only feature of these populations that seems to be interesting is the mean parameter. However, a population has also variance, as well as a shape which is defined by its distribution function (notice that, in general, this function depends on parameters such as means or variances).

==Measures based on something more than sample means==
Marini ''et al.'' (1999) have illustrated that it is a good idea to consider something other than sample means when sexual dimorphism is analyzed. Possibly, the main reason is that the intrasexual variability influences both the manifestation of dimorphism and its interpretation.

===Normal populations===

====Sample functions====
It is likely that, within this type of indices, the one used the most is the well-known statistic with [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t'' distribution]] (see, for instance, Green, 1989). Marini ''et al.'' (1999) have observed that variability among females seems to be lower than among males, so that it appears advisable to use the form of the Student's ''t'' statistic with degrees of freedom given by the Welch-Satterthwaite approximation,

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac {\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)} {\sqrt{\frac{S^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{S^2_2}{n_2}}} : t_\nu ,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nu = \frac {(\frac{S^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{S^2_2}{n_2})^2} {\frac{S^2_1}{n_1(n_1 - 1)} + \frac{S^2_2}{n_2(n_2 - 1)}} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S^2_i, n_i, i=1,2&lt;/math&gt; are sample variances and sample sizes, respectively.

Anyway, it is important to point out the following,
*when this statistic is taken into account in sexual dimorphism studies, two normal populations are involved. From these populations two random samples are extracted, each one corresponding to a sex, and such samples are independent.
*when inferences are considered, what we are testing by using this statistic is that the difference between two mathematical expectations is a hypothesized value, say &lt;math&gt;\mu_0 = \mu_1 - \mu_2.&lt;/math&gt;

However, in sexual dimorphism analyses, it does not appear reasonably (see Ipiña and Durand, 2000) to assume that two independent random samples have been selected. Rather on the contrary, when we sample we select some random observations - making up one sample - that sometimes correspond to one sex and sometimes to the other.

====Taking parameters into account====
Chakraborty and Majumder (1982) have proposed an index of sexual dimorphism that is the overlapping area - to be precise, its complement - of two normal [[probability density function|density]] functions (see Fig. 1). Therefore, it is a function of four parameters &lt;math&gt;\mu_i,\sigma^2_i, i=1,2&lt;/math&gt; (expected values and variances, respectively), and takes the shape of the two normals into account. Inman and Bradley (1989) have discussed this overlapping area as a measure to assess the distance between two normal densities.

Regarding inferences, Chakraborty and Majumder proposed a sample function constructed by considering the Laplace-DeMoivre's theorem (an application to [[binomial distribution|binomial]] laws of the [[central limit theorem]]). According to these authors, the variance of such a statistic is,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(\widehat{D}) = \frac {\widehat{p}_m(1 - \widehat{p}_m)}{n_m} + \frac {\widehat{p}_f(1 - \widehat{p}_f)}{n_f} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\widehat{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the statistic, and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{p}_i, n_i, i=m,f&lt;/math&gt; (male, female) stand for the estimate of the probability of observing the measurement of an individual of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; sex in some interval of the real line, and the sample size of the ''i'' sex, respectively. Notice that this implies that two independent random variables with binomial distributions have to be regarded. One of such variables is ''number of individuals of the f sex in a sample of size &lt;math&gt;n_f&lt;/math&gt; composed of individuals of the f sex'', which seems nonsensical.

===Mixture models===
Authors such as Josephson ''et al.'' (1996) believe that the two sexes to be analyzed form a single population with a probabilistic behavior denominated a [[mixture model|mixture of two normal populations]]. Thus, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable which is normally distributed among the females of a population and likewise this variable is normally distributed among the males of the population, then,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \pi_if_i(x), -\infty &lt; x &lt; \infty ,&lt;/math&gt;

is the density of the mixture with two normal components, where &lt;math&gt;f_i, \pi_i, i=1,2&lt;/math&gt; are the normal densities and the mixing proportions of both sexes, respectively. See an example in Fig. 2 where the thicker curve represents the mixture whereas the thinner curves are the &lt;math&gt;\pi_if_i&lt;/math&gt; functions.
[[Image:Overlapmix.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2. A mixture of two normal components.]]

It is from a population modelled like this that a random sample with individuals of both sexes can be selected. Note that on this sample tests which are based on the normal assumption cannot be applied since, in a mixture of two normal components,  &lt;math&gt;\pi_if_i&lt;/math&gt; is not a normal density.

Josephson ''et al.'' limited themselves to considering two normal mixtures with the same component variances and mixing proportions. As a consequence, their proposal to measure sexual dimorphism is the difference between the mean parameters of the two normals involved. In estimating these central parameters, the procedure used by Josephson ''et al.'' is the one of [[Method of moments (statistics)|Pearson's moments]]. Nowadays, the [[Expectation-maximization algorithm|EM expectation maximization algorithm]] (see McLachlan and Basford, 1988) and the [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|MCMC Markov chain Monte Carlo]] [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian procedure]] (see Gilks ''et al.'', 1996) are the two competitors for estimating mixture parameters.

Possibly the main difference between considering two independent normal populations and a mixture model of two normal components is in the mixing proportions, which is the same as saying that in the two independent normal population model the interaction between sexes is ignored. This, in turn implies that probabilistic properties change (see Ipiña and Durand, 2000).

====The MI measure====
Ipiña and Durand (2000, 2004) have proposed a measure of sexual dimorphism called &lt;math&gt;MI&lt;/math&gt;. This proposal computes the overlapping area between the &lt;math&gt;\pi_1f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2f_2&lt;/math&gt; functions, which represent the contribution of each sex to the two normal components mixture (see shaded area in Fig. 2). Thus, &lt;math&gt;MI&lt;/math&gt; can be written,

:&lt;math&gt;MI = \int_R \operatorname{min}[\pi_1f_1(x), (1 - \pi_1)f_2(x)]\,dx ,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; being the real line.

The smaller the overlapping area the greater the gap between the two functions &lt;math&gt;\pi_1f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2f_2&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the sexual dimorphism is greater. Obviously, this index is a function of the five parameters that characterize a mixture of two normal components (&lt;math&gt;\mu_i, \sigma^2_i, \pi_1, i=1,2)&lt;/math&gt;. Its range is in the interval &lt;math&gt;(0, 0.5]&lt;/math&gt;, and the interested reader can see, in the work of the authors who proposed the index, the way in which an interval estimate is constructed.

===Measures based on non-parametric methods===
Marini ''et al.'' (1999) have suggested the [[Kolmogorov-Smirnov test|Kolmogorov-Smirnov]] distance as a measure of sexual dimorphism. The authors use the following form of the statistic,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{max}_x|F_1(x) - F_2(x)| ,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;F_i, i=1,2&lt;/math&gt; being sample cumulative distributions corresponding to two independent random samples.

Such a distance has the advantage of being applicable whatever the form of the random variable distributions concerned, yet they should be continuous. The use of this distance assumes that two populations are involved. Further, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is a sample function whose aim is to test that the two samples under analysis have been selected from a single distribution. If one accepts the [[null hypothesis]], then there is not sexual dimorphism; otherwise, there is.

A [[child beauty pageant]] is a beauty contest where contestants are usually under 16 years of age. There does not appear to be reliable statistics about the number of these pageants held each year around the world. They vary in style, and categories may include a talent segment as well as costume and theme wear. Contestants often wear makeup, fake teeth, [[Eyelash extensions|false eyelashes]], [[lipstick]], elaborate hairstyles with [[Artificial hair integrations|hair extensions]], and specially designed, sometimes provocative, outfits. Spray tanning and waxing are also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=16 Horrifying Child Beauty Pageant Pictures|url=http://firsttoknow.com/16-horrifying-child-beauty-pageant-pictures/|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugly truth about beauty pageants|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/ugly-truth-about-beauty-pageants/news-story/715edcfaf127b65e929bbd67cef5f145|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contestants compete for prizes and are judged on the way they look and how they act on stage, similar to the judgment criteria in adult [[beauty pageant]]s. The way that the children look is clearly artificial and often detracts from their natural appearances. Many parents attribute confidence-building as one of the reasons they enter their children in [[beauty pageant]]s, but critics argue that the negative effects of beauty pageantry, especially the [[sexualization]] of young children, outweigh the positive intentions.


== Background ==
There are several components to sexualization that set it apart from healthy [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. Sexualization occurs when a person’s value comes only from his or her [[sexual appeal]] or [[behavior]], to the exclusion of other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Oppliger | first=Patrice | author-link = Patrice Oppliger | title = Girls gone skank: the sexualization of girls in American culture | year = 2008 | publisher = McFarland and Company Inc., Publishers | location = Jefferson, North Carolina |pages = 1–2 | isbn = 9780786435227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the [[American Psychological Association]] more specifically cites sexuality that is imposed on someone, rather than undertaken by choice, as evidence of sexualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, legal adulthood and ability to give [[consent]] typically does not come until age 18,{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} yet in child beauty pageants, the children's consenting parents permit them to participate, pay their entry fees, dress them, and train them to perform on stage in front of judges and an audience.

In preparation for these beauty pageants, children have their appearances altered by costumes, makeup, and other products to the point that they resemble dolls, which [[objectification|objectifies]] them at a very young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=Myke|title=Sex Sells: Child Sexualization and the Media|journal=Screen Education|year=2008|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child perceives that sexuality is not only encouraged but can be a means to an end.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt; The child pageant industry involves thousands of contestants and $5 billion a year in revenue,&lt;ref name=Truthout&gt;{{cite web|last=Giroux|first=Henry A.|title=Child Beauty Pageants: A Scene From the "Other America"|url=http://archive.truthout.org/051109a|work=Truthout|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and television networks air in-demand shows like ''[[Toddlers &amp; Tiaras]]'' and ''[[Little Miss Perfect]]''. The viewership implies that many adults not only condone these activities but also the view of children as sexual objects.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt;

=== Bikini contests of minors===
''Miss Tanguita'', which translates as "Miss Child Bikini", is held in Barbosa, Santader, [[Colombia]] as annual part of the "del Rio Suarez" Festival. Activists say that the competition, though legal, abuses the human rights of minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pekanbaru.tribunnews.com/2015/01/14/wah-kontes-ratu-bikini-anak-anak-digelar-di-negara-ini |title=Wah, Kontes Ratu Bikini Anak-anak Digelar di Negara Ini |author=Raya Desmawanto Nainggolan |date=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2016, the [[Miss Teen USA]] pageant removed the swimsuit competition and replaced it with an athleticwear round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/shows/total_divas/news/781840/first-look-see-what-miss-teen-usa-contestants-will-wear-instead-of-bikinis|title=First Look!

== Support for participation ==
Despite criticism of child beauty pageants, contestants' parents continue to argue for the positive impact these competitions have on their children's personal development. Supporters often cite self-confidence and poise as attributes that children learn during the pageant process, and still more defend pageants as being similar to other athletic, music, or educational programs. Since young girls like playing dress up and enjoy participating in beauty pageants, they argue, they are positive events.&lt;ref name=Michael /&gt; The Pageant Director for the Cities of America preliminary pageant system echoes these sentiments and argues that pageants are good for girls—they develop self-confidence by actively trying to be a part of something, they compete with others through a fair process, and they enjoy meeting others with similar interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jen|title=Pageantry With Purpose|url=http://nationalsteenpageants.wordpress.com/about/|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to communicate and network with others is an important skill that children learn at a young age when participating in beauty pageants. Through pageants, children also learn how to communicate with adults.&lt;ref name="Kids Formal" /&gt;

One pageant mother insists that pageants have helped her daughter "gain poise, [[confidence]], [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]], [[discipline]] and grace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Beauty Pageants Are Good For Girls|url=http://shine.yahoo.com/parenting/why-beauty-pageants-are-good-for-girls-2447925.html|publisher=Shine from Yahoo|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be true for some contestants, as the child's attitude typically derives from the parent. When the parents embrace a positive attitude, the children will follow. In these cases, pageants can teach children how to be gracious winners and good losers. They will learn the aspects of rules, and fair play. Thus, pageants teach children how to be calm, cool, and collected in front of crowds. Supporters believe participants learn tenacity when they fail and must move on, and they practice arduously trying to achieve something which proves even more valuable when they are successful.&lt;ref name="Kids Formal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits of Child Beauty Pageants|url=http://www.kidsformal.com/product-p/benefits%20of%20child%20beauty%20pagea.htm|publisher=Kids Formal|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From some child contestants' perspectives, pageants are fun and a way to make new friends, and they are able to feel good about their friends winning.&lt;ref name=Michael&gt;{{cite web|last=Inbar|first=Michael|title=Parents defend Putting their kids in beauty pageants|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/28873086/ns/today-parenting_and_family/t/parents-defend-putting-their-kids-beauty-pageants/#.T5SX0hxztZ4|publisher=Today Parenting|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of sexualization in child pageants==
One critic debunks these claims by questioning the age-appropriateness of these pageants and whether they achieve any positive outcomes or not. After all, playing [[dress-up]] does not result in one winner and many losers, and children may enjoy appeasing parents rather than the activity itself.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt; A writer for the [[New York Times]], criticized child beauty pageants because participants and viewers impose adulthood on children while still expecting them to radiate innocence.&lt;ref name=Karen&gt;{{cite web|last=De Witt|first=Karen|title=Never Too Young to Be Perfect|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/12/weekinreview/never-too-young-to-be-perfect.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Vernon R. Wiehe, professor in the [[University of Kentucky]] College of Social Work, states, "sexualization occurs through little girls wearing adult women's clothing in diminutive sizes, the use of makeup which often is applied by makeup consultants, spray tanning the body, the dying of hair and the use of hair extensions, and assuming provocative postures more appropriate for adult models".&lt;ref name=Vernon&gt;{{cite web|last=Vernon|first=Wiehe|title=Nothing Pretty in Child Pageants|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2011/08/14/1844981/nothing-pretty-in-child-pageants.html|publisher=kentucky.com|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many view the child's appearance as obscene or inappropriate.

They are dressed in revealing clothes or evening gowns, and some children wear high heels. Children are in “Child Beauty Pageants” only because of their age. These children are judged along the same criteria as an adult pageant woman would be judged on. Stated by Laura Pappano, in a New York Times featuring child pageants, "beauty pageants in particular blur the lines between what is cute and what is sensual.&lt;ref name=Karen /&gt; "This is not about cutest baby contests, which most people would see as harmless enough, but rather about adult-like competitions featuring kids pretending to be sexy adults".{{cite web|last=Korn|first=Neer|title=Nanny state ok when it comes to kids and sex|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/nanny-state-ok-when-it-comes-to-kids-and-sex-20110517-1eqnl.html|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carleton Kendrick, a family therapist out of Boston says, "At its core, [pageants are] teaching girls that the best thing [they] can do, and the most attention they can get is to view [themselves] as an assemblage of body parts. And that you will focus on drawing attention to those body parts sets them up for all manner of problems in their lives — self-esteem, eating disorders, relationships they enter into".&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=Mandy|title=Toddlers and Tears: The Sexualization of Young Girls|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865567072/Toddlers-and-Tears-The-sexualization-of-young-girls.html?pg=all|publisher=deseretnews.com|accessdate=6 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of child sexualization==
In reports of children being sexually abused research shows that the sexualization of children is a contributing factor to their abuse.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt; Also, if the child is winning constantly in a competition that is based primarily on her looks, she is more likely to develop [[psychological]] issues later on in life, such as depression, low self-esteem, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite book | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 | oclc = 123130352 }} [http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a link to lowered sexual efficacy and contraceptive use later in life.

"'Some critics contend that the child beauty pageant culture fails to acknowledge that "sexualized images of little girls may have dangerous implications in a world where 450,000 American children were reported as victims of sexual abuse in 1993."&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, Henry. "Child Beauty Pageants and the Politics of Innocence." ''Nymphatic ''Fantasies'''' 16 (1998). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lucia Grosaru states, in her Everyday Psychology article, “contests promote physical beauty as a main value, complimented of course by the “special talent” and “warm hearts”. A child, especially a female that is going to pay so much attention to her looks and that knows she is being assessed for it, is very prone to develop [[eating disorder]]s, such as [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] or [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grosaru|first=Lucia|title=Toddlers and Children Beauty Pageants- Risk Factors for Severe Psychological Turmoils|url=http://psychologycorner.com/toddlers-and-children-beauty-pageants-risk-factors-for-severe-psychological-turmoils/|publisher=Psychology Corner|accessdate=27 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds and thousands of dollars are spent on [[costumes]], [[cosmetics]], and even beauty consultants. Some question what does, in fact, happen to a child's self-esteem if she loses the pageant after her parents have spent so much money on it.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt;

Martina M. Cartwright, an adjunct professor of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Arizona, states in her article on child beauty pageants, “many experts agree that participation in activities that focus on physical appearance at an early age can influence teen and/or adult self-esteem, body image and self-worth. Issues with self-identity after a child "retires" from the pageant scene in her teens are not uncommon.  Struggles with perfection, dieting, eating disorders and body image can take their toll in adulthood”.&lt;ref name=Martina&gt;{{cite web|last=Cartwright|first=Martina|title=Child Beauty Pageants: What Are We Teaching Our Girls?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/food-thought/201108/child-beauty-pageants-what-are-we-teaching-our-girls|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers are usually involved in their child's participation in pageants, so there's a lot of information regarding their outlook on the contests. Social worker Mark Sichel believes that many mothers "push their daughters into pageants because of their own low self-esteem, or as compensation for a perceived lack of attention and admiration in their own lives". As a result of these mother's constant pushing, many of these young girls feel as if they let their mothers down by losing.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Lucy|title=Darling Divas Or Damaged Daughters? The Dark Side Of Child Beauty Pageants And An Administrative Law Solution|url=http://www.tulanelawreview.org/87-2-wolfe/|publisher=Tulane Law Review|accessdate=8 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To pull from a fathers point of view, an [http://thefatherfactor.blogspot.com/2012/03/no-child-beauty-pageants-for-my.html internet blog], "The Father Factor", has an interesting perspective on the topic of child beauty pageants. One father writes, "the mothers of the young pageant contestants all push their girls, some young as two, to emotional and physical limits. They parade the little girls around in makeup, big hairdos, and even bathing suits...I don’t see how a beauty pageant, especially at such young ages, promotes anything other than [[vanity]]."&lt;ref name=D.L.&gt;{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=D.L.|title=No Child Beauty Pageants For My Daughter Please|url=http://thefatherfactor.blogspot.com/2012/03/no-child-beauty-pageants-for-my.html|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, after a 10-year-old girl was featured on the cover of [[Vogue Paris]] in an inappropriate outfit- not fit for a child, lawmakers banned child beauty pageants all together.&lt;ref name=D.L. /&gt;

So much effort and time goes into the preparation for a pageant. Children must constantly be practicing their routines, and creating their pageant look, so they have limited time to play. Through play itself, children develop skills they use the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt;

[[File:Waveguide slotted line.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Waveguide slotted line]]
'''Slotted lines''' are used for [[microwave]] measurements and consist of a movable probe inserted into a slot in a [[transmission line]].   They are used in conjunction with a microwave power source and usually, in keeping with their low-cost application, a low cost [[Schottky diode]] detector and [[VSWR meter]] rather than an expensive [[microwave power meter]].

Slotted lines can measure [[standing wave]]s, [[wavelength]], and, with some calculation or plotting on [[Smith chart]]s, a number of other parameters including [[reflection coefficient]] and [[electrical impedance]].  A precision variable [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] is often incorporated in the test setup to improve accuracy.  This is used to make level measurements, while the detector and VSWR meter are retained only to mark a reference point for the attenuator to be set to, thus eliminating entirely the detector and meter measurement errors.  The parameter most commonly measured by a slotted line is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the impedance match to the item under test.  This is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines; high [[standing wave ratio]] on a radio or TV antenna can distort the signal, increase transmission line loss and potentially damage components in the transmission path, possibly even the transmitter. 

Slotted lines are no longer widely used, but can still be found in budget applications.  Their main drawback is that they are labour-intensive to use and require calculation, tables, or plotting to make use of the results.  They need to be made with mechanical precision and the probe and its detector need to be adjusted with care, but they can give very accurate results.

==Description==
The slotted line is one of the basic instruments used in [[radio frequency]] test and measurement at [[microwave]] frequencies.  It consists of a precision [[transmission line]], usually [[co-axial cable|co-axial]] but [[waveguide]] implementations are also used, with a movable insulated [[Test probe#Near-field probe|probe]] inserted into a longitudinal slot cut into the line.  In a co-axial slotted line, the slot is cut into the outer conductor of the line.  The probe is inserted past the outer conductor, but not so far that it touches the inner conductor.  In a rectangular waveguide, the slot is usually cut along the centre of the broad wall of the waveguide.  Circular waveguide slotted lines are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Gupta, page 113| Voltmer, pages&amp;nbsp;146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slotted lines are relatively cheap&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Thomas H. Lee (engineering professor)|Thomas H. Lee]] even describes a [[microstrip]] slotted line for use up to {{nowrap|5 GHz}} that he claims can be made for less than $10.  He calls this a "{{nowrap|40 dB}} cost reduction" over the price of a network analyser.  That is, its cost is 10,000 times less than an analyser costing $100,000 (Lee, pages xv, 268-271).&lt;/ref&gt; and can perform many of the measurements done by more expensive equipment such as [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analysers]].  However, slotted line measurement techniques are more labour-intensive and often do not directly output the desired parameter; some calculation or plotting is frequently required.  In particular, they can only carry out a measurement at one spot frequency at a time so producing a plot of a parameter versus [[frequency]] is very time consuming.  This is to be compared to modern instruments like network and [[Spectrum analyzer|spectrum analysers]] which are intrinsically [[Radio-frequency sweep|frequency swept]] and produce a plot instantly.  Slotted lines have now largely been superseded, but are still found where [[capital cost]]s are an issue.  Their remaining uses are mostly in the [[millimetre band]], where modern test apparatus is either prohibitively expensive or not available at all, and with academic laboratories and hobbyists.  They are also useful as a teaching aid as the user is more directly exposed to basic line phenomena than with more sophisticated instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, page 496| Lee, pages 246, 251, 268| Voltmer, page 146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The slotted line works by sampling the [[electric field]] inside the transmission line with the probe.  For accuracy, it is important that the probe disturbs the field as little as possible.  For this reason the probe diameter and slot width are kept small (usually around {{nowrap|1 mm}}) and the probe is inserted in no further than necessary.  It is also necessary in waveguide slotted lines to place the slot at a position where the current in the waveguide walls is parallel to the slot.  The current will then not be disturbed by the presence of the slot as long as it is not too wide.  For the [[waveguide dominant mode|dominant mode]] this is on the centre-line of the broad face of the waveguide, but for some [[transverse mode|other modes]] it may need to be off-centre.  This is not an issue for the co-axial line because this operates in the [[Transverse electromagnetic mode|TEM]] (transverse electromagnetic) mode and hence the current is everywhere parallel to the slot.  The slot may be tapered at its ends to avoid [[discontinuity (transmission lines)|discontinuities]] causing reflections.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;497–498| Gupta, page 113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disturbance to the field inside the line caused by the insertion of the probe is minimised as far as possible.  There are two parts to this disturbance.  The first part is due to the power the probe has extracted from the line and manifests as a [[lumped element model|lumped equivalent circuit]] of a [[resistor]].  This is minimised by limiting the distance the probe is inserted into the line so that only enough power is extracted for the detector to operate effectively.  The second part of the disturbance is due to energy stored in the field around the probe and manifests as a lumped equivalent of a [[capacitor]].  This [[capacitance]] can be cancelled out with an [[inductance]] of equal and opposite [[electrical impedance|impedance]].  Lumped inductors are not practical at microwave frequencies; instead, an adjustable [[stub (electronics)|stub]] with an inductive equivalent circuit is used to "tune out" the probe capacitance.  The result is an equivalent circuit of a high impedance in [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt]] across the line which has little effect on the transmitted power in the line.  The probe is more sensitive as a result of this tuning and the distance it is inserted can be further limited as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer, page 148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test setup==
[[File:Annotated slotted line test station.png|320 px|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' A test setup using a waveguide slotted line]]
[[File:Slotted line.png|thumb|'''Figure 3.''' Co-axial slotted line]]
A typical test setup with a waveguide slotted line is shown in figure 2.  Referring to this figure, power from a test equipment source (not shown)  enters the apparatus through the co-axial cable on the left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a [[co-ax to waveguide launcher|launcher]] (1).   This is followed by a section of waveguide (2) providing a transition to a smaller size of guide.  An important component in the setup is the [[Isolator (microwave)|isolator]] (3) which prevents power being reflected back into the source.  Depending on the test conditions, such [[Signal reflection|reflections]] can be large and a high-power source may be damaged by the returning wave.  The power entering the slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] (4).  This is followed by the slotted line itself (5) above which is the probe mounted on a movable carriage.  The carriage also carries the probe adjustements: (6) is the probe depth adjustment, (7) is a length of co-axial section with tuning adjustments, and (8) is a ''detector'', which uses either a point contact ''crystal rectifier'' or a Schottky barrier diode.&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;H. C. Torrey, C. A. Whitmer, ''Crystal Rectifiers'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The right-hand end of the slotted line is terminated in a [[Impedance matching|matched load]] (9) which absorbs all the power exiting the end of the waveguide.  The load can be replaced by the component or system that it is desired to test.  It can also be replaced with a reference short-circuit (10) which is used to calibrate the slotted line.  The carriage can be moved along the slotted line by means of a rotary knob (11) which simultaneously moves a [[vernier gauge]] (12) for accurate measurement of the probes position along the line.&lt;ref&gt;Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;496–498&lt;/ref&gt;

The probe is connected to a detector and a display meter (not shown in figure 2).  These can be, respectively, a [[thermistor]] and power meter, or an [[envelope detector]] and [[VSWR meter]].  The detector can be a crystal detector or a [[Schottky barrier diode]].  The detector is mounted on the probe assembly, usually a distance λ/4&lt;ref group=note&gt;'''λ''', the customary symbol for [[wavelength]].  It is usually most convenient to give distances on transmission lines in terms of wavelengths of the transmitted wave, or sometimes, when the distance involved is small or not an exact multiple of a quarter wavelength, in [[radian]]s where θ=2πλ radians.&lt;/ref&gt; from the probe tip as shown in figure 3.  This is because the detector looks almost like a short circuit to the transmission line, and this distance will convert it to an open circuit through the [[quarter-wave impedance transformer]] effect.  Thus, the detector has minimal effect on loading the line.  The probe tuning stub can be seen on figure 3 branching from the line linking the probe to the detector.  Figure 2 has a slightly different arrangement; the main probe into the waveguide leads to a vertical co-axial tuning and adjustment section but the detector is on a horizontal side-section with a secondary probe into the upright co-axial section.&lt;ref&gt;Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;496–497&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurements==
Measurements of microwave power can be made directly, usually with a thermistor based detector and meter.  However, these instruments are expensive and a common meter used in measurements with a slotted line is instead a cheaper low-frequency VSWR meter.  The microwave power source is [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] with, typically, a {{nowrap|1 kHz}} signal which is recovered by the envelope detector in the probe and sent to the VSWR meter.  This scheme is preferred to simply detecting the unmodulated [[carrier signal|carrier]] directly, which would result in a [[direct current|DC]] output, because a stable, narrowband, [[tuned amplifier]] can be used to amplify the {{nowrap|1 kHz}} signal.  A large amplification is required in the VSWR meter because the limit of the square law range&lt;ref group=note&gt;'''square law''', of a detector diode, the range over which the demodulated output voltage is proportional to the square of the carrier voltage on the line.&lt;/ref&gt; of the detector diode is no more than {{nowrap|10 μW}}.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, page 496| Voltmer, page 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxima and minima===
[[File:Standing Wave Ratio.svg|thumb|'''Figure 4.'''  Standing wave patterns on a line for various reflection coefficients showing maxima and minima]]
When the slotted line is terminated with a precision matching load there is no variation in the detected power along the line, other than a very small decrease due to losses in the line.  However, when this is replaced by a [[device under test]] (DUT) which is not perfectly matched to the line there will be a [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|reflection back towards the source]].  This causes a [[standing wave]] to be set up on the line with periodic [[maxima and minima]] (collectively, ''extrema'') due to alternating constructive and destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].  These extrema are found by moving the probe back and forth along the line and the level at that point can then be measured on the meter.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, pages&amp;nbsp;113–114&lt;/ref&gt;

The extrema are not of any great interest in themselves, but are used in the calculation of several more useful parameters.  Some of these parameters require the measurement of the exact position of the extremum.  Either maxima or minima can equally be used, from a mathematical point of view, but minima are preferred because they are always much sharper than maxima, especially for large reflections, as shown in figure 4.  Additionally, the probe causes less disturbance to the field near a minimum than it does near a maximum.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer, pages&amp;nbsp;147–148&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wavelength===
[[Wavelength]] is determined by measuring the distance between two adjacent minima.  This distance will be λ/2.  There is no need for a DUT, better results are obtained with the reference short in position.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, page 498| Voltmer, page 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standing wave ratio===
[[Standing wave ratio]] (SWR or VSWR) is a basic parameter and the one most commonly measured on a slotted line.  This quantity is of particular importance for transmitter [[Antenna (radio)|antennae]].  A high SWR indicates a poor match between the feed line and the antenna, which increases wasted power, can cause damage to components in the transmission path, possibly including the transmitter, and cause distortion to TV, FM stereo and digital signals.  With the input power set so that the maxima are at 0 [[dBm]], a measurement of a minimum in decibels will directly give SWR (after discarding the minus sign).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, pages&amp;nbsp;112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflection coefficient===
The [[reflection coefficient]], ρ, is the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident wave.  In general it is a [[complex number]].  The magnitude of the reflection coeffient can be calculated from the VSWR measurement by,

:&lt;math&gt; | \rho | = \frac{\mathrm{VSWR}-1}{\mathrm{VSWR}+1}&lt;/math&gt;

where VSWR is the standing wave ratio expressed as a voltage ratio (not in [[decibel]]s).  However, to completely characterise the reflection coefficient, the phase of ρ must also be found.  This is done on a slotted line by measuring the distance of the first minimum from the DUT.  Moving the probe right up to the DUT is not practicable so a different approach is usually adopted.  The position of the first minimum when the reference short is in place is noted.  The distance back along the line from this reference point to the next minimum when the DUT is in place will be the same as the distance from the DUT to the first minimum.  This is so because the reference short guarantees a minimum at the DUT position.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Gupta, pages&amp;nbsp;112–113| Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Phase (waves)|phase]] part of ρ is given by,

:&lt;math&gt;\angle \rho = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda} x - \pi&lt;/math&gt;

where λ is the wavelength and ''x'' is the distance to the first minimum as described earlier.  The magnitude and phase representation of ρ can, if required, be expressed as real and imaginary parts instead by the usual manipulation of complex numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Connor, pages&amp;nbsp;29–32| Das &amp; Das, page 498, 514-515| Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impedance===
The impedance, ''Z'', of the DUT can be calculated from the reflection coefficient by,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_0 \frac {1 + \rho}{1 - \rho}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the characteristic impedance of the line.  An alternative method is to plot the VSWR and distance to the node (in wavelengths) on a [[Smith chart]].  These quantities are directly measured by the slotted line.  From this plot the DUT impedance (normalised to ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) can be read directly off the Smith chart.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Connor, pages&amp;nbsp;34–38| Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;514–515| Gupta, page 112, 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy considerations==

Good slotted lines are precision made instruments.  They need to be because mechanical defects can affect accuracy.  Some of the mechanical issues that are relevant to this include [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] of the vernier, concentricity of the inner and outer conductor, circularity of the outer conductor, centrality and straightness of the inner conductor, variations in cross-section, and the ability of the carriage to maintain a constant probe depth.  Issues with probe tuning and disturbances to the field have already been discussed, but the insulated spacers holding the centre conductor in place can also disturb the field.  Consequently, these are made as discrete as is compatible with mechanical strength.  However, the greatest source of inaccuracy is usually not the slotted line itself, but the characteristics of the detector diode.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;251–252&lt;/ref&gt;

The detected voltage signal output of the Schottky barrier diodes typically used in microwave detectors have a square law relationship to the power being measured and meters are calibrated accordingly.  However, as the power increases, the diode deviates significantly from a square law and remains accurate up to an output voltage of only around {{nowrap|5-10 mV}}.  This can be improved a little by adding a load resistor to the detector output, but this also has the undesirable effect of decreasing sensitivity.  Another technique is to reduce the range of power being measured (so that it is brought within the square law range of the detector) by measuring at a point other than a maximum.  The maximum is then calculated from the known mathematical shape of the standing wave pattern.  This has the objection that it adds significantly to the labour required to make the measurements, as does the technique of precisely calibrating the detector and adjusting the readings on the meter according to a calibration chart.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;252–254&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to completely eliminate errors in the detector and meter if a precision variable attenuator is used in the test setup.  In this technique a minimum is first found and the attenuator adjusted so that the meter is indicating precisely some convenient mark.  A maximum is then found and the attenuation increased until the meter is indicating the same mark.  The amount the attenuation had to be increased is the VSWR of the standing wave.  Accuracy here depends on the accuracy of the attenuator and not at all on the detector.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, page 253&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social stress''' is [[stress (biological)|stress]] that stems from one's relationships with others and from the social environment in general.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2018.

Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal]] theory of emotion, stress arises when a person evaluates a situation as personally relevant and perceives that s/he does not have the resources to cope or handle the specific situation.&lt;ref&gt;

There are three main categories of social stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, S., 2017. Social stress.

Humans are social beings by [[human nature|nature]], as they typically have a fundamental need and desire to maintain positive social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Slavich | first=George M |author2=O'Donovan, Aoife |author3=Epel, Elissa S |author4= Kemeny, Margaret E  | title=Black sheep get the blues: a psychobiological model of social rejection and depression | journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | date=September 2010 | volume=35 | issue=1 | pages=39–45 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.01.003 | pmid=20083138 | pmc=2926175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they usually find maintaining positive social ties to be beneficial.

Social stress is typically the most frequent type of stressor that people experience in their daily lives and affects people more intensely than other types of stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Almeida, D.M. | year=2005 | title=Resilience and vulnerability to daily stressors assessed via diary methods | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=64–68 | url=http://www.midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/116.pdf | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00336.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Researchers define social stress and social stressors in various ways.  Wadman, Durkin, and Conti-Ramsden (2011) defined social stress as "the feelings of discomfort or anxiety that individuals may experience in social situations, and the associated tendency to avoid potentially stressful social situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress in young people with specific language impairment|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197110001016|journal = Journal of Adolescence|date = 2011-06-01|pages = 421–431|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2010.06.010|first = Ruth|last = Wadman|first2 = Kevin|last2 = Durkin|first3 = Gina|last3 = Conti-Ramsden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilfield (1977) defined social stressors as "circumstances of daily social roles that are generally considered problematic or undesirable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Current social stressors and symptoms of depression|journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry|date = 1977-02-01|issn = 0002-953X|pmid = 835737|pages = 161–166|volume = 134|issue = 2|doi = 10.1176/ajp.134.2.161|first = F. W.|last = Ilfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dormann and Zapf (2004) defined social stressors as "a class of characteristics, situations, episodes, or behaviors that are related to psychological or physical strain and that are somehow social in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Customer-Related Social Stressors and Burnout|last = Dormann|first = Christian|date = January 2004|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Zapf|first2 = Dieter|issue = 9.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
Social stress is typically measured through self-report questionnaires.  In the laboratory, researchers can induce social stress through various methods and protocols.

=== Self-reports ===
There are several questionnaires used to assess environmental and psychosocial stress.  Such self-report measures include the Test of Negative Social Exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ruehlman | first=Linda S. |author2=Karoly, Paul  | title=With a little flak from my friends: Development and preliminary validation of the Test of Negative Social Exchange (TENSE) | journal=Psychological Assessment | year=1991  | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=97–104 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.3.1.97}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Marital Adjustment Test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Locke | first=Harvey J. |author2=Wallace, Karl M.  | title=Short Marital-Adjustment and Prediction Tests: Their Reliability and Validity | journal=Marriage and Family Living| date=August 1959 | volume=21 | issue=3 | page=251 | doi=10.2307/348022 | jstor=348022}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Risky Families Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Shelley E |author2=Lerner, Jennifer S |author3=Sage, Rebecca M |author4=Lehman, Barbara J |author5= Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Early environment, emotions, responses to stress, and health | journal=Journal of Personality | date=December 2004 | volume=72 | issue=6 | pages=1365–1393 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00300.x | pmid=15509286 | url=http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/lernerlab/files/taylor_lerner_sage_lehman_seeman_2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Holmes–Rahe Stress Inventory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The social readjustment rating scale|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022399967900104|journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research|pages = 213–218|volume = 11|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0022-3999(67)90010-4|first = Thomas H.|last = Holmes|first2 = Richard H.|last2 = Rahe|pmid=6059863|date=August 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Trierer Inventar zur Erfassung von chronischem Streß (TICS): Skalenkonstruktion, teststatistische Überprüfung und Validierung der Skala Arbeitsüberlastung|url = http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1026//0012-1924.45.1.8|journal = Diagnostica|date = 1999-01-01|issn = 0012-1924|pages = 8–19|volume = 45|issue = 1|doi = 10.1026//0012-1924.45.1.8|first = Peter|last = Schulz|first2 = Wolff|last2 = Schlotz}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Daily Stress Inventory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A daily stress inventory: Development, reliability, and validity|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00845128|journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine|date = 1987-02-01|issn = 0160-7715|pages = 61–73|volume = 10|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/BF00845128|first = Phillip J.|last = Brantley|first2 = Craig D.|last2 = Waggoner|first3 = Glenn N.|last3 = Jones|first4 = Neil B.|last4 = Rappaport}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Job Content Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ): An instrument for internationally comparative assessments of psychosocial job characteristics.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1076-8998.3.4.322|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|pages = 322–355|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.3.4.322|first = Robert|last = Karasek|first2 = Chantal|last2 = Brisson|first3 = Norito|last3 = Kawakami|first4 = Irene|last4 = Houtman|first5 = Paulien|last5 = Bongers|first6 = Benjamin|last6 = Amick}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Perceived Stress Scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Global Measure of Perceived Stress|journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior|date = 1983-12-01|pages = 385–396|volume = 24|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2136404|first = Sheldon|last = Cohen|first2 = Tom|last2 = Kamarck|first3 = Robin|last3 = Mermelstein|jstor=2136404|pmid=6668417}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stress and Adversity Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Slavich, G. M., &amp; Epel, E. S. (2010). The Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN): An automated system for assessing cumulative stress exposure. Los Angeles: University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to self-report questionnaires, researchers can employ structured interview assessments. The Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS) is one of the most popular instruments used in research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Measuring Stress: A Guide for Health and Social Scientists|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6NDhBwAAQBAJ|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 1997-11-17|isbn = 9780190283889|first = Sheldon|last = Cohen|first2 = Ronald C.|last2 = Kessler|first3 = Lynn Underwood|last3 = Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social origins of depression: A study of psychiatric disorder in women|last = Brown|first = George William|publisher = Tavistock|year = 1978|isbn = 0-422-76310-1|location = London|pages = |last2 = Harris|first2 = Tirril}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this type of measure is to probe the participant to elaborate on his/her stressful life events, rather than answering singular questions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The UCLA Life Stress Interview (LSI), which is similar to the LEDS, includes questions about romantic partners, closest friendships, other friendships, and family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hammen Lab at UCLA|url = http://hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu/interview.html|website = hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Induction ===
In [[mouse model|rodent models]], [[social disruption]] and [[social defeat]] are two common social stress paradigms. In the social disruption paradigm, an aggressive rodent is introduced into a cage housing male rodents that have already naturally established a social hierarchy. The aggressive "intruder" disrupts the social hierarchy, causing the residents social stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress induces glucocorticoid resistance in macrophages|url = http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/280/6/R1799|journal = American Journal of Physiology.

In human research, the [[Trier social stress test|Trier Social Stress Task]] (TSST) is widely used to induce social stress in the laboratory. In the TSST, participants are told that they have to prepare and give a speech about why they would be a great candidate for their ideal job.  The experimenter films the participant while s/he gives the speech and informs the participant that a panel of judges will evaluate that speech.  After the public speaking component, the experimenter administers a mathematics task that involves counting backwards by certain increments.  If the participant makes a mistake, the experimenter prompts him/her to start again.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kirschbaum | first=C |author2=Pirke, K M |author3=Hellhammer, D H  | title=The 'Trier Social Stress Test'—a tool for investigating psychobiological stress responses in a laboratory setting | journal=Neuropsychobiology | year=1993 | volume=28 | issue=1–2 | pages=76–81 | pmid=8255414 | url=http://p113367.typo3server.info/uploads/media/lit9304.pdf | doi=10.1159/000119004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of negative evaluation is the social stressor. Researchers can measure the stress response by comparing pre-stress salivary cortisol levels and post-stress salivary cortisol levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Other common stress measures used in the TSST are self-report measures like the [[State-Trait Anxiety Inventory]] and physiological measures like heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;Spielberger, C. D., Gorsuch, R. L., Lushene, R., Vagg, P. R., &amp; Jacobs, G. A. (1983). ''Manual for the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory''. Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a laboratory conflict discussion, couples identify several specific areas of conflict in their relationship.  The couples then pinpoint a couple topics to discuss later on in the experiment (ex. finances, child-rearing).  Couples are told to discuss the conflict(s) for 10 minutes while being videotaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ditzen | first1 = B. | last2 = Schaer | first2 = M. | last3 = Gabriel | first3 = B. | last4 = Bodenmann | first4 = G. | last5 = Ehlert | first5 = U. | last6 = Heinrichs | first6 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication and reduces cortisol levels during couple conflict | url = | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 9| pages = 728–731 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.10.011 | pmid=19027101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brouwer and Hogervorst (2014) designed the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST) to induce stress in the laboratory setting.  After viewing neutral images with subsequent 1-minute rest periods, the participant is instructed to sing a song after the next 1-minute rest period is complete.  Researchers found that skin conductance and heart rate are significantly higher during the post-song message interval than the previous 1-minute intervals.  The stress levels are comparable to that induced in the Trier Social Stress Task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A new paradigm to induce mental stress: the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST) |journal = Frontiers in Neuroscience|date = 2014-07-29|issn = 1662-4548|pmc = 4114180|pmid = 25120425|volume = 8|doi = 10.3389/fnins.2014.00224|first = Anne-Marie|last = Brouwer|first2 = Maarten A.|last2 = Hogervorst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical indicators of stress in large groups===

A statistical indicator of stress, simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]], was proposed for diagnosis of stress and successfully used in physiology and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T.

''"Introduction to econophysics: correlations and complexity in finance."' Cambridge university press; 1999 Nov 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Its applicability for early diagnosis of social stress in large groups was demonstrated by the analysis of crises. It was examined in the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rybnikov|first1=S.R.|last2=Rybnikova|first2=N.A.|last3=Portnov|first3=B.A.|title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=March 2017|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–123|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065_Public_fears_in_Ukrainian_society_Are_crises_predictable|doi=10.1177/0971333616689398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has consistently demonstrated that social stress increases risk for developing negative [[mental health]] outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, S., 2017. Social stress. New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; One [[prospective study]] asked over fifteen hundred Finnish employees whether they had "considerable difficulties with [their] coworkers/superiors/inferiors during the last 6 months, 5 years, earlier, or never".&lt;ref name=romanov&gt;{{cite journal | last=Romanov | first=K |author2=Appelberg, K |author3=Honkasalo, M L |author4= Koskenvuo, M  | title=Recent interpersonal conflict at work and psychiatric morbidity: a prospective study of 15,530 employees aged 24-64 | journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research | date=February 1996 | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=169–176 | pmid=8778399 | doi=10.1016/0022-3999(95)00577-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information on suicides, hospitalizations due to [[psychosis]], suicidal behavior, alcohol intoxication, depressive symptoms, and medication for chronic psychiatric disorders was then gathered from the national registries of mortality and morbidity. Those who had experienced conflict in the workplace with coworkers or supervisors in the last five years were more likely to be diagnosed with a psychiatric condition.&lt;ref name=romanov /&gt;

Research on the [[LGBT|LGB]] population has suggested that people who identify as LGB suffer more from mental health disorders, such as [[substance abuse]] and [[mood disorder]]s, compared to those who identify as heterosexual.&lt;ref name="Meyer 674–697"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prejudice, Social Stress, and Mental Health in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Populations: Conceptual Issues and Research Evidence|journal = Psychological Bulletin|date = 2003-09-01|issn = 0033-2909|pmc = 2072932|pmid = 12956539|pages = 674–697|volume = 129|issue = 5|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674|first = Ilan H.|last = Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers deduce that the LGB people's higher risk of mental health issues derives from their stressful social environments.  [[Minority group]]s can face high levels of stigma, prejudice, and discrimination on a regular basis, therefore leading to the development of various mental health disorders.&lt;ref name="Meyer 674–697"/&gt;

=== Anxiety ===
The biological basis for [[anxiety disorder]]s is rooted in the consistent activation of the stress response.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Fear, which is the defining emotion of an anxiety disorder, occurs when someone perceives a situation (a stressor) as threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shin | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Liberzon | first2 = I. | year = 2010 | title = The neurocircuitry of fear, stress, and anxiety disorders | url = | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 169–191 | doi=10.1038/npp.2009.83| pmc = 3055419 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This activates the stress response.  If a person has difficulty regulating this stress response, it may activate inappropriately. Stress can therefore arise when a real stressor is not present or when something isn't actually threatening.  This can lead to the development of an anxiety disorder ([[panic attack]]s, [[social anxiety]], [[OCD]], etc.).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neuroscience|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=75NgwLzueikC|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9780781760034|first = Mark F.|last = Bear|first2 = Barry W.|last2 = Connors|first3 = Michael A.|last3 = Paradiso}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anxiety disorder]] is defined as the fear of being judged or evaluated by others, even if no such threat is actually present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Anxiety Disorder {{!}} Anxiety and Depression Association of America, ADAA|url = http://www.adaa.org/social-anxiety-disorder|website = www.adaa.org|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-term effects ===
Social stress occurring early in life can have [[psychopathological]] effects that develop or persist in adulthood. One [[longitudinal study]] found that children were more likely to have a psychiatric disorder (e.g. anxiety, depressive, disruptive, personality, and substance use disorders) in late adolescence and early adulthood when their parents showed more maladaptive child-rearing behaviors (e.g., loud arguments between parents, verbal abuse, difficulty controlling anger toward the child, lack of parental support or availability, and harsh punishment). Child [[temperament]] and parental psychiatric disorders did not explain this association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Johnson | first=J G |author2=Cohen, P |author3=Kasen, S |author4=Smailes, E |author5= Brook, J S  | title=Association of maladaptive parental behavior with psychiatric disorder among parents and their offspring | journal=Archives of General Psychiatry | date=May 2001 | volume=58 | issue=5 | pages=453–460 | pmid=11343524 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.58.5.453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have documented the robust relationships between children’s social stress within the family environment and depression, [[aggression]], [[antisocial behavior]], [[anxiety]], [[suicide]], and hostile, oppositional, and delinquent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Repetti | first=Rena L |author2=Taylor, Shelley E |author3=Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Risky families: family social environments and the mental and physical health of offspring | journal=Psychological Bulletin | date=March 2002 | volume=128 | issue=2 | pages=330–366 | pmid=11931522 | url=http://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/2002_%20Risky%20Families_Family%20Social%20Environments%20and%20the%20Mental%20and%20Physical%20Health%20of%20Offspring.pdf | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relapse and recurrence ===
Social stress can also exacerbate current psychopathological conditions and compromise recovery. For instance, patients recovering from depression or [[bipolar disorder]] are two times more likely to relapse if there is familial tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miklowitz | first1 = D.

== Physical health ==

Research has also found a robust relationship between various social stressors and aspects of physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = G. | last2 = Chen | first2 = E. | last3 = Cole | first3 = S.

=== Mortality ===
Social status, a macro-social stressor, is a robust predictor of death. In a study of over 1700 British civil servants, [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) was inversely related to mortality. Those with the lowest SES have worse health outcomes and greater mortality rates than those with the greatest SES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marmot | first=M G |author2=Rose, G |author3=Shipley, M |author4= Hamilton, P J  | title=Employment grade and coronary heart disease in British civil servants | journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | date=December 1978 | volume=32 | issue=4 | pages=244–249 | pmid=744814 | pmc=1060958 | doi=10.1136/jech.32.4.244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have replicated this relationship between SES and mortality in a range of diseases, including infectious, digestive, and respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Adler | first=N E |author2=Boyce, T |author3=Chesney, M A |author4=Cohen, S |author5=Folkman, S |author6=Kahn, R L |author7= Syme, S L  | title=Socioeconomic status and health.

Similarly, social stressors in the micro-environment are also linked to increased mortality. A seminal longitudinal study of nearly 7,000 people found that socially isolated people had greater risk of dying from any cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Berkman | first=L F |author2=Syme, S L  | title=Social networks, host resistance, and mortality: a nine-year follow-up study of Alameda County residents | journal=American Journal of Epidemiology | date=February 1979 | volume=109 | issue=2 | pages=186–204 | pmid=425958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social support]], which is defined as "the comfort, assistance, and/or information one receives through formal or informal contacts with individuals or groups",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallston | first1 = B.

=== Morbidity ===
Social stress also makes people more sick. People who have fewer social contacts are at greater risk for developing illness, including cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Seeman | first=T E | title=Health promoting effects of friends and family on health outcomes in older adults | journal=American Journal of Health Promotion | date=August 2000 | volume=14 | issue=6 | pages=362–370 | pmid=11067571 | doi=10.4278/0890-1171-14.6.362}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower one’s social status, the more likely he or she is to have a [[cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular]], [[gastrointestinal disease|gastrointestinal]], [[Musculoskeletal diseases|musculoskeletal]], [[Neoplastic disease|neoplastic]], [[Pulmonary disease|pulmonary]], [[Renal disease|renal]], or other [[chronic disease]]s.

In one laboratory study, researchers interviewed participants to determine whether they had been experiencing social conflicts with spouses, close family members and friends. They then exposed the participants to the [[common cold virus]] and found that participants with conflict-ridden relationships were two times more likely to develop a cold than those without such social stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cohen | first=S |author2=Frank, E |author3=Doyle, W J |author4=Skoner, D P |author5=Rabin, B S |author6= Gwaltney, J M, Jr  | title=Types of stressors that increase susceptibility to the common cold in healthy adults | journal=Health Psychology | date=May 1998 | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=214–223 | pmid=9619470 | url=http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~scohen/types%20of%20stressors.pdf | doi=10.1037/0278-6133.17.3.214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social support, especially in terms of support for socioeconomic stressors, is inversely related to physical morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Stress: Theory and Research|journal = Annual Review of Sociology|date = 1992-01-01|pages = 15–38|volume = 18|first = Carol S.|last = Aneshensel|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.18.1.15|jstor=2083444}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study that investigated social determinants of health in an urban slum in India found that social exclusion, stress, and lack of social support are significantly related to illnesses, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pawar | first1 = A.

=== Long-term effects ===
Exposure to social stress in childhood can also have long-term effects, increasing risk for developing diseases later in life. In particular, adults who were maltreated (emotionally, physically, sexually abused or neglected) as children report more disease outcomes, such as [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[diabetes]], and [[hypertension]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rich-Edwards | first=Janet W | author2=Spiegelman, Donna; Lividoti Hibert, Eileen N; Jun, Hee-Jin; Todd, Tamarra James; Kawachi, Ichiro; Wright, Rosalind J | title=Abuse in childhood and adolescence as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in adult women | journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | date=December 2010 | volume=39 | issue=6 | pages=529–536 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2010.09.007 | pmid=21084073 | pmc=3003936}}&lt;/ref&gt; or greater severity of those outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wegman | first=Holly L |author2=Stetler, Cinnamon  | title=A meta-analytic review of the effects of childhood abuse on medical outcomes in adulthood | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=October 2009 | volume=71 | issue=8 | pages=805–812 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181bb2b46 | pmid=19779142 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/71/8/805.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adverse Childhood Experiences (study)|Adverse Childhood Experiences study]] (ACE), which includes over seventeen thousand adults, also found that there was a 20% increase in likelihood for experiencing [[heart disease]] for each kind of chronic familial social stressor experienced in childhood, and this was not due to typical risk factors for heart disease such as demographics, smoking, exercise, [[adiposity]], diabetes, or hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dong | first=Maxia |author2=Giles, Wayne H |author3=Felitti, Vincent J |author4=Dube, Shanta R |author5=Williams, Janice E |author6=Chapman, Daniel P |author7= Anda, Robert F  | title=Insights Into Causal Pathways for Ischemic Heart Disease: Adverse Childhood Experiences Study | journal=Circulation | date=28 September 2004 | volume=110 | issue=13 | pages=1761–1766 | doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000143074.54995.7F | pmid=15381652 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/110/13/1761.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiology ==

Social stress leads to a number of physiological changes that mediate its relationship to physical health.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the short term, the physiological changes outlined below are adaptive, as they enable the stressed organism to cope better. Dysregulation of these systems or repeated activation of them over the long-term can be detrimental to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McEwen | first=B S |author2=Stellar, E  | title=Stress and the individual: Mechanisms leading to disease | journal=Archives of Internal Medicine | date=27 September 1993 | volume=153 | issue=18 | pages=2093–2101 | pmid=8379800 | url=http://yalerei.org/intmed/resources/docs/McEwen.pdf | doi=10.1001/archinte.153.18.2093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sympathetic nervous system ===
The [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS) becomes activated in response to stress. Sympathetic arousal stimulates the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] of the [[adrenal glands|medulla]] to secrete [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] into the blood stream, which facilitates the [[fight-or-flight response]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Blood pressure, heart rate, and sweating increase, [[vasoconstriction|veins constrict]] to allow the heart to beat with more force, arteries leading to muscles dilate, and blood flow to parts of the body not essential for the fight or flight response decreases. If stress persists in the long run, then blood pressure remains elevated, leading to hypertension and [[atherosclerosis]], both precursors to [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Sapolsky, R. M. (1994). Why zebras don't get ulcers: A guide to stress, stress related diseases, and coping. New York: W.H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of animal and human studies have confirmed that social stress increases risk for negative health outcomes by increasing SNS activity. Studies of rodents show that social stress causes hypertension and atherosclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sgoifo | first=A | author2=Koolhaas, J; De Boer, S; Musso, E; Stilli, D; Buwalda, B; Meerlo, P | title=Social stress, autonomic neural activation, and cardiac activity in rats | journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | date=November 1999 | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=915–923 | pmid=10580306 | doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(99)00025-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of non-human primates also show that social stress clogs arteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Manuck | first=S B |author2=Marsland, A L |author3=Kaplan, J R |author4= Williams, J K  | title=The pathogenicity of behavior and its neuroendocrine mediation: an example from coronary artery disease | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=June 1995 | volume=57 | issue=3 | pages=275–283 | pmid=7652128 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/57/3/275.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress, visceral obesity, and coronary artery atherosclerosis: product of a primate adaptation|journal = American Journal of Primatology|date = 2009-09-01|issn = 1098-2345|pmc = 3970187|pmid = 19452515|pages = 742–751|volume = 71|issue = 9|doi = 10.1002/ajp.20706|first = Carol A.|last = Shively|first2 = Thomas C.|last2 = Register|first3 = Thomas B.|last3 = Clarkson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although humans cannot be randomized to receive social stress due to ethical concerns, studies have nevertheless shown that negative social interactions characterized by conflict lead to increases in blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gerin | first=W |author2=Pieper, C |author3=Levy, R |author4= Pickering, T G  | title=Social support in social interaction: a moderator of cardiovascular reactivity | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=June 1992 | volume=54 | issue=3 | pages=324–336 | pmid=1620808 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/54/3/324.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social stress stemming from perceived daily discrimination is also associated with elevated levels of blood pressure during the day and a lack of blood pressure dipping at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tomfohr | first=Lianne |author2=Cooper, Denise C |author3=Mills, Paul J |author4=Nelesen, Richard A |author5= Dimsdale, Joel E  | title=Everyday discrimination and nocturnal blood pressure dipping in black and white americans | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=April 2010 | volume=72 | issue=3 | pages=266–272 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181d0d8b2 | pmid=20124424 | pmc=2894630}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smart Richman | first=Laura |author2=Pek, Jolynn |author3=Pascoe, Elizabeth |author4= Bauer, Daniel J  | title=The effects of perceived discrimination on ambulatory blood pressure and affective responses to interpersonal stress modeled over 24 hours | journal=Health Psychology| date=July 2010 | volume=29 | issue=4 | pages=403–411 | doi=10.1037/a0019045 | pmid=20658828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical axis (HPA) ===
In response to stress, the [[hypothalamus]] releases [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH), stimulating the [[anterior pituitary]] to release [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the [[adrenal cortex]] to secrete [[glucocorticoids]], including [[cortisol]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Social stress can lead to adverse health outcomes by chronically activating the HPA axis or disrupting the HPA system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are a number of studies that link social stress and indications of a disrupted HPA axis; for instance, monkey infants neglected by their mothers show prolonged cortisol responses following a challenging event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dettling | first=A |author2=Pryce, C R |author3=Martin, R D |author4= Döbeli, M  | title=Physiological Responses to parental separation and a strange situation are related to parental care received in juvenile Goeldi's monkeys (''Callimico goeldii'') | journal=Developmental Psychobiology | date=July 1998 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=21–31 | pmid=9664169 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2302(199807)33:1&lt;21::aid-dev3&gt;3.0.co;2-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, cortisol tends to have a suppressive effect on inflammatory processes, and proinflammatory cytokines can also activate the HPA system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wilder | first=R L | title=Neuroendocrine-immune system interactions and autoimmunity | journal=Annual Review of Immunology | year=1995 | volume=13 | pages=307–338 | doi=10.1146/annurev.iy.13.040195.001515 | pmid=7612226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sympathetic activity can also [[upregulate]] inflammatory activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jan | first=Badar U |author2=Coyle, Susette M |author3=Macor, Marie A |author4=Reddell, Michael |author5=Calvano, Steve E |author6= Lowry, Stephen F  | title=Relationship of basal heart rate variability to in vivo cytokine responses after endotoxin exposure | journal=Shock | date=April 2010 | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=363–368 | doi=10.1097/SHK.0b013e3181b66bf4 | pmid=20407404 | pmc=2980578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marsland | first=Anna L |author2=Gianaros, Peter J |author3=Prather, Aric A |author4=Jennings, J Richard |author5=Neumann, Serina A |author6= Manuck, Stephen B  | title=Stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines covaries inversely with heart rate variability | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=November 2007 | volume=69 | issue=8 | pages=709–716 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181576118 | pmid=17942840}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the relationships among these physiological systems, social stress may also influence health indirectly via affecting a particular physiological system that in turn affects a different physiological system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4425">A '''spot test''' in lichenology is a [[spot analysis]] used to help identify [[lichen]]s.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL&gt;Field Guide to California Lichens, Stephen Sharnoff, Yale University Press, 2014, {{ISBN|978-0-300-19500-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|369}} It is performed by placing a drop of a chemical on different parts of the lichen and noting the color change (or lack thereof) associated with application of the chemical.  The tests are routinely encountered in [[dichotomous keys]] for lichen species, and they take advantage of the wide array of [[secondary metabolites]] produced by lichens and their uniqueness among [[taxa]].  As such, spot tests reveal the presence or absence of chemicals in various parts of a lichen.  They were first proposed by the [[William Nylander (botanist)]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nylander|first1=William|title=Hypochlorite of Lime and Hydrate of Potash, two new Criteria in the study of Lichens.|journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Botany|date=November 1866|volume=9|issue=38|pages=358–365|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1866.tb01301.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three most common spot tests are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCune|first1=Bruce|last2=Geiser|first2=Linda|title=Macrolichens of the Pacific Northwest|date=1997|publisher=Oregon State Univ. Press|location=Corvallis|isbn=0-87071-394-9|pages=347–349|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''K test:''' a 10% [[aqueous solution]] of [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH), or, in the absence of KOH, a 10% aqueous solution of [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH, lye), which provides nearly identical results;
*'''C test:''' A 5.25% solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]] or undiluted household bleach; and
*'''P test:''' an [[ethanolic]] solution of [[para-phenylenediamine]], made by placing a drop of ethanol (70-95%) over a few crystals of the chemical (yielding an unstable solution).

Although the above tests are most common, a '''KC test''' may be performed by wetting the thallus with K followed immediately by C.  In addition, [[Lugol’s iodine]] may be useful in identifying certain species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brodo|first1=Irwin M.|last2=Sharnoff|first2=Sylvia Duran|last3=Sharnoff|first3=Stephen|title=Lichens of North America|date=2001|publisher=Yale Univ. Press|location=New Haven, Conn. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0300082494|pages=103–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performing Spot Tests ==

Spot tests are performed by placing a small amount of the desired reagent on the portion of the lichen to be tested.  Often, both the cortex and medulla of the lichen are tested, and at times it is useful to test other structures such as soralia.  One method is to draw up a small amount of the chemical into a glass capillary and touch it to the lichen thallus.  A razor blade may be used to remove the cortex and access the medulla.
 
Spot tests may be used individually or in combination.  The results of a spot tests are typically represented with a short code that includes, in order, (1) a letter indicating the reagent used, (2) a "+" or "-" sign indicating a color change or lack of color change, respectively, and (3) a letter or word indicating the color observed.  In addition, care should be taken to indicate which part of the lichen was tested.  For example, "Cortex K+ orange, C-, P-" means the medulla of the test specimen turned orange with application of KOH and did not change under bleach or ''para''-phenylenediamine.  Similarly, "Medulla K-, KC+R" would indicate the medulla of the lichen was insensitive to application of KOH, but application of KOH followed immediately by bleach caused the medulla to turn red.

== Other Tests ==

It may sometimes be useful to perform other diagnostic measures in addition to spot tests.  For example, some lichen metabolites fluoresce under UV radiation such that exposing certain parts of the lichen to a UV light source can reveal the presence of absence of those metabolites similarly to spot tests.  More advanced analytical techniques, such as [[thin layer chromatography]], [[high performance liquid chromatography]], and [[mass spectrometry]] may also be useful in initially characterizing the chemical composition of lichens or when spot tests are unrevealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona State University Lichen Herbarium: Lichen TLC|url=http://nhc.asu.edu/lherbarium/lichen_info/tlc.php|website=nhc.asu.edu|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37332">{{distinguish|Statistical interference}}

'''Statistical inference''' is the process of using [[data analysis]] to deduce properties of an underlying [[probability distribution]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Upton, G., Cook, I. (2008) ''Oxford Dictionary of Statistics'', OUP. {{isbn|978-0-19-954145-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a [[Statistical population|population]], for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.  It is assumed that the observed data set is [[Sampling (statistics)|sampled]] from a larger population.

Inferential statistics can be contrasted with [[descriptive statistics]]. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.

== Introduction ==
Statistical inference makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]]. Given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of (first) [[Model selection|selecting]] a [[statistical model]] of the process that generates the data and (second) deducing propositions from the model.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Konishi &amp; Kitagawa state, "The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling".&lt;ref&gt;Konishi &amp; Kitagawa (2008), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatedly, [[David Cox (statistician)|Sir David Cox]] has said, "How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Cox (2006), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] of a statistical inference is a statistical [[proposition]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Some common forms of statistical proposition are the following:
* a [[point estimate]], i.e. a particular value that best approximates some parameter of interest; 
* an [[interval estimate]], e.g. a [[confidence interval]] (or set estimate), i.e. an interval constructed using a dataset drawn from a population so that, under repeated sampling of such datasets, such intervals would contain the true parameter value with the [[frequency probability|probability]] at the stated [[confidence level]];
* a [[credible intervals|credible interval]], i.e. a set of values containing, for example, 95% of posterior belief;
* rejection of a [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis]];{{efn|According to Peirce, acceptance means that inquiry on this question ceases for the time being. In science, all scientific theories are revisable.}}
* [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] or [[Statistical classification|classification]] of data points into groups.

==Models and assumptions==
{{Main|Statistical model|Statistical assumptions}}
Any statistical inference requires some assumptions. A '''statistical model''' is a set of assumptions concerning the generation of the observed data and similar data. Descriptions of statistical models usually emphasize the role of population quantities of interest, about which we wish to draw inference.&lt;ref name=Cox2006&gt;Cox (2006) page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive statistics are typically used as a preliminary step before more formal inferences are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Evans|first=Michael|title=Probability and Statistics: The Science of Uncertainty|year=2004|publisher=Freeman and Company|page=267|display-authors=etal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkWK8kFzXWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22descriptive%20statistics%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780716747420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degree of models/assumptions===
Statisticians distinguish between three levels of modeling assumptions;
* '''[[Parametric model|Fully parametric]]''': The probability distributions describing the data-generation process are assumed to be fully described by a family of probability distributions involving only a finite number of unknown parameters.&lt;ref name=Cox2006/&gt; For example, one may assume that the distribution of population values is truly Normal, with unknown mean and variance, and that datasets are generated by [[Simple random sample|'simple' random sampling]]. The family of [[Generalized linear model#Model components|generalized linear models]] is a widely used and flexible class of parametric models.
* '''[[Nonparametric statistics#Non-parametric models|Non-parametric]]''': The assumptions made about the process generating the data are much less than in parametric statistics and may be minimal.&lt;ref&gt;van der Vaart, A.W. (1998) ''Asymptotic Statistics''  Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|0-521-78450-6}} (page 341)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, every continuous probability distribution has a median, which may be estimated using the sample median or the [[Hodges–Lehmann estimator|Hodges–Lehmann–Sen estimator]], which has good properties when the data arise from simple random sampling.
* '''[[Semiparametric model|Semi-parametric]]''': This term typically implies assumptions 'in between' fully and non-parametric approaches. For example, one may assume that a population distribution has a finite mean. Furthermore, one may assume that the mean response level in the population depends in a truly linear manner on some covariate (a parametric assumption) but not make any parametric assumption describing the variance around that mean (i.e. about the presence or possible form of any [[heteroscedasticity]]). More generally, semi-parametric models can often be separated into 'structural' and 'random variation' components. One component is treated parametrically and the other non-parametrically. The well-known [[Cox model]] is a set of semi-parametric assumptions.

===Importance of valid models/assumptions===
Whatever level of assumption is made, correctly calibrated inference in general requires these assumptions to be correct; i.e. that the data-generating mechanisms really have been correctly specified.

Incorrect assumptions of [[Simple random sample|'simple' random sampling]] can invalidate statistical inference.&lt;ref&gt;Kruskal 1988&lt;/ref&gt; More complex semi- and fully parametric assumptions are also cause for concern. For example, incorrectly assuming the Cox model can in some cases lead to faulty conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;
[[David A. Freedman|Freedman, D.A.]] (2008) "Survival analysis: An Epidemiological hazard?". ''The American Statistician'' (2008) 62: 110-119. (Reprinted as Chapter 11 (pages 169–192) of Freedman (2010)).&lt;/ref&gt; Incorrect assumptions of Normality in the population also invalidates some forms of regression-based inference.&lt;ref&gt;Berk, R. (2003) ''Regression Analysis: A Constructive Critique (Advanced Quantitative Techniques in the Social Sciences) (v. 11)'' Sage Publications. {{isbn|0-7619-2904-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of '''any''' parametric model is viewed skeptically by most experts in sampling human populations:  "most sampling statisticians, when they deal with confidence intervals at all, limit themselves to statements about [estimators] based on very large samples, where the central limit theorem ensures that these [estimators] will have distributions that are nearly normal."&lt;ref name=Brewer&gt;{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Brewer| title=Combined Survey Sampling Inference: Weighing of Basu's Elephants| publisher=Hodder Arnold|page=6|year= 2002|isbn=978-0340692295}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a normal distribution "would be a totally unrealistic and catastrophically unwise assumption to make if we were dealing with any kind of economic population."&lt;ref name=Brewer/&gt; Here, the central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean "for very large samples" is approximately normally distributed, if the distribution is not heavy tailed.

====Approximate distributions====
{{Main|Statistical distance|Asymptotic theory (statistics)|Approximation theory}}

Given the difficulty in specifying exact distributions of sample statistics, many methods have been developed for approximating these.

With finite samples, [[approximation theory|approximation results]] measure how close a limiting distribution approaches the statistic's [[sample distribution]]: For example, with 10,000 independent samples the [[normal distribution]] approximates (to two digits of accuracy) the distribution of the [[sample mean]] for many population distributions, by the [[Berry–Esseen theorem]].&lt;ref name=JHJ&gt;
Jörgen Hoffman-Jörgensen's ''Probability With a View Towards Statistics'', Volume I. Page 399 {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet for many practical purposes, the normal approximation provides a good approximation to the sample-mean's distribution when there are 10 (or more) independent samples, according to simulation studies and statisticians' experience.&lt;ref name=JHJ/&gt; Following Kolmogorov's work in the 1950s, advanced statistics uses [[approximation theory]] and [[functional analysis]] to quantify the error of approximation. In this approach, the [[metric geometry]] of [[probability distribution]]s is studied; this approach quantifies approximation error with, for example, the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]], [[Bregman divergence]], and the [[Hellinger distance]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Cam (1986) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Torgerson (1991) ''Comparison of Statistical Experiments'', volume 36 of Encyclopedia of Mathematics. Cambridge University Press. {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

With indefinitely large samples, [[asymptotic theory (statistics)|limiting results]] like the [[central limit theorem]] describe the sample statistic's limiting distribution, if one exists. Limiting results are not statements about finite samples, and indeed are irrelevant to finite samples.&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov (1963, p.369): "The frequency concept, &lt;!-- comma missing in original --&gt; based on the notion of limiting frequency as the number of trials increases to infinity, does not contribute anything to substantiate the applicability of the results of probability theory to real practical problems where we have always to deal with a finite number of trials".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Indeed, limit theorems 'as&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity' are logically devoid of content about what happens at any particular&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. All they can do is suggest certain approaches whose performance must then be checked on the case at hand." &amp;mdash; Le Cam (1986) (page xiv)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pfanzagl (1994): "The crucial drawback of asymptotic theory: What we expect from asymptotic theory are results which hold approximately . . . . What asymptotic theory has to offer are limit theorems."(page ix) "What counts for applications are approximations, not limits." (page 188)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the asymptotic theory of limiting distributions is often invoked for work with finite samples. For example, limiting results are often invoked to justify the [[generalized method of moments]] and the use of [[generalized estimating equation]]s, which are popular in [[econometrics]] and [[biostatistics]]. The magnitude of the difference between the limiting distribution and the true distribution (formally, the 'error' of the approximation) can be assessed using simulation&lt;!-- and approximation results --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanzagl (1994) : "By taking a limit theorem as being approximately true for large sample sizes, we commit an error the size of which is unknown. [. . .] Realistic information about the remaining errors may be obtained by simulations." (page ix)
&lt;/ref&gt; The heuristic application of limiting results to finite samples is common practice in many applications, especially with low-dimensional [[statistical model|models]] with [[logarithmically concave function|log-concave]] [[likelihood function|likelihood]]s (such as with one-parameter [[exponential families]]).

===Randomization-based models===
{{Main|Randomization}}
{{See also|Random sample|Random assignment}}

For a given dataset that was produced by a randomization design, the randomization distribution of a statistic (under the null-hypothesis) is defined by evaluating the test statistic for all of the plans that could have been generated by the randomization design. In frequentist inference, randomization allows inferences to be based on the randomization distribution rather than a subjective model, and this is important especially in survey sampling and design of experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman, J.]](1934) "On the two different aspects of the representative method: The method of stratified sampling and the method of purposive selection", ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'', 97 (4), 557&amp;ndash;625 {{jstor|2342192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinkelmann and Kempthorne"&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne(2008) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical inference from randomized studies is also more straightforward than many other situations.&lt;ref&gt;ASA Guidelines for a first course in statistics for non-statisticians. (available at the ASA website)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David A. Freedman]] et alia's ''Statistics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore et al. (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bayesian inference]], randomization is also of importance: in [[survey sampling]], use of [[sampling without replacement]] ensures the [[exchangeability]] of the sample with the population; in randomized experiments, randomization warrants a [[missing at random]] assumption for [[covariate]] information.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Gelman|Gelman A.]] et al. (2013). ''Bayesian Data Analysis'' ([[Chapman &amp; Hall]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Objective randomization allows properly inductive procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1877-1878)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1883)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[[David A. Freedman|David Freedman]] et alia ''Statistics'' and [[David A. Freedman]] ''Statistical Models''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[[C. R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many statisticians prefer randomization-based analysis of data that was generated by well-defined randomization procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce; Freedman; Moore et al. (2015).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, it is true that in fields of science with developed theoretical knowledge and experimental control, randomized experiments may increase the costs of experimentation without improving the quality of inferences.&lt;ref&gt;Box, G.E.P. and Friends (2006) ''Improving Almost Anything: Ideas and Essays, Revised Edition'', Wiley. {{isbn|978-0-471-72755-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Cox (2006), page 196&lt;/ref&gt;)
Similarly, results from [[randomized experiment]]s are recommended by leading statistical authorities as allowing inferences with greater reliability than do observational studies of the same phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;ASA Guidelines for a first course in statistics for non-statisticians. (available at the ASA website)
* David A. Freedman et alia's ''Statistics''.
* Moore et al. (2015).
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a good observational study may be better than a bad randomized experiment.

The statistical analysis of a randomized experiment may be based on the randomization scheme stated in the experimental protocol and does not need a subjective model.&lt;ref&gt;Neyman, Jerzy. 1923 [1990]. "On the Application of Probability Theory to AgriculturalExperiments. Essay on Principles. Section 9." ''Statistical Science'' 5 (4): 465–472. Trans. [[Dorota Dabrowska|Dorota M. Dabrowska]] and Terence P. Speed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann &amp; Kempthorne (2008) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at any time, some hypotheses cannot be tested using objective statistical models, which accurately describe randomized experiments or random samples. In some cases, such randomized studies are uneconomical or unethical.

====Model-based analysis of randomized experiments====
It is standard practice to refer to a statistical model, often a linear model, when analyzing data from randomized experiments. However, the randomization scheme guides the choice of a statistical model. It is not possible to choose an appropriate model without knowing the randomization scheme.&lt;ref name="Hinkelmann and Kempthorne"/&gt; Seriously misleading results can be obtained analyzing data from randomized experiments while ignoring the experimental protocol; common mistakes include forgetting the blocking used in an experiment and confusing repeated measurements on the same experimental unit with independent replicates of the treatment applied to different experimental units.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008) Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradigms for inference==

Different schools of statistical inference have become established. These schools&amp;mdash;or "paradigms"&amp;mdash;are not mutually exclusive, and methods that work well under one paradigm often have attractive interpretations under other paradigms.

Bandyopadhyay &amp; Forster&lt;ref&gt;Bandyopadhyay &amp; Forster (2011). The quote is taken from the book's Introduction (p.3).  See also "Section&amp;nbsp;III: Four Paradigms of Statistics".&lt;/ref&gt;  describe four paradigms: "(i) classical statistics or error statistics, (ii) Bayesian statistics, (iii) likelihood-based statistics, and (iv) the Akaikean-Information Criterion-based statistics".  The classical (or [[Frequentist inference|frequentist]]) paradigm, the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] paradigm, and the [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]]-based paradigm are summarized below.  The likelihood-based paradigm is essentially a sub-paradigm of the AIC-based paradigm.

===Frequentist inference===
{{See also|Frequentist inference}}

This paradigm calibrates the plausibility of propositions by considering (notional) repeated sampling of a population distribution to produce datasets similar to the one at hand. By considering the dataset's characteristics under repeated sampling, the frequentist properties of a statistical proposition can be quantified—although in practice this quantification may be challenging.

====Examples of frequentist inference====

* [[p-value|''p''-value]]
* [[Confidence interval]]

====Frequentist inference, objectivity, and decision theory====

One interpretation of [[frequentist inference]] (or classical inference) is that it is applicable only in terms of [[frequency probability]]; that is, in terms of repeated sampling from a population. However, the approach of Neyman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neyman | first1 = J. | authorlink = Jerzy Neyman | year = 1937 | title = Outline of a Theory of Statistical Estimation Based on the Classical Theory of Probability | jstor = 91337 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A | volume = 236 | issue = 767| pages = 333–380 | doi=10.1098/rsta.1937.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; develops these procedures in terms of pre-experiment probabilities. That is, before undertaking an experiment, one decides on a rule for coming to a conclusion such that the probability of being correct is controlled in a suitable way: such a probability need not have a frequentist or repeated sampling interpretation. In contrast, Bayesian inference works in terms of conditional probabilities (i.e. probabilities conditional on the observed data), compared to the marginal (but conditioned on unknown parameters) probabilities used in the frequentist approach.

The frequentist procedures of significance testing and confidence intervals can be constructed without regard to [[utility function]]s. However, some elements of frequentist statistics, such as [[statistical decision theory]], do incorporate [[utility function]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In particular, frequentist developments of optimal inference (such as [[minimum-variance unbiased estimator]]s, or [[uniformly most powerful test]]ing) make use of [[loss function]]s, which play the role of (negative) utility functions. Loss functions need not be explicitly stated for statistical theorists to prove that a statistical procedure has an optimality property.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to Pfanzagl.&lt;/ref&gt; However, loss-functions are often useful for stating optimality properties: for example, median-unbiased estimators are optimal under [[absolute value]] loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss, and [[least squares]] estimators are optimal under squared error loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss.

While statisticians using frequentist inference must choose for themselves the parameters of interest, and the [[estimators]]/[[Test statistic#Common test statistics|test statistic]] to be used, the absence of obviously explicit utilities and prior distributions has helped frequentist procedures to become widely viewed as 'objective'.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Bayesian inference===
{{See also|Bayesian Inference}}

The Bayesian calculus describes degrees of belief using the 'language' of probability; beliefs are positive, integrate to one, and obey probability axioms. Bayesian inference uses the available posterior beliefs as the basis for making statistical propositions. There are [[Bayesian probability#Justification of Bayesian probabilities|several different justifications]] for using the Bayesian approach.

====Examples of Bayesian inference====

* [[Credible interval]] for [[interval estimation]]
* [[Bayes factor]]s for model comparison

====Bayesian inference, subjectivity and decision theory====

Many informal Bayesian inferences are based on "intuitively reasonable" summaries of the posterior. For example, the posterior mean, median and mode, highest posterior density intervals, and Bayes Factors can all be motivated in this way. While a user's [[utility function]] need not be stated for this sort of inference, these summaries do all depend (to some extent) on stated prior beliefs, and are generally viewed as subjective conclusions. (Methods of prior construction which do not require external input have been [[Bayesian probability#Personal probabilities and objective methods for constructing priors|proposed]] but not yet fully developed.)

Formally, Bayesian inference is calibrated with reference to an explicitly stated utility, or loss function; the 'Bayes rule' is the one which maximizes expected utility, averaged over the posterior uncertainty. Formal Bayesian inference therefore automatically provides [[optimal decision]]s in a [[decision theory|decision theoretic]] sense. Given assumptions, data and utility, Bayesian inference can be made for essentially any problem, although not every statistical inference need have a Bayesian interpretation. Analyses which are not formally Bayesian can be (logically) [[Coherence (statistics)|incoherent]]; a feature of Bayesian procedures which use proper priors (i.e. those integrable to one) is that they are guaranteed to be [[Coherence (statistics)|coherent]]. Some advocates of [[Bayesian inference]] assert that inference ''must'' take place in this decision-theoretic framework, and that [[Bayesian inference]] should not conclude with the evaluation and summarization of posterior beliefs.

===AIC-based inference===
{{Main|Akaike information criterion}}
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
The ''[[Akaike information criterion]]'' (AIC) is an [[estimator]] of the relative quality of [[statistical model]]s for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for [[model selection]].

AIC is founded on [[information theory]]: it offers an estimate of the relative information lost when a given model is used to represent the process that generated the data. (In doing so, it deals with the trade-off between the [[goodness of fit]] of the model and the simplicity of the model.)

===Other paradigms for inference===

====Minimum description length====
{{Main|Minimum description length}}

The minimum description length (MDL) principle has been developed from ideas in [[information theory]]&lt;ref name="Soofi 2000 1349–1353"&gt;Soofi (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory of [[Kolmogorov complexity]].&lt;ref name=HY&gt;Hansen &amp; Yu (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  The (MDL) principle selects statistical models that maximally compress the data; inference proceeds without assuming counterfactual or non-falsifiable "data-generating mechanisms" or [[probability models]] for the data, as might be done in frequentist or Bayesian approaches.

However, if a "data generating mechanism" does exist in reality, then according to [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]'s [[source coding theorem]] it provides the MDL description of the data, on average and asymptotically.&lt;ref name=HY747&gt;Hansen and Yu (2001), page 747.&lt;/ref&gt; In minimizing description length (or descriptive complexity), MDL estimation is similar to [[maximum likelihood estimation]] and [[maximum a posteriori estimation]] (using [[Maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum-entropy]] [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian priors]]). However, MDL avoids assuming that the underlying probability model is known; the MDL principle can also be applied without assumptions that e.g. the data arose from independent sampling.&lt;ref name=HY747/&gt;&lt;ref name=JR&gt;Rissanen (1989), page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDL principle has been applied in communication-[[coding theory]] in [[information theory]], in [[linear regression]],&lt;ref name=JR/&gt; and in [[data mining]].&lt;ref name=HY/&gt;

The evaluation of MDL-based inferential procedures often uses techniques or criteria from [[computational complexity theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. Traub, G. W. Wasilkowski, and H. Wozniakowski. (1988) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fiducial inference====
{{Main|Fiducial inference}}
[[Fiducial inference]] was an approach to statistical inference based on [[fiducial probability]], also known as a "fiducial distribution". In subsequent work, this approach has been called ill-defined, extremely limited in applicability,  and even fallacious.&lt;ref&gt;Neyman (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zabell (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; However this argument is the same as that which shows&lt;ref&gt;Cox (2006) page 66&lt;/ref&gt;  that a so-called [[confidence distribution]] is not a valid [[probability distribution]] and, since this has not invalidated the application of [[confidence interval]]s, it does not necessarily invalidate conclusions drawn from fiducial arguments. An attempt was made to reinterpret the early work of Fisher's [[Fiducial probability|fiducial argument]] as a special case of an inference theory using [[Upper and lower probabilities]].{{sfn|Hampel|2003}}

====Structural inference====

Developing ideas of Fisher and of Pitman from 1938 to 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Davison, page 12. {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George A. Barnard]] developed "structural inference" or "pivotal inference",&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, G.A. (1995) "Pivotal Models and the Fiducial Argument", International Statistical Review, 63 (3), 309–323. {{jstor|1403482}}&lt;/ref&gt; an approach using [[Haar measure|invariant probabilities]] on [[group family|group families]]. Barnard reformulated the arguments behind fiducial inference on a restricted class of models on which "fiducial" procedures would be well-defined and useful.
