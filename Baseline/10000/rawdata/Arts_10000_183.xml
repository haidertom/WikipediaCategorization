'''Afghan art''' has spanned many centuries. One of the most significant periods is the [[Gandhara Art|Gandharan art]] made between the 1st and 7th centuries developing out of [[Greco-Buddhist art]].  With the arrival of Islam, modern [[Afghanistan]] was for long periods part of [[Persia]]n states, and its art was often an important part of [[Persian art]] and [[Islamic art]] in general. 

Since the 1900s, the nation began to use Western techniques in art. Afghanistan's art in many media was originally almost entirely done by men, although women were greatly involved in other media, but recently women are entering the arts programs at [[Kabul University]]. Art is largely centered at the [[National Museum of Afghanistan]], the [[National Gallery of Afghanistan]] and the [[National Archives of Afghanistan]] in [[Kabul]]. There are a number of art schools in the country. The Center for Contemporary Arts Afghanistan (CCAA) in Kabul provides young people an opportunity to learn contemporary painting.

==Metalwork==
A collection of over 20,600 gold ornaments, some of them dating back to the Bronze Age, was discovered in Afghanistan in the late 1970s.  Known as the [[Bactrian Hoard]], these coins, necklaces and other pieces of jewelry were found in burial mounts in [[Sheberghan]] in Jowzjan Province.  They have been displayed in museums in the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/afghanistan-treasures/index.html "Afghanistan: Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208155022/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/afghanistan-treasures/index.html |date=February 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Greco-Buddhist Art==
{{Main|Greco-Buddhist art}}
Greco-Buddhist art was prevalent in Afghanistan from the 4th Century BCE to around the 7th Century CE due to the Islamic Conquest. Many of these art forms have been found in the archaeological site of Hadda, Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/afghanistan/Data/Mapsystem/Archeological_Sites/html/img/19.jpg See image]&lt;/ref&gt; The 6th-century [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] are a well-known example of Gandhara art from this period. They were [[Destruction_of_Art_in_Afghanistan#The_Giant_Buddhas_of_Bamiyan|destroyed]] by the Taliban in 2001.  [[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|Taller Buddha in 1963 and in 2008 after destruction]]

==Islamic Art==
After the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan, Afghan art changed dramatically from previous Greco-Buddhist works, due to the adoption of Islam. Afghan local materials such as lapis lazuli were adapted for use in [[Islamic Art]]. Mosques built in Afghanistan and in the Arab world are built with elaborate tiling styles. Many of these styles were influenced from Chinese ceramics &lt;ref&gt;Canby, 120-123, and see index; Jones &amp; Mitchell, 206-211&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan served as a conduit for introduction to these Chinese ceramic styles and techniques due to its strategic location on the Silk Road.

==Performance Art==
[[Buz-baz]] is a form of musical [[puppetry]] found in Afghanistan.  The puppeteer manipulates a [[markhor]] [[marionette]] while simultaneously playing a [[dambura]].

==Fine Art==
Afghanistan fine art was protected during the Taliban times by art masters at the Senai Art School.  The professors often hid "un-Islamic" paintings from the Taliban when they would visit and inspect. Other artists used water color over oil paintings to conceal faces and images not approved by the Taliban. Since 2002, the Afghan fine art master painters have been able to conduct many more exhibitions within Central Asia and Europe. Their oil and water color paintings are often found in the realism style, as that is what most Afghans prefer. One of the most infamous artists of that time was Sackin Nuqud. &lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.about-afghanistan.com/afghanistan-art-history.html Afghanistan Art History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105033420/http://www.about-afghanistan.com/afghanistan-art-history.html |date=January 5, 2012 }},&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Art==
Since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, contemporary art has seen a resurgence in Afghanistan.  Beginning in 2009, international funding for the arts has flowed into Afghanistan from the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name=Qantara&gt;{{cite web|first=Martin|last=Gerner|date=28 June 2012|title=Solutions Don't Always Come from Elsewhere|url=http://en.qantara.de/Solutions-Dont-Always-Come-from-Elsewhere/19387c20542i1p501/index.html|publisher=Qantara.de|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Kabul]]-based artist [[Aman Mojadidi]] curated a 2012 [[Documenta]] exhibit in Kabul which showcased 12 contemporary Afghan artists whose work includes digital photography, textiles, abstract painting, filmmaking and mixed media.&lt;ref name=Qantara /&gt;

'''Anamorphosis''' is a distorted projection or perspective requiring the viewer to use special devices or occupy a specific vantage point (or both) to view a recognizable image. Some of the media it is used in are painting, photography, sculpture and installation, toys, and film special effects.  The word "anamorphosis" is derived from the Greek prefix ''ana&amp;#8209;'', meaning "back" or "again", and the word ''morphe'', meaning "shape" or "form". An optical anamorphism is the visualization of a mathematical operation called an [[affine transformation]].&lt;ref name="Sánchez-Reyes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sánchez-Reyes|first1=Javier|last2=Chacón|first2=Jesús M.|title=Anamorphic Free-Form Deformation|journal=Computer Aided Geometric Design|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167839616300826 |accessdate=February 23, 2017 |pages=30–42|doi=10.1016/j.cagd.2016.06.002|date=August 1, 2016|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of extreme anamorphosis has been used by artists to disguise [[caricature]]s, [[erotic]] and [[scatological]] scenes, and other furtive images from a casual viewer, while revealing an undistorted image to the knowledgeable spectator.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Daniel L. |title=Anamorphosis and the Eccentric Observer: History, Technique and Current Practice |journal=Leonardo |date=1992 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=179 |doi=10.2307/1575710|jstor=1575710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of projection==
[[File:Anamorphosis chair.jpg|thumb|300px|Example of mirror anamorphosis]]

There are two main types of anamorphosis: ''perspective'' (oblique) and ''mirror'' (catoptric). More-complex anamorphoses can be devised using distorted lenses, mirrors, or other optical transformations.

Examples of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspectival]] anamorphosis date to the early [[Renaissance]] (fifteenth century).&lt;ref name="Baltrušaitis 1977" /&gt; Examples of mirror anamorphosis were first seen in the late Renaissance (sixteenth century).

With mirror anamorphosis, a conical or cylindrical [[mirror]] is placed on the drawing or painting to transform a flat distorted image into an apparently undistorted picture that can be viewed from many angles. The deformed image is painted on a plane surface surrounding the mirror. By looking into the mirror, a viewer can see the image undeformed.

With ''Channel anamorphosis'' or ''[[turning picture]]s'' two different images are on different sides of a corrugated carrier. A straight frontal view shows an unclear mix of the images, while each image can be viewed correctly from a certain angle.

==History==
===Early Use of Distorted Perspective===
The prehistoric cave paintings at [[Lascaux]] may make use of anamorphic technique, because the oblique angles of the cave would otherwise result in distorted figures from a viewer's perspective.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The ancient historians [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Tzetzes]] both record a sculpture competition between [[Alcamenes]] and [[Phidias]] to create an image of [[Minerva]]. Alcamenes' sculpture was beautiful, while Phidias' had grotesque proportions. Yet once both had been mounted on pillars, the decelerated perspective made Phidias' Minerva beautiful and Alcamenes' ugly.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=7-8}}

===Renaissance===
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Holbein's ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' with a ''[[memento mori]]'' anamorph skull in the foreground, 1533 ]]

[[File:Holbein Skull.jpg|thumb|Viewed from the correct oblique angle, the diagonal in ''The Ambassadors'' transforms into an undistorted ''memento mori''.]]

During the Renaissance, artists' experimentation with optics and perspective lead to more advanced development of anamorphic imagery. At this time, religious thought and science were equally important to the technique's growth in Europe. {{r|Baltrušaitis 1977| p=70}} The earliest known example, known as ''Leonardo's Eye'', was executed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and is included in the ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' (1483-1518). He later completed several large-scale anamorphic commissions for the King of France. [[Vignolo]] credited [[Tommasso Lauretti]] as the originator of a perspectival anamorphic technique in one of the earliest written descriptions in ''Two Rules'', compiled between 1530 and 1540 but not published until 1583. Without access to Vignolo's work, many other descriptions and examples were created before 1583.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977| p=29-30,32-33}}

''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' (c. 1533) by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] is well known for the prominent oblique anamorphic transformation in the painting. In this artwork, a distorted shape lies diagonally across the bottom of the frame. Viewing this from an acute angle transforms it into the plastic image of a [[human skull]]. The painting is regarded as a ''[[vanitas]]'' - a meditation on the transience of life - with the skull a symbolic ''[[memento mori]]''. The altered perspective required to see the image reflects the contemporary practice of painting skulls on the reverse of otherwise tranquil paintings.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|chapter=7 Holbein's 'The Ambassadors'}} Four centuries later, the painting inspired the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jaques Lacan]] to note in ‘Of the Gaze as ''Objet Petit a''’ (1973) that the use of anamorphism, particularly in this painting, is one of the few methods for making viewers aware of their gaze.&lt;ref name="Scott DS Project"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Maria |title=Deciphering the Gaze in Lacan's 'Of the Gaze as Objet Petit {{!}} The DS Project |url=http://thedsproject.com/portfolio/deciphering-the-gaze-in-lacans-of-the-gaze-as-objet-petit-a/ |website=The DS Project |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 17th century, a revival of fantastical anamorphic imagery occurred.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=26-28}} Mirror anamorphosis emerged at this time in Italy and China. It remains uncertain whether Jesuit missionaries imported or exported the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication |jstor= 3049875|title= Review: Anamorphic Act by Jurgis Baltrušaitis |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major works on perspective were published: ''Perspective''(1612) by [[Salomon de Caus]], and ''Curious Perspective'' (1638) by [[Jean-Francois Niceron]]. Each contained extensive  scientific and practical infromation on anamorphic imagery. In Niceron's work, three types of large-scale anamorphism are explained: 'optical' (looking horizontally); 'anoptric' (looking upwards); and 'catoptric' (looking down ie. from a mezzanine). A conical perspective is also described.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=26-28}}

[[File:Sant'Ignazio - affresco soffitto -antmoose.jpg |thumb|[[Andrea Pozzo]]'s painted ceiling in the [[Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome|Church of St. Ignazio]], 1690]]
[[Baroque]] ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' murals often used anamorphism to combine actual architectural elements with illusory painted elements to create a seamless effect when viewed  from a specific location. The dome and vault of the [[Sant'Ignazio|Church of St. Ignazio]] in Rome, painted by [[Andrea Pozzo]], represented the pinnacle of illusion. Due to neighboring monks complaining about blocked light, Pozzo was commissioned to paint the ceiling to look like the inside of a dome, instead of building a real dome. As the ceiling is flat, there is only one spot where the illusion is perfect and a dome looks undistorted.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Anamorphosis could be used to conceal images for privacy or personal safety, and many secret portraits were created of deposed royalty. A well-known anamorphic portrait of the English [[King Edward VI]] was completed a year before his execution in 1546, only visible when viewed through a hole in the frame. It was later hung at [[Whitehall Palace]], and may have influenced [[Shakespeare]] during the writing of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=16-18}} Many anamorphic portraits of [[King Charles I]] were created and shared following his 1649 execution.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=28}}  A secret mirror anamorphosis portrait of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]] can only be recognized when a polished cylinder is placed in the correct position. To possess such an image would have been seen as [[treason]] in the aftermath of the 1746 [[Battle of Culloden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westhighlandmuseum.org.uk/collections/the-jacobites/secret-portrait/ |title=Now you see me  |publisher=[[West Highland Museum]] |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth Century===
[[File:Thomas-Mole-Living Emblem-1919-USMC.jpg|thumb|Thomas and Mole, ''Living Emblem'' (1919). USMC]]
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, anamorphic images had come to be used more as [[children's games]] than fine art.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; By the twentieth century, some artists wanted to renew the technique of anamorphosis for aesthetic and conceptual effect. During the First World War [[Arthur Mole]], an American commercial photographer, used anamorphic techniques to create patriotic images from massive assembled groups of soldiers and reservists. When seen from high above, the gathered people resolved into recognizable pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Radio |first1=Minnesota Public |title=MPR: Group setting |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/01/28_robertsc_grouppix/ |accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=news.minnesota.publicradio.org |date=28 January 2005 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcel Duchamp]] was interested in anamorphosis. His last work ''[[Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas]]'' (1946-66) used mild anamorphosis to force viewers into the position of peep-hole voyeurs in order to see a nude, anonymous human body.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

[[Surrealist]] artist [[Salvador Dalí]] used extreme [[foreshortening]] and anamorphism in his paintings and works, and had a [[glass floor]] installed in a room next to his studio to enable radical perspective studies from above and below.&lt;ref name=GlassFloor&gt;{{cite book|last=Ades|first=ed. by Dawn|title=Dalí's optical illusions : [Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, January 21 - March 26, 2000 : Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, April 19 - June 18, 2000 ; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, July 25 - October 1, 2000]|year=2000|publisher=Yale Univ.

==Impossible objects==
[[File:Necker cube.svg|thumb|Necker cube]]
In the twentieth century, artists began to play with perspective by drawing "impossible objects". These objects included stairs that always ascend, or cubes where the back meets the front. Such works were popularized by the artist [[M. C. Escher]] and the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]]. Although referred to as "impossible objects", such objects as the [[Necker Cube]] and the [[Penrose triangle]] can be sculpted in 3-D by using anamorphic illusion. When viewed at a certain angle, such sculptures appear as the so-called impossible objects.

==Ames Rooms==
[[File:Ames room forced perspective.jpg|thumb|Ames room forced perspective]]
[[File:Ames room.JPG|thumb|Ames room]]
The [[Ames room]] was invented by American scientist [[Adelbert Ames]], Jr. in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.psychologie.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/html/ames_room.html |title=Ames Room |first= |last= |work=psychologie.tu-dresden.de |year=2001  |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When viewed through a peephole, the room appears to have normal perspective. However, all other viewpoints reveal that the room is constructed of irregular trapezoids. Similar effects had been achieved during the Renaissance through the use of "accelerated perspective" in stage design. These included productions by Scamozzi (1588-9), Furtenbach (1625), Sabbattini (1637) and Troili (1672).&lt;ref name="Baltrušaitis 1977"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baltrušaitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |isbn=9780810906624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most interesting effects of an Ames room is that the distorted perspective can make people and objects looks much bigger or smaller than they really are.&lt;ref name="EB Anamorphosis"&gt;{{cite web |title=Anamorphosis art |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/anamorphosis-art |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=18 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Ames rooms are widely used in cinema for [[practical special effects]]. A well-known example is the homes in the Shire from the [[Lord of The Rings (film franchise)|Lord of the Rings]] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]] films. Through the use of [[forced perspective]], the character of Gandalf appeared much larger than the characters of Frodo and Bilbo, without the use of digital effects.&lt;ref name="Cosmos"&gt;{{cite web |last1=England |first1=Jason |title=Hobbit houses and the Moon trick the brain and eye {{!}} Cosmos |url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/hobbit-houses-and-moon-trick-brain-and-eye |website=cosmosmagazine.com |accessdate=20 November 2018 |language=en |date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical uses==
[[Cinemascope]], [[Panavision]], [[Technirama]], and other [[widescreen]] formats use anamorphosis to project a wider image from a narrower film frame. The [[IMAX]] company uses even more extreme anamorphic transformations to project moving images from a flat film frame onto the inside of a [[sphere|hemispheric]] dome, in its "Omnimax" or "IMAX Dome" process.
 
The technique of anamorphic projection can be seen quite commonly on text written at a very flat angle on roadways, such as "Bus Lane" or "Children Crossing", to make it easily read by drivers who otherwise would have difficulty reading obliquely as the vehicle approaches the text; when the vehicle is nearly above the text, its true abnormally elongated shape can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 3B.20 Pavement Word, Symbol, and Arrow Markings|url=https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part3/part3b.htm#section3B20|work=[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]|publisher=United States [[Federal Highway Administration]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in many sporting stadiums, especially in [[Rugby football]] in [[Australia]], it is used to promote company brands which are painted onto the playing surface; from the television camera angle, the writing appear as signs standing vertically within the field of play.

Much writing on shop windows is in principle anamorphic, as it was written mirror-reversed on the inside of the window glass.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==In the work of contemporary artists==
[[File:Manfred Stader Stocznia Szczecinska 1 (Piotr Kuczynski).jpg|thumb|Anamorphic street art by [[Manfred Stader]]]]
While not a widespread in contemporary art, anamorphosis as a technique has been used by contemporary artists in painting, photography,  [[printmaking]], sculpture, film and video, digital art and games, [[holography]],&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; [[street art]] and [[Installation art|installation]]. The latter two art forms are largely practised in public areas such as parks, city centres and transit stations&lt;ref name="WebUrbanist"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=SA |title=Perspective Puzzle: Anamorphic Art in the Toronto Subway |url=https://weburbanist.com/2010/05/08/perspective-puzzle-anamorphic-art-in-the-toronto-subway/ |website=WebUrbanist |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1975 a major exhibition was held focusing exclusively on anamorphic imagery - ''Anamorphoses: Games of Perception and Illusion in Art''. The artist [[Jan Beutener]] created ''The Room'' - a major new installation - specifically for the exhibit.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

The ''Presence of Absence'' is an ongoing exhibition focusing on anamorphic art. It features work by [[Patrick Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

===Sculpture and Installation===
[[File:West Bromwich Bus Station - sign and mosaic's (5580214957).jpg|thumb|Anamorphic mosaic art in a [[West Bromwich]] bus station.]]

Since the mid-20th century, many artists have made use of anamorphosis in public artworks. American [[Land art]] pioneer [[Michael Heizer|Michael Heizer's]] ''Complex One'' (1972-1974), a massive earth and concrete structure in the [[Nevada]] desert, creates a rectangular frame for a [[mastaba]] when viewed from a specific location.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; Inspired by [[Luxor]] and other ancient monumental sites, it is part of the larger work ''City'', an enormous sculpture running a mile and a half long. The entire work will not be completed until 2020.&lt;ref name="New Yorker 2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goodyear |first1=Dana |title=A Monument to Outlast Humanity |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/michael-heizers-city |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=20 November 2018 |date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Marcus Raetz]] created anamorphic sculptures ranging in size from large-scale public installation to something that could fit in your hand. One of his largest pieces, ''Kopf'', revealed the form of a person's head in profile when viewed from a specific vantage-point. It was installed in a public park in [[Basel, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

[[Shigeo Fukuda]], a Japanese artist and designer globally renowned for his satirical posters on anti-war and environmental advocacy&lt;ref name="NYT Fukuda"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heller |first1=Steven |title=Shigeo Fukuda, Graphic Designer of Wit and Allusion, Dies at 76 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/arts/design/20fukuda.html |accessdate=18 November 2018 |date=19 January 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, created posters and sculptures making use of both types of anamorphosis in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="illusionworks Fukada"&gt;{{cite web |title=Art of Shigeo Fukada |url=https://psy2.psych.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/html/art_of_shigeo_fukuda.html |publisher=Illusionworks |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote multiple books on the topic of optical illusions.

While anamorphic images were not his exclusive area of focus, the American artist [[Jonathan Borofsky]] created installations in the 1980's using anamorphic techniques, exhibiting at institutions such as the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; 

[[File:Fréhel vue d'ensemble 1.jpg|thumb|Jean-Max Albert, ''Un carré pour un square'', from the specific vantage point, Place Fréhel, Paris(1988)]]
[[Jean-Max Albert]] created three public sculptures using anamorphosis:''Un carré pour un square'', ''Cube fantôme'' and ''Reflet anamorphose'' (1985). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jonty Hurwitz]], pioneered the use of a mathematical technique to create [[Catoptrics|Catoptric]] sculptures that resolve in a cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Jobson|date=January 21, 2013|website=Colossal|title=The Skewed, Anamorphic Sculptures and Engineered Illusions of Jonty Hurwitz|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/01/the-skewed-anamorphic-sculptures-and-engineered-illusions-of-jonty-hurwitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he produced a public work for the [[Savoy Hotel]]'s River Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alice Jones|title=A homage to Kaspar the friendly cat checks in at the Savoy's new eatery|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/a-homage-to-kaspar-the-friendly-cat-checks-in-at-the-savoys-new-eatery-8600305.html|date=May 2, 2013|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Several academic papers have been written about his work, notably, *''A simplified procedure for anamorphic sculpture'', 2015. Ayoub, Manal Helal. International Design Journal, Volume 5, Issue 2, pp 317–326.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journal.faa-design.com/pdf/5-2-manal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.--&gt;

In 2011, French artist [[François Abélanet]]'s anamorphic garden work ''Qui croire? (Who to believe?)'' was featured in front of the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Adams|first=Henry|title=Is a "Garden" the World's Greatest New Artwork?|date=Nov 29, 2011|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/art/2011/11/is-a-garden-the-worlds-greatest-new-artwork/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Felice Varini|Felici Varini's]] 2014 work ''Three Ellipses for Three Locks'' in [[Hasselt, Belgium]] is an image of three loops that are  made up of segments painted on to over 100 buildings. It is only visible from a specific vantage point over the city.&lt;ref name="EB Anamorphosis" /&gt;

===Drawing and Painting===
The Swedish artist Hans Hamngren produced and exhibited many examples of mirror anamorphosis in the 1960s and 1970s. 

===Photography===
Beginning in 1967, Dutch artist [[Jan Dibbets]] based an entire series of photographic work titled ''Perspective Corrections'' on the distortion of reality through perspective anamorphosis. This involved the incorporation of land art into his work, where areas dug out of the Earth formed squares from specific perspectives.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

===Street Art===
Anamorphic effects are popular in street art, sometimes called "Slant Art" when accomplished on sidewalks. Examples are the [[sidewalk chalk]] drawings of [[Kurt Wenner]] and [[Julian Beever]]&lt;ref name="WebUrbanist" /&gt;, where the chalked image, the pavement, and the architectural surroundings all become part of an illusion. Art of this style can be produced by taking a photograph of an object or setting at a sharp oblique angle, then putting a grid over the photograph. Another elongated grid is placed on the sidewalk based on a specific perspective, and visual elements of one are transcribed into the other, one grid square at a time.

In 2016, the street artist [[JR (artist)|JR]] completed a massive temporary anamorphic illusion over the [[Louvre|Louvre's]] pyramid, making the modern structure disappear and the original building appear as though it was still in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="JR 2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=JR completes monumental anamorphic artwork on the louvre's glass pyramid |url=https://www.designboom.com/art/jr-louvre-museum-installation-paris-05-24-2016/ |website=designboom architecture &amp; design magazine |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1993, [[Myrna Hoffman|Myrna Hoffman’s]] company, OOZ &amp; OZ, has been producing mirror anamorphosis art kits and activities for children, such as the "Morph-O-Scopes" kit.&lt;ref name="OOZ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oozandoz.com/morph-o-scopes-kits/sports-of-all-sorts-kit/ |title=Sports of All Sorts |accessdate=January 14, 2012 |publisher=OOZandOZ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman's kits have earned more than two dozen national toy awards.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Anamorphic portraits were produced of members of the group [[Steeleye Span]] for the sleeve of their album [[All Around My Hat (album)|All Around My Hat]] in 1975 by John O'Connor, a friend of one of them. The album packaging included a lyric sheet with holes punched in the side through which to view the portraits in their correct perspective.

[[Rick Wakeman]]'s 1976 [[album]] ''[[No Earthly Connection]]'' featured front and back cover photographs that are mirror anamorphoses. The original [[gramophone record|vinyl]] release included a mirrored [[Mylar]] sheet which could be curled into a cylinder for viewing the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rwcc.com/title_detail.asp?int_titleID=5 |title=Rick Wakeman official website |accessdate=January 14, 2012 |publisher=rwcc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ani ng Dangal''' or "Harvest of Honors" is a state recognition given by the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] under the Office of the President of the Republic of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB04437.pdf|title=Ani ng Dangal|publisher=Philippine Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an annual event in the Philippines celebrated as a highlight and concluding rite of the Philippine Arts Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/photo_release/2011/0301_03.asp|title=Ani ng Sining|publisher=Senate of the Philippines|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aningdangal.weebly.com/guidelines.html|title=Ani ng Dangal Guidelines|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippine Arts Festival==
February of every year is National Arts Month in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filipinojournal.com/philippine-news/news/ncaa-celebrates-arts-month-with-ani-ng-dangal-awards |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131030094317/http://filipinojournal.com/philippine-news/news/ncaa-celebrates-arts-month-with-ani-ng-dangal-awards |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-10-30 |title=NCAA celebrates arts month with Ani Ng Dangal awards &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=Filipinojournal.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then President Corazon C. Aquino made this declaration in 1991 via ''Presidential Decree 683''. For two decades the NCCA has been supporting various local projects and special events during National Arts Month to showcase the best of the Philippine artistic and cultural scene.

In 2009, the NCCA elevated what has been a national undertaking into a consolidated international event that is the Philippine Arts Festival (PAF). PAF is the NCCA’s contribution to the celebration of National Arts Month. Its tagline is “Ani ng Sining”, and the festival has proven through the years that is indeed a harvest for the arts.

The Ani ng Dangal is given to a natural-born Filipino artist or group that has reaped ''top honors in international events''. Its coverage includes the seven art disciplines:
* Architecture and Allied Arts
* Cinema
* Dance
* Dramatic Arts
* Literary Arts
* Music
* Visual Arts
*including ''Multi-Disciplinary Arts''

==Guidelines==

*The Ani ng Dangal Awards recognizes Filipino talent who have won or earned the highest honors and recognition in competition and events abroad.
* The Ani ng Dangal Awards consists of 9 categories: Architecture, Cinema, Dance, Dramatic Arts, Literary Arts, Music, Visual Arts, Folk Arts and Multi-Disciplinary Arts . New categories may be added subject to deliberation of the Artistic Committee.
* The Ani ng Dangal Awards honors Filipino artists who garnered international awards and prizes from the previous year.
*The Ani ng Dangal Awards only recognizes legitimate award-giving bodies and/or competitions. The legitimacy is based on the recommendation of each committee. Others must be subjected to deliberation by respective committees.
*An international award won through mass voting i.e. online voting is not considered legitimate.
*Awardees must be natural-born Filipino citizens who either have the Philippines as their permanent residence, or have at least acquired enough years of residence in the country at the time of their win (subject to committee deliberation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ANi ng Dangal website|url=http://aningdangal.weebly.com/guidelines.html|accessdate=23 August|work=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Annunciation''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Filippo Lippi]]. Dating to 1440-45, it is housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]] of [[Palazzo Barberini]], [[Rome]].

The composition pivots around the Virgin, who occupies the centre of the scene. In the background, on the right, two small figures of women are riding a stair. The two [[donor portrait]]s show the unknown donors kneeling behind a [[cordonata]].   That they were represented in natural size (i.e., in the same size as the religious figures) was a relatively new stylistic feature.

'''Art Jewelry Forum (AJF)''' is a nonprofit international organization founded in 1997 that advocates for the field of contemporary [[art jewelry]] through education, discourse, publications, grants, and awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artjewelryforum.org/about-ajf|title=About AJF|work=artjewelryforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Art Jewelry Forum publishes online articles as well as in print books. AJF’s online articles cover historical pieces and movements, theoretical interpretations of work, and exhibition reviews. Contributors for the online articles include staff writers as well as professionals in the field. Printed books from Art Jewelry Forum include ''Geography'' (exhibition catalog), ''AJF Best of Interviews'', and ''Show and Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artjewelryforum.org/bookstore/ajf-publications%7ctitle=Bookstore%7cwork=artjewelryforum.org%7ctitle=Bookstore%7cwork=artjewelryforum.org|title=Bookstore|work=artjewelryforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art jewelry Forum also initiated and funded the publication of ''Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective'' by Lark Crafts.

The exhibition catalog ''Geography'' was Art Jewelry Forum's first publication in 2011. ''Geography'' was printed in conjunction with an exhibition of the same name that was presented at SOFA Chicago 2011 and at the [[Society of North American Goldsmiths]] conference in Seattle of 2011.

Art Jewelry Forum worked with Lark Crafts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larkcrafts.com/jewelry-beading/announcing-contemporary-jewelry-in-perspective/|title=Announcing "Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective" «  Lark Crafts|work=larkcrafts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subsidiary of [[Sterling Publishing]], in 2013 to publish ''Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective''. ''Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective'' is broken into three sections "the first exploring what kind of thing contemporary jewelry is, the second exploring its history, and the third exploring opportunities and challenges for the field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://craftcouncil.org/magazine/article/assume-nothing|title=Assume Nothing|work=craftcouncil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Metcalf]] reviews that within these sections "There are two themes that run throughout the book. One is that studio jewelry should be critical. The other is that the most fertile territory for the present-day practitioner is in the realm of the hybrid."&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf, Bruce. "Under the Covers: Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective". ''Metalsmith Magazine'' March, 2014. Volume 34 Number 2. Pg. 16-17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''AJF Best of Interviews'' was published in 2014 by Art Jewelry Forum. ''AJF Best of Interviews'' "corrals some of the site’s most interesting content: interviews with jewelry makers and others central to the field. Taking part in the 20 lively conversations are makers such as Lola Brooks, [[Tanel Veenre]], and Jamie Bennett; dealers such as Sienna Patti; curators such as Bruce Pepich and Ursula Ilse-Neuman; and jewelry aficionados such as [[Madeleine Albright]]... The focus is on intelligent questions and the voices of the interviewees – captured in fresh, informal exchanges that will captivate lovers of art jewelry"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://craftcouncil.org/magazine/article/fresh-perspectives|title=Fresh Perspectives|work=craftcouncil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes Monica Moses, editor in chief at the ''American Craft Magazine'' published by the [[American Craft Council]].

''Show and Tales'' published by Art Jewelry Forum in 2015 and was released in Munich in conjunction with the annual Schmuck fair. ''Show and Tales'' focuses on exhibition making in regards to jewelry, making it the first ever publication on the topic.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Show and Tales'' is broken into three sections that cover historical landmark exhibitions of jewelry, challenges in curating craft and jewelry, and exhibition reviews. It contains essays by Glenn Adamson (USA), David Beytelmann (AR), Susan Cummins (USA), {{Interlanguage link multi|Liesbeth den Besten|nl}} (NL), Monica Gaspar (ES), Toni Greenbaum (USA), Marthe Le Van (USA), Benjamin Lignel (FR), Kellie Riggs (USA), Damian Skinner (NZ), {{Interlanguage link multi|Jorunn Veiteberg|no}} (NO), Namita Wiggers (USA), among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11679">The '''Association of Personal Historians''' ('''APH''') was an international [[non-profit]] [[trade association]] dedicated to developing, supporting and marketing the work of self-employed writers and small businesses who are engaged in  preparing print, video, and audio memoirs recording the lives of individuals, families, and communities. Formed in the United States in 1995, it had a global membership of over 650 at its peak,&lt;ref name=themonthly/&gt;&lt;ref name=aph_about&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.personalhistorians.org/about/about_aph_the_life_story_people.php  |website=Association of Personal Historians|title= About APH — The Life Story People'| accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  before dissolving in May 2017, reportedly due to "financial constraints and membership trends".&lt;ref&gt;[https://truestorieswelltold.com/2017/05/17/when-aph-died-doves-cried/  Sarah White, "When APH Died, Doves Cried", May 17, 2017]. Retrieved 19 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The APH's mission statement was to "support... its members in recording, preserving and sharing life stories of people, families, communities and organizations around the world."&lt;ref name=aph_goals&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.personalhistorians.org/about/vision_mission_goals.php |website=APH|title= Vision, Mission &amp; Goals|accessdate= April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the organization, its members "help other people create personal histories, including memoirs, video tributes, autobiographies, biographies, family histories, heritage cookbooks, community histories, corporate and organizational histories, legacy letters, and ethical wills."&lt;ref name=aph_about/&gt;

All APH members are expected to abide by the organization's [[code of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.personalhistorians.org/about/code_ethics.php |website= APH|title=Code of ethics| accessdate= April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners often have training in skills such as [[interviewing]] techniques, [[desktop publishing]], video and/or audio production, as well as some knowledge of [[geriatrics]] or other disciplines.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Governance==
The APH was governed by an elected, all-volunteer board of directors with overlapping two-year terms. The organization held an annual conference for its members: the 2016 conference was held in Fort Worth, Texas. The 2017 Board of Directors cited decreasing membership and a growing trend towards online networking and collaboration as reasons for dissolution. In a letter to members, the 2017 Board wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;"...APH has achieved its purpose many times over, which, as stated in our Bylaws, was to 'advance the profession of helping individuals, organizations, and communities preserve their histories, memories, and life stories.' APH has helped launch more than a thousand personal history businesses, and its members have produced many thousands of personal history works that will be part of our world’s historical record. APH leaves the field at a time when a broader recognition of the importance of saving life stories has emerged and is flourishing—and is widely known and communicated through the work of many other organizations and media outlets. APH has had a significant role in advancing that conversation. And it was our members, as individual practitioners of personal history, who achieved this in countless ways in countless communities, and we know you will continue to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.personalhistorians.org|title=Letter to Membership: Dissolution of APH, Inc.|last=APH Board of Directors|first=2017|date=May 9, 2017|work=Constant Contact alluded to under Announcements on this page.|access-date=May 10, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Resources==
Former members of APH and current personal historians are encouraged to use the phrase "personal history" and "personal historian" in search engines in order to find relevant social media groups. Trade associations exist for genealogists, photo archivists, ghostwriters, editors, and biographers, among others.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

'''Brigie de Courcy''' is an Irish television producer.

Graduating from [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) with a PhD in [[Drama]], she began working for [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] (RTÉ) as an assistant script editor on the Irish soap ''[[Fair City]]'' in 2000. After a promotion to Script Editor and successful stints as Story Editor and Story Producer on ''[[Emmerdale]]'', she transferred to the [[BBC]]. She worked as Series Story Producer on ''[[EastEnders]]'' under [[Kate Harwood]]. 

This period, from 2005 to 2006, represented a return to form for the show. Criticism had been intense, with particular ire directed at "the quality of its storylines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/12048 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509131624/http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/12048 |archivedate=2006-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general recovery under Harwood, and the improvement in storylines under de Courcy, culminated in a [[National Television Awards|National Television Award]] for most popular series, as well as ''[[EastEnders]]'''s first [[BAFTA]] nomination since 2002 and first victory since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088512/ |title=Awards Section|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harwood went on to become Head of Series and Serials at the BBC in October 2006, while de Courcy left shortly after for a spell in senior BBC management.

In 2008, she returned to Irish television and was appointed Executive Producer of ''[[Fair City]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.ie/star/fair-city-faced-axe-after-a-season-53261/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006104057/http://www.thestar.ie/star/fair-city-faced-axe-after-a-season-53261/ |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; During her reign, the soap has received critical acclaim for its more credible, sophisticated and psychological stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/alls-fair-in-love-and-war-26550149.html |title=All's Fair in love and war |website=Independent.ie |date=2009-07-11 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently she has become Script Producer of the new animated show on RTÉ called ''[[Ballybraddan]]'' which is about [[hurling]] and was brought in to celebrate 125 years of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metroeireann.com/article/all-in-good-time%2C2120 |title=All in good time |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525233337/http://metroeireann.com/article/all-in-good-time%2C2120 |archivedate=2014-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6339">[[File:Prisme.jpg|thumb|right|White light split by a [[prism (optics)|prism]]. The additive primary colors are clearly visible.]]
There are two types of '''color mixing''': ''Additive'' and ''Subtractive''. In both cases, there are three [[primary colors]], three [[secondary colors]] (colors made from 2 of the three primary colors in equal amounts), and one tertiary color made from all three primary colors. This point is a common source of confusion, as there are different sets of primary colors depending on whether you are working with additive or subtractive mixing.

==Additive mixing==
[[File:Additive color mixing simulated.png|thumb|A simulated example of additive color mixing. Additive primaries act as sources of light.  The standard red, green, and blue combine pairwise to produce the additive secondaries cyan, magenta, and yellow. Combining all three primaries (center) produces yellow and white.]]
The additive mixing of colors is unintuitive as it does not correspond to the mixing of physical substances (such as paint) which would correspond to subtractive mixing. For instance, one can additively mix yellow and blue by shining yellow light together with blue light, which will result in not green but a white light. As in this example, one should always have the mixture of light in mind when considering additive color mixing as it is the only situation where it occurs. Despite being unintuitive, it is conceptually simpler than subtractive mixing. Two beams of light that are superimposed correspond to additive mixing.

By convention, the three primary colors in additive mixing are [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]. In the absence of color, when no colors are showing, the result is black. If all three primary colors are showing, the result is white. When red and green combine, the result is yellow. When red and blue combine, the result is magenta. When blue and green combine, the result is cyan. 

Additive mixing is used in television and computer [[Visual display unit|monitors]] to produce a wide range of colors using only three primary colors. A [[pixel]] is a juxtaposition of these three primary colors. Projection televisions typically have three projectors, one for each primary color.

==Subtractive mixing==
{{Main|Subtractive color}}
[[File:SubtractiveColorMixing.png|thumb|right|A simulated example of (idealized) subtractive color mixing.  An external source of illumination is assumed, and each primary attenuates (absorbs) some of that light.  The standard subtractive primaries cyan, magenta, and yellow combine pairwise to make subtractive secondaries red, green, and blue (which themselves are additive primaries, or in practice somewhat darker and less-saturated versions of typical additive primaries).  Combining all three primaries (center) absorbs all the light, resulting in black. For real pigments, the results would be somewhat complicated by opacity and mixing behavior, and in practice adding a fourth pigment such as black may be helpful.]]
The mixing of colored physical substances corresponds to subtractive color mixing, hence it corresponds to our intuition about mixing colors. To explain the mechanism, let us consider mixing red paint with yellow paint. The red paint is red because when the ambient light strikes it, the composition of the material is such that it absorbs all other colors in the visible spectrum except for red. The red light, not being absorbed, reflects off the paint and is what we see. This same mechanism describes the color of all material objects -- note that light is not a material object -- and so applies to the yellow paint as well. Making recourse to the figure above demonstrating additive color mixing, one sees that yellow light is composed of an (additive) mixture of red and green light. When we mix the two paints, the resulting substance has red paint and yellow paint. The yellow paint absorbs all colors except for red and green. However, the red paint will absorb the green reflected by the yellow paint. The red paint can be said to subtract the green from the yellow paint. The resulting paint reflects only red light and so appears red to our eyes. Note however that this description is theoretical and that the mixing of [[pigment]]s does not correspond to ideal subtractive color mixing because some light from the subtracted color is still being reflected by one component of the original paint. This results in a darker and desaturated color compared to the color that would be achieved with ideal filters.

The three primary colors in subtractive mixing that produce the largest [[gamut]] are [[yellow]], [[magenta]] and [[cyan]], leading to the [[CMYK color model]] widely used in color printing. Historically, painters have used [[RYB color model|yellow, red and blue]] in place of these, resulting in reduced gamut. In subtractive mixing of color, the absence of color is white and the presence of all three primary colors is black. The secondary colors are the same as the primary colors from additive mixing, and vice versa. This is not an accident. By mixing additive secondary colors subtractively one can reachieve the primary additive colors. Subtractive mixing is used to create a variety of colors when [[printing]] on paper by combining a small number of [[ink]] colors, and also when painting. Red is created by mixing magenta and yellow (removing green and blue). Green is created by mixing cyan and yellow (removing red and blue respectively). Blue is created by mixing cyan and magenta (removing red and green). Black can be approximated by mixing cyan, magenta, and yellow, although real pigments are not ideal and so pure black is nearly impossible to achieve.

'''Confronted animals''', or '''confronted-animal''' as an [[adjective]], where two animals face each other in a [[symmetry|symmetrical]] pose, is an ancient bilateral [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in [[art]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] studied in [[archaeology]] and [[art history]]. The "anti-confronted animals" is the opposing motif, with the animals back to back.

Bilateral symmetry is a dominant aspect of our world and strong representation of it with matching figures often creates a balance that is appealing in artwork.

In ancient art, confronted-animal motifs often involve the [[Master of Animals]], a central human figure between two confronted animals, often grasping them, and are probably part of a unified [[sociology|socio-]][[culture|cultural]] motif. A related motif in ancient art is known as the [[Mistress of Animals]].

It is thought that the [[iconography]] sometimes has [[ritual]] and religious associations; for example, the Lion Gate of [[Mycenae]] has a column between the protective, surmounted and confronted lionesses standing with two feet on the ground and two on the same base on which the column rests. The column is thought to represent a goddess, abstracted to avoid [[taboo]]ed direct representation.  Alternatively, the column has also been interpreted as symbolizing the entrance to the palace.  The lions are thus guarding the entrance to the palace and the walled fortification simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/4306/1/The_Lion_Gate_Relief.pdf|title=The Lion Gate Relief at Mycenae Reconsidered (PDF)|last=Shaw|first=Maria C.|date=1986|website=TSpace (University of Toronto), Archaeological Society of Athens, Greece|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif called the [[Tree of Life]], where two confronted animals graze on a shrub or tree, is also very ancient.

==Gebel el-Arak Knife==

The reverse side of the [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] handle, displayed at the top of the article, shows two powerful confronted lions, separated by a figure who is grasping them. Of note, the knob on the reverse shows the top end of the hole for a cord or rope, on the suspension [[lug (knob)|lug]]; this knife may have been worn around the neck ceremonially.

==Examples from archaeology==

===Cylinder seals===

[[Image:Uruk3000BCE.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Cylinder seal]] of [[Uruk]] displaying a confronted-lioness motif sometimes described as a ''"[[serpopard]]"'' - 3000 BC - [[Louvre]]]]
Examples of confronted animals exist on [[Cylinder seal]]s from [[Mesopotamia]]. [[deity|Deities]], or [[hero]]es grasping lionesses, cattle, [[griffin]]s, or other, imaginary creatures are sometimes found.

Many cylinder seals involving confronted [[goat]]s surrounding a central [[Tree of life]] on a 'cone' or 'mountain' platform share one common theme. Others may be thought of as deities holding the animals under their control.

Because cylinder seals are numerous and also come from [[prehistory|pre-historical]] periods, back to the [[4th millennium BC|fourth]] or [[5th millennium BC]], themes are varied. Another Tree of life type of confronted animals cylinder seal has a "hero grasping water buffalo" and a "bull-man grasping lions", each between the animals; again, the central figure is the "Tree-of-Life" that often is interpreted as representing a goddess.

===Confronted snakes===
[[Image:Snake Goddess Crete 1600BC.jpg|thumb|Figure from [[Crete]], holding confronted snakes, dated 1600 BC. ]]
Confronted [[serpent (symbolism)|snake]]s are frequent images in many cultures from ancient times to historical periods. Often associated with religious ceremonies and deities, perhaps the most familiar figure known popularly from ancient times is the deity or priestess of Crete depicted holding up two confronted snakes on either side of her.

A [[chlorite]] vessel [http://www.nyu.edu/classes/wright/Fall03/ChloriteVase2.jpg] from the area of contemporary [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] is displayed at this link. It depicts three pairs of confronted animals. Two confronted [[snakes]] are being held in the hands of the central figure; below the snake-pair are a pair of ''anti-confronted-lionesses'' (although they turn their heads to face each other their hind quarters are closely confronted), recumbent. The third similar pair of animals on this item are two anti-confronted bovines with a human or deity between also. Two tumbling lions and other animals are depicted to the right.

===Narmer Palette===
[[File:Narmer Palette serpopard side.jpg|thumb|left|Narmer Palette with confronted lionesses, displayed in iconographic [[register (sculpture)|register]]s - ''Ancient Egypt c. 3,000 BC'']]
The [[Narmer Palette]], used to mix cosmetics in the receptacle on one side, has two confronted [[Felidae|felines]], sometimes called [[serpopard]]s (because of their exaggerated long necks which look snakelike to some researchers) forming the receptacle. Close examination of the animals with the exaggerated, long necks supports identification as [[lion]]esses. The entire theme of the Narmer Palette, is about the [[pharaoh]] of the newly unified [[Ancient Egypt]] represented in two scenes, (palette ''obverse'', palette ''reverse''). On one side the pharaoh wears the crown of [[Upper Egypt]] and on the other, the pharaoh wears the crown of [[Lower Egypt]]. Thus, it is thought that the lionesses with their intertwining necks are representing two kingdoms, once separate, but now unified under one pharaoh. The lioness [[Bastet|Bast]] had been the protective deity of one kingdom and the lioness [[Sekhmet]] of the other kingdom, equally important deities in each of the early [[Egyptian pantheon]]s. Respectively, they were the special protectors of the pharaoh in each kingdom, who persisted as deities throughout the long history of unified [[Ancient Egypt]]. Eventually their roles diverged, however, with one becoming less of the protector and warrior deity and assigned other roles. Typically, many similar deities in the two kingdoms soon were merged, so the retention of both is thought to be the result of the long and strong tradition of each.

Examples of other confronted animals exist on many [[cosmetic palette]]s of Ancient Egypt that have been discovered.  One palette has confronted-[[hippopotamus]]es; others include giraffes, geese, and other animals familiar to the Egyptians. Bilaterally depicted [[palm tree]]s also are known as well on palettes.

===Mycenae Lion Gate===
[[Image:Mycenae lion gate detail dsc06384.jpg|thumb|225px|The Mycenae "Lion Gate" (detail) with two [[lion]]esses or lions that flank a central column|alt=]]
The gate to the citadel of [[Mycenae]] is shown to the right. It crowned the major entrance gateway to the ancient citadel that was the centre of the culture, [[Mycenaean Greece]], that predated that of [[Greece]], and is a well-known example of two confronted lionesses. Debate exists in research of this image, questioning whether these are leopards or lionesses confronted with a column between them that represents the deity, but the characteristic tufts at the end of the tails confirm the species. Many images of lioness related deities are depicted with heavier manes than typical for lionesses, but that may have been the result of attempts to interpretation of the species or, unfamiliarity with the atypical [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] differences within this feline species.  Alternatively, George Mylonas believed lions were depicted, not lionesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mycenae and the Mycenaean Age|last=Mylonas|first=George|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0691035239|location=|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greek herald's staffs (kerykeia)===

In ancient Greece, heralds functioning as private messengers or public criers were referred to as ''kerykes''. The ''keryx'' has functions in political, military, judicional and religious matters. He was identified by his attribute, the herald's staff or ''kerykeion'', in Latin ''caduceus''. The attribute also offered him protection. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, also carries a ''kerykeion''. Kerykeia were often donated to temples by private persons and on state occasions. They are also found in herald's graves, and identify the profession of the buried person.

{{Main|Tomb of the Leopards}}
Confronted leopards appear in a tomb found in Tarchuna ([[Tarquinia]]), or Tarchna Tarchnal, the chief of the [[Etruscan cities|twelve cities]] of [[Etruria]], a district in what is described as the [[Etruscan civilization]] that existed in Italy from 1200 BC through the 100 BC. It appears in the earliest history of [[Rome]], which was dominated by it until early in the 330s BC. This mural features confronted [[leopard]]s providing protection for a banquet in the afterlife. Frequently felines, lionesses and leopards such as these are confronted with a tree, shrub, or column between them in murals from this culture. The Etruscans are thought to have migrated from the area of Troy,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} through Greece where they absorbed many cultural elements, to Italy where they founded their culture in prehistoric times.

In Europe, confronted animals are an important motif in [[animal style]], or [[zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] decoration, [[Insular art]], and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]. In these contexts there may be little or nothing between the two animals, and the emphasis is on the pair themselves.  Human figures are often treated in the same way, often mixed in with animals in decorative schemes - [[Archery|archer]]s were especially popular in the Romanesque period.

The early [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[ship burial]] found in contemporary Great Britain at [[Sutton Hoo]], from the seventh century AD, contains famous examples of [[Migration Period art]].  The [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid]] has three stylized confronted-animal pairs; the two side pairs, left and right, are identical, and have the animals in the person's clutched grasp. The central confronted animals are even more complex in theme.

Opposed animals are used in [[Insular art]], the style of which is derived from a mixture of [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and northern European design traditions. Confronted animals, or animals intertwined in very intricate patterns, often depicted grabbing at each other to form the "gripping beast" pattern, are a main feature of some periods of [[Viking art]]. So intertwined are the animals, they are dissolved into pure ornament, and the individuals are barely discernable from each other.  Confronted animals are also frequently seen in European [[Romanesque art]], for example as decorative patterns in [[Romanesque architecture]].

[[Supporters (heraldry)|Supporters]] in [[heraldry]], not always a matched pair, continue the theme.

===Asian art===

====Luristan bronzes, Anatolian "animal" carpets====
{{See also|Early Anatolian Animal carpets|Luristan bronze}}

Confronted-animal motifs are found extensively in Asian art and in textiles, including [[Oriental rug|rug]]s, across [[Eurasia]].

Few examples still exist of a special type of Oriental [[Oriental rug|carpet]], termed "animal carpets" because their main feature are confronted animals. Dated to the 13th–16th century, they represent carpets woven during the transition period between the late [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuq]] and the early [[Ottoman empire]]. Parallels were shown between the "opposed animal" and "latch-hook" motifs from woven pile rugs and the [[Lorestān bronze]]s.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are [[Early Iron Age]] [[bronze]] artifacts of various individual forms which have been recovered from [[Lorestān Province|Lorestān]] and [[Kermanshah]] areas in west-central [[Iran]].

Carpet fragments discovered in [[Konya]] and [[Beyşehir]] in Turkey, and [[Fustat|Fostat]] in Egypt were dated to the 13th century, which corresponds to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=F.R.|title=A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800|date=1908|publisher=Printed for the author in the I. and R.

A traditional Chinese motif, the fight between phoenix and dragon, is seen in an Anatolian carpet now displayed at the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin, and radiocarbon dated to the mid 15th century. The Chinese motif was probably introduced into Islamic art by the Mongols during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="Dragon and Phoenix carpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon and Phoenix Carpet|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=object;ISL;de;Mus01;34;de|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another animal carpet showing two medallions with two birds besides a tree was found in the Swedish church of Marby.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt;

Since 1988, seven more carpets of the animal type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]]. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;ref name="MET animal carpet Acc.Nr. 1990.61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/453317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which parallels a painting by the Sienese artist [[Gregorio di Cecco]]: "The Marriage of the Virgin", 1423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Gallery London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-gregorio-di-cecco-di-luca-the-marriage-of-the-virgin|website=National Gallery London NG 1317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows large confronted animals, each with a smaller animal inside. An almost complete animal carpet is now at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]].

"Animal carpets" were also depicted in Italian paintings of the 14th and 15th century, and thus represent the earliest Oriental carpets shown in [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance paintings]].

[[File:Powhatan's mantle, lithography 1888.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of Powhatan's Mantle]]
"Powhatan's Mantle" is a cloak of [[deerskin]], which originally belonged to a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] of high social status. Its decoration consists of shell beadwork, depicting a central standing human figure flanked by two upright, opposed quadrupeds and surrounded by 34 discs. The two animals resemble one another in terms of their overall outline, but their tails and paws differ. The left-hand animal has a long tail and round paws with five articulated digits. The right-hand animal has a shorter tail, and its legs end in cloven hoofs. Historically, this artwork was believed to have belonged [[Powhatan]], who was the [[paramount chief]] of [[Tsenacommacah]], an [[Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom|alliance]] of [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian-speaking]] [[Virginia Indians]] in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]] at the time English settlers landed at [[History of the Jamestown Settlement (1607–1699)|Jamestown]] in 1607. "Powhatan's Mantle" is one of the earliest North American artifacts to be collected by Europeans that still survives today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/amulets/tradescant/tradescant07-13.html "Powhatan's Mantle"] at the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Coronation of the Virgin''''' (in Italian ''Incoronazione Maringhi'') is a painting of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] by the Italian Renaissance master [[Filippo Lippi]], in the [[Uffizi]], Florence.

==History==

Francesco Maringhi, ''procuratore'' of the church of [[Sant'Ambrogio, Florence|Sant'Ambrogio]], left money after his death in 1441 for a new painting at the high altar of the church. Bills of the payments for the work until 1447 have been preserved.

In the late 1430s, brother Filippo Lippi had left the convent of the [[Church of the Carmine, Florence|Carmine convent]] to open an artist workshop of his own; however, having no money enough to pay assistants and apprentices, he worked alone with two usual collaborators,  Fra' Carnevale and Fra' Diamante, along with an unknown "Piero di Lorenzo dipintore". For the ''Coronation of the Virgin'', however, Lippi had to call in a total of six external painters, who were responsible also for the gilded frame, now lost. Originally the work had a [[predella]], also lost, with the exception of a small panel with a ''Miracle of St. Ambrose'', now in the [[Berlin State Museums]].

The work was immediately admired and was copied by numerous painters. It remained in Sant'Ambrogio until 1810, when it was stolen. Later it was sold to the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], from which it was transferred to the [[Galleria degli Uffizi]] in Florence.

==Description==
The work is composed of a single panel, divided into three sectors by the arches. At the sides of the central arch are two ''[[Tondo (art)|tondos]]'', depicting the Angel of Annunciation and the Virgin.

The main scene features a crowd of biblical figures, angels and saints,
portrayed in informal positions; most of them are probably portraits of existing people. As usual, the scene is set in Heaven, but Lippi decided to avoid the outdated gilded background, replacing it with a striped sky which alludes to the seven sectors of the Paradise. In the middle, in a commanding position, are Christ and the kneeling Madonna who is going to be crowned, within a majestic marble throne in perspective. The latter includes the shell-shaped niche, featured in other paintings by Lippi.

Four angels hold a gilded ribbon, while in the lower level is a series of kneeling saints; on the left and right are other two groups of saints and angels, inspired to the crowded choirs of older works, such as the ''Incoronation of the Virgin'' by [[Lorenzo Monaco]]. The elevated pavement of the side groups creates a perspective triangle whose apex is the Virgin's head.

Amongst the figures in the middle can be recognized Mary Magdalene and St. Eustace (titular of one of the most important altars in the church) with his sons and his wife. These figures, all without a halo, are shorter than normal, as the painter imagined them to be correctly seen from below, in perspective, by the nuns of the Sant'Ambrogio convent from their separated choirs.

Kneeling at the side are the work's commissioner, facing a cartouche with the write ''ISTE PERFECIT OPUS'' ("this one finished the work"), while on the left is a self-portrait of Filippo Lippi in the robes of a [[Carmelite monk]] (as he was). Standing on the sides are the two titular saints of the church: St. Ambrose (left) and St. John the Baptist (right), whose austere representation reveal the influence of [[Masaccio]].

This painting is described at length in lines 344-389 of [[Robert Browning|Robert Browning's]] poem '[[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]]', published in 1855 in his collection ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]''.

'''''Displaying the Body of Saint Bonaventure''''' (French - ''Exposition du corps de saint Bonaventure'') is a 1629 painting by [[Francisco de Zurbarán]], now in the [[Louvre]]. Around the body of [[saint Bonaventure]] are figures including [[James I of Aragon]] and [[Pope Gregory X]], shown in conversation. It formed part of a series of paintings on the saint's life - the other works are ''Saint Bonaventure at the Council of Lyon'' (Louvre), ''Saint Bonaventure and the Angel'' (Dresden) and ''Saint Bonaventure and Saint Thomas Aquinas before a Crucifix'' (Berlin).

==Background==
The '''East Village''', sometimes called the "East Village Arts District," is the name of a neighborhood in [[Long Beach, California]], within eastern  [[Downtown Long Beach, Long Beach, California|Downtown Long Beach]].  The borders of the East Village are not strictly defined, but the area is centered in the southeast portion of downtown, roughly between Long Beach Boulevard on the west and Alamitos Avenue on the east, and Ocean Boulevard on the south to 10th Street on the north.

==Demographics==
The East Village is a mix of many different housing types, including high-rise condos, artist lofts and small [[Arts and Crafts movement|craftsman cottages]]. It serves as the home to individuals with differing cultures, income levels, and professions. 

==Setting==
The neighborhood has many independent stores selling everything from designer denim and specialty sneakers to used books and mid-century furniture. There are coffee shops, juice bars, and restaurants featuring selections from crepes and sushi to chicken n' waffles.

==Arts District==
The East Village is also the city's [[arts district]], with most of the independent shops, restaurants and [[art gallery|galleries]] exhibiting work by Long Beach and Southern Californian artists.&lt;ref&gt;http://lbpost.com/news/2000000895-lbt-makes-major-changes-routes-altered-cleaner-buses&lt;/ref&gt;
The East Village Arts District is home to the ''Second Saturday Art Walk'' [http://artwalklb.com/] which occurs every month. This event features art receptions and special events in the shop and galleries of the District. The District is also home to ''Tour des Artistes'', an annual street festival event in June which features visual artists in every discipline, as well as performing artists ranging from singer-songwriters to Shakespeare.
The District hosts ''Soundwalk'' [http://www.soundwalk.org], a unique sound art festival, which began in 2004. ''Soundwalk'' is a series of site-specific sound installations and sound art performances which attracts renowned sound artists from around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">[[Albert Einstein]], in searching for the [[transformation group]] for his [[unified field theory]], wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every attempt to establish a unified field theory must start, in my opinion, from a group of transformations which is no less general than that of the continuous transformations of the four coordinates.  For we should hardly be successful in looking for the subsequent enlargement of the group for a theory based on a narrower group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Einstein |first1=Albert |first2= E. G. |last2=Straus |url=http://www.utdallas.edu/~mxv091000/Einstein-Straus-46.pdf |title=A Generalization of the Relativistic Theory of Gravitation |journal=Annals of Mathematics |volume=46 |issue=4 |date=October 1945 |pp=578&amp;ndash;584 |doi=10.2307/1969197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- the following paragraph appears to be non-sense --&gt;

==The Poincaré group==

The [[Poincaré group]], the transformation group of [[special relativity]], being [[orthogonal]], the inverse of a transformation equals its transpose, introducing [[discrete reflections]]. This, in turn, violates Einstein's dictum for a group "no less general than that of the continuous transformations of the four coordinates."  Specifically, any pair of Euler angles ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;minus;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are not independent, nor are any pair of boosts ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;/''c'' and &amp;minus;''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;/''c''.  Available parameters are thus reduced, from the 16 needed to express all transformations in a curved spacetime, per the general [[principle of relativity]], ∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&amp;prime;&lt;/sup&gt;/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;, to the 10 of the Poincaré group.

==The Einstein group==

[[Mendel Sachs]], in the 1960s, found the transformation group that Einstein had sought, the "Einstein" group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the Most General Form of a Field Theory from Symmetry Principles|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v226/n5241/abs/226138a0.html|journal = Nature|date = 1970-04-11|pages = 138–139|volume = 226|issue = 5241|doi = 10.1038/226138a0|first = Mendel|last = Sachs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Einstein group can be obtained by factorizing the squared spacetime invariant interval

: ''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;mu;&amp;nu;''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''&amp;mu;''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''&amp;nu;''&lt;/sup&gt;

into a [[quaternion]]-valued form and its conjugate, ''ds''&amp;nbsp;''ds*'', where

: ''ds'' = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;mu;''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''&amp;mu;''&lt;/sup&gt;

and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is a [[four-vector]] of [[Hermitian]] [[quaternions]].

Note that the Einstein group approaches—but never reaches—the Poincare group as the flat spacetime ([[special relativity]] limit) is approached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sachs | first = Mendel | year = 2010 | title = Physics of the Universe | publisher = Imperial College Press, London | ISBN = 978-1-84816-532-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Encyclopedia of Albanian Art''''' or '''''Enciklopedia e Artit Shqiptar''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] that specialises in coverage in [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]] and in the [[Albanian diaspora]]. It combines knowledge on a wide range of Albanian art, from [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] to [[wikt:cinema|cinema]] and [[theatre]].

== Contributors ==
A number of authors have contributed to the encyclopedia including [[Josef Papagjoni]], [[Zana Shuteriqi]], [[Ferid Hudhri]], [[Moikom Zeqo]], [[Jakup Mato]] and [[Kristaq Dhamo]] in Albania. The encyclopedia is the first of its kind in Albania, an ambitious project which will eventually be published in six to eight volumes.

The publication is a product of the Center of Studies of Art, part of the [[Albanian Academy of Sciences]]. The encyclopedia has a board of 10 people, including some of the most prominent scholars in their fields. The board are also the most active contributors to the encyclopedia

In October 2007 about 1000 or so pages had been made ready for publication.

The '''Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges''' ('''''Exhibition of Flemish Primitives at Bruges''''') was an art exhibition of paintings by the so-called [[Flemish Primitives]] (nowadays usually called Early Netherlandish painters) held in the [[Provinciaal Hof]] in Bruges between 15 June and 5 October 1902.

It was the largest exhibition of c 15th c Flemish art to date, consisted of 413 official catalogue entries,&lt;ref name=Bohn&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohn|first=Babette|title=A companion to Renaissance and Baroque Art|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son|isbn=9781118391501|page=513|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjE8vLREjmYC&amp;pg=PA521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and drew some 35,000 visitors.&lt;ref name=Krul/&gt; The exposition was highly influential, leading to at least five contemporary books as well as numerous scholarly articles, and initiated deeper study of the Flemish Primitives by a new generation of [[connoisseur]]s.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;&lt;ref name=VKC&gt;{{cite web|last=Paumen|first=Vanessa|title=De Vlaamse primitieven: What's in a name?|url=http://vlaamseprimitieven.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/nl/onderzoek/webpublicaties/de-vlaamse-primitieven-whats-in-a-name|publisher=De Vlaamse Kunstcollectie.be|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also inspired [[Johan Huizinga]] to research and write his ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stigter|first=Bianca|title=De ontsproten Picasso|year=2009|publisher=Atlas Contact|isbn=9789025430412|language=Dutch|chapter=Voor eksters geschilderd. Jan van Eyck in Brugge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in attribution of many important works (in table below) reflects progress in understanding the era by art historians since then, although it is an ongoing process.

==Exposition==
The 1902 exhibition was not the first to focus on the Flemish Primitives, although it was the first on this scale and to generate so much interest and scientific feedback. Among earlier exhibitions were the 1867 "Tableaux de l'ancienne école Néerlandaise" in Bruges, also directed by W. H. J. Weale; the 1892 "Exhibition of pictures by masters of the Netherlandish and allied schools of XV and early XVI centuries" at the [[Burlington Fine Arts Club]], with 60 pictures;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition culture in London 1878–1908|url=http://www.exhibitionculture.arts.gla.ac.uk/exhibition.php?eid=2980|publisher=Exhibition Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1899 ''Netherlandish School'' exhibition at the [[New Gallery (London)]], with 165 works.

The 1902 exposition was originally intended for Brussels, but moved to Bruges after the city refused to lend the many works it held to the exhibition if it did not take place in Bruges. It was held in the Provincial Government Palace in Bruges from 15 June until 15 September 1902, but due to popular demand was extended until 5 October 1902.

The president of the exhibition was Baron [[Henri Kervyn de Lettenhove]].

[[William Henry James Weale]] wrote the notes for the catalogue for the painting section. The often erroneous attributions were those of the owners, but the position of the paintings in the exhibition generally reflected the opinion of the organizers, including Weale and Georges Hulin de Loo (a professor at the [[University of Ghent]]), regarding their authorship.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; The illustrated catalogue of the section showing manuscripts, [[Illuminated manuscript|miniatures]], archive texts, seals, [[Méreau (token)|mereaux]], coins and medals was written by Baron [[Albert Van Zuylen Van Nyevelt]]. A third section, covering needlework, gobelins, and the like, was catalogued by [[Isabelle Errera]].

The exhibition showed some 400 paintings attributed to the Flemish Primitives, many of which had never before been exhibited. The display of many works by major artists created the first strong opportunity to compare their styles side by side and revise earlier attributions, either from one painter to another or from "work by" to "copy of a work by".

The exhibition was opened by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]], and visited by Crown Prince [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert]] and Crown Princess Elisabeth on 3 July 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prinselijk bezoek voor de Tentoonstelling der Vlaamse Primitieven.|url=http://beeldbankbrugge.be/beeldbank/weergave/record/?id=2a5077f7-8920-4216-b08a-acd0630135d2|publisher=Beeldbank Brugge|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The exhibition showed far more of the most important remaining examples of Early Netherlandish panel painting than earlier exhibitions and sparked a lively discussion about the attributions of the paintings, started by Hulin de Loo: dissatisfied with the official catalogue, he published his own critical catalogue.&lt;ref name=Ridderbos&gt;{{cite book|last=Ridderbos|first=Bernhard|title=Early Netherlandish Paintings: Rediscovery, Reception, and Research|year=2005|publisher=Getty|isbn=9780892368167|page=481|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1Kmpi4bOygC&amp;pg=PA453 |chapter=3. From Waagen to Friedländer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition greatly improved the appreciation of Early Netherlandish art, which previously had been chiefly appreciated only by a few collectors and art historians,
&lt;ref name=Krul&gt;{{cite book|last=Krul|first=Wessel|title=Early Netherlandish Paintings: Rediscovery, Reception, and Research|year=2005|publisher=Getty|isbn=9780892368167|page=481|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1Kmpi4bOygC&amp;pg=PA453 |chapter=4. Realism, Renaissance and Nationalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also led to shifts in the status of the artists: [[Hans Memling]], who had been considered to be the major artist of the period, was surpassed by the likes of [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. This has been attributed to the abundance of works by Memling at the exhibition, which made critics notice the lack of invention and overly serialized production he often showed, compared to the other masters.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Jenny|title=Inventing Van Eyck: The Remaking of an Artist for the Modern Age|year=2007|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781845207762|page=259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N378atgUje0C&amp;pg=PA232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the organizers of the exhibition had a somewhat Belgian nationalistic view, art lovers in other countries sometimes reacted vehemently to the appropriation of "their" painters by the Flemish or Belgians. In France, there were calls for a similar exhibition of French Primitives, which was organised in 1904 and tried to reclaim artists, like van der Weyden and [[Robert Campin]], who were from French-speaking parts of the Netherlands; it also tried to cast Early Netherlandish painting as a derivative of Early French painting.&lt;ref name=Krul/&gt;

The Bruges exhibition directly influenced some painters, who incorporated aspects of Flemish Primitive painting into their work. Flemish [[Expressionism|expressionist]] [[Gustave Van de Woestijne]] changed his approach to portraiture, focusing more on the psychological aspects, while his colleague [[Valerius de Saedeleer]] was influenced by the landscapes he saw at the exhibition.&lt;ref name=Boyens&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyens|first=Piet|title=Sint-Martens-Latem|year=1998|publisher=Lannoo|isbn=9789020934977|page=517|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEPOYiZilNEC&amp;pg=PA52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a new exhibition documenting the 1902 exhibition and its impact was held in Bruges: "Impact 1902 Revisited. Early Flemish and Ancient Art exhibition. Bruges 15th June - 15th September 1902, Brugge, 2002.", with a catalogue by Eva Tahon, Piet Boyens e.a.&lt;ref name=VKC/&gt;

The '''F-rating''' is a rating to highlight women on screen and behind the camera.&lt;ref&gt;http://f-rated.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;
Developed at [[Bath Film Festival]] in 2014, the '''F-rating''' was inspired by the [[Bechdel test|Bechdel Test]] based on a 1985 cartoon strip&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/the-rule|title=dykestowatchoutfor.com  » Blog Archive   » The Rule|website=dykestowatchoutfor.com|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Alison Bechdel]], and popularised in the 2010s by [[Anita Sarkeesian]]'s Feminist Frequency blog, and by Ellen Tejle's A-rating&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-listfilm.com/ A-rating]&lt;/ref&gt; in Swedish cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bechdeltestfest.com/2015/04/10/we-talk-to-ellen-tejil-founder-of-a-rate/ |title=We talk to: Ellen Tejle founder of A Rate! |work=The Bechdel Test Fest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521164412/http://bechdeltestfest.com/2015/04/10/we-talk-to-ellen-tejil-founder-of-a-rate/ |archivedate=2015-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticisms of the A-rating, Swedish film theorists Ingrid Ryberg, Anu Koivunen and Laura Horak wrote, "The A rating has proved to be an activist provocation that works, and it is important to ask why... The A rating is not about classifying films as feminist or not feminist. It aims to alert viewers who find female sociality compelling to films they might like, and so challenge the industry to make more such films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/27/swedish-cinema-bechdel-test-works|title=Swedish cinema's use of the Bechdel test is a provocation that works|author=Anu Koivunen|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival developed the F-rating in October 2014 "to take it a step further and highlight films which either had a senior figure in production who was female—a director or a screenwriter—or had very strong female leads or women's issues," according to festival director and F-rating founder Holly Tarquini.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/bath-film-festival-2014-movies-with-strong-female-credentials-to-receive-special-frated-certificate-9849238.html|title=Bath Film Festival 2014: Movies with strong female credentials to receive special F-rated certificate|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarquini told the [[BBC]] that films had to meet at least one of three criteria to receive the rating: "If our films have a female director, a female lead who is not simply there to support the male lead, or are specifically about women then they will receive an F-rated stamp of approval." &lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-29739874|title='F-rated' films shown at Bath Film Festival|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the F-rated founder, Holly Tarquini was invited to deliver a TED talk at TEDxYouth@Bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Stories Shape Us {{!}} Holly Tarquini {{!}} TEDxYouth@Bath|date=2016-12-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMEajG_cvC0&amp;t=1s|accessdate=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==

The F-rating is a reaction to a phenomenon known as the [[celluloid ceiling]], which has been documented internationally. "[[British Film Institute|BFI]] figures showed that in 2011, 15% of all UK films released were directed by women, but in 2012, this went down to 7.8%.",&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; while a study by "the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University found females made up 15 per cent of protagonists, 29 per cent of major characters and 30 per cent of all speaking characters in the 100 top-grossing films of 2013."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

==Bath Film Festival 2014: first implementation==

Seventeen of the forty-two films received the F-rating, included the First World War drama [[Testament of Youth]], based on [[Vera Brittain]]’s memoir, and director Jean-Marc Vallée’s true-life tale Wild, starring [[Reese Witherspoon]].

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/11/bath-film-festival-wild-f-rating-feminist-films|title=Bath film festival goes Wild with F rating for feminist films|author=Ben Child|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's magazines Marie Claire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/world/547748/bath-film-festival-f-rating-given-to-films-with-strong-female-leads.html|title=Bath Film Festival: 'F' Rating Given To Films With Strong Female Leads - Marie Claire|work=Marie Claire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a19084/bath-film-festival-feminist-rating/|title=Bath Film Festival Announces 'F' Rating For Feminist Films|author=Diana Bruk|work=ELLE}}&lt;/ref&gt; both gave positive coverage to the rating and programme, which were also mentioned in UK Culture Minister [[Ed Vaizey]]'s weekly bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathfilmfestival.org.uk/festival-news/f-rated-goes-viral/|title=Bath Film Festival's F-Rating Goes Viral - Bath Film Festival|work=Bath Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent implementation==

In February 2015, the Bath Comedy Festival announced that it would be the UK's first F-rated comedy festival, with performers including [[Viv Groskop]] and [[Helen Lederer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathcomedy.com/f-rating|title=Bath Comedy Festival - F-Rating|work=bathcomedy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, Komedia Bath arranged a meeting to encourage all Bath festivals, including the [[Bath Festival of Children's Literature]] and [[Bath International Music Festival]], and arts organisations to make [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] the first F-rated city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komedia.co.uk/bath/komedia-bath-bids-to-make-bath-the-first-f-rated-city/ |title=Komedia  » Blog Archive   » Komedia Bath bids to make Bath the first F-Rated city |work=komedia.co.uk }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Bath Film Festival programme was 45% F-rated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bathfilmfestival.org.uk/content/uploads/2014/07/Bath-Film-Festival-2015.pdf|title=Bath Film Festival 2015 programme|last=|first=|date=November 2015|website=bathfilmfestival.org.uk/|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted more attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34982615|title=Can F-rated films help overcome sexism in Hollywood?|last=Youngs|first=Ian|date=2015-12-04|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 all the independent cinemas and film festivals in the UK were invited to join the F-rating with dozens signing up to F-rated their programme.&lt;ref&gt;http://f-rated.org/we-f-rate/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 The Barbican became the 40th organisation to adopt the rating.

==F-rated keyword added to IMDb==

In January 2017, the F-rated keyword was added to [[IMDb]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-39132867&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2017, there were over 22,400 films on IMDb tagged with the F-rated keyword.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword?keywords=f-rated&lt;/ref&gt;

The rating was defended by [[GQ|GQ Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gq.com/story/please-dont-use-imdbs-new-feature-to-be-a-dick&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Folklore''''' {{efn|{{nihongo|FolksSoul -失われた伝承-|FōkusuSōru -Ushinawareta Denshō-}} in Japanese}} is a 2007 [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Game Republic]] and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]. The game is set in Ireland and the [[Celtic Otherworld]] of [[Irish mythology]], centering on a young woman named Ellen, and a journalist named Keats, both playable characters who together unravel the mystery that the quaint village of [[Doolin]] hides, the mystery that can only be solved by seeking the memories of the dead in the dangerous, Folk-ridden Netherworld.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Folklore Screen.jpg|left|thumb|Ellen utilizing "folk" in combat]]

Folklore is an [[action role-playing game]], where players control characters in a [[Virtual camera system|third-person]] view to both explore their surroundings and engage in combat. From the start, players will have a choice to play the game as either of the two lead protagonists, the young woman Ellen or the journalist Keats, both having different yet intertwining plots and play styles. The game is split into two worlds, the real world set in small sea-side Irish village of [[Doolin]] and the more fantastical Netherworld inhabited by folk creatures and spirits.

In Doolin, players lead their chosen character throughout the village and surrounding area. When in this state, characters are unable to engage in combat or utilize their abilities and instead will be limited to exploring the village’s locations and interacting with its inhabitants, containing multiple search and slight puzzle-esque quests that progress the main story and eventually lead them to and from the Netherworld, acting as a hub between worlds and subsequent quests.

When characters pass into the Netherworld, the gameplay shifts entirely towards the action-adventure side of its genre. Basic attack techniques are performed by utilizing "folk", various creatures and spirits that upon defeat can be absorbed for the player’s use. When a folk is nearly defeated, its spirit will glow red, allowing players to absorb it by locking onto it and performing shaking and yanking motions with the [[Sixaxis]] motion control (rather than a conventional button interface) to reel in its energy for use. While the player can choose from nearly all folk encountered and absorbed, only four at a time can be mapped to the controller’s main four interface/action buttons and used in quick succession for combat with different kinds of folk being better suited for certain situations and techniques such as close-combat, projectile attacks or magic. The two playable characters themselves also differ between play styles. While Ellen uses a variety of folk as basic strategy and favoring a defensive stance with the ability to cloak herself with folk powers, Keats uses more straight up brute force attacks with usually all round stronger folk along with the ability to release built up energy to become invincible and perform stronger attacks for a period of time.

==Plot==
The game takes place in the present day. A young university student by the name of Ellen ([[Lisa Hogg]]) is lured to the sea-side village of Doolin, in Ireland, led by a letter from her supposedly dead mother, telling her to meet her at the Cliff of Sidhe, Doolin. Meanwhile Keats ([[Richard Coyle]]), a journalist from an occult magazine called ''Unknown Realms'', receives a telephone call from a woman in distress telling him to come to Doolin, and crying about Faerys who would kill her. Though he suspects it is a prank call, he pays a visit to Doolin Village.

When Ellen arrives at the Cliff of Sidhe, she sees a cloaked figure resting at the edge. Thinking it is her mother, she calls out to the figure, but it does not reply. Keats arrives on the scene then, and asks Ellen if she was the one who called him. When she, surprised, says no, he wonders aloud if the figure at the cliff was the one who called him.

A strong gust of wind suddenly blows across the cliff, and when it dies down, the figure has disappeared. Ellen, distraught, runs down to the beach to find the body and bumps into a girl from the village named Suzette. She questions Ellen, but she is so distressed that she faints. Keats arrives and, after questioning Suzette about Ellen, decides that the best thing would be to bring Ellen back into the village.

Suzette brings Ellen to a small hut and Keats to a base on the edge of the village. That night, they are both visited by strange voices who invite them to the village pub, where they meet creatures they had never before thought existed, and are taken to a place that surpasses all imagination: the Netherworld, realm of the dead. Soon Keats and Ellen find themselves in a 17-year-old murder mystery, where the answers seem to only be found in the Netherworld, the land that can only be accessed from one place in the world, Doolin. To solve the crime and reveal Ellen's forgotten past, they will need to venture to the Netherworld as travelers, where Faerys and Folks alike await them.

Along the way they meet a variety of different characters, like Scarecrow and Belgae, who help out both of them in their quest. Throughout the game, players learn about the chaos the Netherworld was put into by a previous Netherworld traveller. The eventual goal is to reach the core of the Netherworld and "fix" it. The game takes two different perspectives in the story that shows the different views and opinions of many different characters. While traveling in the Netherworld, many mysterious murders start to occur in the village of Doolin after the appearance of "The Hag." The people murdered are the only ones who knew the truth (or part of the truth) of Ellen's past.

==Development==
''Folklore'' was announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2006 which was said to be "The next generation of dark fantasy." It was to be developed by [[Game Republic]], under [[Yoshiki Okamoto]], a video game designer who worked on popular games, including ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. The game was originally titled ''Monster Kingdom: Unknown Realms'', and was intended as a companion piece to [[Gaia (game company)|Gaia]]'s ''[[Monster Kingdom: Jewel Summoner]]''. However, disappointing sales of ''Jewel Summoner'' led to the game being retitled ''Folklore''. Gaia however would assist the development of Folklore, contributing monster designs. Numerous creatures appearing in ''Folklore'' would later appear in Gaia's [[PlayStation Portable]] game ''[[Coded Soul: Uketsugareshi Idea]]'' the following year, which also featured connectivity with ''Folklore''.

A playable demo was first released on the Japanese [[PlayStation Network]] (PSN) on May 30, 2007. The demo features the two playable characters Keats and Ellen, with the ability to choose from either of them. The demo includes a series of short comic-style cutscenes, exploration of a sea-side village and a trek through a series of playable areas where a player is introduced to the gameplay basics (i.e. fighting, how to acquire new Ids, etc.). This demo was all in Japanese aside from the lines in English that both protagonists would occasionally exclaim during combat.

An English speech demonstration was released on the European PSN on August 22, 2007; as a limited time offering, it was removed from the [[PlayStation Store]] on August 31. This demo was released to the North American PSN on August 23, 2007. An English/Traditional Chinese speech version demo was released on the Asian PSN on September 4, 2007. The original Japanese demo was released in English version on European and US PlayStation Network Stores.

Upon release, ''Folklore'' received "favorable" reviews according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of three eights and a nine, for a total of 33 out of 40.&lt;ref name="Famitsu score"/&gt;

Most of the praise the game received was direct at the art design and a rich fairy tale/mythological setting and style. Ryan Clements of [[IGN]] was particularly impressed with the game’s style over the actual technical graphics engine, noting that "''Folklore'''s sheer visual beauty comes more from the stellar art direction and execution of the artistic design than the amount of processing power it requires,” helped further by the soundtrack described as "poignant and intrinsically atmospheric."&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; This view was further echoed by Gaming Target, summing up with "technically the game looks great, with the realistic style of Doolin, mixed in with the colorful and absurdly Japanese stylings of the Netherworld levels," later including ''Folklore'' in their "52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=GT staff |date=December 31, 2007 |url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=8069 |title=52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007 |publisher=Gaming Target |accessdate=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle system where players would catch and utilize various "folk" was considered another positive aspect. [[GameSpy]] found that "what makes the enormous library of monsters and moves work so well is that each is most useful in a particular situation"&lt;ref name="GameSpy review"/&gt; and while [[GameTrailers]] also praised the feature finding that "switching folk in and out of your arsenal is easy thanks to well-organized menus," it also criticized brief loading times between shifting in and out of the menus that "puts a damper on the game’s flow."&lt;ref name="GameTrailers review"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]] on the other hand felt that the basic level design was "pretty standard dungeon crawling," if not "bland" at times. The use of the SIXAXIS motion control to reel in energy from downed folk was considered a better use of the feature compared to past games, with [[1UP.com]] calling it "the most subtle and sensible use of the PS3's motion control yet."&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Barnholt |first=Ray |date=October 9, 2007 |url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/folklore |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604003110/http://www.1up.com/reviews/folklore |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |title=Folklore |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the narrative was considered a strong point, with GameZone calling it "compelling," the method of telling much of the story in graphic-novel style still cutscenes however received a less than positive response.&lt;ref name="GameZone review"/&gt; Kevin VanOrd of [[GameSpot]] felt that while "an interesting design choice" is, in the end "weirdly flavorless."&lt;ref name="Gamespot review"/&gt; Another issue found in this method was the lack of voice-work outside of the full CGI cutscenes with [[GamesRadar]] (in-house) finding it to hinder the delivery of the overall story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesradar.com/us/ps3/game/reviews/article.jsp?articleId=2007092517183422088&amp;sectionId=1000&amp;pageId=20070925171854786003]{{Dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancelled sequel===
The now-defunct Game Republic was planning a [[PlayStation Portable]] or download only Move compatible ''Folklore'' sequel and had pitched the idea to Sony. The idea was well received by Sony but due to poor sales of the original ''Folklore'' were not keen to green light the project which failed to pass the internal review board at Sony by a few points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thegamingliberty.com/index.php/2011/07/07/game-republic-were-planning-folklore-2-with-move-support |title=Game Republic were planning Folklore 2 with Move support |publisher=TheGamingLiberty.com |date=July 7, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716125923/http://thegamingliberty.com/index.php/2011/07/07/game-republic-were-planning-folklore-2-with-move-support |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Romero |first=Josh |date=January 5, 2009 |url=http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2009/01/05/folklore-2-and-brave-story-2-will-not-be-made-says-game-republic-founder.htm |title=Folklore 2 and Brave Story 2 will not be made, says Game Republic founder |publisher=Video Games Blogger |accessdate=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ganjapa''' ({{lang-or|ଗଞ୍ଜପା}}) are the traditional [[playing card]]s from the [[India]]n state [[Odisha]].&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singha|first1=Minati|title=Ganjapa lost in the mists of time|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Ganjapa-lost-in-the-mists-of-time/articleshow/35465926.cms|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=Times of India|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to the [[trick-taking game|trick-taking]] [[card game]] that they are used for.
It is played with circular shaped [[Pattachitra]] painted cards. Originated in the 16th century, Ganjapa is a recreational game for male members of the [[Odia people|Odia]] society, primarily villagers, kings and their [[court]]men. Ganjapa is played as "''Charirangi''" (cards of 4 colors), "''Atharangi''" (cards of 8 colors), "''Dasarangi''" (cards of 10 colors), "''Bararangi''" (cards of 12 colors), "''Chaudarangi''" (cards of 14 colors) and "''Sohalarangi''" (cards of 16 colors). The variation of this game influenced by [[Persia]]n card game [[Ganjifa|Ganjifeh]] is known as "Mughal Ganjifa". The game is popular in [[Puri district|Puri]] and [[Ganjam district]] of Odisha.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Panda|first1=Namita|title=Days numbered for Ganjapa cards|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140205/jsp/odisha/story_17690733.jsp#.VF2aqfmUfHU|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hindu1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Das|first1=Sib Kumar|title=A unique pack of cards|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/a-unique-pack-of-cards/article3834260.ece|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the relative isolation of Odisha in the past, Ganjapa developed very differently from the Ganjifa found in the rest of India.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|pages=184-192|ref=Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odisha has by far the largest community of Ganjifa players and manufacturers.

== Etymology ==
The [[Odia language|Odia]] word Ganjapa is believed to be related to "[[Ganjifa]]" (originated from [[Persian language|Persian]] word Ganjifeh)&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jena|first1=Monalisa|title=Playing cards of yore|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2001/07/01/stories/1301046e.htm|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was popular by the [[Mughal emperors]].&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

== History ==
The first written document regarding the play dates back to [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] times 1399 – 1412, mentioning about the winning of a ransom by Mamluk’s army officer by playing Kanjafa. The [[Topkapı Palace]] in Istanbul has a collection of a set of Mamluk cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nandagopal|first1=Dr.Choodamani|title=Ganjifa – The Indian Playing Cards|url=http://www.aventure.ac.in/ganjifa-the-indian-playing-cards/|publisher=Aventure|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Earliest mention of Ganjifa is found in 1527 AD during Mughal emperor [[Babur]]'s rule.&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt;

== Artwork ==
Artworks used on Ganjapa cards are Pattachitra painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samantaray |first1=Prafulla Kumar |title=Patta Chitra - It's Past and Present |issue=December 2005 |page=50 |url=http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/dec2005/engpdf/patta_chitra_its_past_and_present.pdf |accessdate=9 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109064833/http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/dec2005/engpdf/patta_chitra_its_past_and_present.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pattachitra motifs and patterns with figurative representations of dancers and other people, and of the [[Ramayana]], [[Dasavatar]]a of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Vishnu]], and other deities of Hindu mythology are painted on the round cards. Artworks always have traditional Odishan art, and vary from region to region and community to community in Odisha.&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt; Ganjapa artwork from Ganjam varies from that of Puri.&lt;ref name=hindu1/&gt;

Ganjapa appears very differently from Ganjifa found in other parts of India as well.&lt;ref name="Hopewell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopewell|first1=Jeff|editor1-last=MacKenzie|editor1-first=Colin|editor2-last=Finkel|editor2-first=Irving|title=Asian Games: The Art of Contest|date=2004|publisher=[[Asia Society]]|location=New York|page=248|ref=Hopewell|chapter=Ganjifa: The Traditional Cards of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Moghul Ganjapa, the suit-symbols are now highly stylized and abstract. Dasavatara Ganjifa contains only 10 suits but its Ganjapa equivalent can contain 12, 16, 20, or 24 suits to make the game more challenging. The Ramayana type is presently unique to Odisha and perhaps the most popular in the present. Also produced are ones with birds as suit-symbols, a relatively modern invention marketed to tourists.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

== Card making ==
[[File:Patta-painting of Ganjapa.webm|thumb|Girl painting Ganjapa cards at [[Raghurajpur]] craft's village. [[Puri district|Puri]]]]
The card making procedure resembles that of Pattachitra. Layers of glue made by grinding tamarind seeds are pasted on cloth are applied and dried. Circular shaped cards then are carved using hollow iron cylinders. Two circular sheets are joined together to make a card. After drying natural dyes made of [[lac]], limestone (for white color), coal-carbon (for black) and [[tamarind]] (for yellow) are used to paint figures.&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt;

== Variations ==
[[File:Carirangi Ganjapa.jpg|thumb|Dasarangi Ganjapa cards]]
Ganjapa is played as "''Charirangi''" (cards of 4 colors or 4 suits in a pack of card), "''Atharangi''" (cards of 8 colors),&lt;ref name=toi/&gt; "''Dasarangi''" (cards of 10 colors), "''Bararangi''" (cards of 12 colors), "''Caudarangi''" (cards of 14 colors) and "''Sohalarangi''" (cards of 16 colors). Each color has 12 cards that makes the total number of cards an integer of number associated with the card's name, i.e. a "Charirangi Ganjapa" has 48 cards similar to [[playing cards]], "Atharangi Ganjapa has 96 cards and so on.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt; Each color is recognizable by a unique background color. Each suit contains 10 numbered cards (1-10), a king and [[vizier]]. The king possesses the highest value followed by the vizier and then the numerical series in descending order. The king's card has a painting of him in sitting posture with legs folded at the knees (known as "chauka madi basa"), with the vizier's card with him standing. The king is also seen riding a chariot with the minister mounted on a horse. Some of the cards have the king with two heads and the minister with one head. Signature figures from Pattachitra like imaginary figure with human head and four legs of four different animals are also seen in cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GANJAPA playing cards|url=http://www.riace.in/workshop/ganjapa.html|website=RIA/CE|publisher=Raghurajpur International Art/Culture Exchange|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Interzone''''' is a collection of unpublished short stories and other early works by [[William S. Burroughs]] from 1953 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/william-s-burroughs/interzone/|title=INTERZONE by William S. Burroughs {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was first published by [[Viking Press|Viking Penguin]] in 1989, although several of the stories had already been printed elsewhere, including an earlier publication titled ''Early Routines''. The title was inspired by the [[Tangier International Zone|International Zone]] in [[Tangiers]], Morocco, where Burroughs lived for a time and by which he was greatly influenced.

A notable inclusion is "Twilight's Last Gleamings", written in 1938 in collaboration with childhood friend Kells Elvins, and widely thought to be Burroughs' first attempt at fiction. The villain of the piece, Doctor Benway, was to play a pivotal role in ''[[Naked Lunch]]''. (This story differs from another Burroughs piece titled "Twilight's Last Gleamings," which was published in the 1970s collection, ''[[Exterminator!]]''.)

''Interzone'' features many characters and concepts that would manifest themselves in ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', ''[[Nova Express]]'' and others. At one point, Interzone was considered as a title for ''[[Naked Lunch]]''. Moreover, the concluding section entitled "WORD" was part of the original ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' manuscript but was cut during the editing process (according to the introduction by editor [[James Grauerholz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257582.Interzone|title=Interzone|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the short pieces were adapted into other media. Burroughs recorded the stories "[[The Junky's Christmas]]" and "Spare Ass Annie," which were set to music and released on the album ''[[Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales]]''. "[[The Junky's Christmas]]" was also adapted as an animated film in the 1990s.

'''''La nobla leyczon''''' ({{IPA-oc|la ˈnɔbːlɔ lejˈsu|oc}}, ''La nòbla leiçon'' in modern [[Occitan language|Occitan]], "The Noble Lesson") is an anonymous text written in [[Old Occitan]]. It is the founding document&lt;ref&gt;The most important of the Waldensian literature is a poem in Provençal, ''La Nobla Leyczon'', but it is not entirely original, having been edited.[http://www.askwhy.co.uk/christianheresy/0811Inquisition.php]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Waldensians|Waldensian]] creed. Its sixth line, ''ben ha mil &amp; cent an complí entierament'' (already eleven hundred years have run their course [since [[Christ]] died]), places it in the early 12th century but modern scholars now date it between 1190 and 1240.&lt;ref&gt;Bosio, Enrico: La Nobla Leyczon ''considérée au point de vue de la doctrine, de la morale et de l'histoire'', Bulletin de la Société d'Histoire Vaudoise, n° 2 (dic. 1885), pp. 20-36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the very same line varies according to which of the four manuscripts is studied: the [[Geneva]] and [[Dublin]] ones say ''mil e cen'' (1100) while the [[Cambridge]] ones both state ''mil e cccc cent'' (1400).&lt;ref&gt;Édouard Montet, ''La noble leçon, texte original d'après le manuscrit de Cambridge'', 1888, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Further discrepancies include various anachronisms and the fact that Old Occitan was not spoken in the [[Lyon]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Collins, ''Heritage of the Waldensians: a Sketch'', WRS Journal 3:2 (August 1996) 9-15, p.2: This pre-dates Peter of Lyons, who with his followers, were chased from Lyons about 1186, when they joined the valley dwellers, the Valdese. [...] The ''Lesson'' mentions the Vaudois (''Valdense'') as being already persecuted and as having already a well-known history. The idiom of the ''Nobla Leyczon'' is that of the valleys, the Romance language, and not that of the idiom of Lyons, a French dialect, which it would have been if Peter (''Valdo'') and his Poor Men had authored it.[http://www.wrs.edu/Materials_for_Web_Site/Journals/3-2%20Aug-1996/Collins%20-%20Waldensians.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was found in the [[Piedmont]]ese valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Griffiths &amp; George Edward Griffiths, ''The Monthly Review'', 1825, p. 259 [https://books.google.com/books?id=KfhGYUVvr6EC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=noble+lesson&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jZ9eTOaRB8Ge4AaY85i5Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=noble%20lesson&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 479 lines of the poem can be divided into seven parts according to the themes treated [http://www.info-bible.org/livres/Histoire.Eglise.Vaudoise.2/13.htm#repentance]: 1-56 deal with the [[eschatology|end of the world]]; 57-229 retrace the history of the [[Bible]]; 230-265 tell of the new law; 266-333 narrate Jesus's life and works; 334-360 praise the faithful [[Christian Church]]; 361-413 relate the persecutions and the corrupted lives of [[papist]]s and 414-479 explain what true [[repentance]] is.

THUS BEGINTH THE NOBLE LESSON [https://books.google.com/books?id=CHwFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=noble+lesson&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jZ9eTOaRB8Ge4AaY85i5Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]

O Brethren, give ear to a noble Lesson,&lt;br&gt;
We ought always to watch and pray,&lt;br&gt;
For we see this world nigh to a conclusion,&lt;br&gt;
We ought to strive to do good works,&lt;br&gt;
Seeing that the end of this world approacheth.&lt;br&gt;
There are already a thousand and one hundred years fully accomplished&lt;br&gt;
Since it was written thus, ''For we are in the last time''.&lt;br&gt;
We ought to covet little, for we are at the latter end.&lt;br&gt;
We see daily the signs to be accomplished&lt;br&gt;
In the increase of evil and the decrease of good.&lt;br&gt;
These are the perils which the Scripture mentioneth&lt;br&gt;
In the Gospels and Saint Paul's writings.&lt;br&gt;
No man living can know the end.&lt;br&gt;
And therefore we ought the more to fear, for we are not certain&lt;br&gt;
Whether we shall die to day or to morrow.

'''Marks &amp; Spencer Group plc''' (also known as '''M&amp;S''') is a major British multinational retailer headquartered in the [[City of Westminster]], London. It is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]].

It specialises in the selling of clothing, home products and [[Luxury good|luxury]] food products. M&amp;S was founded in 1884 by [[Michael Marks]] and [[Thomas Spencer (Marks and Spencer)|Thomas Spencer]] in [[Leeds]].&lt;ref name="BBC2000October23"&gt;{{cite news|title=M&amp;S launches underwear boutiques|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/986292.stm|accessdate=15 March 2017|agency=BBC|issue=Business|publisher=BBC|date=23 October 2000|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also began to sell branded goods like [[Kellogg's Corn Flakes]] in November 2008.&lt;ref name="top brands"&gt;{{cite news |author=Hiscott, Graham |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/city-news/2009/11/04/marks-and-spencer-to-start-selling-top-brands-115875-21796883/ |title=Marks and Spencer to start selling top brands |work=Daily Mirror |location=London |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; M&amp;S currently has 979 stores across the U.K. including 615 that only sell food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39743611|title=M&amp;S online food delivery service will be no piece of cake|last=Plummer|first=Robert|date=28 April 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the company became the first British retailer to make a pre-tax profit of over £1&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref name="profit"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/96531.stm |title=Marks &amp; Spencer profits top expectations |publisher=BBC News  |date=19 May 1998 |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although subsequently it went into a sudden slump, which took the company, its shareholders, who included hundreds of thousands of small investors, and nearly all retail analysts and business journalists, by surprise. In November 2009, it was announced that [[Marc Bolland]], formerly of [[Morrisons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Zoe Wood  |author2=Julia Finch  |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/22/bolland-marks-spencer-problems |title=A new face, but the same old problems at Marks &amp; Spencer |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 22 November 2009|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; would take over as chief executive from executive chairman [[Stuart Rose]] in early 2010; Rose remained in the role of non-executive chairman until he was replaced by Robert Swannell in January 2011.&lt;ref name="guardian bolland"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/18/marc-bolland-marks-spencer|title=Marc Bolland appointed as chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer| last=Wearden |first=Graeme |date=18 November 2009 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ft bolland"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8d85cb20-d438-11de-990c-00144feabdc0.html |title=M&amp;S names Bolland as new chief|last=Stafford|first=Philip|date=18 November 2009 |work=Financial Times |accessdate=18 November 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, its clothing sales have fallen whilst food sales have increased after the axing of the "[[St Michael (brand)|St. Michael]]" naming for their own brand.

On 22 May 2018, it was confirmed that over 100 stores will have closed by 2022 in a "radical" plan. Whether more stores will close is yet to be confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=10 hrs ago |url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/news/marks-and-spencer-confirms-100-stores-will-close-by-2022/ar-AAxCEC7?OCID=ansmsnnews11 |title=Marks And Spencer Confirms 100 Stores Will Close By 2022 |publisher=Msn.com |date= |accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Establishment===
[[File:Marks &amp; Spencer, Briggate, Leeds.jpg|thumb|Marks and Spencer on [[Briggate, Leeds|Briggate]] not far from their original branch in [[Leeds]].]]
The company was founded by a partnership between [[Michael Marks]], a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jew]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/facilitiesandresources/diversity/events/documents/multiculturalism_poster_m_s.pdf |title=Marks and Spencer – a Great British institution. |publisher=[[Bournemouth University]] |accessdate=4 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509144611/http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/facilitiesandresources/diversity/events/documents/multiculturalism_poster_m_s.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Paul Burns|2008|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; from [[Słonim]] (Marks was born into a Polish-Jewish family, a Polish refugee living in the Russian Empire, now in [[Belarus]]), and [[Thomas Spencer (Marks and Spencer)|Thomas Spencer]], a cashier from the English market town of [[Skipton]] in [[North Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A43825629 |title=The History of Marks and Spencer |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theskiptonpress.co.uk/skiptons-illustrious-citizen-thomas-spencer-co-founder-marks-spencer/|title=Skipton’s Most Illustrious Citizen: Thomas Spencer, Co-Founder Of Marks &amp; Spencer|publisher=Skipton Press|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his arrival in England, Marks worked for a company in Leeds, called Barran, which employed refugees (see [[Sir John Barran, 1st Baronet]]). In 1884 he met Isaac Jowitt Dewhirst while looking for work. Dewhirst lent Marks £5 which he used to establish his Penny Bazaar on [[Leeds Kirkgate Market|Kirkgate Market]], in Leeds.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Dewhirst also taught him a little English. Dewhirst's cashier was Tom Spencer, a bookkeeper, whose second wife, Agnes, helped improve Marks' English. In 1894, when Marks acquired a permanent stall in Leeds' covered market, he invited Spencer to become his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/gallery/2008/jul/09/marksandspencer.history|title=The history of Marks and Spencer|date=9 July 2008|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 Marks moved to the [[Birkenhead]] open market where he amalgamated with Spencer. The pair were allocated stall numbers 11 &amp; 12 in the centre aisle in 1903, and there they opened the famous Penny Bazaar.  The company left Birkenhead Market on 24 February 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upton-wirral.co.uk/wir3.php |title=Birkenhead Market Fire |work=upton-wirral.co.uk |accessdate=20 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427143731/http://www.upton-wirral.co.uk/wir3.php |archivedate=27 April 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next few years saw Michael Marks and Tom Spencer open market stalls in many locations around the North West of England and move the original Leeds Penny Bazaar to 20, Cheetham Hill Road, [[Manchester]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/BUmarks.htm |title=Spartacus: Michael Marks |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date=31 December 1907 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605081542/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/BUmarks.htm |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic growth===
[[File:Marks and Spencer shop, Bekonscot.JPG|thumb|Representation of historic store from the 1930s, [[Bekonscot]] model village, UK]]
Marks and Spencer, known colloquially as "Marks and Sparks",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' – [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919169,00.html "Business: Marks &amp; Sparks Trades Up"], 28 November 1977&lt;/ref&gt; or "M&amp;S", made its reputation in the early 20th century with a policy of only selling British-made goods (it started to back down from this policy in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/mampss-uturns-will-the-latest-plans-last-2133453.html |title=M&amp;amp;S's U-turns: Will the latest plans last? |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It entered into long-term relationships with British manufacturers, and sold clothes and food under the "[[St Michael (brand)|St Michael]]" brand, which was introduced in 1928. The brand honours [[Michael Marks]]. It also accepted the return of unwanted items, giving a full cash refund if the receipt was shown, no matter how long ago the product was purchased, which was unusual for the time.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

M&amp;S staff raised £5,000 to pay for a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighter aircraft called ''The Marksman'' in 1941.&lt;ref name="marksintime"&gt;{{cite book | title = Marks in Time: 125 Years of Marks &amp; Spencer | date = 3 September 2009 | last = Chislett | first = Helen | publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson | isbn = 978-0-297-85873-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1950, virtually all goods were sold under the "St Michael" label. M&amp;S lingerie, women's clothes and girls' school uniform were branded under the "St Margaret" label until the whole range of general merchandise became "St Michael". [[Simon Marks]], son of Michael Marks, died in 1964, after fifty-six years' service. [[Israel Sieff]], the son-in-law of Michael Marks, took over as chairman and in 1968, [[John Salisse]] became the company Director. A cautious international expansion began with the introduction of Asian food in 1974. M&amp;S opened stores in continental Europe in 1975 and in Ireland four years later.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

The company put its main emphasis on quality, including a 1957 stocking size measuring system.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; For most of its history, it also had a reputation for offering fair value for money. When this reputation began to waver, it encountered serious difficulties. Arguably, M&amp;S has historically been an iconic retailer of 'British Quality Goods'.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

The uncompromising attitude towards customer relations was summarised by the 1953 slogan: "The customer ''is'' always and completely right!"&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

Energy efficiency was improved by the addition of thermostatically controlled refrigerators in 1963.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

M&amp;S began selling [[Christmas cake]]s and [[Christmas pudding]]s in 1958. In an effort to improve the quality of their [[Swiss roll]]s, they hired the food expert Nat Goldberg, who made a major improvement across their entire cake range, which had lost the public's favour a few years earlier. As a later measure to improve food quality, food labelling was improved and "sell by dates" were phased in between 1970 and 1972.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

Smoking was banned from all M&amp;S shops in 1959 because of the fire hazards it posed.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

In 1972, [[Marcus Sieff, Baron Sieff of Brimpton|Marcus Sieff]] became chairman, remaining in place until 1984, and emphasising the importance of good staff relations to the tradition of the store,  while extending staff benefits to areas such as restaurants and chiropody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1323890/Lord-Sieff-of-Brimpton.html |title=Obituary - Marcus sieff |date=26 February 2001 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International expansion===

M&amp;S opened its first Asian store in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitlock |first=Monica |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24165743 |title=When Duke Ellington played Kabul - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company expanded into Canada in 1973, and at one point had forty-seven stores across Canada. Despite various efforts to improve its image, the chain was never able to move beyond its reputation there as a stodgy retailer, one that catered primarily to senior citizens and expatriate Britons. The shops in Canada were smaller than British outlets, and did not carry the same selection. In the late 1990s, further efforts were made to modernise them and also expand the customer base. Unprofitable locations were closed. Nonetheless, the Canadian operations continued to lose money, and the last 38 shops in Canada were closed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/1999/07/14/marks990714.html |title=Marks and Spencer close ahead of schedule |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=10 November 2000 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826234315/http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/1999/07/14/marks990714.html |archivedate=26 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion into France began with shops opening in Paris at [[Boulevard Haussmann]] and [[Lyon]] in 1975, followed by a second Paris shop at Rosny 2 in 1977. Further expansion into other French and Belgian cities followed into the 1980s. Although the Paris shops remained popular and profitable, the Western European operation as a whole did not fare as well and eighteen shops were sold in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pfanner |first=Eric |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2001/10/18/t15_14.php |title=Galeries Lafayette buying 18 stores |work=International Herald Tribune |date=18 October 2001 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 2011, M&amp;S changed directions again with an announcement to reopen a store that will not only sell clothing but food as well. In addition the group will also open several food outlets throughout the French capital. The first branch opened on 24 November 2011 at the [[Champs-Élysées]] in a ceremony attended by the company's CEO [[Marc Bolland]], the model [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]] and the British Ambassador to France, Sir [[Peter Westmacott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8917910/Paris-has-a-Marks-and-Spencer-again-but-its-the-wrong-size-and-in-the-wrong-place.html|title=Paris has a Marks and Spencer again, but it's the wrong size and in the wrong place|publisher=The Telegraph|date=27 November 2018|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the company acquired [[Brooks Brothers]], an American clothing company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooksbrothers.com/aboutus/heritage3.tem |title=Brooks Brothers Heritage |publisher=Brooksbrothers.com |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kings Super Markets]], a US food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/sector-44-45-retail-trade/clothing-clothing/1181357-1.html |title=Kings Supermarkets |publisher=Allbusiness.com |date=1 May 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 M&amp;S expanded to sell through European marketplace [[Zalando]] on their German, French, Dutch, Belgian and Austrian sites with a range of kidswear and lingerie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zalando.de/ms-london/|title=Marks &amp; Spencer London Online-Shop {{!}} Marks &amp; Spencer London versandkostenfrei bei Zalando|website=www.zalando.de|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial decline===
[[File:M &amp; S, Inverness (1998).png|thumb|M&amp;S shop in [[Inverness]] in 1998]]

M&amp;S's profits peaked in the financial year 1997/1998.&lt;ref name="profit"/&gt; At the time it was seen as a continuing success story, but with hindsight it is considered that during Sir [[Richard Greenbury]]'s tenure as head of the company, profit margins were pushed to untenable levels, and the loyalty of its customers was seriously eroded. The rising cost of using British suppliers was also a burden, as rival retailers increasingly imported their goods from low-cost countries, but M&amp;S's belated switch to overseas suppliers undermined a core part of its appeal to the public. Another factor was the company's refusal until 2001 to accept any credit cards except its own chargecard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciao.co.uk/Marks_Spencer_Chargecard__Review_5001590 |title=Marks &amp; Spencer storecard fading value |publisher=Ciao.co.uk |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724031156/http://www.ciao.co.uk/Marks_Spencer_Chargecard__Review_5001590 |archive-date=24 July 2010 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These factors combined to plunge M&amp;S into a sudden slump, which took the company, its shareholders, who included hundreds of thousands of small investors, and nearly all retail analysts and business journalists, by surprise. The company's share price fell by more than two thirds, and its profits fell from more than a billion pounds in 1997 and 1998 to £145&amp;nbsp;million in the year ended 31 March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/07/02/bcnmshist102.xml Marks &amp; Spencer: A Recent History] ''The Daily Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, with changes in its business focus such as accepting credit cards, the introduction of the "Per Una" clothing range designed by [[George Davies (retailer)|George Davies]], and a redesign of its underlying business model, profits recovered somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/2794432/Marks-and-Spencer-loses-Per-Una-design-director.html|title=Marks &amp; Spencer loses Per Una design director|publisher=The Telegraph|date=7 August 2008|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, M&amp;S was in the throes of an attempted takeover by [[Arcadia Group]] and [[British Home Stores|BHS]] boss, [[Philip Green]].&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DQA/is_2000_Feb_17/ai_59870857 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016211356/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DQA/is_2000_Feb_17/ai_59870857 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=16 October 2015 |title=Green drops Marks &amp; Spencer bid |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=18 April 2011 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July a recovery plan was announced which would involve selling off its financial services business [[M&amp;S Bank|M&amp;S Money]] to [[HSBC Bank (Europe)|HSBC Bank plc]], buying control of the ''Per Una'' range, closing the [[Gateshead]] Lifestore and stopping the expansion of its Simply Food line of shops. [[Philip Green]] withdrew his takeover bid after failing to get sufficient backing from shareholders.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The book- "Marks in time" by Orionbooks.co.uk (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, M&amp;S announced the opening of the world's largest M&amp;S shop outside the UK at [[Dubai Festival City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dubai.mconet.biz/index.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=282535&amp;category=884&amp;category_name= |title=Dubai Online |publisher=Dubai.mconet.biz |accessdate=7 November 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2008, M&amp;S opened its first mainland China shop in [[Shanghai]]. Problems with the supply chain for the first few months of opening led Stuart Rose, M&amp;S chairman, to describe failures in "basic shopkeeping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2bac61ae-f6e2-11dd-8a1f-0000779fd2ac.html |title=M&amp;S admits Shanghai errors |first = Patti | last = Waldmeir |work=Financial Times |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restructuring===
Twenty-two unprofitable and minor food stores, such as the ones at [[Ripon]] and [[Balham]], were closed in early 2009 as part of a cost cutting measure.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; In August 2010, it was confirmed that the [[Grantham]] branch of M&amp;S would close, along with two other [[Lincolnshire]] branches in [[Skegness]] and [[Scunthorpe]] due to low sales in these older format stores. The closures were met with protests from the local communities and petitions were signed in support of retaining the stores, although they went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;BBC New Lincolnshire 25 August 2010 [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-11076135 'M&amp;S confirms three store closures in Lincolnshire'] Retrieved 25 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Retail Knowledge Bank conducted an audit of the company's brands in August 2010, and revealed that sales of womenswear were at a 10-year low. The audit covered both the Limited Collection, Autograph, Autograph Weekend, Classic Collection, Per Una, Portfolio and Indigo.&lt;ref name="thisismoney.co.uk 512068"/&gt; ''Draper'' magazine claimed that Per Una was the only clothing brand not at risk of being axed while Marc Bolland considered which brands would be retained.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Per Una was planned to stay due to its successful and distinctive flair, but Portfolio and Indigo were planned to go due to poor sales.&lt;ref name="thisismoney.co.uk 512068"/&gt; Both the Limited Collection, Autograph, Autograph Weekend, Classic Collection brands were being considered for the cull during mid-2010, but were later given a reprieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Isak Halfon, expansion director, Mango |url=http://www.just-style.com/news/bolland-review-to-streamline-ms-clothing-brands_id108648.aspx |title=UK: Bolland review to streamline M&amp;S clothing brands?: Apparel and textile news &amp; analysis |publisher=Just-style.com |date=17 August 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 November 2010, chief executive Marc Bolland revealed plans to strengthen the company’s overall brand image and targeting sales of between £800m and £1bn for which company will increase capital expenditure to £850m to £900m over the next three years to fund the plans.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6A70V420101109 |agency=Reuters   | first=Mark | last=Potter | title=UPDATE 5-Marks &amp; Spencer's new CEO lifts investment | date=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan also involved the discontinuation of its 'Portfolio' fashion brand and the sale of electrical products. The company also announced a new marketing strapline, 'Only at M&amp;S', and that it would revamp its website.&lt;ref name="htanna"&gt;{{cite web|title=M&amp;S plans £900m capital expenditure to boost sales|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2010/11/sales-plans-1bn-operations|work=2010 plans for expansion|accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolland ordered a new store design in May 2011, and it was announced that the company would spend around £600 million between 2011 and 2014 on its UK stores, involving the launch of a range of different store formats based on the age, affluence and demographics of people in those areas. The design also included the trial of a new in-store "navigation scheme", which followed research showing that shoppers found M&amp;S store layouts confusing and "difficult to shop [in]". It also confirmed that the amount of money-off promotions and deals offered would be increased, and that it would replace the Marks &amp; Spencer label on clothing with "M&amp;S Woman" and "M&amp;S Man".&lt;ref name="telegraph2"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8534666/2bn-Marks-and-Spencer-makeover-less-than-inspiring.html | title=£2bn Marks &amp; Spencer makeover 'less than inspiring'|date=25 May 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=25 March 2012|first=James|last=Hall|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013, M&amp;S's clothing division had an 11% market share in the UK.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22605609 |title=Marks and Spencer profits fall as clothing disappoints |publisher=BBC News |date=21 May 2013 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22546823 |title=M&amp;S tries to boost sales with new clothing range |publisher=BBC News |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite news|author=Emma Simpson |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22533986 |title=M&amp;S tries to lure back shoppers with new fashion ranges |publisher=BBC News |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 saw the launch of the ''Best of British'' range as well as the overhaul of ''Per Una'' and ''Indigo''.&lt;ref name="mirror1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/city-news/marks-spencer-fashion-launch-slick-1889943 |title=Marks and Spencer fashion launch was slick but what matters is what core customers think |work=Daily Mirror |author=Hiscott, Graham |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne became the new marketing director, succeeding Steven Sharp in July. Mark Bolland also vowed to bring "quality and style back" &lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; M&amp;S also stated it intended to increase its number of UK suppliers from the 20 it had at the time.&lt;ref name="mirror1"/&gt;

In November 2013, it was revealed that Bill Adderley, founder of homeware chain [[Dunelm Group]], had amassed a £250m stake in M&amp;S over the past 18 months. This disclosure was made as stock market rules mean that any holding over 3 per cent share must be made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/business-news/business-headlines/yorkshire-retail-entrepreneur-builds-up-250m-stake-in-m-s-1-6212162|title=Yorkshire retail entrepreneur builds up £250m stake in M&amp;S|publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2016 it was announced that [[Marc Bolland]], who has been CEO since 2010 would step down on 2 April 2016, and be replaced by [[Steve Rowe (businessman)|Steve Rowe]], head of clothing, and previously head of the food business.&lt;ref name=Guardian_20160107&gt;{{cite news|last1=Butler|first1=Sarah|last2=Kollewe|first2=Julia|title=M&amp;S boss Marc Bolland to step down|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/07/ms-boss-marc-bolland-to-step-down|accessdate=7 January 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and environmental policy===

===="Look Behind the Label"====
In 2006, the ''Look Behind the Label'' marketing campaign was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/timeforpaddington/ti_news_detail.asp?newsID=63 M&amp;S launches new ‘Look behind the label' campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928024224/http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/timeforpaddington/ti_news_detail.asp?newsID=63 |date=28 September 2007 }}". Paddington Waterside Partnership – 21 February 2006 &lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this campaign was to highlight to customers the various ethical and environmentally friendly aspects of the production and sourcing methods engaged in by M&amp;S including: [[Fairtrade]] products, [[sustainable fishing]] and environmentally friendly textile dyes. All coffee and tea sold in M&amp;S stores is now Fairtrade.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foodnavigator.com/news/ng.asp?id=66333-marks-spencer-fairtrade-coffee Marks &amp; Spencer dives into ethical consumer market]" Fletcher, Anthony – 10 March 2006 – Food Navigator.com (Europe)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the company offers clothing lines made from Fairtrade cotton in selected departments.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4660410.stm M&amp;S set to launch Fairtrade range]". BBC News Online – 30 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

At Christmas, the company introduces a range of food products to support the housing charity [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://england.shelter.org.uk/howtohelp/howtohelp-682.cfm Marks &amp; Spencer raises money for Shelter this Christmas]" (dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MarksAndSpencerBirmingham.jpg|thumb|M&amp;S store on [[Birmingham]] High Street]]

On 15 January 2007, M&amp;S launched an initiative, known as "Plan A",&lt;ref name=PlanA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plana.marksandspencer.com/ |title=Plan A |publisher=Plana.marksandspencer.com |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to dramatically increase the environmental [[sustainability]] of the business within 5 years and expected to cost £200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6261939.stm |title=Business &amp;#124; M&amp;S unveils carbon-neutral target |publisher=BBC News  |date=15 January 2007 |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan covers "100 commitments over 5 years to address the key social and environmental challenges facing M&amp;S today and in the future" with the tag-line "Because there is no Plan B". The commitments span five themes: [[climate change]], [[waste]], sustainable raw materials, 'fair partnership' and health,&lt;ref name=PlanA/&gt; with the aim that, by 2012, it will:&lt;ref&gt;[http://plana.marksandspencer.com/index.php?action=PublicPillarDisplay Marks &amp; Spencer: Plan A – The Five Pillars], Marks &amp; Spencer&lt;/ref&gt;
* Become carbon neutral
* Send no waste to landfill
* Extend sustainable sourcing
* Help improve the lives of people in their supply chain
* Help customers and employees live a healthier life-style

Despite an 18% fall in the share price in January 2008, following publication of their latest [[trading statement]], the company confirmed that they would be continuing with the plan, saying that there were 'compelling commercial&amp;nbsp;— as well as moral&amp;nbsp;— reasons to do so'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206094008/http://www.hbrgreen.org/2008/03/the_hard_economics_of_green.html?cm_mmc=npv-_-listserv-_-MAR_2008-_-HBRGreen0305 The hard economics of green], [[Harvard Business Review]], [[Stuart Rose|Sir Stuart Rose]], published 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

M&amp;S introduced a reusable [[Hessian (cloth)|hessian]] bag in 2007 as part of the plan, aiming to reduce the number of plastic bags used within five years. This was followed in May 2008 by the introduction of a 5p charge for standard sized carrier bags used for food purchases (before this charge became compulsory).&lt;ref name=PlanA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7268283.stm |title=M&amp;S to charge 5p for plastic bags |publisher=BBC News  |date=28 February 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All profits from the sale of food bags originally went to the charity [[Groundwork UK]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/02/28/eaplastic128.xml "Marks and Spencer to charge for plastic bags"], By Bonnie Malkin and agencies, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (online), 28 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; M&amp;S launched the "Forever Fish" campaign in June 2011 and switched funding to that campaign to promote protection of marine wildlife in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.marksandspencer.com/page.aspx?pointerid=7337418c9e6a4eb2a97b7016192e0ee4 "Marks &amp; Spencer launches Forever Fish"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322220938/http://corporate.marksandspencer.com/page.aspx?pointerid=7337418c9e6a4eb2a97b7016192e0ee4 |date=22 March 2012 }}, Marks and Spencer Press Release, 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In becoming carbon neutral the company has committed to only use [[carbon offset]]ting as a last resort,&lt;ref&gt;[http://plana.marksandspencer.com/index.php?action=PublicAboutPlanDetailDisplay&amp;pillar_id=1&amp;cur_page=2 Marks &amp; Spencer: Plan A – The Plan – Climate change], Marks &amp; Spencer&lt;/ref&gt; restricted to cases "where it is required by government or where the technology for green air or road transport will not be available for the foreseeable future".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6262453.stm Rose goes green in pursuit of profit], [[BBC]], published 15 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A picture of M&amp;S White City branch in Westfield London 2014-01-17 17-26.jpg|thumb|M&amp;S White City in [[Westfield London]] is one of the company's largest stores.]]
The largest shop is at [[Marble Arch]], on [[Oxford Street]] in London, which has around {{convert|16000|m2}} of [[shop floor]]. The second largest is in Cheshire Oaks, [[Ellesmere Port]], which is the largest outside London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.propertyweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=36&amp;storycode=3103910&amp;c=1 |title=M&amp;S megastore for Leeds&amp;nbsp;— Property Week |publisher=Property Week|accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third largest shop is at the Gemini Retail Park in [[Warrington]]. In 1999 M&amp;S opened its shop in [[Manchester]]'s [[Exchange Square (Manchester)|Exchange Square]], which was destroyed in the [[1996 Manchester bombing]] and rebuilt. At re-opening, it was the largest M&amp;S shop with {{convert|250000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of retail space, but half was subsequently sold to [[Selfridges]], the company's second site in Manchester.  The smallest branch is an outlet located in the [[Grainger Market]] in Newcastle upon Tyne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastlegateshead.com/things-to-do/grainger-market-p433811|title=Grainger Market|publisher=Newcastle Gateshead|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M&amp;S has opened a number of stores at out of town locations since the trend to build shopping centres away from town centres became popular in the 1980s. The first was at the [[MetroCentre (shopping centre)|MetroCentre]], [[Gateshead]], [[Tyne and Wear]], which opened in 1986. Another notable example is the store at the [[Merry Hill Shopping Centre]] at [[Brierley Hill]], West Midlands. This store opened on 23 October 1990 shortly after the closure of stores in the nearby town centres of [[Dudley]] and [[West Bromwich]]; the Merry Hill store was not originally intended to replace these two town centre stores, but both the Dudley and West Bromwich stores had experienced a downturn in trade as the opening of the Merry Hill store loomed, and both stores were closed on 25 August 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120106032922/http://www.sthelens.oxon.sch.uk/Geography/Downloads/Geopress%20Factsheets/Geo%20factsheets/11%20out%20of%20town%20shopping%20centres.pdf Out Of Town Shopping Centres] Geofactsheet No. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson, Molly&amp;nbsp;— icWales.co.uk – 20 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's website has received criticism for having its prices in [[Pound sterling]] and not in euro, and for providing a search for its Irish stores through a "UK Store Finder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=COMPUTERS+IN+BUSINESS-qqqs=computersinbusiness-qqqid=37099-qqqx=1.asp |title=Sunday Business Post &amp;#124; Irish Business News |publisher=Sbpost.ie |date=2 November 2008 |accessdate=7 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625190709/http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=COMPUTERS+IN+BUSINESS-qqqs=computersinbusiness-qqqid=37099-qqqx=1.asp |archivedate=25 June 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Irish Times]]'' pointed out that M&amp;S failed to explain why the company is in a position to deliver goods ordered from its website to Brazil, Argentina, Iraq and Afghanistan but not to Ireland. M&amp;S did not comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/pricewatch/2010/0111/1224262050906.html |title=M&amp;S Vouchers |work=The Irish TImes  |date=1 January 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 2013, Marks &amp; Spencer announced "that it is set to have about 80 stores open in the region by 2016 as part of its strategy to become a leading international, multichannel retailer" with partner Reliance Retail.&lt;ref name="Marks &amp;amp; Spencer to Expand in India"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/retail-news/mass-off-price/marks-spencer-to-expand-in-india-7272370?src=nl/mornReport/20131112 | title=Marks &amp; Spencer to Expand in India | publisher=WWD | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=12 November 2013 | author=Conti,  Samantha}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened a flagship store in Bandra in Mumbai.&lt;ref name="Marks &amp;amp; Spencer to Expand in India"/&gt; M&amp;S sales of lingerie accounts for more than a fifth of the sales in the Indian market, with total lingerie sales increasing by a third during the last six months of 2013.&lt;ref name="Marks &amp;amp; Spencer to Expand in India"/&gt;  In May 2014 Marks &amp; Spencer announced that their intention was now to open 100 stores in the country by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/05/20/m-s-india-idINKBN0E00TU20140520|title=Marks &amp; Spencer plans to open 100 stores in India by 2016|work=reuters.com|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, as of 2015, M&amp;S have a supermarket in the expensive [[Kalverstraat]] shopping street in Amsterdam, as well as a larger store including clothing in [[The Hague]]. A number of [[British Petroleum|BP]] gas stations in the Western area of the Netherlands include M&amp;S [[convenience food]] stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksandspencer.eu/Our-Stores/store-finder,en_NL,pg.html |title=M&amp;S Store Finder - Netherlands |publisher=M&amp;S.eu |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, M&amp;S is due to open a much larger store in Amsterdam, with a direct underground link to a new metro station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/149435/luxe-warenhuizen-aan-rokin-krijgen-eigen-tunnel-naar-noordzuidlijn-station |title=Luxe warenhuizen aan Rokin krijgen eigen tunnel naar Noord/Zuidlijn-station |publisher=AT5.nl |date=9 November 2015 |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Store formats==

===Core shops===
[[File:Marks and Spencer.Kirkcaldy.JPG|thumb|A typical example of an un-modernised 'core' M&amp;S store, located in [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]]. However, as of 2012 the store has now been fully refurbished with the so-called "Light Touch" re-fit.]]
M&amp;S core shops typically feature a selection of the company's clothing ranges and an M&amp;S [[food hall]]. The range of clothing sold and the space given to it depends on the location and customer demographic (an example would be that some London shops do not stock the Classic Collection, but stock Limited Collection and a full Autograph range). Most core shops feature a Food hall. The current store format was designed by Urban Salon Architects in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2586665.ece |title=Marks and sparks: Shopping in the 21st century |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=27 May 2007 |accessdate=7 November 2009 |first=Paul |last=Rodgers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118145633/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2586665.ece |archivedate=18 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===M&amp;S Foodhall===
[[File:M&amp;S Food Hall, SUTTON, Surrey, Greater London.jpg|thumb|An M&amp;S Food Hall in the [[Sutton, London]] branch]]
All the '''St Michael Food hall''' supermarkets were renamed ''M&amp;S Food hall'' when Marks &amp; Spencer dropped the ''St Michael'' brand in 2000. Each M&amp;S Foodhall sells groceries, which are all under the Marks &amp; Spencer brand. However, in 2009 the company began selling a limited range of other brands, such as [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Stella Artois]], without reducing the number of M&amp;S goods they sold. This marked the first time in its 125-year history that Marks &amp; Spencer had sold any brands other than its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/950570/M-S-sell-brands-first-time-125-years/|title= M&amp;S to sell other brands for the first time in 125 years|publisher=Brand Republic|first= James|last= Quilfer|date= 4 November 2009|accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M&amp;S introduced [[self check-out]] tills in the food-halls of a small number of trial stores in 2002. Self check-out was implemented in the general merchandise sections in three trial stores in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5245/is_200209/ai_n19869452 M&amp;S to test self-scan tills]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospitality===
Many large shops, such as Lisburn Sprucefield, [[Westfield London|Westfield, White City]], Cribbs Causeway and [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], also offer other hospitality outlets, such as a modern ''Deli Bar'' (champagne, canapés, seafood), ''Restaurant'' (table service—the first of which was opened in Newcastle) ''M&amp;S Kitchen'' (traditional home cooking &amp; lunches) or ''Hot Food To Go'' (burgers, chips, soups). Many of these outlets are run in conjunction with [[Compass Group]] under franchise arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catererandhotelkeeper.co.uk/articles/19/4/2013/348189/compass-group-signs-m-s-franchise-agreement.htm|title=Compass Group signs M&amp;S franchise agreement|publisher=Caterer and Hotelkeeper|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home stores===
In 2007, M&amp;S announced that new, dedicated shops for home furnishings were to be launched. Shops have now been opened in [[Cheltenham]] in Gloucestershire, [[Tunbridge Wells]] in Kent, [[Lisburn]] Sprucefield in Northern Ireland&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retail-week.com/Stores/theres_no_place_like_home.html There is no place like home] Retail Week&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Barton Square section of [[Trafford Centre|The Trafford Centre]], Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shopping-centre.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/2591/Trafford_extends_Barton_Square_homewares_offer.html |title=Trafford extends Barton Square homewares offer |publisher=Shopping-centre.co.uk |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725092414/http://www.shopping-centre.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/2591/Trafford_extends_Barton_Square_homewares_offer.html |archivedate=25 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outlet stores===
As of 2010, M&amp;S have 50 outlet stores and growth expansion plans for future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annualreport.marksandspencer.com/about/uk-international.aspx |title=Annual Report 2009 |year=2009 |publisher=Marks &amp; Spencer |accessdate=25 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723122137/http://annualreport.marksandspencer.com/about/uk-international.aspx |archivedate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Outlet division offers M&amp;S products with the majority of them discounting at least 30% from the original selling price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.marksandspencer.com/thecompany/our_stores/outlet.shtml |title=Outlet |publisher=Marks and Spencer |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714041208/http://www2.marksandspencer.com/thecompany/our_stores/outlet.shtml |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these stores opened at [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] in Kent in 2000. Many of the Outlet shops are in locations such as retail parks and outlet centres, though some, including the shop in [[Woolwich]], South London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misterwhat.co.uk/company/146221-marks-spencer-outlet-london |title=Woolwich outlet from |publisher=MisterWhat |date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Newton Abbot]], Devon were previously main M&amp;S shops which converted to the Outlet format. Meadow Bank Outlet Store in Edinburgh became the model for all the Marks and Spencer Outlet shop in the early months of 2010.
There are now also stores which combine a mainline M&amp;S store and an Outlet store to create a store which offers both the main current full-price M&amp;S ranges and the discounted Outlet ranges: one such store is at the [[Lewisham Shopping Centre]], where the previously closed upper level of the M&amp;S store was reopened in January 2009 as an Outlet format sub-store;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewishamcentre.co.uk/stores/atozofstores/20314.aspx |title=M&amp;S Outlet on Lewisham Shopping Centre website |publisher=Lewishamcentre.co.uk |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===M&amp;S Simply Food===
[[File:Marks and Spencer, Banstead, Surrey - geograph.org.uk - 339773.jpg|thumb|M&amp;S Simply Food in [[Banstead]], Surrey]]
[[File:M&amp;S Food to Go, SUTTON, Surrey, Greater London.jpg|thumb|An M&amp;S Food to Go store in Sutton station, [[Sutton, London]]]]
M&amp;S launched a convenience format, branded ''Simply Food'' in 2001, with the first stores opening in [[Twickenham]] and [[Surbiton]]. The stores predominantly sell food but also carry a small selection of general merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finch|first1=Julia|title=Simply Food to triple in size with restaurant plan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/nov/08/marksspencer.supermarkets|accessdate=20 January 2015|work=The Guardian|date=8 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of these are run under [[franchising|franchise]] agreements:
* [[SSP Group]] runs the stores at mainline railway stations and airports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssp-intl.com/SSPInternet/Content/Brands/National.htm Select Service Partner]. Company Website&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Moto Hospitality|Moto]] has stores at 37 of its motorway service stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6136684.stm Perils of the motorway pit stops] May, Maurice&amp;nbsp;— BBC News Online – 10 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[BP]] has over 120 petrol stations with ''Simply Food'' offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bp.com/retail/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9036797&amp;contentId=7067920|title=M&amp;S Simply Food at BP Connect|accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orders from M&amp;S accounted for more than half of [[Uniq plc|Uniq]]'s food product supplies to UK retailers in 2010 after several years service as a major M&amp;S food product supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Business-News/Uniq-Brands-will-drive-footfall-at-M-S-but-not-in-the-desserts-fixture |title=Uniq: Brands will drive footfall at M&amp;S, but not in the desserts fixture |publisher=Foodmanufacture.co.uk |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 it was noted that M&amp;S were operating [[express pricing]]; i.e., charging more in their Simply Food branches than in regular branches. A spokesperson stated that "prices are a little higher than at our high street stores but this reflects the fact that these stores are open longer and are highly convenient for customers on the move".&lt;ref name="m&amp;s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confused.com/money/articles/mystery-shop-how-much-more-do-you-pay-in-m-s-simply-food#ixzz2V8aHbrYr|title=Mystery shop: How much do you pay in M&amp;S Simply Food?|publisher=[[Confused.com]]|accessdate=3 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927074743/http://www.confused.com/money/articles/mystery-shop-how-much-more-do-you-pay-in-m-s-simply-food#ixzz2V8aHbrYr|archivedate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Simply Food brand has been phased out in all stand-alone larger stores since the rebrand in 2015 and the stores have now been branded as "M&amp;S Foodhall."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/marks-spencer-open-m-s-foodhall-bath/story-28652896-detail/story.html|title=Marks &amp; Spencer to open an M&amp;S Foodhall in Bath|date=2 February 2016|work=Bath Chronicle|accessdate=21 March 2017}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online services===
Products could be ordered online since the mid-2000s, in response to [[Tesco]] launching their pioneering [[Tesco.com]] home shopping delivery service in the early 2000s. Both Tesco, M&amp;S and others are expanding rapidly into this new niche market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39743611|title=M&amp;S online food delivery service will be no piece of cake|last=Plummer|first=Robert|date=28 April 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online flower service was accused of unfair trading and using [[Google]] to piggy-back advertise on online searches aimed at [[Interflora]] online in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11531677 |publisher=BBC News  | title=Interflora sues Marks &amp; Spencer over Google ad links | date=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] shopping chain beat M&amp;S to the title of the UK's best high-street website by late 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bold |first=Ben |url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/channel/DigitalMedia/article/1035596/John-Lewis-beats-M-S-UKs-best-high-street-website/ |title=John Lewis beats M&amp;S as UK's best high-street website |work=Marketing magazine |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2013, the Republic of Ireland now handles more than 50% of online trade.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

==Product line history==
{{Main article|List of Marks &amp; Spencer brands}}
[[File:PercyPigs.jpeg|thumb|upright|Marks &amp; Spencer Percy Pigs]]
The company's ranges include clothing for men, woman and children, as well as home products and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksandspencer.com/|title=Welcome to Marks &amp; Spencer|website=www.marksandspencer.com|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these ranges, M&amp;S use a number of own brands, such as those used within its womenswear division, including Indigo Collection Junior, Indigo Collection and Portfolio. Indigo Collection is aimed at women over 30s, while Portfolio is aimed at those aged over 45. By 2010, M&amp;S had 10 sub-brands within womenswear and 6 sub-brands within menswear, following a reduction in brands.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8098977/MandS-plans-to-take-Twiggy-international.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=James | last=Hall | title=M&amp;S plans to take Twiggy international | date=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marks &amp; Spencer were selling clothes under the ''St Margaret'' and ''St Michael'' label by the mid-1950s and launched their [[school uniforms]] in the early 1950s, but would be scrapped in the early 2000s as part of the corporate modernisation plan.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

Within Marks &amp; Spencer's food ranges, it first pioneered boil-in-the-bag and sachet meals in 1972. The company also sells main meals, lunches, sweets and other savoury items. It launched its "[[Percy Pig]]s" sweets in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/high-on-the-hog-how-percy-pig-came-to-dominate-the-sweetie-market-and-win-the-nations-hearts-1989583.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=6 June 2010 | title=High on the hog: How Percy Pig came to dominate the sweetie market, and win the nation's hearts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the billionth "Percy Pig" sweet was sold by October 2007.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; M&amp;S also has an extensive wine and beer range,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksandspencer.com/Wine-Food-Wine/b/44092030?ie=UTF8&amp;intid=gnav_food-wine_wine |title=Wine : Food &amp; Wine |publisher=Marks &amp; Spencer |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first started in 1973.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; In 2006 and 2007, M&amp;S entered over a hundred of its own wines into two wine competitions, ''[[Decanter (magazine)|The Decanter World Wine Awards]]'' and the International Wine Challenge. Both years, almost every wine won an award, ranging from the 2005 Secano Pinot Noir, Leyda Valley, Chile (Best Pinot Noir in the world for under £10) to the Rosada Cava (Commended).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decanter.com/worldwineawards/2007/dwwa_search.php?rsearch=M%26S |title=Decanter World Wine Awards 2007 |publisher=Decanter.com |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

M&amp;S's relatively successful interior design 'Home' brand was launched in 2005 and featured products like vases, furniture and beds.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

The children's online only 'Living the Dream' range of [[Lewis Hamilton]] and [[Heikki Kovalainen]] memorabilia and merchandise was launched in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewishamilton.com/news/2009/09/mandslaunch09 |title=Pit-stop press!

===Per Una===
[[File:Women peruna.jpg|thumb|Per Una's logo, three hearts]]
"Per Una" was launched on 28 September 2001 as a joint venture between M&amp;S and [[Next plc|Next]] founder [[George Davies (retailer)|George Davies]] with the contribution of Julie Strang. The ''Per Una'' brand has been a major success for the company,&lt;ref name=davies&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4329412.stm |title=M&amp;S sales rise but Davies resigns |date=11 October 2005 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2004, M&amp;S bought the brand in a £125&amp;nbsp;million, two-year service contract with George Davies.&lt;ref name=per&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3715654.stm |title=M&amp;S completes Per Una purchase |date=5 October 2004 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Davies was to stay on for at least two years to run the company, with 12 months notice required if he wished to leave.&lt;ref name=davies/&gt;&lt;ref name=per/&gt;

===Old labels===
The "St Michael" brand was introduced by Simon Marks in 1928 in honour of his father and co-founder of Marks &amp; Spencer, [[Michael Marks]]. By 1950, virtually all goods were sold under the St Michael brand. M&amp;S lingerie, women's clothing and girls' uniform were branded under the ''St Margaret'' brand, until the whole range of general merchandise became St Michael.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; The synthetic fibre Tricell was first used in 1957 and lasted until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; and another synthetic fibre called Courtelle was first launched, nationally, by Marks &amp; Spencer during 1960 and also lasted well into the 1970s.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; Machine washable wool first appeared in 1972 and [[Lycra]] hosiery first came in during 1986.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

M&amp;S launched their own brands of domestic products, such as [[washing powder]] and [[aluminium foil]] in 1972, under the brand name of 'House-care'.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;
The 1996–1997 'Orient Express Tagged' brand was the first of numerous new brands, most of which were in feminine and children's clothes. The 'Orient Express Tagged' brand was part of the inspiration behind the 'Portfolio' brand.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; The men's Autograph brand was then launched in 2000&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; and continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksandspencer.com/c/men/autograph |title=Autograph |publisher=Marks &amp; Spencer |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Sir Stuart Rose axed a number of brands including the menswear brand "SP Clothing", the "View From" sportswear range, the [[David Beckham]] children's range "DB07" and several food lines as he thought the company's stock inventory management had become 'too complicated'.&lt;ref name="thisismoney.co.uk 512068"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Birnbaum |url=http://www.just-style.com/analysis/sir-stuart-hands-over-golden-baton_id108297.aspx |title=Sir Stuart hands over golden baton: Apparel and textile news &amp; analysis |publisher=Just-style.com |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of Per Una aimed at teenagers, "Per Una Due", was also discontinued, despite having launched earlier in the year, due to poor sales.&lt;ref name="thisismoney.co.uk 512068"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Craven |first=Neil |date=15 August 2010 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |title=M&amp;S clothing brands set for overhaul |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=512068&amp;in_page_id=2 |work=This is Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hayes |first=David |date=7 February 2004 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-11737114-ms-and-teenage-frills.do |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421120827/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-11737114-ms-and-teenage-frills.do |dead-url=yes |archivedate=21 April 2013 |title=M&amp;S and teenage frills |work=[[Evening Standard]] |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also began to sell branded goods like [[Kellogg's Corn Flakes]] in November 2008.&lt;ref name="top brands"/&gt; Following a review by Marc Bolland in 2011, M&amp;S confirmed it would begin to reduce the number of branded items on sale, instead offering only those that it did not have an M&amp;S alternative for.&lt;ref name="ausfoodnews.com.au"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.ausfoodnews.com.au/2010/10/19/marks-and-spencer-may-cut-sales-of-name-brands.html|title=Marks and Spencer may cut sales of name brands|publisher=Food News|date=19 October 2010|accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==

===New logo===
[[File:Marks &amp; Spencer corporate logo.svg|thumbnail|The older logo, used from 2000 to 2007]]
During the height of the company's troubles at the beginning of the 21st century, the ''St Michael'' brand used as the selling label for all M&amp;S products was discontinued in favour of ''Marks &amp; Spencer'' and a new logo in the [[Optima]] typeface was introduced and began to appear in place of ''St Michael'' on product packaging. The same logo was also applied to store fascias and carrier bags. The ''St Michael'' name was subsequently adopted as a 'quality guarantee' and appeared as the ''St Michael Quality Promise'' on the back of food products, on the side of delivery vehicles and on in-store ordering receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/674973.stm|title=M&amp;S drops St Michael|date=12 March 2000|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Your M&amp;S===
[[File:Your M&amp;S logo.svg|thumb|''Your M&amp;S'' promotional logo 2004–2014.]]
When Steve Sharp joined as marketing director in 2004, after being hired by new Chief Executive Sir Stuart Rose, he introduced a new promotional brand under the ''Your M&amp;S'' banner, with a corresponding logo.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/marks/story/0,,1804124,00.html Steve Sharp: Shy marketing whizz creating sparks at Marks]". Martinson, Jane – ''The Guardian'', 23 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-profile media campaigns===
[[File:Marks &amp; Spencer new logo.svg|thumbnail|Logo 2007-2015]]
M&amp;S has always run newspaper and/or Magazine ads since the early 1950s, but the introduction of some famous stars such as [[Twiggy]]&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6636506/Supermodel-Erin-OConnor-told-to-have-cosmetic-surgery.html |title=Supermodel Erin O’Connor told to have cosmetic surgery |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 November 2009 |accessdate=19 December 2009 | location=London | first=Urmee | last=Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2009/may/15/marks-spencer-anniversary-ad |title=Video: Watch Twiggy in Marks &amp; Spencer's 125th birthday ad |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 18 May 2009|accessdate=19 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Jason]] in various TV ads has helped raise the company's profile. Twiggy first appeared in 1967, returning later in 1995 and 2005. Anne Grierson&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; first featured in adverts during the late 1950s and most of the 1960s. In later years, [[Erin O'Connor]],&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt; [[Myleene Klass]],&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt; Tanja Nadjila, Peter Kay, [[David Beckham]],&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[Antonio Banderas]],&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[Claudia Schiffer]],&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[Helena Christensen]],&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[Tatjana Patitz]],&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[Lisa Snowdon]], [[Dannii Minogue]], [[V V Brown]] and [[Carmen Kass]] have also featured in a few ads, along with many others.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[John Sergeant (journalist)|John Sergeant]], David Jason and [[Joanna Lumley]] have either appeared in or voiced over adverts since 2008.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

The new look has been instrumental in the company's recent resurgence, particularly with the success of a new clothing campaign featuring the celebrated model, [[Twiggy]], and younger models associated with the [[Boho-chic#The influence of boho|bohemian]] styles of 2005–6, and the new TV ad campaign for its food range. These adverts have the tag-line "This is not just food, this is M&amp;S food" and feature slow motion, close-up footage of various food products, described in a sultry [[voice-over]] by [[Dervla Kirwan]], to an enticing instrumental song&amp;nbsp;— most notably Fleetwood Mac's "[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]" as well as [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s "[[Samba Pa Ti (instrumental)|Samba Pa Ti]]", [[Olly Murs]]' "[[Busy (Olly Murs song)|Busy]]", [[Groove Armada]]'s "[[At the River]]" or [[Spandau Ballet]]'s "[[True (Spandau Ballet song)|True]]". These adverts have been referred to by both fans and critics as being ''[[food porn]]'', with a number of other companies copying the idea, such as [[Aldi]] and, most recently, [[Waitrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Kollewe, Julia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/04/marksspencer |title=Food porn for every hedonist in the world |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 4 July 2008|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 TV advertising campaign drew complaints, leading to national press coverage, regarding sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/sexism-complaints-over-marks-and-spencer-christmas-ad-14566626.html |title=Sexism complaints over Marks and Spencer's Christmas ad |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, it was confirmed that Dannii Minogue would be one of the new faces of Marks &amp; Spencer. She filmed her first commercial in South Africa, which featured [[Cheryl Lynn]]'s "[[Got to Be Real]]", for their Spring campaign that aired on 24 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/24/dannii-minogue-marks-and-spencer-ad|title=Marks &amp; Spencer launches ads starring Dannii Minogue and Lisa Snowdon|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 March 2010|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dannii travelled to [[Miami]], Florida in January 2011 to shoot the commercial for M&amp;S for the 2011 Spring collection, prior to her contractual termination. In August 2011, M&amp;S announced the new faces of their campaigns would be [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]], [[Ryan Reynolds]] and [[David Gandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/Article.aspx?Id=TMG8731621 |title=David Gandy and Ryan Reynolds Join Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for M&amp;S |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 August 2011 |accessdate=22 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313062227/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/Article.aspx?Id=TMG8731621 |archivedate=13 March 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marks &amp; Spencer dropped a series of planned television adverts in the July 2011, featuring [[Twiggy]], [[Dannii Minogue]] and [[VV Brown]]  as it started its corporate image revamp. It confirmed that Twiggy, [[Lisa Snowden]] and [[Jamie Redknapp]] would return for future advertising.&lt;ref name="peacock1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8643936/MandS-drops-ad-featuring-Twiggy-Minogue-and-VV-Brown.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Louisa | last=Peacock | title=M&amp;S drops ad featuring Twiggy, Minogue and VV Brown | date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2014, M&amp;S launched the new iteration of its 'Leading Ladies' marketing campaign featuring figures including [[Emma Thompson]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Rita Ora]] and [[Baroness Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/1286622/emma-thompson-annie-lennox-rita-ora-unveiled-marks-spencer-leading-ladies/ | title = Emma Thompson, Annie Lennox and Rita Ora unveiled as Marks &amp; Spencer 'Leading Ladies' | publisher = Campaign Live | accessdate = 25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Israel===
Marks &amp; Spencer has been criticised by pro-Palestinian activists over what they claim is its past support for [[Zionism]], and for fruit trading with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boycott-israel.co.uk/business-links/133-marks-and-spencer |title=Boycott Israel Website |publisher=Boycott-israel.co.uk |date=21 September 1941 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911025551/http://www.boycott-israel.co.uk/business-links/133-marks-and-spencer |archivedate=11 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A shop in [[Brighton]] was vandalised in 2004 with pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2004/10/299453.html?c=on#c103995 Brighton Activists deface Marks and Spencer store]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company states, "We deal with politicians and officials, in government and opposition. We do not support or align ourselves to political parties and make no political donations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.marksandspencer.com/howwedobusiness/working_with_government Working with Government] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604154054/http://corporate.marksandspencer.com/howwedobusiness/working_with_government |date=4 June 2013 }} Marks &amp; Spencer&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comprehensive Spending Review===
{{see also|2010 Spending Review}}
In October 2010, chairman Sir Stuart Rose was a signatory to a controversial letter to ''The Daily Telegraph''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=18 October 2010 Comments |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/8069609/Osbornes-cuts-will-strengthen-Britains-economy-by-allowing-the-private-sector-to-generate-more-jobs.html |title=Osborne’s cuts will strengthen Britain’s economy by allowing the private sector to generate more jobs |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed that "The private sector should be more than capable of generating additional jobs to replace those lost in the public sector, and the redeployment of people to more productive activities will improve economic performance, so generating more employment opportunities", despite recent job cuts of 1,000 staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article5455026.ece M&amp;S cuts 1,000 jobs as fashion sales dive], Helen Power and Marcus Leroux, ''The Times'', 6 January 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612031348/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article5455026.ece |date=12 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted calls for a boycott of Marks &amp; Spencer and the companies represented by the other signatories to the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberalconspiracy.org/2010/10/24/why-im-boycotting-the-35-businesses-who-support-the-cuts/ |title=Why I’m boycotting the 35 businesses who support the cuts, Kate Belgrave |publisher=Liberalconspiracy.org |date=24 October 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contactless payment issues===
Some Marks &amp; Spencer customers claim that the chain's [[contactless payment]] terminals have taken money from cards other than the ones intended for payment. Contactless cards are supposed to be within about 4&amp;nbsp;cm of the front of the terminal to work. M&amp;S investigated the incident and confirmed the new system had been extensively tested and was robust. It had recently rolled out the contactless payments system, provided by Visa Europe, to 644 UK stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22545804|title=Contactless 'charging errors' at Marks and Spencer|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=12 March 2014|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim checkout-staff policy===
In December 2013, Marks &amp; Spencer announced that Muslim checkout staff in the UK could refuse to sell pork products or alcohol to customers at their till.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ms-says-muslim-staff-may-refuse-to-serve-customers-pork-and-alcohol-9020982.html |title=M&amp;S says Muslim staff may refuse to serve customers pork and alcohol |work=The Independent |date=22 December 2013 |accessdate=22 December 2013 |location=London |first1=Adam |last1=Withnall |first2=Alex |last2=Delmar-Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was announced after at least one news outlet reported that customers waiting with goods that included pork or alcohol were refused service, and were told by a Muslim checkout worker to wait until another till became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10532782/Muslim-staff-at-Marks-and-Spencer-can-refuse-to-sell-alcohol-and-pork.html |title=Muslim staff at Marks &amp; Spencer can refuse to sell alcohol and pork |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=21 December 2013 |accessdate=22 December 2013 |location=London |first=Robert |last=Mendick}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy applied across all 703 UK M&amp;S stores and prompted a strong backlash by customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=M&amp;S faces furious backlash from customers over Muslim policy |url=http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/m-faces-furious-backlash-customers-174843463.html |work=Yahoo News |date=22 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103021213/https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/m-faces-furious-backlash-customers-174843463.html |archivedate=3 January 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A company spokesman subsequently apologised and stated that they will attempt to reassign staff whose beliefs may impact their work to different departments, such as clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bbc.co.uk/news/business-25488259 |title=M&amp;S apology over Muslim alcohol refusal |work=BBC News |date=22 December 2013 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hijab as school uniform ===
Marks &amp; Spencer introduced a hijab in its section of school uniforms in late 2018 and subsequently faced backlash and boycott from customers; the product is stocked for girls as young as three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/ms-started-selling-hijabs-its-15268756|title=M&amp;S has started selling hijabs made for children as young as three|last=Hodgson|first=Sarah|date=2018-10-12|work=northwales|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matteo Bandello.jpg|thumb|right|Matteo Bandello]]
'''Matteo Bandello''' ({{lang-fr|Mathieu Bandel}}; {{circa}} 1480 &amp;ndash; 1562) was an Italian writer, soldier, monk, and later, a Bishop mostly known for his novellas.

==Biography==

[[File:Castel Goffredo Palazzo Gonzaga-Acerbi.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Castel Goffredo]], palace Gonzaga-Acerbi.]]
Matteo Bandello was born at [[Castelnuovo Scrivia]], near [[Tortona]] (current [[Piedmont]]), {{circa}} 1480. He received a good education, and entered the church, but does not seem to have been very interested in [[theology]]. For many years he lived at [[Mantua]] and [[Castel Goffredo]], and superintended the education of the celebrated [[Lucrezia Gonzaga]], in whose honour he composed a long poem. The decisive [[Battle of Pavia]], as a result of which [[Lombardy]] was taken by the emperor, compelled Bandello to flee; his house at [[Milan]] was burnt and his property confiscated. He took refuge with [[Cesare Fregoso]], an Italian general in the French service, whom he accompanied into France.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

He was later raised to the [[bishopric of Agen]], a town in which he resided for many years before his death in 1562. Bandello wrote a number of poems, but his fame rests entirely on his extensive collection of Novelle, or tales (1554, 1573), which have been extremely popular. They belong to the same genre as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]’s ''[[Decameron]]'' and [[Marguerite de Navarre]]’s ''[[Heptameron]]''. The common origin of them all is to be found in the old French ''[[fabliaux]]''{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, though some well-known tales are evidently Eastern, and others classical. Bandello’s novellas are thought the best of those written in imitation of the Decameron, though Italian critics find fault with them for negligence and inelegance of style.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

The stories on which [[William Shakespeare]] based several of his plays (''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' in particular)&lt;ref name="SHEMEK"/&gt; were supplied by Bandello, probably through [[Francois de Belleforest|Belleforest]] and [[Pierre Boaistuau]] whose stories were later translated into English by [[William Painter (author)|William Paynter]] and included in his ''The Palace of Pleasure''. Another of his stories includes "The countess of Cellant", a distortion of Challand, a northwest region of Italy.

==English translations of novellas==
The only nearly complete translation of Bandello's tales into English is "The novels of Matteo Bandello", translated by [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]] in 6 volumes, 1890.&lt;ref name="PAYNE"/&gt; This edition is separated into 4 parts, containing 51, 43, 51, and 21 stories, respectively, for a total of 166, minus two (part 2, story 35 and part 4, story 6), omitted because of their being almost identical to those of Marguerite the Navarre's Heptameron (stories 30 and 17), respectively, though keeping Bandello's dedicatory preface.

The Payne translation is a mixture of 19th and 16th century idioms. Examples of the latter include "an thou wilt" instead of "if you will", "wheneas" instead of "when", "methinketh" instead of "I think", "parlous" instead of "perilous". On most occasions, the language is clear and of fine literary value, but sometimes it is degraded with terms no one ever spoke or wrote. For example, instead of saying "Now I would gladly hear your advice on this matter", the duchess of Amalfi says: "Now I would fain hear from thee that which thou counsellest thereanent."

There is a second book of Bandello in an English translation by Percy Pinkerton and containing twelve tales.&lt;ref name="PINKERTON"/&gt; This translation uses a more modern mode of expression.

==Source material==
The vast majority of the stories derive from those Bandello heard from contemporaries, reported as real life events. Far more rarely, some stories are based on literary or historical sources, such as book 5 of Dante's Purgatory (part 1, story 11), the Lucretia and Tarquin episode in Livy's History of Rome (part 2, story 15), story #23 of the Heptameron (part 2, story 17), and Francesco Petrarch's Triumph of Love from ''[[Triumphs]]'' (part 2, story 41). Some derive from English history, such as the chronicle of Mary Douglas, niece to King Henry VIII of England (part 3, story 44) and Henry VIII's six wives (part 3, story 45), some from Spanish history, such as Alfonso X (part 4, story 10). All of them were told to him by men, but a minority of dedicatory prefaces are offered to women. Bandello writes that the dedicatory prefaces to the nobility or to worthy persons are useful to him as a shield in case someone becomes offended by one of the stories and is tempted to attack him (part 2, story 32). He shows psychological insight into jealousy, in particular the description of two types of jealous men, the first from feelings of inadequacy and the second from feelings of the fickleness of women (part 3, story 47).

The most striking stories include two whores seeking to win their husbands back (part 1, story 17), two brother thieves in cahoots to rob the treasures of the king of Egypt (part 1, story 23), a disdained lover voluntarily choosing to live inside a cave (part 1, story 25), a woman killing herself only out of fear that her good fortune will turn bad (part 1, story 48), [[Filippo Lippi]], released from slavery in Africa because of his talent as a celebrated painter (part 1, story 50), a woman disdaining a man and then killing herself when he no longer pursues her (part 2, story 16), an abbot making music from a chorus of pigs (part 2, story 23), an adulterous lover buried alive and then saved (part 3, story 1), a merchant's murder of another (part 4, story 1), a case of double adultery whereby each husband cuckolds the other (part 4, story 11), and two women yelling at each other after being falsely told they are hard of hearing (part 4, story 21).

==Plays by Shakespeare==
Four Bandello stories were adapted by Shakespeare, including ''[[Cymbeline]]'' (part 1, story 19), the Claudio subplot of ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' (part 1, story 20), ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (part 2, story 6), and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (part 2, story 28), plus one from the [[Shakespeare Apocrypha]], ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'' (part 2, story 29).

==Plays by others==
Bandello stories have also been adapted by other dramatists, including [[John Webster]], ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'' (part 1, story 24), [[Philip Massinger]], ''[[The Picture (Massinger play)|The Picture]]'' (part 1, story 19), the same source as that of Cymbeline, [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]] and [[Jean Mairet]], ''[[Sophonisba]]'' (part 1, story 35), [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], ''[[The Maid's Tragedy|The Maid in the Inn]]'' (part 2, story 11), the anonymous 17th century French author of ''[[The Cruel Moor]]'' (1618) (part 3, story 17), [[Giuseppe Giacosa]], ''La Signora di Challant'', ''[[The Lady of Challand]]'' (part 1, story 4) and [[Lope de Vega]], ''Castelvines y Monteses'' (published in 1647 and written between 1604 and 1618).

'''Michael Clark''' (born 1 April 1954) is a contemporary British artist. His work spans a broad range of media including painting, drawing, sculpture, film, photography, installation, video, performance and artist's books. Clark was born in Manchester and lives and works in London.

== Life and work ==
In 1977 Clark met [[Muriel Belcher]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] in [[The Colony Room]] club in Soho.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p030kfnc|title='When Bacon is in your bloodstream he never leaves you', 24 August 2015, Today - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark's portrait of Belcher on her deathbed (''Muriel Belcher Ill in bed'') was part of the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1981, and won the Charles Wollaston Award. At the suggestion of Valerie Beston, of [[Marlborough Fine Art]], Clark made the first of a series of portraits of Bacon, one of which is in the [[British Museum]]'s collection. "Michael Clark's portraits of Bacon emphasise the sad preoccupation of his sagging face, with eyes deep in concussed hollows grimly contemplating mortality".&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/10/art|title=The power and the passion|author=Peter Conrad|date=10 August 2008|work=The Observer|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vanitas'' (1990-1992), Clark's double-sided portrait of [[Lisa Stansfield]], was part of ''[[The Portrait Now]]''  exhibition held from 1993–1994 at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]. "Both the theme of the wound and the title 'Vanitas' make references to mortality. Clark was partly inspired by a Renaissance painting — also double-sided — by [[Barthel Bruyn the Elder]]."&lt;ref name=CHowse&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/13th-november-1993/40/arts|title=Beautiful Wounds|author= Christopher Howse|date=13 November 1993|work=The Spectator|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, Clark's ''Five Wounds''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.tooveys.com/2013/12/francis-bacon/|title=Flesh and Bones Unites Oxford and Chichester – Toovey’s Blog|website=blog.tooveys.com|language=en-GB|access-date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been on permanent display at [[Chichester Cathedral]], alongside works by [[Graham Sutherland]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] and [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;blockquote&gt;"In some the glaze is so heavy that their raised and gleaming beads of crimson appear to flow. In others pieces of yellow 'bone' seem to rise beneath the skin. Any initial revulsion soon gives way to enchantment. [...] In the Wounds the viewer comes face to face with the very real nature of Christ's suffering and consequently with our own mortality. 'These works are forms to meditate upon' explains the artist. 'A trigger-release mechanism; a way of opening up.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/art-the-word-made-flesh-michael-clarks-paintings-of-wounds-are-now-on-display-at-chichester-1432388.html|title=The word made flesh: Michael Clark's paintings of wounds are now on display at Chichester Cathedral.

The drawing has a distinct and immediate impact, foregrounding as it does the quality of personal courage of the sitter. You are powerfully drawn to the face, you have a sense that the sitter trusted the artist to see into the eyes, to do much more than observe …”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://colourchroma.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/for-derek/|title=For Derek|date=31 January 2012|work=Colour/ "Chroma"|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After purchasing ''Seer'' (1993), a [[grisaille]] portrait of Derek Jarman, in 1995,&lt;ref name="SeerNPG"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw09524/Derek-Jarman-Seer?LinkID=mp08170&amp;role=art&amp;rNo=0|title=Derek Jarman ('Seer')|author=National Portrait Gallery|website=www.npg.org.uk|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Portrait Gallery commissioned Clark, in 1999, to make a portrait of the filmmaker [[Nicolas Roeg]]. Clark delivered ''Al-Jebr'', a kinetic assemblage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/explore/glossary-of-art-terms/assemblage|title=Assemblage|last=Glossary of art terms|first=|date=|website=National Portrait Gallery|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; made of mixed media portraying Roeg, which in Arabic means 'the bringing together of broken parts'.&lt;ref name="RoegNPG"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw12329/Nicholas-Roeg-al-jebr|title=Nicholas Roeg ('al-jebr')|author=National Portrait Gallery|website=www.npg.org.uk|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art collection of Valerie Beston was sold at [[Christie's]] in February 2006 and included ten works by Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/jan/29/art1|title=Harriet Lane reveals passions beneath calm exterior of Miss Valerie Beston, Francis Bacon's trusted gallery administrator|author=Harriet Lane|date=29 January 2006|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying catalogue stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Bacon’s influence threads through his [Clark's] works, reappearing even in his conceptual pieces. Be it in the appearance of wounds in his paintings, or in the location of a ‘sound sculpture’ outside a sex shop that Bacon used to frequent (only in part to cash his cheques), his ghostly spectre appears again and again, if only obliquely, in his figurative and conceptual works. For Clark is not a portraitist, although he has created many portraits of people ranging from film directors to the characters of [[Soho]] of yesterday to Royalty to Pop royalty. He is a conceptual artist, for whom the painstakingly accurate depiction of the human face is only one of his means or media, and conversation with him ranges from the diverse influences of [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Bruce Nauman|Nauman]] as well as [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]] and [[Rembrandt]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Christie's International Media Division|date=February 2006|title=The Collection of The Late Miss Valerie Beston: Artists from the London School|journal=Auction Catalogue|volume=|pages=72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his book, ''Francis Bacon in Your Blood,'' art historian [[Michael Peppiatt]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A feature article&lt;ref name="Conrad"/&gt; came out a while ago in the ''Observer'' in which the author, [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]], interviewed three men who had been close to Francis Bacon in their youth. He described each of them as having been 'burnt' for life by their contact with the painter. The implication was that you did not survive the influence of a genius as dark and powerful as Bacon. The three men were the photographer [[Peter Beard]], the artist Michael Clark, and myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NlJFCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT7&amp;lpg=PT7&amp;dq=francis+bacon+in+your+blood+francis+bacon+michael+clark&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tXzOQxChg&amp;sig=91xuEJowZpSMBqEHaTjFAbS0gP8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwit0oKnls7ZAhUsIcAKHaPMA7QQ6AEwD3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=francis%20bacon%20in%20your%20blood%20francis%20bacon%20michael%20clark&amp;f=false|title=Francis Bacon in Your Blood|author=Michael Peppiatt|first=Michael|publisher=Bloomsbury Circus|year=2015|isbn=1408856247|location=UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Winfrey started the book club in 1996, selecting a new book, usually a [[novel]], for viewers to read and discuss each month.&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt; The club ended its 15-year run, along with the ''Oprah Winfrey Show'', on May 25, 2011.&lt;ref name=minzesheimer&gt;Bob Minzesheimer, [https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-05-22-Oprah-Winfrey-Book-Club_n.htm "How the 'Oprah Effect' changed publishing"], ''USA Today'', May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flamm&gt;Matthew Flamm, [http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110520/FREE/110529985/1072 "Publishers say farewell to Oprah Book Club boon"], ''Crain's New York Business'', May 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kellogg/&gt; In total the club recommended 70 books during its 15 years.

Due to the book club's widespread popularity, many obscure titles have become very popular [[bestseller]]s, increasing sales in some cases by as many as several million copies.&lt;ref name="oprah effect"&gt;{{cite news | last =Wyatt | first =Edward | coauthors = | title = Tolstoy's Translators Experience Oprah's Effect | work = | pages = | newspaper =The New York Times | date =June 7, 2004 | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E6D81131F934A35755C0A9629C8B63 | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Greco, a Fordham University marketing professor, estimated the total sales of the 69 "Oprah editions" at over 55 million copies.&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt;

The club has seen several literary controversies, such as [[Jonathan Franzen]]'s public dissatisfaction with his novel ''[[The Corrections]]'' having been chosen by Winfrey,&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt; and the now infamous incident of [[James Frey]]'s memoir, ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'', a 2005 selection, being outed as almost entirety fabricated.&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt; The latter controversy resulted in Frey and publisher [[Nan Talese]] being confronted and publicly shamed by Winfrey in a highly praised live televised episode of Winfrey's show.&lt;ref name="truthiness"&gt;{{cite news | last =Carr | first =David | coauthors = | title =How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness | work = | pages = | newspaper =The New York Times | date =January 30, 2006 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html?ex=1296277200&amp;en=1c0e8843da5b43d6&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, June 1, 2012, Oprah announced the launch of [[Oprah's Book Club 2.0]] with ''Wild'' by [[Cheryl Strayed]]. The new version of Oprah's Book Club, a joint project between OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network and ''O: The Oprah Winfrey Magazine'', will incorporate the use of various social media platforms and e-readers.

==History==
The book club's first selection on September 17, 1996, was the then recently published novel ''[[The Deep End of the Ocean]]'' by [[Jacquelyn Mitchard]].&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt; Winfrey discontinued the book club for one year in 2002, stating that she could not keep up with the required reading while still searching for contemporary novels that she enjoyed.&lt;ref name="turns page"&gt;{{cite news | last =Lacayo | first =Richard | coauthors = | title =Oprah Turns the Page | pages = | work =Time Magazine | date =April 7, 2002 | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002228,00.html | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After its revival in 2003, books were selected on a more limited basis (three or four a year)

Winfrey returned to fiction with her 2007 selections of ''[[The Road]]'' by [[Cormac McCarthy]] in March and ''[[Middlesex (novel)|Middlesex]]'' by [[Jeffrey Eugenides]] in June.  Shortly after its being chosen, ''The Road'' was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]].  Winfrey conducted the first ever television interview with McCarthy, a famously reclusive author, on June 5, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahsbookclub/road/road_book_synopsis/1 |title=Readers' Guide to The Road by Cormac McCarthy |publisher=Oprah.com |date=March 28, 2007 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2007, the latest selection was announced as ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'', a 1985 novel by Nobel Prize laureate [[Gabriel García Márquez]], greatly furthering not only the influence of the author in North America, but that of his translator [[Edith Grossman]].  Another work by Márquez, ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', was a previous selection for the book club in 2004.&lt;ref name="marquez"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Oprah Winfrey chooses Garcia Marquez's 'Love in the Time of Cholera' as next book club pick | work = | pages = | publisher =The International Herald Tribune | date =October 5, 2007 | url =http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/05/arts/NA-A-E-BKS-US-Winfreys-Book-Club.php | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last club selection was a special edition of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and ''[[Great Expectations]]''.&lt;ref name=kellogg&gt;Carolyn Kellogg, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/books/la-ca-oprah-books-20110522,0,193254.story "Oprah's Book Club: She spoke, we read"], ''Los Angeles Times'', May 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It had disappointingly low sales figures.&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt;

==Influence==
In ''Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America'', [[Kathleen Rooney]] describes Winfrey as "a serious American [[intellectual]] who pioneered the use of electronic media, specifically [[television]] and the [[Internet]], to take reading&amp;mdash;a decidedly non-technological and highly individual act&amp;mdash;and highlight its social elements and uses in such a way to motivate millions of erstwhile non-readers to pick up books."

''[[Business Week]]'' stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the Oprah phenomenon is how outsized her power is compared with that of other market movers. Some observers suggest that [[Jon Stewart]] of [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'' could be No. 2. Other proven arm-twisters include [[Fox News]]'s [[Sean Hannity]], [[National Public Radio]]'s [[Terry Gross]], [[radio]] personality [[Don Imus]], and [[CBS]]' ''[[60 Minutes]]''. But no one comes close to Oprah's clout: Publishers estimate that her power to sell a book is anywhere from 20 to 100 times that of any other media personality.&lt;ref name="wallet"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Why Oprah Opens Readers' Wallet | work = | pages = | publisher =Business Week | date =October 10, 2005 | url =http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_41/b3954059.htm | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009 it was reported that the influence of Winfrey's book club had even spread to [[Brazil]] with picks like [[A New Earth]] dominating Brazil's best-seller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=87978 |title=Oprah’s Favorite Authors Dominate Bestseller Lists In Brazil |publisher=Webwire.com |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club generated so much success for some books that they went on to be adapted into films.  This subset includes ''[[The Deep End of the Ocean]]'' and ''[[The Reader]]''.

At the show's conclusion in May 2011, [[Nielsen BookScan]] created a list of the top-10 bestsellers from the club's final 10 years (prior data was unavailable).&lt;ref name=flamm/&gt; The top four with sales figures as of May 2011:&lt;ref&gt;Jason Boog.

In a 2014 paper by economist [[Craig L. Garthwaite]] published in ''[[American Economic Journal: Applied Economics]]'', it was reported that while the book club increased sales of individual titles in the list, it caused a short-term overall decrease in sales for the book industry as a whole after each selection was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Demand Spillovers, Combative Advertising, and Celebrity Endorsements |journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics |author1=Garthwaite, Craig L. |date=April 2014 |volume=6 |number=2 |doi=10.1257/app.6.2.76 |url=http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/app.6.2.76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig L. Garthwaite (2012). [http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/garthwaite/htm/research.htm "You Get a Book! And You Get A Book: Demand Spillovers, Combative Advertising, and Celebrity Endorsements"]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Oprah's selections were longer and more difficult classics that demanded greater time and energy to read, those people who were reading Oprah's books were not buying their usual fare of genre books, "there were statistically significant decreases for mysteries and action/adventure novels. Romances also saw a sales decline," following an Oprah endorsement. In the 12 weeks following an endorsement, "weekly adult fiction book sales decreased by a statistically significant 2.5 percent."&lt;ref name=drum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/03/unintended-consequences-oprahs-book-clubs|title=The Unintended Consequences of Oprah's Book Club|date=Mar 1, 2012|accessdate=Mar 1, 2012|author=Kevin Drum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The club has received critical commentaries from the literary community. 

[[Scott Stossel]], an editor at ''[[The Atlantic]]'', wrote:
:"There is something so relentlessly ''therapeutic'', so consciously ''self-improving'' about the book club that it seems antithetical to discussions of serious literature. Literature should disturb the mind and derange the senses; it can be palliative, but it is not meant to be the easy, soothing one that Oprah would make it."&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt;

==Controversies==
=== Jonathan Franzen ===
[[Jonathan Franzen]] felt conflicted about his book ''[[The Corrections]]'' being chosen as a book club selection. After the announcement was made, he expressed distaste with being in the company of other Oprah's Book Club authors, saying in an interview that Winfrey had "picked some good books, but she's picked enough schmaltzy, one-dimensional ones that I cringe, myself, even though I think she's really smart and she's really fighting the good fight."&lt;ref name="franzen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/authors/franzen.html%20Powells.com |title= Jonathan Franzen Uncorrected  |accessdate=October 5, 2007 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franzen added that his novel was a "hard book for that audience."&lt;ref name="people1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schindehette |first=Susan |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20135698,00.html |title=Novel Approach - Feuds, The Corrections, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jonathan Franzen, Oprah Winfrey |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Franzen also felt conflicted about being selected by Winfrey because he was hoping to attract a male audience.&lt;ref name="mobylives1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobylives.com/Oprah_v_Franzen.html |title=Too Cool for Oprah |publisher=Mobylives.com |date=October 26, 2001 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the criticism Franzen was uninvited from the televised book club dinner, and he apologized profusely.&lt;ref name="mediabistro1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/reading/books/0374100128/ |title=Content: Reading Room |publisher=mediabistro |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Franzen was not invited back, he suggested that perhaps he and Winfrey could still have dinner but not on TV, but Winfrey was all booked up, and her spokesperson said she was moving on.&lt;ref name="people1"/&gt;

Other writers were critical of Franzen. Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', author [[Verlyn Klinkenborg]] suggested that "lurking behind Mr. Franzen's rejection of Ms. Winfrey is an elemental distrust of readers, except for the ones he designates."&lt;ref name=Klinkenborg-NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Klinkenborg|first=Verlyn|title=The Not-Yet-Ready-for-Prime-Time Novelist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/opinion/editorial-observer-the-not-yet-ready-for-prime-time-novelist.html|accessdate= July 4, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andre Dubus III]] wrote that, "It is so elitist it offends me deeply. The assumption that high art is not for the masses, that they won't understand it and they don't deserve it – I find that reprehensible. Is that a judgment on the audience? Or on the books in whose company he would be?" &lt;ref name="mediabistro1"/&gt; Editor Dennis Loy Johnson questioned Franzen's motivations, asking, "Is it misogyny, do you think, or class prejudice, or worse?"&lt;ref name="mobylives1"/&gt;

In 2010, Oprah chose another of Franzen's books, ''[[Freedom (Franzen novel)|Freedom]]'', for her book club.  She says that after she read a copy of the book Franzen had sent her with a note, she called the author and gained his permission.&lt;ref name=announce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprahs-Book-Club-Announcement-Video |title=Oprah's Book Club Announcement - Video |publisher=Oprah.com |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oprah said "we have a little history this author and I", but called the book "a masterpiece", and according to an article in the ''Los Angeles Times'', she "seems to have forgiven the bestselling author after their 2001 kerfuffle".&lt;ref name=announce/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-0918-franzen-oprah-20100918,0,245001,print.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Carolyn | last=Kellogg | date=September 18, 2010 | title=Oprah's book club christens Franzen's 'Freedom'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== James Frey ===

In late 2005 and early 2006, Oprah's Book Club was again embroiled in controversy. Winfrey selected [[James Frey]]'s ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' for the September 2005 selection. ''Pieces'' is a book billed as a [[memoir]]&amp;mdash;a true account of Frey's life as an [[alcoholic]], [[drug addict]], and criminal. It became the Book Club's greatest selling book up to that point, and many readers spoke of how the account helped free them from drugs as well. But the additional attention focused on Frey's memoir soon led to critics questioning the validity of Frey's supposedly true account, especially regarding his treatment while in a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] facility and his stories of time spent in [[Prison|jail]]. Initially, Frey convinced [[Larry King]] that the embellishments in his book were of a sort that could be found in any literary memoir; Winfrey encouraged debate about how creative non-fiction should be classified, and cited the inspirational impact Frey's work had had on so many of her viewers. But as more accusations against the book surfaced, Winfrey invited Frey on the show to find out directly from him whether he had lied to her and her viewers. During a heated live televised debate, Winfrey forced Frey to admit that he had indeed lied about spending time in jail, and that he had no idea whether he had two [[root canal]]s without painkillers or not, despite devoting several pages to describing them in excruciating detail. Winfrey then brought out Frey's publisher [[Nan Talese]] to defend her decision to classify the book as a memoir, and forced Talese to admit that she had done nothing to check the book's veracity, despite the fact that her representatives had assured Winfrey's staff that the book was indeed non-fiction and described it as "brutally honest" in a press release.

The media feasted over the televised showdown. [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] of the ''New York Times'' wrote: "Both Mr. Frey and Ms. Talese were snapped in two like dry winter twigs."&lt;ref name="truthiness"/&gt; "Oprah annihilates Frey," proclaimed Larry King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/01/lkl.01.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=May 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'' columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] wrote, "It was a huge relief, after our long national slide into untruth and no consequences, into [[Swift boating]] and swift bucks, into [[George W. Bush|W]].'s delusion and denial, to see the Empress of Empathy icily hold someone accountable for lying,"&lt;ref name="bunk"&gt;{{cite news | last =Dowd | first =Maureen | coauthors = | title =Oprah's Bunk Club | work = | pages = | publisher =The New York Times | date =January 8, 2006 | url =http://homepage.mac.com/imfalse/chapel_annex/oprahs_bunk_club.html | accessdate =October 5, 2007 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070912140931/http://homepage.mac.com/imfalse/chapel_annex/oprahs_bunk_club.html | archivedate =September 12, 2007 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Washington Post]]'''s [[Richard Cohen (Washington Post columnist)|Richard Cohen]] was so impressed by the confrontation that he crowned Winfrey "[[Mensch]] of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Poniewozik  | first =James | coauthors = | title =Oprah Clarifies Her Position: Truth, Good.

'''Osman Hamdi Bey''' (30 December 1842{{spaced ndash}}24 February 1910) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administrator, intellectual, art expert and also a prominent and pioneering painter. He was also an accomplished [[archaeologist]], and is regarded as the pioneer of the [[curator|museum curator]]'s profession in [[Turkey]]. He was the founder of [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]] and of ''Istanbul Academy of Fine Arts'' ([[:tr:Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi|Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi]] in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), known today as the [[Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts]].

==Early life==
Osman Hamdi was the son of [[Ibrahim Edhem Pasha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Shaw, Wendy M. K. |title= Possessors and possessed: museums, archaeology, and the visualization of history in the late Ottoman Empire |publisher= University of California Press |year= |page= 2003 |isbn= 0-520-23335-2 |quote=(Osman Hamdi)…His father, Ibrahim Edhem, was born in the Greek Orthodox village of Sakiz. After being captured as a prisoner of war during a village revolt, he was sold as a slave to the chief naval officer, Kaptan-ı Derya Hüsrev Pasha, the head of the Ottoman Navy, who would also soon serve as vizier to the sultan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Grand Vizier]] (in office 1877–1878, replacing [[Midhat Pasha]]) who was originally a [[Greeks|Greek]] boy from the Ottoman island of [[Sanjak of Sakız|Sakız]] ([[Chios]]) orphaned at a very young age&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Shankland, David |title= Archaeology, anthropology, and heritage in the Balkans and Anatolia: the life and times of F.W.

[[File:Osman hamdi genclik.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Osman Hamdi in his youth]]

Osman Hamdi went to primary school in the popular [[Istanbul]] quarter of [[Beşiktaş]];&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol.7, Edited by Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; "''Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire...''".&lt;/ref&gt; after which he studied Law, first in Istanbul (1856) and then in [[Paris]] (1860). However, he decided to pursue his interest in painting instead, left the Law program, and trained under [[France|French]] [[orientalism|orientalist]] painters [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Gustave Boulanger]].&lt;ref&gt;Wendy M.K. Shaw, Possessors and Possessed: Museums, Archaeology, and visualisation of history in the late Ottoman Empire. University of California Press 2003, p. 98 {{ISBN|0-520-23335-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his nine-year stay in Paris, the international capital of fine arts at the time, he showed a keen interest for the artistic events of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom J. and Blair, S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009 Vol. 3, p.361&lt;/ref&gt;

His stay in Paris was also marked by the first ever visit by an [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman sultan]] to [[Western Europe]], when [[Abdülaziz|Sultan Abdülaziz]] was invited to the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)]] by [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]]. He also met many of the [[Young Ottomans]] in Paris, and even though he was exposed to their liberal ideas, he did not participate in their political activities, being the son of an Ottoman [[pasha]] who was loyal to the [[sultan]] and did not challenge the old [[absolute monarchy|absolutist system]]. Osman Hamdi Bey also met his first wife Marie, a French woman, in Paris when he was a student. After receiving his father's blessings, she accompanied him to Istanbul (Constantinople) when he returned in 1869, where the two got married and had two daughters.

Once back in Turkey, he was sent to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province of [[Baghdad]] as part of the administrative team of [[Midhat Pasha]] (the leading political figure and reformer among the [[Young Ottomans]] who enacted the [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Ottoman Constitution]] in 1876, Midhat Pasha served as the [[Grand Vizier]] between [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers|1876–1877]], before being replaced by İbrahim Edhem Pasha, Osman Hamdi Bey's father.)&lt;ref name="W. Shaw, p. 98"&gt;W. Shaw, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, Osman Hamdi returned to Istanbul, as the vice-director of the Protocol Office of the Palace. During the 1870s, he worked on several assignments in the upper echelons of the Ottoman bureaucracy.

==Career==
{{double image|right|Eşi Naile Hanım - Osman Hamdi.jpg|109|Osman Hamdi Bey - Naile Hanım Portresi , Portrait of Naile Hanım - Google Art Project.jpg|120|Two portraits by Osman Hamdi Bey of his second wife Marie, who later took the name Naile Hanım.&lt;ref name=Posta&gt;[http://www.posta.com.tr/pazarpostasi/HaberDetay/Asik-oldugu-iki-kadinin-adi-da-Marie-ydi---.htm?ArticleID=46171 "Aşık olduğu iki kadının adı da Marie'ydi..."], Posta.com.tr, 11 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of his first wife was also Marie, and both of them were [[France|French]].&lt;ref name=Posta/&gt; From his first wife Marie, whom he met in [[Paris]], he had two daughters named Fatma and Hayriye.&lt;ref name=Posta/&gt; From his second wife Marie (Naile Hanım), whom he met in [[Vienna]], he had three daughters named Melek, Leyla and Nazlı, and one son named Edhem.&lt;ref name=Posta/&gt;|}}

Osman Hamdi exhibited three paintings at the [[International Exposition (1867)|1867 Paris Exposition Universelle]].&lt;ref name="W. Shaw, p. 98"/&gt; None seem to have survived today, but their titles were ''Repose of the Gypsies'', ''Black Sea Soldier Lying in Wait'', and ''Death of the Soldier''.
An important step in his career was his assignment as the director of the Imperial Museum (Müze-i Hümayun) in 1881. He used his position as museum director to develop the museum and rewrite the antiquities laws and to create nationally sponsored archaeological expeditions. In 1882, he instituted and became director of the [[Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University|Academy of Fine Arts]], which provided Ottomans with training in aesthetics and artistic techniques without leaving the empire.&lt;ref&gt;W. Shaw, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, he oversaw the promulgation of a Regulation prohibiting historical artifacts from being smuggled abroad ''(Asar-ı Atîka Nizamnamesi)'', a giant step in constituting a legal framework of preservation of the antiquities. Representatives or middlemen of 19th-century European Powers routinely smuggled artifacts with historical value from within the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire (which then comprised the geographies of [[ancient Greek]] and [[Mesopotamian]] civilizations, among others), often resorting to shadily obtained licenses or bribes, to enrich museums in European capitals.

He conducted the first scientific based archaeological researches done by a Turkish team. His digs included sites as varied as the [[Commagene]] tomb-sanctuary in [[Nemrut Dağı]] in southeastern [[Anatolia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://1886.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr/items/show/76325|title=Le Tumulus de Nemroud-Dagh : voyage, description, inscriptions ... {{!}} 1886 - Collections patrimoniales numérisées de Bordeaux Montaigne|website=1886.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a top tourist's venue in Turkey and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] today, within the [[Adıyaman Province]]), the [[Hekate]] [[sanctuary]] in [[Lagina]] in southwestern Anatolia (much less visited, and within the [[Muğla Province]] today), and [[Sidon]] in [[Lebanon]]. The [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] he discovered in Sidon (including the one known as the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]], although this sarcophagus is thought to contain the remains of either [[Abdalonymus]], King of [[Sidon]]; or [[Mazaeus]], a Persian noble who was also the governor of [[Babylon]]) are considered among the worldwide jewels of archaeological findings. To lodge these, he started building what is today the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]] in 1881. The museum officially opened in 1891 under his directorship.

Throughout his professional career as museum and academy director, Osman Hamdi continued to paint in the style of his teachers, Gérôme and Boulanger.

==''The Tortoise Trainer''==
His 1906 painting, ''[[The Tortoise Trainer]]'', broke a record in Turkey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/osman-hamdis-lost-masterpiece-in-auction-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=65652&amp;NewsCatID=385|title=Osman Hamdi’s 'lost' masterpiece in auction|access-date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by being sold for the amount of 3.5 million [[dollars]] in December 2004. The painting expresses a sarcastic [[innuendo]] on the painter's own view of his style of work compared to those of his collaborators and apprentices, and is also a reference to the historical fact of tortoises having been employed for illuminative and decorative purposes, by placing candles on the shell, in evening outings during the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]] in the early 18th century. The painting was acquired by the Suna and İnan Kıraç Foundation and is currently on display at the [[Pera Museum]] in [[İstanbul]], which was established by this foundation.

Modern researchers have identified  the animals portrayed are ''[[Testudo graeca]] ibera'', a variety of the Spur-thighed tortoise. A reproduction of the painting appeared on the cover of the ''[[Bibliotheca Herpetologica]]'' issue in which the paper about the identification was published.&lt;ref&gt;Bettelheim, Matthew P. and Ertan Taskavak. 2006. "The Tortoise and the Tulip – Testudo graeca ibera and Osman Hamdi's ''The Tortoise Trainer''". ''[[Bibliotheca Herpetologica]]''. 6(2): pp 11–15. The paper is mentioned, and the magazine cover is shown, at [http://www.t-ad.net/ishbh/pub.html ISHBH publication list]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to film:

'''[[Film]]''' &amp;ndash; refers to motion pictures as individual projects and to the field in general.  The name came from the fact that [[photographic film]] (also called [[film stock|filmstock]]) has historically been the primary [[Recording medium|medium]] for recording and displaying motion pictures.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is film? ==
Film can be described as all of the following:

* [[Art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, film is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Film is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse. 
*** One of the [[visual arts]] &amp;ndash; visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.
*** One of the [[performing arts]] &amp;ndash; art forms in which artists use their body, voice, or objects to convey artistic expression. Performing arts include a variety of disciplines but all take the form of a [[performance]] in front of an audience.
*** [[Fine art]] &amp;ndash; in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word "fine" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.
* [[Show business]] &amp;ndash; a means of providing employment for [[actor]]s, [[screenwriter]]s, [[artisan]]s and [[technician]]s, regardless of whether the finished film was produced as a [[for-profit]] enterprise or as a [[not-for-profit]] public service.

=== Other names for film ===
* Movies

==Essence of film==

* [[Filmmaking]] &amp;ndash; process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through scriptwriting, casting, shooting, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition.  Filmmaking is both an art and an industry. Films were originally recorded onto plastic film which was shown through a movie projector onto a large screen (in other words, an analog recording process). The adoption of CGI-based special effects led to the use of digital intermediates. Most contemporary films are now fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition from start to finish.

A '''photograph conservator''' is a professional who examines, documents, researches, and treats [[photographs]], including documenting the structure and condition of art works through written and photographic records, monitoring conditions of works in storage and exhibition and transit environments.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.conservators-converse.org/2015/02/job-posting-conservator-of-photography-modern-and-contemporary-sfmoma-san-francisco-ca/], Job Posting for Conservator of Photography:Modern and Contemporary, SFMOMA. (2015). Retrieved February 28, 2015 from: http://www.conservators-converse.org/2015/02/job-posting-conservator-of-photography-modern-and-contemporary-sfmoma-san-francisco-ca/.&lt;/ref&gt; This person also performs all aspects of the treatment of photographs and related artworks with adherence to the Code of Ethics outlined by the [[American Institute for Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice#.VULP8M7QkqZ|publisher=American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities ==
Responsibilities of a Photograph Conservator of course vary from museum to museum, however there are some critical functions that all conservators must perform in their roles as protectors of cultural heritage. Preventive conservation, examination and documentation, research, and treatment are core functions at the center of every photograph conservators responsibilities.

=== Preventive conservation ===
[[Collections care|Preventive Conservation]] is a rather new specialty in the field and is in response to the need conservators feel for preserving objects post-treatment. As Barbara Appelbaum states, "The fact that conservators feel responsible for preserving object forever is noble, but, practically speaking, unrealistic."&lt;ref name="Conservation Treatment Methodology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Barbara|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|date=2007|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Burlington, MA|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventive conservation shifts the burden of preservation and protection onto measures like environmental controls such as temperature and relative humidity control, control of light levels present, and control of various contaminants. It also includes [[Museum integrated pest management|integrated pest management]] and [[Emergency response (museum)|emergency preparedness]]. All of these steps should be taken for each object before and after treatment, or in some cases in the place of treatment. The Photograph Conservator should be working on preventive conservation each day, as it is one of the most important ways to preserve objects when treatment isn't practical or necessary.

====Environmental controls====
Control of relative humidity and temperature is critical in the preservation of photographs. "Heat can accelerate deterioration and high relative humidity provides the moisture necessary to promote harmful chemical reactions in materials and, with high temperature encourages mold growth and insect activity" according to the Northeast Document Conservation Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=2.1 Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation|website=www.nedcc.org|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Fondos archivo.jpg|thumb|A prime example of proper archive storage and of archival friendly boxes.]]
Proper storage can protect photographs from fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature and/or seasonal changes. Photographic prints and negatives are best stored in individual paper or plastic enclosures. Note that paper enclosures must pass the PAT test or [http://naa.gov.au/records-management/agency/preserve/physical-preservation/pat.aspx Photographic Activity Test] in order to be deemed safe for storage of photographic materials.&lt;ref name="Storing Photograph Collections"&gt;{{cite web|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|publisher=NEDCC|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the photographs are in their individual enclosures they must be boxed in archival quality boxes. Horizontal storage is usually recommended over vertical storage, as is storing photographs of similar size together to avoid abrasions or misplacing the smaller items.&lt;ref name="Storing Photograph Collections"/&gt; Negatives, which includes black and white or color negatives, slides, lantern slides, collodion wet and dry plate negatives, and silver gelatin wet and dry plate negatives should be stored upright and vertically along their longest edge. Padded boxes with dividers are often necessary as you do not want two glass plate negatives to touch each other. When packing the archival quality boxes, make sure to not pack them too heavy and label them accordingly. Scrapbooks and albums provide a particular challenge to conservators because they often contain a variety of components and media. They should not be stored with other archival collections if it can be avoided. Scrapbooks can either be digitally reproduced or if the original is deemed important enough, can be wrapped in archival quality paper or housed in a custom fitted box.&lt;ref name="Storing Photograph Collections"/&gt;

====Emergency preparedness and response====
The [http://www.aam-us.org/ AAM], or American Alliance of Museums, defines an emergency response plan as "a series of written policies and procedures that prevent or minimize damage resulting from disasters (either man made or natural) and help a museum recover."&lt;ref name=AAM&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing a Disaster Preparedness/Emergency Response Plana|url=http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/developing-a-disaster-plan-final.pdf?sfvrsn=2|website=American Alliance of MuseumsA|publisher=AAM|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The required elements of such a plan are as follows: tailored to the institutions current facilities and specific circumstances, covers all threats/risks relevant to the institution, addresses staff, visitors, structures, and collections, includes evacuation plans for people, specifies how to protect, evacuate or recover collections in the event of a disaster, and delegates responsibility for implementation. A Photography Conservator would have a vital role to play in the emergency response plan at their institution. It would be their responsibility to detail the needs of the photography collection and the ways to recover that collection in case of a disaster.&lt;ref name="AAM"/&gt; It is widely recommended that the staff partake in monthly training to go over the emergency response plan in order to ensure that each staff member, including the photograph conservator, knows their role in case of an emergency.

=== Examination and documentation ===
Examination is defined by the act of looking at something closely and carefully or a close and careful study of something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam Webster Dictionary: examination|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/examination|website=Merriam Webster Dictionary|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be a crucial duty for all conservators, including Photograph Conservators. Barbara Appelbaum explains that "the contrast between the first impression of an object-which is more or less the impression of the ordinary viewer- and the view that a conservator takes during an examination is a significant one."&lt;ref name="Conservation Treatment Methodology"/&gt; The first step of an examination is examination of an object with one's eye with a bright light, sometimes with the help of magnification or other viewing aids like binoculars. Tactile observations are also critical, and in some cases senses of smell and hearing yield useful information as well, as tapping on a glass plate negative for example can help identify significant discontinuities.&lt;ref name="Conservation Treatment Methodology"/&gt;

It can be argued that documentation is the most important task a conservator carries out. Every step of the process must be fully documented by a conservator. The National Park Service recommends that all conservation treatment should be documented in writing. They should also include visual representations such as photographs, drawings, analytical results, spectra, and digital images. The documentation should be kept in hard copy and in digital files appended to the Collections Database System used by the museum.&lt;ref name="Chapter 8: Conservation Treatment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 8: Conservation Treatment|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/mhi/chap8.pdf|website=NPS.gov|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation is important for the following reasons
* Conservation documentation is a written and visual report of the work that is done. It provides the park staff with detailed information on the condition of the object, including how it has been altered, what parts are composed of original material, and what has been added or removed during previous treatments or restorations.
* It serves as a permanent record of the treatment procedures performed and the materials and methods used.
* It spells out the understanding reached between the curatorial staff and the conservator on the treatment, including the extent and type of any stabilization or restoration treatment.
* It provides information that will help future conservators to assess the condition of an object and devise further treatment. 
* It makes it possible to assess the success or failure of treatment methods and materials over a long period of time.
* It may last longer than the object itself and become the only record.&lt;ref name="Chapter 8: Conservation Treatment"/&gt;

=== Research ===
Photograph conservators must do thorough research before any treatment can take place. This is often the legacy that conservators leave behind, their documentation, research, and treatment. New techniques and less harsh treatments are being discovered all the time by professionals in the field. The Getty Conservation Institute is currently researching methods for characterization of photographs and photographic material. The study is explained as, "both qualitative and quantitative analysis of photographs and photographic material in order to facilitate identification of photographic processes, and to develop a quantitative methodology for analysis of photographic material. The analytical techniques currently being used in this research are:
* X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF)
* Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR)
* Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
* inductively coupled plasmas mass spectrometry (ICP–MS)
* environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM)
* neutron activation analysis (NAA)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research on the Conservation of Photographs|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/photocon/photocon_component2.html|website=The Getty Conservation Institute|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===
Treatment is defined by the American Institute for Conservation as, "the deliberate alteration of the chemical and/or physical aspects of cultural property, aimed primarily at prolonging its existence. Treatment may consist of stabilization and/or restoration." Stabilization is meant to maintain the integrity of cultural property and minimize deterioration and restoration is meant to return cultural property to a known or assumed state, often through addition of non original material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of Conservation Terminology|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/related-organizations/definitions#.VT7eNihELww|website=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treating photographs is not all about the aesthetic of the image, it also has to do with the photographs long term survival. Of course a photographs conservator would want the image to look as pleasing as possible, but that is not the primary motive behind conservation treatment. [[Photograph preservation]] is concerned with treating original photographic material and not the digital copy of that image, although making reproductions of images digitally is a treatment plan used by many conservators. This allows for the image and information that image contains to live on and be researched without the original being damaged further. However this is not a replacement for the original photograph as digital scans and copies can easily become obsolete.

A successful treatment was carried out on a broken glass plate interpositive of Abraham Lincoln taken in 1860, at the George Eastman House. This treatment included using materials that stabilized the glass and emulsion and involved research in innovative new methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastman House displays Abraham Lincoln’s favorite image, featuring museum’s conservation of shattered glass plate|url=http://www.eastmanhouse.org/tools/pressroom/view.php?title=lincoln-2009|website=George Eastman HouseA|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skills and knowledge ==
Photograph conservators need to possess a vast knowledge of photographic processes and deterioration of those materials. Conservators should have experience in: 
* examination procedures to determine the materials, method of manufacture, and properties of objects or structures and the causes and extent of deterioration or alteration
* scientific analysis and research to identify historic and artistic methods and materials of fabrication, and to evaluate the efficacy and appropriateness of materials and procedures of conservation
* documentation procedures to record the condition of an object or site at a specific time, or before, during, and after treatment, and to outline treatment methods and materials in detail
* treatment, including interventive procedures, as well as passive measures to stabilize an artifact or retard its deterioration
* restoration to bring a deteriorated or damaged object or structure closer to a previous or assumed appearance or function
* advising on procedures for the safe exhibition and travel of cultural materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Careers in Conservation|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/publications-resources/careers-in-conservation/become-a-conservator#.VT7kcChELww|website=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Paths to becoming a conservator vary but usually include, a graduate degree in conservation or historic preservation with a certificate in or diploma in conservation as well as post graduate fellowships. Study of a foreign language, formal course work in drawing, painting, photography etc., professional experience, and a personal interview and portfolio are sometimes required. A few PhD programs do exist for those that wish to further their studies of conservation sciences. Some programs in North America include:

'''''Retro-Pulp Tales''''' is a [[limited edition]] [[anthology]] published by [[Subterranean Press]]&lt;ref&gt;http://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/retro_pulp_tales&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006, edited by [[Joe R. Lansdale]]. It tied in winning the 2006 [[Bram Stoker Award]] for [[Bram Stoker Award for Best Anthology|Best Anthology]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.horror.org/stokerwinnom.htm#2006&lt;/ref&gt; (the other winning title was "Mondo Zombie" edited by [[John Skipp]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfsite.com/07a/rp227.htm review retrieved 6/2/13&lt;/ref&gt;

It contains new stories written in the style of the [[pulp magazine]]s of the early 20th century. Lansdale's guidelines for Retro Pulp Tales were basic: "Write a story in the vein of the old pulps ... that takes place before 1960, and with the restrictions of those times."

It includes contributions by Bill Crider, Stephen Gallagher, Melissa Mia Hall, Alex Irvine, Tim Lebbon, Kim Newman, Norman Partridge, Gary Phillips, James Reasoner, Al Sarrantonio, Chet Williamson, and F. Paul Wilson. This collection was issued as a [[trade hardcover]], a numbered limited edition, and a lettered special edition. All issues have long since sold out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oocities.org/craigsbookclub/retropulptales.html extensive review retrieved 6/2/13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Roadside Memorial.JPG|thumb|Roadside memorial, [[Virginia]], United States]]
A '''roadside memorial''' is a marker that usually commemorates a site where a person died suddenly and unexpectedly, away from home.  Unlike a grave site headstone, which marks where a body is laid, the memorial marks the last place on earth where a person was alive&amp;nbsp;– although in the past travelers were, out of necessity, often buried where they fell.

Usually the memorial is created and maintained by family members or friends of the person who died. A common type of memorial is simply a bunch of flowers, real or plastic, taped to [[street furniture]] or a tree trunk. A handwritten message, personal mementos, etc. may be included. More sophisticated memorials may be a [[memorial cross]], [[ghost bike]], or a plaque with an inscription, decorated with flowers or wreaths.

Roadside memorials tend to be clustered along the busiest roadways and often times at intersections. This is evident when examining the clustering of tribute sites on a map such as this one showing how many sites are along US 30 in northern Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/|title=Roadside Tribute: A Site to Remember|last=|first=|date=|website=Roadside Tribute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning and message==
Roadside memorials are a statement of [[grief]] and [[love]] from the loved ones of the accident victim(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid|first= A.|year= 2015|title= Place, Meaning, and the Visual Argument of the Roadside Cross, Savannah Law Review| volume= 2|pages=265–300 |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2633661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But apart from their personal significance, these memorials also serve as a reminder and warning to other road users of the dangers of driving, and to encourage safer driving.&lt;ref&gt;Tay, R., Churchill, A. &amp; de Barros, A. 2011. Effect of roadside memorial on traffic flow, Accident Analysis and Prevention, vol. 43, pp.483–486&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tay, R. 2009. Drivers’ perceptions and reactions to roadside memorials, Accident Analysis and Prevention, vol. pp.41, 663–669&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s, the [[Arizona]] [[Highway patrol|State Highway Patrol]] began using white crosses to mark the site of fatal car accidents. This practice was continued by families of road-crash victims after it had been abandoned by the police{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. The [[ghost bike]] phenomenon, where an old bicycle is painted white and locked up at an accident site, serves the same purpose in relation to cycling casualties. Some tribute sites include elaborate displays to memorialize the personality of the person to whom the tribute site is dedicated, including action figures and lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/tribute-sites/united-states/california-1/searles-valley/tributes/superman-the-rock-searle-valley-trona/|title=Superman &amp; The Rock Searle Valley/Trona|last=|first=|date=|website=Roadside Tribute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, roadside memorials were personal memorials, but there is a modern trend toward public memorials of increasingly large size.  Typically little or no effort is made to make the memorials accommodate the natural beauty of the landscape and many roadside memorials, over time, lack proper maintenance.

The phenomenon of roadside memorials may be associated with another growing trend:  public outpouring of grief for celebrities. The death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], for example, precipitated an avalanche of flowers and wreaths at the [[Pont de l'Alma]] road tunnel in Paris, the site of her death, and at [[Kensington Palace]], her home in London.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} While car-crash victims are rarely so well known, something of the same sort of impulse to make a public display of emotion at the site of a tragedy may be partly responsible for the growing popularity of roadside memorials. The broad phenomenon of creating improvised and temporary memorials after traumatic death (accidents, murder, disasters etc.) has become popular since the 1980s. Because of their non-institutionalized character they are generically coined as grassroots memorials.&lt;ref&gt;''Grassroots Memorials: The Politics of Memorializing Traumatic Death'', eds Peter Jan Margry and Cristina Sánchez-Carretero (New York: Berghahn, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and practice==
Roadside memorials have been erected around the world for centuries. Their legality varies from country to country. A web site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/|title=Roadside Tribute: A Site to Remember|website=Roadside Tribute: Remembering Lost Loved Ones}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created in order to preserve in a more permanent manner the physical roadside tributes in a virtual manner. This helps to preserve in a longer term manner the original beauty of the tribute site that tends to degrade over time without regular maintenance. It also provides a means of creating a virtual tribute site for those who haven't yet built a physical memorial at the accident scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/about-us/|title=About Roadside Tribute|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The number of memorials erected in [[Australia]] since 1990 has increased considerably. In 2003, it was estimated that one in five road deaths were  memorialized at the site of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Ukraine===
[[File:Ukrainian roadside memorial.png|thumb|A roadside memorial in Ukraine]]
It is traditional in [[Ukraine]] to place a roadside memorial on the site of a deadly car or motorcycle crash. It is usually a [[cross]] or a small monument with a [[wreath]] of flowers. There are also usually fresh flowers regularly placed by the cross if the relatives of the person who died live close enough to look after the memorial. Sometimes Ukrainian roadside memorials can be more elaborate, including a small granite or marble gravestone and/or a picture of the loved one.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Tribute at North London railway station.jpg|thumbnail|A tribute at a North London railway station. The message reads: "You collapsed one month ago here at the station died 13 days later. RIP Tracey your son is doing well. X Love and miss you loads"]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], the practice of erecting roadside memorials has recently generated a media debate about the danger these memorials may pose to other road users and to people erecting them in unsafe places. This debate has been sparked by accounts of dangerous actions, such as when an adult crosses a main road with a child to place a tribute. Some jurisdictions already enforce local regulations, and police officials and local councilors have suggested that uniform rules be introduced across the country. For example, according to the [[BBC]], in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], memorials will only be allowed where it is deemed safe and appropriate, and they will be removed after three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4806870.stm | work=BBC News | title='Dangerous' road tributes concern | date=15 March 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

The spread  of spontaneous roadside memorials to mark the site of fatal [[traffic accident]]s in the [[United States]] is a relatively new phenomenon. There is a gravestone-style memorial in Ellington, CT marking a child's death in 1812.  A typical memorial includes a cross (usually wooden), flowers, hand-painted signs, and, in the case of a child's death, [[stuffed animal]]s. 

The spread of roadside memorials in the United States has increased in recent decades as a result of large immigrant populations from Mexico entering the country {{Clarify|United States|date=July 2017}}. And while not limited to Mexican populations, roadside memorials are most common in areas with large Mexican populations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Formerly, in funerary processions where a group would proceed from a church to a graveyard carrying a coffin, the bearers would take a rest, or ''[[wikt:descanso|descanso]]'' in Spanish, and wherever they set the coffin down, a cross would be placed there in memory of the event. The modern practice of roadside shrines commemorate the last place a person was alive before receiving fatal injuries, even if they should actually die in a hospital after the crash.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/environment/environment_krqe_albuquerque_125_crews_protect_roadside_memorial_200903032140 |title=I25 crews protect roadside memorial |publisher=Krqe.com |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306024108/http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/environment/environment_krqe_albuquerque_125_crews_protect_roadside_memorial_200903032140 |archivedate=6 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[southwestern United States]], they are also common at historic [[paraje]]s on old [[long distance trail]]s, going back to the roots of the tradition, and also marked the graves of people who died while traveling.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} A descanso memorial may be decorated especially for the holidays, and for significant anniversaries in the person's life.  A descanso memorial for a child may be decorated with special toys, even toy vignettes of family life, and votive candles may be placed there on special nights.

In the United States, the legal situation varies from state to state.

In [[New Mexico]], Department of Transportation crews undertaking new construction are not required to protect them, but usually either avoid altering them, or otherwise place them as close to where they originally were as possible once construction has been completed as a courtesy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In [[California]], Streets and Highways Code Section 101.10 directs the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to place and maintain memorial signs along state highways that read “Please Don't Drink and Drive” followed by “In Memory of {victim's name}.” Caltrans places signs at the request of victims’ relatives when there is a fatality as a result of an alcohol or drug-impaired driver. The signs are to remain in place for a period of seven years. The department shall charge the requesting party a fee to cover the department’s cost in designing, constructing, placing, and maintaining that sign, and the department’s costs in administering this section.{{clarify|date=March 2014}}&lt;!--alongside state highways?--&gt;

The states of [[Colorado]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Wisconsin]] ban such memorials.

In the state of [[Delaware]], roadside memorials are illegal per the Clear Zone Act for safety reasons. As an alternative to roadside memorials, the Delaware Highway Memorial Garden located at the [[Smyrna Rest Area]] consists of a path with bricks bearing the names of people who died along roads in Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Programs and Services – Delaware Highway Memorial Garden|publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation|url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/mem_garden/index.shtml|accessdate=7 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311201759/http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/mem_garden/index.shtml|archivedate=11 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states impose specific requirements for roadside memorials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/local/article/0,2845,MCA_25340_4541992,00.html Commercial Appeal : Memphis News, Business, Homes, Jobs, Cars, &amp; Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319083455/http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/local/article/0,2845,MCA_25340_4541992,00.html |date=19 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.descansos.org/links.shtml#STATE_APPLICATIONS_AND_GUIDELINES__ |title=(see state by state requirements) |publisher=Descansos.org |date=8 September 2004 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121053/http://www.descansos.org/links.shtml#STATE_APPLICATIONS_AND_GUIDELINES__ |archivedate=5 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others think they serve as a sort of public service announcement that reminds drivers to be careful and drive safely, and are no more distracting than any other roadside advertisement.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  For anyone but those close to the death, they may do little but clutter the landscape. If the memorial is located on a road that the loved ones seldom or never travel, or in a remote area, it may be seen as a form of grandstanding.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Using a Christian cross as a memorial along a public highway can be seen as an illegal endorsement of religion and has been challenged in a growing number of lawsuits by secular groups concerned about the separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid|first= A.|year= 2013|title= Private Memorials on Public Space: Roadside Crosses at the Intersection of the Free Speech Clause and the Establishment Clause, Nebraska Law Review|volume= 92|pages=124–184 |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2278611}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 18 August 2010 the Tenth Circuit held that the State of Utah violated the Establishment Clause by constructing a series of 12-foot high Latin crosses along the roadside to memorialize fallen state troopers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.au.org/our-work/legal/lawsuits/american-atheists-inc-v-duncan | title=American Atheists, Inc. v.

'''''Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám''''' is the title that [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] gave to his 1859 translation from [[Farsi]] to English of a selection of [[quatrain]]s (''{{lang|ar-Latn|[[ruba'i|rubāʿiyāt]]}}'') attributed to [[Omar Khayyam]]  (1048–1131), dubbed "the Astronomer-Poet of Persia".

FitzGerald's work at first was unsuccessful commercially. But it was popularised from 1861 onward by [[Whitley Stokes]], and the work came to be greatly admired by the [[Pre-Raphaelites]] in England. In  1872 FitzGerald had a third edition printed, which increased interest in the work in the United States of America. By the 1880s, the book was extremely well known throughout the English-speaking world, to the extent that numerous "Omar Khayyam Clubs" were formed and there was a "fin de siècle cult of the Rubaiyat".&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Yohannan, ''Persian Poetry in England and America'', 1977., p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
FitzGerald's work has been published in several hundred editions, and it has inspired similar translation efforts in English and in many other languages.

The authenticity of the poetry attributed to Omar Khayyam is highly uncertain. Omar was famous during his lifetime not as a poet but as an astronomer and mathematician. The earliest reference to his having written poetry is found in his biography by [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani|al-Isfahani]], written 43 years after his death. This view is reinforced by other medieval historians such as [[Shahrazuri]] (1201) and [[Al-Qifti]] (1255). Parts of the ''Rubaiyat'' appear as incidental quotations from Omar in early works of biography and in anthologies. These include works of [[Fakhr al-Din Razi|Razi]] (ca. 1160-1210), [[Najm al-Din Razi|Daya]] (1230), [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvayni]] (ca. 1226-1283), and Jajarmi (1340).&lt;ref name="Wine of Wisdom"&gt;Aminrazavi, Mehdi: ''The Wine of Wisdom''. Oneworld 2005, {{ISBN|1-85168-355-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}}&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Edward Denison Ross, "Omar Khayyam", ''Bulletin of the School Of Oriental Studies'', London Institution (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|434}} Also, five quatrains assigned to Khayyam in somewhat later sources appear in Zahiri Samarqandi's ''[[Sindbad-Nameh]]'' (before 1160) without attribution.&lt;ref name="Dashti"&gt;Ali Dashti (translated by L. P. Elwell-Sutton), ''In Search of Omar Khayyam'', Routledge Library Editions: Iran (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

The number of quatrains attributed to him in more recent collections varies from about 1,200 (according to [[Saeed Nafisi]]) to more than 2,000. Skeptical scholars point out that the entire tradition may be [[pseudepigraphic]].&lt;ref name="Dashti" /&gt;{{rp|11}}
The extant manuscripts containing collections attributed to Omar are dated much too late to enable a reconstruction of a body of authentic verses. 

In the 1930s, Iranian scholars, notably [[Mohammad-Ali Foroughi]], attempted to reconstruct a core of authentic verses from scattered quotes by authors of the 13th and 14th centuries, ignoring the younger manuscript tradition. After World War II, reconstruction efforts were significantly delayed by two clever forgeries. De Blois (2004) is pessimistic, suggesting that contemporary scholarship has not advanced beyond the situation of the 1930s, when [[Hans Heinrich Schaeder]] commented that the name of Omar Khayyam "is to be struck out from the history of Persian literature".&lt;ref&gt;Francois De Blois, ''Persian Literature - A Bio-Bibliographical Survey: Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&amp;pg=PA307 p. 307].&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature of the more recent collections is the lack of linguistic homogeneity and continuity of ideas. [[Sadegh Hedayat]] commented that "if a man had lived for a hundred years and had changed his religion, philosophy, and beliefs twice a day, he could scarcely have given expression to such a range of ideas".&lt;ref name="Dashti"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Hedayat's final verdict was that 14 quatrains could be attributed to Khayyam with certainty.&lt;ref name="Sadeq Hedayat's Learning"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bashiri|first1=Iraj|title=Sadeq Hedayat's Learning|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Fiction/Learning.html|website=Blind Owl|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various tests have been employed to reduce the quatrains attributable to Omar to about 100.&lt;ref name="Ross" /&gt;{{rp|434}} Arthur Christensen states that "of more than 1,200 ruba'is known to be ascribed to Omar, only 121 could be regarded as reasonably authentic".&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|663}} Foroughi accepts 178 quatrains as authentic, while [[Ali Dashti]] accepts 36 of them.&lt;ref name="Ross" /&gt;{{rp|96}}

FitzGerald's source were transcripts sent to him in 1856&amp;ndash;1857 by his friend and teacher [[Edward B. Cowell]] of two manuscripts, a Bodleian manuscript with 158 quatrains,&lt;ref&gt;MS. Ouseley 140, copied in 1460 in [[Shiraz]], Persia, 47 folia. This is the oldest securely dated manuscript of 
Omar Khayyam's poetry. It belonged to [[William Ouseley]] (1767-1842) and was purchased by the Bodleian Library in 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;
and a "Calcutta manuscript". 

FitzGerald completed his first draft in 1857 and sent it to ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' in January 1858.
He made a revised draft in January 1859, of which he privately printed 250 copies. This first edition became extremely sought-after by the 1890s, when "more than two million copies ha[d] been sold in two hundred editions".&lt;ref&gt;Preface to a [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NAtFAQAAIAAJ  facsimile of the first edition] (no year [c. 1900], "from the fine copy owned by Charles Dana Burrage" [1857-1926]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism vs. Sufism debate==
The extreme popularity of FitzGerald's work led to a prolonged debate on the correct interpretation of the philosophy behind the poems. FitzGerald emphasized the religious skepticism he found in Omar Khayyam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Dick|title=FitzGerald, Edward|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fitzgerald-|website=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his preface to the ''Rubáiyát'', he describes Omar's philosophy as [[Epicurean]] and claims that Omar was "hated and dreaded by the Sufis, whose practice he ridiculed  and whose faith amounts to little more than his own, when stripped of the Mysticism and formal recognition of Islamism under which Omar would not hide."&lt;ref&gt;FitzGerald, E. (2010). ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'' (p. 12). Champaign, Ill.: Project Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Nelson Frye]] also emphasizes that Khayyam was despised by a number of prominent contemporary Sufis. These include figures such as [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Najm al-Din Razi|Najm al-Din Daya]], [[Al-Ghazali]], and [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], who "viewed Khayyam not as a fellow-mystic, but a free-thinking scientist".&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran"&gt;''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Volume 4. Cambridge University Press (1975): Richard Nelson Frye&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|663–664}} The skeptic interpretation is supported by the medieval historian [[Al-Qifti]] (ca. 1172–1248), who in his ''The History of Learned Men'' reports that Omar's poems were only outwardly in the Sufi style, but were written with an anti-religious agenda. He also mentions that Khayyam was indicted for impiety and went on a [[hajj|pilgrimage]] to avoid punishment.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sufis understood his poems outwardly and considered them to be part of their mystical tradition. In their sessions and gatherings, Khayyam's poems became the subject of conversation and discussion. His poems, however, are inwardly like snakes who bite the sharia [Islamic law] and are chains and handcuffs placed on religion. Once the people of his time had a taste of his faith, his secrets were revealed. Khayyam was frightened for his life, withdrew from writing, speaking and such like and traveled to [[Mecca]]. Once he arrived in [[Baghdad]], members of a Sufi tradition and believers in primary sciences came to him and courted him. He did not accept them and after performing the pilgrimage returned to his native land, kept his secrets to himself and propagated worshiping and following the people of faith." cited after Aminrazavi (2007){{page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics of FitzGerald, on the other hand, have accused the translator of misrepresenting the mysticism of Sufi poetry by an overly literal interpretation. Thus, the view of Omar Khayyam as a Sufi was defended by Bjerregaard (1915).&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The writings of Omar Khayyam are good specimens of [[Sufism]], but are not valued in the West as they ought to be, and the mass of English-speaking people know him only through the poems of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]. It is unfortunate because Fitzgerald is not faithful to his master and model, and at times he lays words upon the tongue of the Sufi which are blasphemous. Such outrageous language is that of the eighty-first quatrain for instance. Fitzgerald is doubly guilty because he was more of a Sufi than he was willing to admit." C. H. A. Bjerregaard, ''Sufism: Omar Khayyam and E. Fitzgerald'', The Sufi Publishing Society (1915), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dougan (1991) likewise says that attributing [[hedonism]] to Omar is due to the failings of FitzGerald's translation, arguing that the poetry is to be understood as "deeply esoteric".&lt;ref&gt;"Every line of the Rubaiyat has more meaning than almost anything you could read in Sufi literature". Abdullah Dougan, [http://www.gnosticpress.co.nz/ ''Who is the Potter?''], Gnostic Press 1991 {{ISBN|0-473-01064-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Idries Shah]] (1999) similarly says that FitzGerald misunderstood Omar's poetry.&lt;ref&gt;"FitzGerald himself was confused about Omar. Sometimes he thought that he was a Sufi, sometimes not." Idries Shah, ''The Sufis'', Octagon Press (1999), pp. 165-166&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sufi interpretation is the view of a minority of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aminrazavi|first1=Mehdi|title=Umar Khayyam|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/umar-khayyam/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Beveridge]] states that "the Sufis have unaccountably pressed this writer [Khayyam] into their service; they explain away some of his blasphemies by forced interpretations, and others they represent as innocent freedoms and reproaches".&lt;ref&gt;Beveridge, H. (1905). XVIII. "Omar Khayyam". ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', 37(3), 521-526.&lt;/ref&gt; Aminrazavi (2007) states that "Sufi interpretation of Khayyam is possible only by reading into his Rubaiyat extensively and by stretching the content to fit the classical Sufi doctrine".&lt;ref name="Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|128}}

FitzGerald's "skepticist" reading of the poetry is still defended by modern scholars. Sadegh Hedayat (''[[The Blind Owl]]'' 1936) was the most notable modern proponent of Khayyam's philosophy as agnostic skepticism. In his introductory essay to his second edition of the ''Quatrains of the Philosopher Omar Khayyam'' (1922), Hedayat states that "while Khayyam believes in the transmutation and transformation of the human body, he does not believe in a separate soul; if we are lucky, our bodily particles would be used in the making of a jug of wine".&lt;ref&gt;Katouzian, H. (1991). Sadeq Hedayat: ''The life and literature of an Iranian writer'' (p. 138). London: I.B. Tauris&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that "religion has proved incapable of surmounting his inherent fears; thus Khayyam finds himself alone and insecure in a universe about which his knowledge is nil". In his later work (''Khayyam's Quatrains'', 1935), Hedayat further maintains that Khayyam's usage of Sufic terminology such as "wine" is literal, and that  "Khayyam took refuge in wine to ward off bitterness and to blunt the cutting edge of his thoughts."&lt;ref name="Sadeq Hedayat's Learning" /&gt;

FitzGerald's text was published in five editions, with substantial revisions:
* 1st edition – 1859 [75 quatrains]
* 2nd edition – 1868 [110 quatrains]
* 3rd edition – 1872 [101 quatrains]
**1878, "first American edition", reprint of the 3rd ed.
* 4th edition – 1879 [101 quatrains]
* 5th edition – 1889 [101 quatrains]

Of the five editions published, four were published under the authorial control of FitzGerald. The fifth edition, which contained only minor changes from the fourth, was edited posthumously after his death on the basis of manuscript revisions FitzGerald had left.

Numerous later editions were published after 1889, notably an edition with illustrations by [[Willy Pogany]], first published in 1909 (George G. Harrap, London). It was issued in numerous revised editions.This edition combined FitzGerald's texts of the 1st and 4th editions and was subtitled "The First and Fourth Renderings in English Verse".

A bibliography of editions compiled in 1929 listed more than 300 separate editions.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose George Potter, ''A Bibliography of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;  Many more have been published since.&lt;ref&gt;Francois De Blois, ''Persian Literature - A Bio-Bibliographical Survey: Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&amp;pg=PA312 p. 312].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character of translation==
FitzGerald's translation is rhyming and metrical, and rather [[Free translation|free]]. Many of the verses are paraphrased, and some of them cannot be confidently traced to his source material at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|last=Fitzgerald|first=Edward|publisher=Rupa &amp; Co.|year=2007|isbn=81-7167-439-9|location=New Delhi|pages=132|chapter=Note by W. Aldis Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; FitzGerald described his work as "transmogrification".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} To a large extent, the ''Rubaiyat'' can be considered original poetry by FitzGerald loosely based on Omar's quatrains rather than a "translation" in the narrow sense.

FitzGerald was open about the liberties he had taken with his source material:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My translation will interest you from its form, and also in many respects in its detail: very un-literal as it is. Many quatrains are mashed together: and something lost, I doubt, of Omar's simplicity, which is so much a virtue in him. (letter to E. B. Cowell, 9/3/58)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I suppose very few People have ever taken such Pains in Translation as I have: though certainly not to be literal. But at all Cost, a Thing must live: with a transfusion of one's own worse Life if one can’t retain the Original's better. Better a live Sparrow than a stuffed Eagle. (letter to E. B. Cowell, 4/27/59)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For comparison, here are two versions of the same quatrain by FitzGerald, from the 1859 and 1889 editions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{| style="vertical-align: top;"" role="presentation"
|Quatrain XI (1859)
&lt;poem&gt;

And Wilderness is Paradise enow.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|style="padding-left: 2em;"|Quatrain XII (1889)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabiannights.org/rubaiyat/rubaiyat.php3?display?5??9?0?4?3????1 |title=Arabiannights.org |publisher=Arabiannights.org |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630085923/http://www.arabiannights.org/rubaiyat/rubaiyat.php3?display%3F5%3F%3F9%3F0%3F4%3F3%3F%3F%3F%3F1 |archive-date=30 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread—and Thou

&lt;/poem&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This quatrain has a close correspondence in two of the quatrains in the [[Bodleian Library]] ms., numbers 149 and 155. In the literal prose translation of 
[[Edward Heron-Allen]] (1898):&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/rubaiyatbodleian00omar#page/266/mode/2up The Ruba'iyat of Omar Khayyam : being a facsimile of the manuscript in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, with a transcript into modern Persian characters.

===English===
Multilingual edition, published in 1955 by [[Tahrir Iran Co.]]/[[Kashani Bros.]]]]

Two English editions by [[Edward Henry Whinfield]] (1836&amp;ndash;1922) consisted of 253 quatrains in 1882 and 500 in 1883. This translation was fully revised and some cases fully translated anew by Ali Salami and published by Mehrandish Books.

Whinfield's translation is, if possible, even more free than FitzGerald's; Quatrain 84 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above) reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In the sweet spring a grassy bank I sought
And thither wine and a fair [[Houri]] brought;
And, though the people called me graceless dog,
Gave not to [[Paradise]] another thought!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Leslie Garner published an English translation of 152 quatrains in 1888. His was also a free, rhyming translation.
Quatrain I. 20 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Yes, Loved One, when the Laughing Spring is blowing,
With Thee beside me and the Cup o’erflowing,
I pass the day upon this Waving Meadow,
And dream the while, no thought on Heaven bestowing.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Justin Huntly McCarthy]] (1859–1936) (Member of Parliament for [[Newry (UK Parliament constituency)|Newry]]) published prose translations of 466 quatrains in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Omar Khayyam, ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', translated by [[Justin Huntly McCarthy]] MP. [London] : D. Nutt, 1889. (Source: [http://library.catalogue.tcd.ie/record=b13332609~S9 Trinity College Dublin Library])&lt;/ref&gt;
Quatrain 177 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In Spring time I love to sit in the meadow with a paramour
perfect as a Houri and goodly jar of wine, and though
I may be blamed for this, yet hold me lower
than a dog if ever I dream of Paradise.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Richard Le Gallienne]] (1866–1947) produced a verse translation, subtitled "a paraphrase from several literal translations", in 1897. 
In his introductory note to the reader, Le Gallienne cites [[Justin Huntly McCarthy|McCarthy]]'s "charming prose" as the chief influence on his version. Some example quatrains follow:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Look not above, there is no answer there;
Pray not, for no one listens to your prayer;
Near is as near to God as any Far,
And Here is just the same deceit as There.
''(#78, on p. 44)''

And do you think that unto such as you;
A [[maggot]]-minded, starved, fanatic crew:
God gave the secret, and denied it me?—
Well, well, what matters it! Believe that, too.
''(#85, p. 47)''

"Did God set grapes a-growing, do you think,
And at the same time make it sin to drink?
Give thanks to Him who foreordained it thus—
Surely He loves to hear the glasses clink!"
''(#91, p. 48)''
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Edward Heron-Allen]] (1861–1943) published a prose translation in 1898. He also wrote an introduction to an edition of [[Frederick Rolfe]] (Baron Corvo) 's translation into English of Nicolas's French translation.

The English novelist and orientalist [[Jessie Cadell]] (1844–1884) consulted various manuscripts of the Rubaiyat with the intention of producing an authoritative edition. Her translation of 150 quatrains was published posthumously in 1899.&lt;ref name=ODNBCadell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raza|first1=Rosemary Cargill|chapter=Cadell, Jessie Ellen (1844&amp;ndash;1884)|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur John Arberry|A. J. Arberry]] in 1959 attempted a scholarly edition of Khayyam, based on thirteenth-century manuscripts. However, his manuscripts were subsequently exposed as twentieth-century forgeries.&lt;ref name=TLS&gt;{{cite web

The 1967 translation of the Rubáiyat by [[Robert Graves]] and [[Omar Ali-Shah]], however, created a scandal. The authors claimed it was based on a twelfth-century manuscript located in Afghanistan, where it was allegedly utilized as a Sufi teaching document. But the manuscript was never produced, and British experts in Persian literature were easily able to prove that the translation was in fact based on Edward Heron Allen's analysis of possible sources for FitzGerald's work.&lt;ref name=TLS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aminrazavi, Mehdi: ''The Wine of Wisdom''.

Quatrains 11 and 12 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Should our day's portion be one mancel loaf,
A haunch of [[mutton]] and a gourd of wine
Set for us two alone on the wide plain,
No Sultan's bounty could evoke such joy.

A gourd of red wine and a sheaf of poems —
A bare subsistence, half a loaf, not more —
Supplied us two alone in the free desert:
What Sultan could we envy on his throne?
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[http://oberlin.edu/library/special/bowen.html John Charles Edward Bowen (1909-1989)] was a British poet and translator of Persian poetry. He is best known for his translation of the Rubaiyat, titled ''A New Selection from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.'' Bowen is also credited as being one of the first scholars to question Robert Graves' and Omar Ali-Shah's translation of the Rubaiyat.&lt;ref&gt;http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001005780&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern version of 235 quatrains, claiming to be "as literal an English version of the Persian originals as readability and intelligibility permit", was published in 1979 by [[Peter Avery]] and [[John Heath-Stubbs]]. 
Their edition provides two versions of the thematic quatrain, the first (98) considered by the Persian writer [[Sadeq Hedayat]] to be a spurious attribution.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Will have more wealth than a Sultan's realm.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
234.
If chance supplied a loaf of white bread,
Two casks of wine and a leg of mutton,
In the corner of a garden with a tulip-cheeked girl,
There'd be enjoyment no Sultan could outdo.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1988, the Rubaiyat was translated by a Persian for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Azarang|first=Abd-al Hussein|title=Emami, Karim|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/emami-karim-translator-editor|work=Encyclopædia Iranica|publisher=iranicaonline.org|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karim Emami]]'s translation of the Rubaiyat was published under the title ''The Wine of Nishapour'' in Paris. ''The Wine of Nishapour'' is the collection of Khayyam's poetry by Shahrokh Golestan, including Golestan's pictures in front of each poem.&lt;ref&gt;Emami, Karim. ''Ups and Downs of Translation'', Tehran, 1988, pp. 134-169&lt;/ref&gt;  
Example quatrain 160 (equivalent{{dubious|date=September 2017}} of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his first edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In spring if a houri-like sweetheart
Gives me a cup of wine on the edge of a green cornfield,
Though to the vulgar this would be blasphemy,
If I mentioned any other Paradise, I'd be worse than a dog.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1991 [[Ahmad Saidi]] (1904–1994) produced an English translation of 165 quatrains grouped into 10 themes. Born and raised in Iran, Saidi went to the United States in 1931 and attended college there. He served as the head of the Persian Publication Desk at the U.S. Office of War Information during World War II, inaugurated the Voice of America to Iran, and prepared an English-[[Persian language|Persian]] military dictionary for the Department of Defense. His quatrains include the original Persian verses for reference alongside his English translations. His focus was to faithfully convey, with less poetic license, Khayyam's original religious, mystical, and historic Persian themes, through the verses as well as his extensive annotations. Two example quatrains follow:

Quatrain 16 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XII in his 5th edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ah, would there were a loaf of bread as fare,
A joint of lamb, a jug of vintage rare,
And you and I in wilderness encamped—
No Sultan's pleasure could with ours compare.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quatrain 75:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The sphere upon which mortals come and go,
Has no end nor beginning that we know;
And none there is to tell us in plain truth:
Whence do we come and whither do we go.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===German===
[[Adolf Friedrich von Schack]] (1815–1894) published a German translation in 1878.

Quatrain 151 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Gönnt mir, mit dem Liebchen im Gartenrund
Zu weilen bei süßem Rebengetränke,
Und nennt mich schlimmer als einen Hund,
Wenn ferner an's Paradies ich denke!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Friedrich Martin von Bodenstedt|Friedrich Martinus von Bodenstedt]] (1819–1892) published a German translation in 1881. The translation eventually consisted of 395 quatrains.

Quatrain IX, 59 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Im Frühling mag ich gern im Grüne weilen
Und Einsamkeit mit einer Freundin teilen
Und einem Kruge Wein. Mag man mich schelten:
Ich lasse keinen andern Himmel gelten.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===French===
The first French translation, of 464 quatrains in prose, was made by J. B. Nicolas, chief interpreter at the French embassy in Persia in 1867.

Prose stanza (equivalent of Fitzgerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):

&lt;blockquote lang="fr"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Au printemps j’aime à m’asseoir au bord d’une prairie, avec une idole semblable à une houri et une cruche de vin, s’il y en a, et bien que tout cela soit généralement blâmé, je veux être pire qu’un chien si jamais je songe au paradis.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The best-known version in French is the free verse edition by Franz Toussaint (1879–1955) published in 1924. This translation consisting of 170 [[quatrains]] was done from the original Persian text, while most of the other French translations were themselves translations of FitzGerald's work. The ''Éditions d'art Henri Piazza'' published the book almost unchanged between 1924 and 1979. Toussaint's translation has served as the basis of subsequent translations into other languages, but Toussaint did not live to witness the influence his translation has had.

Quatrain XXV (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote lang="fr"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Au printemps, je vais quelquefois m’asseoir à la lisière d’un champ fleuri. Lorsqu’une belle jeune fille m’apporte une coupe de vin, je ne pense guère à mon salut. Si j’avais cette préoccupation, je vaudrais moins qu’un chien.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Russian===
Many [[Russian language|Russian-language]] translations have been undertaken, reflecting the popularity of the ''Rubaiyat'' in [[Russia]] since the late 19th century and the increasingly popular tradition of using it for the purposes of [[bibliomancy]]. The earliest verse translation (by [[Vasily Velichko]]) was published in 1891. The version by Osip Rumer published in 1914 is a translation of FitzGerald's version. Rumer later published a version of 304 rubaiyat translated directly from Persian. A lot of poetic translations (some based on verbatim translations into prose by others) were also written by [[German Plisetsky]], [[Konstantin Bal'mont]], Ts. Banu, I. Tkhorzhevsky, L. Pen'kovsky, and others.

==Influence==

FitzGerald rendered Omar's name as "Omar the Tentmaker",{{dubious|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--apparently not in FitzGerald's text--&gt; and this name resonated in English-speaking popular culture for a while. Thus, [[Nathan Haskell Dole]] published a novel called ''Omar, the Tentmaker: A Romance of Old Persia'' in 1898. ''Omar the Tentmaker of Naishapur'' is a historical novel by John Smith Clarke, published in 1910. 
"Omar the Tentmaker" is a 1914 play in an oriental setting by [[Richard Walton Tully]], adapted as a [[Omar the Tentmaker (film)|silent film]] in 1922.
US General [[Omar Bradley]] was given the nickname "Omar the Tent-Maker" in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey D. Lavoie, ''
The Private Life of General Omar N. Bradley'' (2015), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and the name has been recorded as a slang expression for "[[penis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kimmel, Christine Milrod, Amanda Kennedy,  ''Cultural Encyclopedia of the Penis'' (2014), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;
FitzGerald's translations also reintroduced Khayyam to  Iranians, "who had long ignored the Neishapouri poet".&lt;ref name="Molavi110"&gt;Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p. 110f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

{{trivia|date=September 2017}}
* The title of [[Rex Stout]]'s [[Nero Wolfe]] novel ''[[Some Buried Caesar]]'' comes from one of the Tentmaker's quatrains (FitzGerald's XVIII), for example.
* [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s drama ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' derives its title from the first quoted quatrain above.
* [[Agatha Christie]] used ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' as a story title, as did [[Stephen King]]. See also ''[[And Having Writ…]]''.
* [[Lan Wright]] used ''[[Dawn's Left Hand]]'' as the title of a science fiction story serialized in ''[[New Worlds Science Fiction]]'' (January–March 1963).
* The title of [[Allen Drury]]'s science fiction novel ''[[The Throne of Saturn (novel)|The Throne of Saturn]]'' comes from a quatrain which appears as the book's [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]].

Equally noteworthy are these works likewise influenced:
* The satirist and short story writer Hector Hugh Munro took his pen name of '[[Saki]]' from Edward FitzGerald's translation of the Rubaiyat.
* The American author [[O. Henry]] humorously referred to a book by "Homer KM" with the character "Ruby Ott" in his short story "The Handbook of Hymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.literaturecollection.com/a/o_henry/66/ |title=The Handbook of Hymen by O. Henry |publisher=Literaturecollection.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411200856/http://www.literaturecollection.com/a/o_henry/66/ |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; " O. Henry also quoted a quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam in "The Rubaiyat of a Scotch Highball."
* [[Oliver Herford]] released a parody of the Rubaiyat called "The Rubaiyat of a Persian Kitten" in 1904, which is notable for its charming illustrations of the kitten in question on his philosophical adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldfashionedamericanhumor.com/the-rubaiyat-of-a-persian-kitten.html |title=Old Fashioned American Humor |publisher=Old Fashioned American Humor |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The American horror author [[H P Lovecraft]] created an Arab poet [[Abdul Alhazred]] to whom was attributed a couplet:
:::That is not dead which can eternal lie
:::And with strange aeons even death may die.
:Lovecraft was obsessed with the [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]] and had no doubt read the Fitzgerald translation - the couplet follows Fitzgerald's [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] and rhyme pattern for the first half of a Khayyam quatrain.
* The artist/illustrator [[Edmund Dulac]] produced some much-beloved illustrations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldfineart.com/albums/rubaiyat-of-omar-khayyam-illustrated-by-edmund-dulac/pages/1/ |title=oldfineart.com |publisher=oldfineart.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005104159/http://www.oldfineart.com/albums/rubaiyat-of-omar-khayyam-illustrated-by-edmund-dulac/pages/1/ |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Rubaiyat, 1909.
* The play ''[[The Shadow of a Gunman]]'' (1923) by [[Seán O'Casey]] contains a reference to the ''Rubaiyat'' as the character Donal Davoren quotes "grasp this sorry scheme of things entire, and mould life nearer to the heart's desire."
* The Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] discusses ''The Rubaiyat'' and its history in an essay, "The Enigma of Edward FitzGerald" ("El enigma de Edward FitzGerald") in his book "Other Inquisitions" ("Otras Inquisiciones", 1952). He also references it in some of his poems, including "Rubaiyat" in "The Praise of the Shadow" ("Elogio de la Sombra", 1969), and "Chess" ("Ajedrez") in "The Maker" ("El Hacedor", 1960). Borges' father [[Jorge Guillermo Borges]] was the author of a Spanish translation of the FitzGerald version of The Rubaiyat.
* Science fiction author [[Paul Marlowe]]'s story "Resurrection and Life" featured a character who could only communicate using lines from the Rubaiyat.
* Science fiction author [[Isaac Asimov]] quotes ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' in his time-travel novel ''[[The End of Eternity]]''  when a character discusses whether history could be changed.
* [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schultz]] wrote a strip in which Lucy reads the ''[[Jug of Wine]]'' passage, and Linus asks "No blanket?".
* [[Wendy Cope]]'s poem "Strugnell's Rubiyat" is a close parody of the FitzGerald translation, relocated to modern day [[Tulse Hill]].
* One of the title pages of ''[[Principia Discordia]]'' (1965), a co-author of which went by the pen-name [[Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst]], features its own spin on the quatrain most quoted above:
::: A jug of wine,
::: A leg of lamb
:::: And thou!
::: Beside me,
:::: Whistling in
::::: the darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/5.php |title=Principia Discordia, the book of Chaos, Discord and Confusion |publisher=Principiadiscordia.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Lebanese writer [[Amin Maalouf]] based his novel ''[[Samarkand (novel)|Samarkand]]'' (1988) on the life of [[Omar Khayyam]], and the creation of the Rubaiyat. It details the [[Hashshashin|Assassin]] sect as well, and includes a fictional telling of how the (non-existent) original manuscript came to be on the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.
* In the opening chapter of his book ''[[God is Not Great]]'' (2007), [[Christopher Hitchens]] quotes from [[Richard Le Gallienne]]'s translation of Khayyam's famous quatrain:
:::And do you think that unto such as you
:::A maggot-minded, starved, fanatic crew
:::God gave the secret, and denied it me?
:::Well, well--what matters it? Believe that, too!
* The title of [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s memoir ''Myself when Young'' is a quote from quatrain 27 of Fitzgerald's translation:
:::Myself when young did eagerly frequent
:::Doctor and Saint, and heard great Argument
:::About it and about: but evermore
:::Came out by the same Door as in I went.

===Cinema===
* Filmmaker [[D.W. Griffith]] planned a film based on the poems as a follow-up to ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' in 1916. It was to star [[Miriam Cooper]], but when she left the Griffith company the plans were dropped;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dark Lady of the Silents |last=Cooper |first=Miriam |year=1973 |publisher=Bobbs Merrill |isbn=0672517256 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; he would ultimately film ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' instead.
* A canto was quoted and used as an underlying theme of the 1945 screen adaptation of ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'': "I sent my soul through the invisible, some letters of that after-life to spell, and by and by my soul did return, and answered, 'I myself am Heaven and Hell.'"
* The Rubaiyat was quoted in the 1946 [[King Vidor]] Western film ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'', which starred [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Jennifer Jones]]: "Oh threats of hell and hopes of paradise! One thing at least is certain: This life flies. One thing is certain and the rest is Lies; The Flower that once is blown for ever dies."
* The 1951 film ''[[Pandora and the Flying Dutchman]]'', starring [[James Mason]] and [[Ava Gardner]], opens with an illuminated manuscript of the quatrain beginning "The moving finger writes...".
* In the film ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]'' (based on the 1957 [[The Music Man|musical]]), town librarian Marian Paroo draws down the wrath of the mayor's wife for encouraging the woman's daughter to read a book of "dirty Persian poetry." Summarizing what she calls the "Ruby Hat of Omar Kayayayayay...I am ''appalled!!"'', the mayor's wife paraphrases FitzGerald's Quatrain XII from his 5th edition: "People lying out in the woods eating sandwiches, and drinking directly out of jugs with innocent young girls."
* The film ''[[Omar Khayyam (film)|Omar Khayyam]]'', also known as ''The Loves Of Omar Khayyam'', was released in 1957 by Paramount Pictures and includes excerpts from the Rubaiyat.
* In ''[[Back to the Future]]'' the character Lorraine Baines, played by [[Lea Thompson]], is holding a copy of the book in 1955 at the high school when her son Marty McFly is trying to introduce her to his father.
* The Rubaiyat was quoted in the film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' (1995) around 11 minutes in.
* In [[Adrian Lyne]]'s ''[[Unfaithful (2002 film)|Unfaithful]]'' a copy of the text in French is quoted in English: "Drink wine, this is life eternal //This, all that youth will give to you//It is the season for wine, roses//And drunken friends//Be happy for this moment//This moment is your life." The book is a gift given flirtatiously to [[Diane Lane]]'s character by [[Olivier Martinez]] who plays rare book dealer Paul Martel in the film.

===Music===
* The British composer [[Granville Bantock]] produced a choral setting of FitzGerald's translation 1906&amp;ndash;1909.
* Using FitzGerald's translation, the Armenian-American composer [[Alan Hovhaness]] set a dozen of the quatrains to music. This work, ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', Op. 308, calls for narrator, orchestra, and solo [[accordion]].
* The Rubaiyat have also influenced Arabic music. In 1950 the Egyptian singer [[Umm Kulthum]] recorded a song entitled "Rubaiyat Al-Khayyam."
* The [[Comedian Harmonists]] in "[[Wochenend und Sonnenschein]]".
* [[Woody Guthrie]] recorded an excerpt of the Rubaiyat set to music that was released on ''[[Hard Travelin' (The Asch Recordings Vol. 3)]]''.
* [[The Human Instinct]]'s album ''[[Pins In It]]'' (1971) opens with a track called "Pinzinet," the lyrics of which are based on the Rubaiyat.
* [[Elektra Records]] released a compilation album named ''[[Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary|Rubáiyát]]'' in 1990 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Elektra Records record label.
* [[Coldcut]] produced an album with a song called "Rubaiyat" on their album ''Let us Play!'' (1997).

* The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], through a unanimous opinion written in 2005 by [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] [[Leonardo Quisumbing]], quoted "The Moving Finger" when it ruled that the widow of defeated presidential candidate [[Fernando Poe Jr.]] could not substitute her late husband in his pending election protest against President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], thus leading to the dismissal of the protest.
* There was a real jewel-encrusted copy of the book on the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''. It had been crafted in 1911 by the firm of [[Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe]] in London. It was won at a [[Sotheby's]] auction in London on 29 March 1912 for £405 (a bit over $2,000 in 1912) to Gabriel Weis, an American, and was being shipped to New York. The book remains lost at the bottom of the Atlantic to this day.

'''''Saint Paul''''' (Spanish: ''San Pablo'') is a painting by  [[Diego Velázquez]] that is in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] in [[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]]. The piece was created around 1619 during the early stage of Velázquez's artistic career before he moved to Madrid.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Saint Paul {{!}} Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|url = http://www.museunacional.cat/en/colleccio/saint-paul/diego-velazquez/024242-000|website = www.museunacional.cat|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage of Velazquez's career he was deeply influenced by [[Caravaggio]]. In the image, [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] is seated holding a book, commonly referenced as a large Gospel book.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recognising saints: book and sword {{!}} Saints {{!}} National Gallery, London|url = http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/learn-about-art/paintings-in-depth/painting-saints/recognising-saints-objects/book-and-sword|website = www.nationalgallery.org.uk|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Image description ==
The painting was created using oil on canvas. The artist from [[Seville]] reveals his mastery of portraiture in the image of a man captured directly from nature and wrapped in a wide robe in which the folds are almost sculptural. The dramatic lighting that brings the figure into relief against a dark background is a style inherited from [[Tenebrism]], as are the earth-tone colors commonly used by Velázquez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Full text of "Art History, Combined Volume (4th Edition)"|url = https://archive.org/stream/arthistory_201403/0205744222_Art2_djvu.txt|website = archive.org|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They present to the viewer a natural and authentic representation of the figure. The saint is sitting on a stone plinth that blends with the background area. The fingers of the left hand grasp a thick book. Perhaps to hide his limitations, Velázquez has hidden the legs and most of the hands under its folds. 

According to José López-Rey, Saint Paul's head is "sharply drawn" and the image itself is "somewhat rubbed and darkened", a style typical of Velázquez's early works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Velazquez: Work and World|last = López-Rey|first = José|publisher = Faber and Faber|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the New Testament, Paul was traveling to Damascus when he saw a bea of light and was visited by Jesus, who struck him blind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACTS CHAPTER 9 KJV|url = http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Acts-Chapter-9/#3|website = www.kingjamesbibleonline.org|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Paul regained his sight and began to preach [[Christianity]] to the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACTS CHAPTER 9 KJV|url = http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Acts-Chapter-9/#9|website = www.kingjamesbibleonline.org|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this painting, Saint Paul is depicted wearing a large brown robe to symbolize his pilgrimage from the Holy Land to Damascus. The loose and thick cloak contains numerous creases, which suggest the heaviness of the fabric draping over a reddish/brown tunic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Saint Paul is commonly drawn with a tapering beard, brown hair, and a balding forehead to signify great wisdom and learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Velázquez's image depicts Saint Paul with black hair that has a hint of grey in it, a very uncommon attribute for this figure.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = MNAC Guide|last = |first = |publisher = Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Barcelona|pages = 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velázquez's image of Saint Paul holds a blank stare, perhaps referencing his loss of eyesight from the legend.

The text in the upper-left hand corner identifies the figure as ''S. PAVLVS'' (which means "Saint Paul" in Latin).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He is depicted without the sword, his only known attribute. (If not holding a book, Saint Paul is more grimly represented with a severed head and the sword that killed him, which depicts his martyrdom.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A glowing aura, or halo, around the head of the figure symbolizes that he has a sense of holiness and was canonized as a saint.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the aura of holiness is appropriate to the subject, the work also evokes the intellectual philosophers painted by [[José de Ribera]]. Velázquez deviated from the traditional representation of Saint Paul by drawing him with a book.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Gospel book that Saint Paul is holding symbolizes that this figure is an apostle and had a great influence on the spreading of the Christian religion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
''Saint Paul'' was painted around 1619,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; before Velázquez left Seville in 1623 to become the court painter to the Spanish King, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]. In 1921, August Mayer identified the painting as a work of Velázquez.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This image and one of Saint Thomas ([[Musée des Beaux-Arts d'Orléans|Musée des Beaux-Arts d’Orléans]]), also by Velázquez, are believed to have originally been housed at the Carthusian monastery of Las Cuevas in Seville.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The art historian Xavier Bray says the two paintings, which are similar in their dimensions, may have been part of a series of portraits of the twelve apostles Velázquez painted while still residing in Seville, the rest of which are lost.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. W., Bray, X., Velázquez, D., &amp; National Gallery (Great Britain). (2006). ''Velázquez''. London: National Gallery. p. 138. {{ISBN|9781857093032}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Velázquez's early years as a painter, he was greatly influenced by Caravaggio,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Diego Velazquez: painter and courtier|last = White|first = Jon Manchip|publisher = Hamish Hamilton|year = 1969|isbn = |location = London|pages = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the painting of Saint Paul is "considered a key work for understanding the influence of Caravaggio's pictorial realism in Spain."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Style  ==
The young Velázquez used influences from the classical literature of his day, like El Lazarillo de Tormes, as well as the beauty of his native country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Velazquez: Painter of Truth and Prisoner of the King|last = Riggs|first = Arthur Stanley|publisher = The Bobbs-Merrill Company|year = 1947|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his career grew, he continued to use colors and objects he found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Diego Velazquez: painter and courtier|last = White|first = Jon Manchip|publisher = Hamish Hamilton|year = 1969|isbn = |location = London|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to make people see his chosen subjects as they appeared to him, so he presented his figures realistically and with a "quality of immortal freshness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Velazquez: Painter of Truth and Prisoner of the King|last = Riggs|first = Arthur Stanley|publisher = The Bobbs-Merrill Company|year = 1947|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Velázquez had always been a [[Realism (arts)|realist]] and was influenced by Caravaggio and Italian Renaissance painters in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Velasquez: Great Masters in Painting and Sculpture|last = Stevenson|first = R.A.M.|publisher = George Bell &amp; Sons|year = 1902|isbn = |location = London|pages = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His use of both rough and smooth brushstrokes is "more akin to Titian's than to Caravaggio", according to José López-Rey.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Velazquez: Work and World|last = López-Rey|first = José|publisher = Faber and Faber|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velázquez was unusual among painters of his day in that he did not carefully plan his compositions or create sketches beforehand.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Secret Formulas and Techniques of the Masters|last = Maroger|first = Jacques|publisher = Hacker Art Books|year = 1979|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Velasquez: Great Masters in Painting and Sculpture|last = Stevenson|first = R.A.M.|publisher = George Bell &amp; Sons|year = 1902|isbn = |location = London|pages = 46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he analyzed his models and drew completely by eye.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; By the time Velázquez was thirty years of age, he was already well-versed in realism and did not alter the style of his artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Velasquez: Great Masters in Painting and Sculpture|last = Stevenson|first = R.A.M.|publisher = George Bell &amp; Sons|year = 1902|isbn = |location = London|pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his early career, Velázquez painted [[Bodegón|bodegones]] and figure paintings.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Velazquez: Work and Work|last = López-Rey|first = José|publisher = Faber and Faber|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodegones is a term that relates to "food, drink, or tableware."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The second style is the figure paintings he did between the years 1618 and 1622, which accentuate human expression.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Saint Paul is an example of this style, which is a clear depiction of a somber human emotion.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Velazquez: Work and World|last = López-Rey|first = José|publisher = Faber and Faber|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only twenty of Velázquez's works have been uncovered from these early years, but it is evident that he "enjoyed painting portraits."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; A "unifying religious undertone" can be viewed in the majority of Velázquez's early paintings and depict his lifelong devotion to the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Relation to other artworks ==
[[File:Diego Velázquez - The Waterseller of Seville - WGA24366.jpg|302x302px|''The Waterseller of Seville''|thumb]]
In 1618, Velázquez had rented a place in Seville, where watersellers roamed the streets.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Paintings and the Culture of Seventeenth-Century Seville|last = Tiffany|first = Tanya J.|publisher = The Pennsylvania State University Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Pennsylvania|pages = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1618 and 1620, Velázquez painted ''[[The Waterseller of Seville (Velázquez)|The Waterseller of Seville]]''. The art historian Peter Cherry believes that Velázquez used a model for this image, since Velázquez was drawn to "humble subject matter."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Cherry says that the figure "bears a resemblance to Velázquez's early Saint Paul" and believes that Velázquez used the same model for ''The Waterseller of Seville'' and the 1619 painting of Saint Paul.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The '''spectacle''' is a central notion in the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] theory, developed by [[Guy Debord]] in his 1967 book, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]''. In its limited sense, ''spectacle'' means the [[mass media]], which are "its most glaring superficial manifestation."&lt;ref name="Debord1977t24"/&gt; Debord said that the society of the spectacle came to existence in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name="Eskilson2005p377"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1988cII"/&gt;

The critique of the ''spectacle'' is a development and application of Karl Marx's concept of [[fetishism of commodities]], [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]],&lt;ref name="Debord1967SocietyI"&gt;Guy Debord (1967) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/tsots01.html Society of the Spectacle''. (Paris, June 1967). Chapter I: Separation Perfected.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the way it was reprised by [[György Lukács]] in 1923. In the society of the spectacle, the commodities rule the workers and the consumers, instead of being ruled by them, are passive subjects that contemplate the reified spectacle.

== History and influences ==

===Bernays and Adorno===
Debord claims that in its limited sense, ''spectacle'' means the [[mass media]], which are "its most glaring superficial manifestation.".&lt;ref name="Debord1977t24"&gt;Debord (1977) thesis 24&lt;/ref&gt; However [[T. J. Clark (art historian)|T. J. Clark]] regards this as a journalistic cliché. Clark argues that the spectacle came to dominate Paris during the [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] thanks to [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]]. Debord, however, said that the society of the spectacle came to existence in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name="Eskilson2005p377"&gt;Eskilson (2005) pp.377-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1988cII"&gt;Debord (1988) ''Comments on the Society of the Spectacle'', II&lt;/ref&gt; This is the period in which modern [[advertising]] and [[public relation]]s were introduced, most significantly with the innovative techniques  developed by [[Edward Bernays]] in his campaigns for the tobacco industry.&lt;ref name="Studlar2002p55"&gt;Donley T. Studlar (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=GmN9-GXTu4wC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Tobacco Control: Comparative Politics in the United States and Canada''] p.55 quotation: {{quote|...from the early days advertising has been intimately intertwined with tobacco. The man who is sometimes considered the founder of modern advertising and Madison Avenue, Edward Bernays, created many of the major cigarette campaigns of the 1920s, including having women march down the street demanding the right to smoke.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1928 book ''[[Propaganda (book)|Propaganda]]'', Bernays theorized the "conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses."&lt;ref&gt;Bernays (1928) ''[[Propaganda (book)|Propaganda]]'', ch.1&lt;/ref&gt; The critique of the society of the spectacle shares many assumptions and arguments with the critique of the ''[[culture industry]]'' made by Adorno and Horkheimer in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Eskilson (2005) p.386 n.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry F. Dahms [https://books.google.com/books?id=6xCb9wfgW3oC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159 ''No Social Science Without Critical Theory, Volume 25''] p.159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garoian, Charles R. (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qDo6q3c4jeYC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71 ''Performing Pedagogy: Toward an Art of Politics''] pp.70-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jostein Gripsrud]], Lennart Weibull (2010)  [https://books.google.com/books?id=zGJEfrbPoaMC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117 ''Media, Markets &amp; Public Spheres: European Media at the Crossroads''] p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marx and Lukács===
With ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', Debord attempted to provide the Situationist International (SI) with a Marxian [[critical theory]]. The concept of "the spectacle" expanded to all society the Marxist concept of [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] drawn from the first section of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''Capital'', entitled ''The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret thereof'' and developed by [[György Lukács]] in his work, ''History and Class Consciousness''.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} This was an analysis of the logic of commodities whereby they achieve an ideological autonomy from the process of their production, so that "social action takes the form of the action of objects, which rule the producers instead of being ruled by them."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Capital&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=August 2012}}

Developing this analysis of the logic of the commodity, ''The Society of the Spectacle'' generally understood society as divided between the passive subject who consumes the spectacle and the reified spectacle itself. In a spectacular society, the system of commodity production generates a continual stream of images, for consumption by people who lack the experiences represented therein. The spectacle represents people solely in terms of their subordination to commodities, and experience itself becomes [[Commodification|commodified]].

{{quote|text=The spectacle in general, as the concrete inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the non-living.|sign=Guy Debord, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]}}

In the opening of ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx makes the observation that within the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] we evaluate materials not by what purpose they serve or what they're actually useful for, but we instead recognize them based on their value in the market.&lt;ref name="Marx1957VolumeI"&gt;Karl Marx (1867) ''Volume I, Section 4. The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret thereof''. Das Kapital (1867).&lt;/ref&gt; In capitalist society, virtually identical products often have vastly different values simply because one has a more recognizable or prestigious [[Brand|brand name]]. The value of a [[commodity]] is abstract and not tied to its actual characteristics. Much in the same way capitalism commodifies the material world, the situationists assert that [[advanced capitalism]] commodifies experience and perception.&lt;ref name="Debord1967SocietyI"/&gt;

{{quote|We live in a spectacular society, that is, our whole life is surrounded by an immense accumulation of spectacles. Things that were once directly lived are now lived by proxy. Once an experience is taken out of the real world it becomes a commodity. As a commodity the spectacular is developed to the detriment of the real. It becomes a substitute for experience.|''Images and Everyday Life''|&lt;ref name="Law2009Images"&gt;Lawrence Law (2009) [https://archive.org/details/SpectacularTimesImagespdf ''Images and Everyday Life''].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Features and aspects of the Spectacle==

===Recuperation===
{{main|Recuperation (politics)}}
As early as 1958, in the [[Report on the Construction of Situations|situationist manifesto]], Debord described [[official culture]] as a "rigged game", where conservative powers forbid subversive ideas to have direct access to the [[public discourse]]. Such ideas get first trivialized and sterilized, and then they are safely [[Social integration|incorporated]] back within mainstream society, where they can be exploited to add new flavors to old dominant ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1957) pp.2, 10&lt;/ref&gt; This technique of the spectacle is sometimes called ''recuperation''.&lt;ref name="Chasse1969Faces"/&gt;

To survive, the spectacle must maintain [[social control]] and effectively handle all threats to the [[social order]]. [[Recuperation (sociology)|Recuperation]], a concept first proposed by [[Guy Debord]],&lt;ref name="Chasse1969Faces"&gt;Robert Chasse, Bruce Elwell, Jonathon Horelick, Tony Verlaan. (1969) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/faces.html Faces of Recuperation]''. In the American section of the Situationist International, issue #1 (New York, June 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; is the process by which the spectacle intercepts [[political radicalism|socially and politically radical]] ideas and images, [[Commodification|commodifies]] them, and safely incorporates them back within mainstream society.&lt;ref name="Chasse1969Faces"/&gt; More broadly, it may refer to the [[cultural appropriation|appropriation]] or co-opting of any subversive works or ideas by mainstream media. It is the opposite of [[détournement]], in which conventional ideas and images are reorganized and recontextualized with radical intentions.&lt;ref name="Chasse1969Faces"/&gt;

Debord discusses the close link between revolution and culture and [[everyday life]], and the reason why conservative powers are interested in forbidding them "any direct access to the rigged game of [[official culture]]." Debord recalls that worldwide revolutionary movements that emerged during the 1920s were followed by "an ebbing of the movements that had tried to advance a liberatory new attitude in culture and everyday life," and that such movements were brought to a "complete social isolation."&lt;ref&gt;Section 3 ''The Function of Minority Trends in the Period of Reflux''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different forms===
In ''Comments on the Society of the Spectacle'' (1988), Debord modified his argument, and claimed that the spectacle manifests itself in three different forms:

====The concentrated spectacle====
The spectacle associated with concentrated bureaucracy.  Debord associated this spectacular form mostly with the [[Eastern Bloc]] and [[Fascism]], although today mixed backward economies import it, and even advanced capitalist countries in times of crisis. Every aspect of life, like property, music, and communication is concentrated and is identified with the bureaucratic class. The concentrated spectacle generally identifies itself with a powerful political leader. The concentrated spectacle is made effective through a state of permanent violence and police terror.

====The diffuse spectacle====
The diffuse spectacle is the spectacle associated with advanced [[capitalism]] and commodity abundance. In the diffuse spectacle, different commodities conflict with each other, preventing the consumer from consuming the whole. Each commodity claims itself as the only existent one, and tries to impose itself over the other commodities:

{{quote|Irreconcilable claims jockey for position on the stage of the affluent economy's unified spectacle, and different star commodities simultaneously promote conflicting social policies. The automobile spectacle, for example, strives for a perfect traffic flow entailing the destruction of old urban districts, while the city spectacle needs to preserve those districts as tourist attractions.|Guy Debord|The Society of the Spectacle}}

The diffuse spectacle is more effective than the concentrated spectacle. The diffuse spectacle operates mostly through seduction, while the concentrated spectacle operates mostly through violence. Because of this, Debord argues that the diffuse spectacle is more effective at suppressing non-spectacular opinions than the concentrated spectacle.

====The integrated spectacle====
The spectacle associated with modern capitalist countries. The integrated spectacle borrows traits from the diffuse and concentrated spectacle to form a new synthesis. Debord argues that this is a very recent form of spectacular manifestation, and  that it was pioneered in France and Italy. According to Debord, the integrated spectacle goes by the label of [[liberal democracy]]. This spectacle introduces a state of permanent general secrecy, where experts and specialists dictate the morality, statistics, and opinions of the spectacle. [[Terrorism]] is the invented enemy of the spectacle, which specialists compare with their "liberal democracy", pointing out the superiority of the latter one.  Debord argues that without terrorism, the integrated spectacle wouldn't survive, for it needs to be compared to something in order to show its "obvious" perfection and superiority.

==Legacy==
A long tradition of work exists in [[political science]] on the "political spectacle"&lt;ref name="McLagan"&gt;McLagan, Meg. "Spectacles of difference: cultural activism and the mass mediation of Tibet", ''Media Worlds: Anthropology on New Terrain'', 2002, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; started with Debord;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Edelman|Edelman, Murray]] (1998) ''Constructing the political spectacle''.&lt;br/&gt;[[Lisa Wedeen|Wedeen, Lisa]] (1999) ''Ambiguities of Domination: Politics, Rhetoric, and Symbols in Contemporary Syria''.&lt;/ref&gt; many [[literary criticism|literary critics]] and [[philosopher]]s in the 20th century contributed to this analysis. According to anthropologist Meg McLagan, "Debord analyzes the penetration of the commodity form into mass communication, which he argues results in the spectacle".&lt;ref name="McLagan" /&gt; Andrew Hussey claims in his biography of Debord that the term spectacle began life not in a Marxist context, but was first borrowed from [[Nietzsche]] and his concept of the [[mass secret]]. The critic [[Sadie Plant]] argues that later theories of postmodernism, particularly those of [[Baudrillard]] and [[Lyotard]], owe much to Debord's theory, and represent an apolitical appropriation of its criticism of the unreality of life under [[late capitalism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Debord was a rebel to his core and despised academic [[commodification]] of his ideas and their integration into the diffuse spectacle.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Throughout his life he fought to make his ideas truly revolutionary. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In ''Green Illusions'', Ozzie Zehner draws largely on Debord to argue that the spectacles of solar cells, wind turbines, and other technologies have organized environmental thinking around energy-production at the expense of energy-reduction strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, NE|isbn=0803237758|pages=149–169|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjectile is a kind of ground used in artistic painting.  The word has also been used by [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] commented its use.&lt;ref name="Art of A"&gt;Derrida J., and  Thévenin, P., ''The Secret Art of Antonin Artaud'', Caws, Mary Ann, The MIT Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subjectile is seen as a theory, not a fact; as a theory the subjectile is a tool that can be employed to analyse art objects to generate hypotheses concerning the relationship between subject and object in art.

Derrida mentions that the word 'subjectile' appears in an essay&lt;ref&gt; ''L’amour de L’art'' 2, no.8, Aout 1921&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Pierre Bonnard]], published in 1921.  The subjectile refers to Bonnard’s use of cardboard for painting.
The [http://www.collinslanguage.com/bilingual-dictionaries/french Concise French dictionary] translates 'subjectile' as 'Art: support (beneath paint, etc.)'. Without a support and ground the subject of a painting could not exist as it would fall away. Derrida argues that Artaud's subjectile is both ground and a support. It is stretched out, extended, beyond, through and behind the subject, it is not alien to the subject, yet ‘It has two situations’. Derrida holds that the subjectile functions as a hypothesis, and is a subjectile itself. ‘Subjectile, the word or the thing, can take the place of the subject or of the object – being neither one nor the other.’&lt;ref name="Art of A"/&gt;

[[Antonin Artaud]] mentions the subjectile three times in his writing.[[Jacques Derrida]], in his essay, ''To Unsense the Subjectile''  states ‘All three times, he is speaking of his own drawings, in 1932, 1946, and 1947’.&lt;ref name="Art of A"/&gt; The first time Artaud used the word was in a letter to André Rolland de Renéville, ‘Herewith a bad drawing in which what is called the subjectile betrayed me.’&lt;ref&gt;See: The original text, published in French, Artaud, Antonin, ''Oeuvres Completes'', [http://www.gallimard.fr/catalog/html/actu/index/index_artaud.html Gallimard] 1964 volume V, pp. 119 - 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946, ‘This drawing is grave attempt to give life and existence to what until today had never been accepted in art, the botching of the subjectile, the piteous awkwardness of forms crumbling around an idea after having for so many eternities labored to join it. The page is soiled and spoiled, the paper crumpled, the people drawn with the consciousness of a child.’&lt;ref&gt;See: The original text, published in French, Artaud, Antonin, ''Oeuvres Completes'', Gallimard 1984 volume XIX, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally in February 1947, ‘The figures on the inert page said nothing under my hand. They offered themselves to me like millstones which would not inspire the drawing, and which I could cut. Scrap, file, sew, unsew, slash, and stitch without the subjectile ever complaining through father or through mother.’&lt;ref&gt;See: Paule Thevenin records the source as ‘Text of February 1947, written by Artaud at Ville-Évrard. Thevenin, Paule, Derrida, Jacques, ''Antonin Artaud, Dessins et Portraits'' Gallimard, 1986. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Derrida's essay was first published in French titled ''Forcener le Subjectile'' in 1986 by Gallimard and an abridged  English translation &lt;ref&gt; Jacques Derrida and Mary Ann Caws, ''Maddening the Subjectile'', Yale French Studies, No. 84, Boundaries: Writing &amp; Drawing (1994), pp. 154-171 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2930185 Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt; was  published later (in 1998 by MIT press). For copyright reasons the images published in the Gallimard book were excluded from the later English translation, which contains instead photographs of Artaud taken by Georges Pastier in 1947, the year before Artaud died.&lt;ref name="Art of A"/&gt;

The subjectile is also commented on by [[Susan Sontag]] in her introduction to the edited translation of Artaud's works.&lt;ref&gt;Artaud, A. 1988 [http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520064430 Selected Writings], (ed.) Susan Sontag, Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and further in ''The Antonin Artaud Critical Reader'', which includes texts by [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Susan Sontag]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, E.

'''Talespinner Children's Theatre (TCT)''' is a professional theater for child audiences based in  [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. Its inaugural season began in early 2012, and since its inception has been based in the Reinberger Auditorium in the [[Gordon Square (Cleveland)#Gordon Square|Gordon Square]] neighborhood in the city's Near West Side.

TCT specializes in presenting imaginative original work inspired by or adapted from classic tales from world literature. To date, each play produced (adapted from fables, folktales, myths and literature) has been an original work commissioned by TCT from a Cleveland-area playwright. Presented on the thrust, platform stage in the Reinberger Auditorium, productions feature small ensembles of adult actors, utilizing puppets, dance, movement, music and song and fantastical costumes to bring each play to life for young audiences.&lt;ref name="TCT Homepage"&gt;[http://talespinnerchildrenstheatre.org] Home page&lt;/ref&gt;

TCT also provides theater-arts classes for children throughout the year.&lt;ref name="classes"&gt;[http://fox8.com/2013/09/06/my-town-talespinner-childrens-theatre-arts-classes/ Fox 8 - My Town: Talespinner Children’s Theatre Arts Classes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by Artistic Director [[Alison Garrigan]], TCT has a board of directors and paid staff.&lt;ref name="TCT Homepage" /&gt;

==Critical Response==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3173">The '''Terra Foundation for American Art''' is a privately operated nonprofit organization dedicated to the support of American art exhibitions, projects, academic research, and publications worldwide. Its goal is to promote a greater understanding and appreciation of the cultural and artistic heritage of the United States through the acquisition, study, and display of works of American art. 
The Foundation was established by [[Daniel J. Terra]] in 1978 along with the [[Terra Museum|Terra Museum of American Art]], which opened in 1980. Terra was a businessman and art collector who used his own collection of influential American art to realize the goals of the Foundation. The Foundation is headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

The Terra Foundation uses its endowment to award grants for exhibitions, fellowships, symposia, research, publications, and academic programs, with a special focus on international initiatives and local Chicago initiatives. It works closely with educators, scholars, curators, and museums. 

Despite the closure of the Museum in 2004, the Foundation continues to actively collect paintings, sculptures, works on paper, and other objects representing achievement in American art from the late eighteenth century to 1945. The collection currently comprises hundreds of works by artists such as [[John Singleton Copley]], [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Winslow Homer]], [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Edward Hopper]]. The Foundation lends these works to institutions and exhibitions worldwide and maintains a comprehensive database of the collection. A selection of Terra Foundation paintings remains on long-term loan to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], and the Art Institute also houses the Foundation’s collection of works on paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j4VSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ar4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5633,5554224&amp;dq=terra-foundation&amp;hl=en|date= June 22, 2003 |work=Telegraph-Herald |title=Terra Museum of American Art to close }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New exhibit on Terra firma;Collections unite to capture 'the sweep of American culture' |url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=109A7AE4DDC3F448&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|author=Misha Davenport |date= April 14, 2005 |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation has longstanding presence in France. In 1992, it opened the [[Musée d'Art Américain Giverny]], a museum managed in partnership with the French government and the [[Musée d’Orsay]] which focuses on international impressionism. In 2009, the Terra Foundation opened its Paris Center to support its programs in Europe. The Paris Center houses the only research library in Europe dedicated exclusively to American art and transatlantic artistic exchange.

'''''The Canterbury Tales''''' ({{lang-enm|Tales of Caunterbury}}{{refn|The name "Tales of Caunterbury" appears within the surviving texts of Chaucer's work. Its modern name first appeared as {{lang|enm|Canterbury talys}} in [[John Lydgate]]'s 1421–1422 prologue to the ''Siege of Thebes''.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, David.

Accessed 6 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}) is a collection of 24 stories that runs to over 17,000 lines written in [[Middle English]] by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] between 1387 and 1400.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Canterbury-Tales Encyclopedia Brittanica]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1386, Chaucer became Controller of Customs and Justice of Peace and, in 1389, Clerk of the King's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Medieval People: Vivid Lives in a Distant Landscape|last = Prestwich|first = Michael|publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson|year = 2014|isbn = 9780500252031 |location = London|pages = 4. An Age of Plague 1300–1400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during these years that Chaucer began working on his most famous text, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The tales (mostly written in [[verse (poetry)|verse]], although some are in [[prose]]) are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of [[pilgrim]]s as they travel together from London to [[Canterbury]] to visit the shrine of Saint [[Thomas Becket]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the [[The Tabard|Tabard Inn]] at Southwark on their return.

After a long list of works written earlier in his career, including ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[House of Fame]]'', and ''[[Parlement of Foules|Parliament of Fowls]]'', ''The Canterbury Tales'' is near-unanimously seen as Chaucer's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. He uses the tales and descriptions of its characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church. Chaucer's use of such a wide range of classes and types of people was without precedent in English. Although the characters are fictional, they still offer a variety of insights into customs and practices of the time. Often, such insight leads to a variety of discussions and disagreements among people in the 14th century. For example, although various social classes are represented in these stories and all of the pilgrims are on a spiritual quest, it is apparent that they are more concerned with worldly things than spiritual. Structurally, the collection resembles Giovanni Boccaccio's ''[[The Decameron]]'', which Chaucer may have read during his first diplomatic mission to [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] in 1372.

It has been suggested that the greatest contribution of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to [[English literature]] was the popularisation of the English [[vernacular]] in mainstream literature, as opposed to French, Italian or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language centuries before Chaucer's time, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries—[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], [[the Pearl Poet]], and [[Julian of Norwich]]—also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was seminal in this evolution of literary preference.

While Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems, the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for nobility.

''The Canterbury Tales'' is generally thought to have been incomplete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the [[General Prologue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Geoffrey Chaucer (1342–1400) "The Canterbury Tales" (in middle english and modern english)|url = http://www.librarius.com/cantales.htm|website = www.librarius.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; some 30 pilgrims are introduced. According to the Prologue, Chaucer's intention was to write four stories from the perspective of each pilgrim, two each on the way to and from their ultimate destination, St. Thomas Becket's shrine (making for a total of about 120 stories). Although perhaps incomplete, ''The Canterbury Tales'' is revered as one of the most important works in English literature. It is also open to a wide range of interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature|last = Black|first = Joseph|publisher = Broadview Press|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Canada|pages = 229–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The question of whether ''The Canterbury Tales'' is a finished work has not been answered to date. There are 84 manuscripts and four [[incunabula]] (printed before c 1540) editions of the work, dating from the late medieval and early Renaissance periods, more than for any other vernacular literary text with the exception of ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]''. This is taken as evidence of the ''Tales''' popularity during the century after Chaucer's death.&lt;ref name="Pearsall, 8"&gt;Pearsall, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-five of these manuscripts are thought to have been originally complete, while 28 are so fragmentary that it is difficult to ascertain whether they were copied individually or as part of a set.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 6—7&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tales'' vary in both minor and major ways from manuscript to manuscript; many of the minor variations are due to copyists' errors, while it is suggested that in other cases Chaucer both added to his work and revised it as it was being copied and possibly as it was being distributed. Determining the text of the work is complicated by the question of the narrator's voice which Chaucer made part of his literary structure. 

Even the oldest surviving manuscripts of the ''Tales'' are not Chaucer's originals. The very oldest is probably MS Peniarth 392 D (called "[[Hengwrt Chaucer|Hengwrt]]"), written by a scribe shortly after Chaucer's death. The most beautiful, on the other hand, is the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]], a manuscript handwritten by one person with illustrations by several illustrators; the tales are put in an order that many later editors have followed for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 10, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to be published in print was [[William Caxton]]'s 1476 edition. Only 10 copies of this edition are known to exist, including one held by the [[British Library]] and one held by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]. 

In 2004, Linne Mooney claimed that she was able to identify the [[scrivener]] who worked for Chaucer as an [[Adam Pinkhurst]]. Mooney, then a professor at the [[University of Maine]] and a visiting fellow at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], said she could match Pinkhurst's signature, on an oath he signed, to his handwriting on a copy of ''The Canterbury Tales'' that might have been transcribed from Chaucer's working copy.&lt;ref&gt;Linne R. Mooney (2006), "Chaucer's Scribe," ''Speculum'', '''81''' : 97–138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jul/20/highereducation.books] Ezard, John.

===Order===
{{main article|Order of The Canterbury Tales|List of The Canterbury Tales characters}}
In the absence of consensus as to whether or not a complete version of the ''Tales'' exists, there is also no general agreement regarding the order in which Chaucer intended the stories to be placed.&lt;ref name = seven&gt;Cooper, 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Textual and manuscript clues have been adduced to support the two most popular modern methods of ordering the tales. Some scholarly editions divide the ''Tales'' into ten "Fragments". The tales that make up a Fragment are closely related and contain internal indications of their order of presentation, usually with one character speaking to and then stepping aside for another character. However, between Fragments, the connection is less obvious. Consequently, there are several possible orders; the one most frequently seen in modern editions follows the numbering of the Fragments (ultimately based on the Ellesmere order).&lt;ref name = seven/&gt; Victorians frequently used the nine "Groups", which was the order used by [[Walter William Skeat]] whose edition ''Chaucer: Complete Works'' was used by Oxford University Press for most of the twentieth century, but this order is now{{when|date=March 2018}} seldom followed.&lt;ref name = seven/&gt;

An alternative ordering (seen in an early manuscript containing ''The Canterbury Tales'', the early-fifteenth century [[Harley MS. 7334]]) places Fragment VIII before VI. Fragments I and II almost always follow each other, just as VI and VII, IX and X do in the oldest manuscripts. Fragments IV and V, by contrast, vary in location from manuscript to manuscript.

Chaucer wrote in late Vernacular Middle English, which has clear differences from Modern English. From philological research, we know certain facts about the pronunciation of English during the time of Chaucer. Chaucer pronounced ''-e'' at the end of words, so that ''care'' was {{IPA-enm|ˈkaːrə|}}, not {{IPAc-en|k|ɛər}} as in Modern English. Other silent letters were also pronounced, so that the word ''knight'' was {{IPA|[kniçt]}}, with both the ''k'' and the ''gh'' pronounced, not {{IPAc-en|n|aɪ|t}}. In some cases, vowel letters in Middle English were pronounced very differently from Modern English, because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] had not yet happened. For instance, the long ''e'' in ''wepyng'' "weeping" was pronounced as {{IPA-enm|eː|}}, as in modern German or Italian, not as {{IPAc-en|iː}}. Below is an [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription of the opening lines of ''The Merchant's Prologue'':

Although no manuscript exists in Chaucer's own hand, two were copied around the time of his death by [[Adam Pinkhurst]], a scribe with whom he seems to have worked closely before, giving a high degree of confidence that Chaucer himself wrote the ''Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;Linne R. Mooney, "Chaucer’s Scribe", ''Speculum'', 81 (2006), 97–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the final ''-e'' sound was lost soon after Chaucer's time, scribes did not accurately copy it, and this gave scholars the impression that Chaucer himself was inconsistent in using it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ian Robinson, ''Chaucer's Prosody: A Study of the Middle English Verse Tradition'' (London: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; It has now been established, however, that ''-e'' was an important part of Chaucer's grammar, and helped to distinguish singular adjectives from plural and subjunctive verbs from indicative.&lt;ref&gt;Seminal studies included M. L. Samuels, "Chaucerian Final '-e'", ''Notes and Queries'', 19 (1972), 445–48, and D. Burnley, "Inflection in Chaucer's Adjectives", ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 83 (1982), 169–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

No other work prior to Chaucer's is known to have set a collection of tales within the framework of pilgrims on a pilgrimage. It is obvious, however, that Chaucer borrowed portions, sometimes very large portions, of his stories from earlier stories, and that his work was influenced by the general state of the literary world in which he lived. Storytelling was the main entertainment in England at the time, and storytelling contests had been around for hundreds of years. In 14th-century England the English Pui was a group with an appointed leader who would judge the songs of the group. The winner received a crown and, as with the winner of ''The Canterbury Tales'', a free dinner. It was common for pilgrims on a pilgrimage to have a chosen "master of ceremonies" to guide them and organise the journey.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Bloom]] suggests that the structure is mostly original, but inspired by the "pilgrim" figures of Dante and Virgil in ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''.&lt;ref name="Harold Bloom"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Road Trip|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Bloom-t.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 September 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; New research suggests that the General Prologue, in which the innkeeper and host Harry Bailey introduces each pilgrim, is a pastiche of the historical Harry Bailey's surviving 1381 poll-tax account of Southwark's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=A Southwark Tale: Gower, the 1381 Poll Tax, and Chaucer’s ''The Canterbury Tales''|journal=Speculum|date=2017|volume=92|issue=3|pages=630–660|doi=10.1086/692620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Decameron]]'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] contains more parallels to ''The Canterbury Tales'' than any other work. Like the ''Tales'', it features a number of narrators who tell stories along a journey they have undertaken (to flee from the [[Black Death]]). It ends with an apology by Boccaccio, much like [[Chaucer's Retraction]] to the ''Tales''. A quarter of the tales in ''The Canterbury Tales'' parallel a tale in the ''Decameron'', although most of them have closer parallels in other stories. Some scholars thus find it unlikely that Chaucer had a copy of the work on hand, surmising instead that he must have merely read the ''Decameron'' at some point,&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; while a new study claims he had a copy of the ''Decameron'' and used it extensively as he began work on his own collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/971521732|title=Chaucer's ''Decameron'' and the Origin of the Canterbury Tales|last=Biggs|first=Frederick M.|others=D.S. Brewer,|isbn=9781843844754|location=Cambridge|oclc=971521732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the tales has its own set of sources that have been suggested by scholars, but a few sources are used frequently over several tales. They include poetry by [[Ovid]], the Bible in one of the many vulgate versions in which it was available at the time (the exact one is difficult to determine), and the works of [[Petrarch]] and [[Dante]]. Chaucer was the first author to use the work of these last two, both Italians. [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' appears in several tales, as the works of [[John Gower]] do. Gower was a known friend to Chaucer. A full list is impossible to outline in little space, but Chaucer also, lastly, seems to have borrowed from numerous religious encyclopaedias and liturgical writings, such as [[John Bromyard]]'s ''[[Summa praedicantium]]'', a preacher's handbook, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Against Jovinianus|Adversus Jovinianum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, pp. 12–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars say there is a good possibility [[Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio|Chaucer met Petrarch or Boccaccio]].&lt;ref name="Brewer227"&gt;Brewer, p. 227. ''Although Chaucer undoubtedly studied the works of these celebrated writers, and particularly of Dante before this fortunate interview; yet it seems likely, that these excursions gave him a new relish for their compositions, and enlarged his knowledge of the Italian fables.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewer277"&gt;Brewer, p. 277. ''...where he became thoroughly inbued with the spirit and excellence of the great Italian poets and prose-writers: Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio; and is said to have had a personal contact interview with one of these, Petrarch.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendrickson183-192"&gt;Hendrickson, pp. 183–192. Professor G. L. Hendrickson of the University of Chicago gives a detailed analysis as to Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch.&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Rearden, p. 458. ''There can be no moral doubt but that Chaucer knew Petrarch personally. They were both in France many times, where they might have met. They were both courtiers. They both had an enthusiasm for scholarship. Whether they met then, or whether Chaucer, when on his visit to Genoa, specially visited the Italian, it does not appear.'' ''...but the only reason that such a visit could not have occurred lies in the fact that Petrarch himself does not record it. Still, on the other hand, would he have mentioned the visit of a man who was the servant of a barbarous monarch, and whose only claim to notice, literary-wise, was his cultivation of an unknown and uncouth dialect that was half bastard French?''&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Skeat (1874), p. xxx. '' And we know that Petrarch, on his own shewing, was so pleased with the story of Griselda that he learnt it by heart as well as he could, for the express purpose of repeating it to friends, before the idea of turning it into Latin occurred to him. Whence we may conclude that Chaucer and Petrarch met at Padua early in 1373; that Petrarch told Chaucer the story by word of mouth, either in Italian or French; and that Chaucer shortly after obtained a copy of Petrarch's Latin version, which he kept constantly before him whilst making his own translation.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre and structure==
[[File:Canterbury-Cathedral-Church-of-England-1890-1900.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the north west [[circa]] 1890–1900 (retouched from a black &amp; white photograph)]]
''The Canterbury Tales'' is a collection of stories built around a frame narrative or [[frame tale]], a common and already long established genre of its period. Chaucer's ''Tales'' differs from most other story "collections" in this genre chiefly in its intense variation. Most story collections focused on a theme, usually a religious one. Even in the ''Decameron'', storytellers are encouraged to stick to the theme decided on for the day. The idea of a [[pilgrimage]] to get such a diverse collection of people together for literary purposes was also unprecedented, though "the association of pilgrims and storytelling was a familiar one".&lt;ref&gt;"Sources and Analogues of the Canterbury Tales", 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Introducing a competition among the tales encourages the reader to compare the tales in all their variety, and allows Chaucer to showcase the breadth of his skill in different genres and literary forms.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the structure of the ''Tales'' is largely linear, with one story following another, it is also much more than that. In the ''General Prologue'', Chaucer describes not the tales to be told, but the people who will tell them, making it clear that structure will depend on the characters rather than a general theme or moral. This idea is reinforced when the Miller interrupts to tell his tale after the Knight has finished his. Having the Knight go first gives one the idea that all will tell their stories by class, with the Monk following the Knight. However, the Miller's interruption makes it clear that this structure will be abandoned in favour of a free and open exchange of stories among all classes present. General themes and points of view arise as the characters tell their tales, which are responded to by other characters in their own tales, sometimes after a long lapse in which the theme has not been addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, Chaucer does not pay much attention to the progress of the trip, to the time passing as the pilgrims travel, or to specific locations along the way to Canterbury. His writing of the story seems focused primarily on the stories being told, and not on the pilgrimage itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Hengwrt Chaucer (f.2.r) title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales in the hand of Adam Pinkhurst, c.1400]]

The variety of Chaucer's tales shows the breadth of his skill and his familiarity with many literary forms, linguistic styles, and rhetorical devices. Medieval schools of rhetoric at the time encouraged such diversity, dividing literature (as [[Virgil]] suggests) into high, middle, and low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary. Another popular method of division came from [[St. Augustine]], who focused more on audience response and less on subject matter (a Virgilian concern). Augustine divided literature into "majestic persuades", "temperate pleases", and "subdued teaches". Writers were encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker, subject, audience, purpose, manner, and occasion. Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles, showing favouritism to none.&lt;ref name="empathy article"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/tuesday-tome-canterbury-tales-geoffrey-chaucer/|title=Puppetry and the "Popet:" Fiction, Reality, and Empathy in Geoffrey Chaucer’s ''Canterbury Tales''|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=December 29, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience, but the other pilgrims within the story as well, creating a multi-layered rhetorical puzzle of ambiguities. Thus Chaucer's work far surpasses the ability of any single medieval theory to uncover.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this, Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of readers, focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with a skill proportional to their social status and learning. However, even the lowest characters, such as the Miller, show surprising rhetorical ability, although their subject matter is more lowbrow. Vocabulary also plays an important part, as those of the higher classes refer to a woman as a "lady", while the lower classes use the word "wenche", with no exceptions. At times the same word will mean entirely different things between classes. The word "pitee", for example, is a noble concept to the upper classes, while in the ''Merchant's Tale'' it refers to sexual intercourse. Again, however, tales such as the ''Nun's Priest's Tale'' show surprising skill with words among the lower classes of the group, while the ''Knight's Tale'' is at times extremely simple.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaucer uses the same meter throughout almost all of his tales, with the exception of ''Sir Thopas'' and his prose tales. It is a [[decasyllable]] line, probably borrowed from French and Italian forms, with [[riding rhyme]] and, occasionally, a [[caesura]] in the middle of a line. His meter would later develop into the heroic meter of the 15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of [[iambic pentameter]]. He avoids allowing couplets to become too prominent in the poem, and four of the tales (the Man of Law's, Clerk's, Prioress', and Second Nun's) use [[rhyme royal]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context and themes==
[[File:DeathWatTylerFull.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 is mentioned in the ''Tales''.]]

''The Canterbury Tales'' was written during a turbulent time in English history. The Catholic Church was in the midst of the [[Western Schism]] and, although it was still the only Christian authority in Europe, it was the subject of heavy controversy. [[Lollardy]], an early English religious movement led by [[John Wycliffe]], is mentioned in the ''Tales'', which also mention a specific incident involving pardoners (sellers of [[indulgences]], which were believed to relieve the temporal punishment due for sins that were already forgiven in the [[Sacrament of Confession]]) who nefariously claimed to be collecting for St. Mary Rouncesval hospital in England. ''The Canterbury Tales'' is among the first English literary works to mention paper, a relatively new invention that allowed dissemination of the written word never before seen in England. Political clashes, such as the [[Peasants' Revolt|1381 Peasants' Revolt]] and clashes ending in the deposing of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], further reveal the complex turmoil surrounding Chaucer in the time of the ''Tales''' writing. Many of his close friends were executed and he himself moved to [[Kent]] to get away from events in London.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some readers look to interpret the characters of ''The Canterbury Tales'' as historical figures, other readers choose to interpret its significance in less literal terms. After analysis of Chaucer's diction and historical context, his work appears to develop a critique of society during his lifetime. Within a number of his descriptions, his comments can appear complimentary in nature, but through clever language, the statements are ultimately critical of the pilgrim's actions. It is unclear whether Chaucer would intend for the reader to link his characters with actual persons. Instead, it appears that Chaucer creates fictional characters to be general representations of people in such fields of work. With an understanding of medieval society, one can detect subtle satire at work.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Howard, ''Chaucer and the Medieval World'' (London, 1987), pp. 410–417.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The ''Tales'' reflect diverse views of the Church in Chaucer's England. After the [[Black Death]], many Europeans began to question the authority of the established Church. Some turned to [[lollardy]], while others chose less extreme paths, starting new monastic orders or smaller movements exposing church corruption in the behaviour of the clergy, false [[relic|church relics]] or abuse of [[indulgences]].&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 49–51, 56–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Several characters in the ''Tales'' are religious figures, and the very setting of the pilgrimage to Canterbury is religious (although the prologue comments ironically on its merely seasonal attractions), making religion a significant theme of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two characters, the Pardoner and the Summoner, whose roles apply the Church's secular power, are both portrayed as deeply corrupt, greedy, and abusive. Pardoners in Chaucer's day were those people from whom one bought Church "indulgences" for forgiveness of sins, who were guilty of abusing their office for their own gain. Chaucer's Pardoner openly admits the corruption of his practice while hawking his wares.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 61–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Summoners were Church officers who brought sinners to the Church court for possible excommunication and other penalties. Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing them to protect their interests. Chaucer's Summoner is portrayed as guilty of the very kinds of sins for which he is threatening to bring others to court, and is hinted as having a corrupt relationship with the Pardoner.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Friar's Tale]], one of the characters is a summoner who is shown to be working on the side of the devil, not God.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|left|The murder of [[Thomas Becket]]]]
Churchmen of various kinds are represented by the Monk, the Prioress, the Nun's Priest, and the Second Nun. Monastic orders, which originated from a desire to follow an ascetic lifestyle separated from the world, had by Chaucer's time become increasingly entangled in worldly matters. Monasteries frequently controlled huge tracts of land on which they made significant sums of money, while peasants worked in their employ.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 73–75, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Nun is an example of what a Nun was expected to be: her tale is about a woman whose chaste example brings people into the church. The Monk and the Prioress, on the other hand, while not as corrupt as the Summoner or Pardoner, fall far short of the ideal for their orders. Both are expensively dressed, show signs of lives of luxury and flirtatiousness and show a lack of spiritual depth.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 91–95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Prioress's Tale]] is an account of Jews murdering a deeply pious and innocent Christian boy, a [[blood libel against Jews]] that became a part of English literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; The story did not originate in the works of Chaucer and was well known in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/depts/chaucer/zatta/prioress.html "The Prioress's Tale"], by Prof. Jane Zatta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilgrimage was a very prominent feature of medieval society. The ultimate pilgrimage destination was Jerusalem,&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 99–102.&lt;/ref&gt; but within England Canterbury was a popular destination. Pilgrims would journey to cathedrals that preserved relics of saints, believing that such relics held miraculous powers. [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]], Archbishop of Canterbury, had been murdered in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by knights of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during a disagreement between Church and Crown. Miracle stories connected to his remains sprang up soon after his death, and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage destination.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 110–113.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrimage in the work ties all of the stories together and may be considered a representation of Christians' striving for heaven, despite weaknesses, disagreement, and diversity of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 117–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social class and convention===
[[File:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|[[Bors]]' Dilemma – he chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]]]

The upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire, was in Chaucer's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield yet mannerly in the King's Court and Christian in their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 123–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Knights were expected to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them, but an even stronger bond with a woman whom they idealised to strengthen their fighting ability.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action, its conflicting values often degenerated into violence. Church leaders frequently tried to place restrictions on jousts and tournaments, which at times ended in the death of the loser. [[The Knight's Tale]] shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealise. To win her, both are willing to fight to the death. Chivalry was on the decline in Chaucer's day, and it is possible that The Knight's Tale was intended to show its flaws, although this is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 139–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer himself had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] under [[Edward III]], who heavily emphasised chivalry during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Two tales, ''[[Sir Topas]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'' are told by Chaucer himself, who is travelling with the pilgrims in his own story. Both tales seem to focus on the ill-effects of chivalry—the first making fun of chivalric rules and the second warning against violence.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tales'' constantly reflect the conflict between classes. For example, the division of [[Estates of the realm|the three estates]]: the characters are all divided into three distinct classes, the classes being "those who pray" (the clergy), "those who fight" (the nobility), and "those who work" (the commoners and peasantry).&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the tales are interlinked by common themes, and some "quit" (reply to or retaliate against) other tales. Convention is followed when the Knight begins the game with a tale, as he represents the highest social class in the group. But when he is followed by the Miller, who represents a lower class, it sets the stage for the ''Tales'' to reflect both a respect for and a disregard for upper class rules. Helen Cooper, as well as Mikhail Bakhtin and Derek Brewer, call this opposition "the ordered and the grotesque, [[Lent]] and [[Carnival]], officially approved culture and its riotous, and high-spirited underside."&lt;ref name=opp&gt;Cooper, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Several works of the time contained the same opposition.&lt;ref name=opp/&gt;

===Relativism versus realism===
Chaucer's characters each express different—sometimes vastly different—views of reality, creating an atmosphere of [[Playspace|testing]], [[empathy]], and [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="empathy article" /&gt; As [[Helen Cooper (professor)|Helen Cooper]] says, "Different genres give different readings of the world: the [[fabliau]] scarcely notices the operations of God, the saint's life focuses on those at the expense of physical reality, tracts and sermons insist on prudential or orthodox morality, romances privilege human emotion." The sheer number of varying persons and stories renders the ''Tales'' as a set unable to arrive at any definite truth or reality.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liminality===
The concept of [[liminality]] figures prominently within ''The Canterbury Tales''.&lt;ref name="empathy article" /&gt; A liminal space, which can be both geographical as well as metaphorical or spiritual, is the transitional or transformational space between a “real” (secure, known, limited) world and an unknown or imaginary space of both risk and possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Norma J. "Liminal Space in Travellers’ Tales: Historical and Fictional Passages (Folklore, Ritual, History).” Order No. 8615152 The Pennsylvania State University, 1986. Ann Arbor: ProQuest. Web. 30 Sep. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a pilgrimage is itself a liminal experience, because it centres on travel between destinations and because pilgrims undertake it hoping to become more holy in the process. Thus, the structure of ''The Canterbury Tales'' itself is liminal; it not only covers the distance between London and Canterbury, but the majority of the tales refer to places entirely outside the geography of the pilgrimage. Jean Jost summarises the function of liminality in ''The Canterbury Tales'',

"Both appropriately and ironically in this raucous and subversive liminal space, a ragtag assembly gather together and tell their equally unconventional tales. In this unruly place, the rules of tale telling are established, themselves to be both disordered and broken; here the tales of game and earnest, solas and sentence, will be set and interrupted. Here the sacred and profane adventure begins, but does not end. Here, the condition of peril is as prominent as that of protection. The act of pilgrimaging itself consists of moving from one urban space, through liminal rural space, to the next urban space with an ever fluctuating series of events and narratives punctuating those spaces. The goal of pilgrimage may well be a religious or spiritual space at its conclusion, and reflect a psychological progression of the spirit, in yet another kind of emotional space."&lt;ref&gt;Jost, Jean. “Urban and Liminal Space in Chaucer’s Knight’s Tale: Perilous or Protective?” Albrecht Classen, ed. Fundamentals of Medieval and Early Modern Culture : Urban Space in the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Age. Berlin, DEU: Walter de Gruyter, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liminality is also evident in the individual tales. An obvious instance of this is the [[The Friar's Tale|Friar’s Tale]] in which the yeoman devil is a liminal figure because of his transitory nature and function; it is his purpose to issue souls from their current existence to hell, an entirely different one.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Morton W. “The ‘Friar’s Tale’ as a Liminal Tale.” The Chaucer Review 17.4 (1983): 286–291. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The Franklin's Tale|Franklin’s Tale]] is a [[Breton lai|Breton Lai]] tale, which takes the tale into a liminal space by invoking not only the interaction of the supernatural and the mortal, but also the relation between the present and the imagined past.&lt;ref&gt;Nowlin,  Steele. “Between Precedent and Possibility: Liminality, Historicity, and Narrative in Chaucer's ‘The Franklin's Tale.’" Studies in Philology 103.1 (2006): 47–67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on literature==
It is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to [[English literature]] was in popularising the literary use of the [[vernacular]] English, rather than French or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language for centuries before Chaucer's life, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries—[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and [[the Pearl Poet]]—also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Although Chaucer had a powerful influence in poetic and artistic terms, which can be seen in the great number of forgeries and mistaken attributions (such as ''[[The Floure and the Leafe]]'', which was translated by [[John Dryden]]), modern English spelling and orthography owe much more to the innovations made by the [[Court of Chancery]] in the decades during and after his lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Reception==
[[File:Chaucer ellesmere.jpg|thumb|left|Chaucer as a Pilgrim from the [[Ellesmere manuscript]].]]
[[File:Wife-of-Bath-ms.jpg|thumb|right|Opening prologue of [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]] from the Ellesmere Manuscript.]]

While Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems (the ''[[Book of the Duchess]]'' is believed to have been written for [[John of Gaunt]] on the occasion of his wife's death in 1368), the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a [[court poet]] who wrote exclusively for the nobility. He is referred to as a noble translator and poet by [[Eustache Deschamps]] and by his contemporary John Gower. It has been suggested that the poem was intended to be read aloud, which is probable as this was a common activity at the time. However, it also seems to have been intended for private reading as well, since Chaucer frequently refers to himself as the writer, rather than the speaker, of the work. Determining the intended audience directly from the text is even more difficult, since the audience is part of the story. This makes it difficult to tell when Chaucer is writing to the fictional pilgrim audience or the actual reader.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 294-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaucer's works may have been distributed in some form during his lifetime in part or in whole. Scholars speculate that manuscripts were circulated among his friends, but likely remained unknown to most people until after his death. However, the speed with which copyists strove to write complete versions of his tale in manuscript form shows that Chaucer was a famous and respected poet in his own day. The Hengwrt and Ellesmere manuscripts are examples of the care taken to distribute the work. More manuscript copies of the poem exist than for any other poem of its day except ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]'', causing some scholars to give it the medieval equivalent of bestseller status. Even the most elegant of the illustrated manuscripts, however, is not nearly as highly decorated as the work of authors of more respectable works such as [[John Lydgate]]'s religious and historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 295-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===15th century===
John Lydgate and [[Thomas Occleve]] were among the first critics of Chaucer's ''Tales'', praising the poet as the greatest English poet of all time and the first to show what the language was truly capable of poetically. This sentiment was universally agreed upon by later critics into the mid-15th century. Glosses included in ''The Canterbury Tales'' manuscripts of the time praised him highly for his skill with "sentence" and rhetoric, the two pillars by which medieval critics judged poetry. The most respected of the tales was at this time the Knight's, as it was full of both.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 298–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary additions and supplements==
The incompleteness of the ''Tales'' led several medieval authors to write additions and supplements to the tales to make them more complete. Some of the oldest existing manuscripts of the tales include new or modified tales, showing that even early on, such additions were being created. These emendations included various expansions of the ''Cook's Tale'', which Chaucer never finished, ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', ''[[The Tale of Gamelyn]]'', the ''[[Siege of Thebes (Lydgate)|Siege of Thebes]]'', and the ''[[Tale of Beryn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, Stephanie, ''Congenial Souls: Reading Chaucer from Medieval to Postmodern'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2002, p. 86. {{ISBN|0-8166-3823-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tale of Beryn'', written by an anonymous author in the 15th century, is preceded by a lengthy prologue in which the pilgrims arrive at Canterbury and their activities there are described. While the rest of the pilgrims disperse throughout the town, the Pardoner seeks the affections of Kate the barmaid, but faces problems dealing with the man in her life and the innkeeper Harry Bailey. As the pilgrims turn back home, the Merchant restarts the storytelling with ''Tale of Beryn''. In this tale, a young man named Beryn travels from Rome to Egypt to seek his fortune only to be cheated by other businessmen there. He is then aided by a local man in getting his revenge. The tale comes from the French tale ''[[Bérinus]]'' and exists in a single early manuscript of the tales, although it was printed along with the tales in a 1721 edition by [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]].&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, pp. 86–88, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Lydgate wrote ''The Siege of Thebes'' in about 1420. Like the ''Tale of Beryn'', it is preceded by a prologue in which the pilgrims arrive in Canterbury. Lydgate places himself among the pilgrims as one of them and describes how he was a part of Chaucer's trip and heard the stories. He characterises himself as a monk and tells a long story about the history of Thebes before the events of the ''Knight's Tale''. John Lydgate's tale was popular early on and exists in old manuscripts both on its own and as part of the ''Tales''. It was first printed as early as 1561 by [[John Stow]], and several editions for centuries after followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, pp. 88–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are actually two versions of ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', both of which are influenced by the story ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', a work written during Chaucer's lifetime. Chaucer describes a Plowman in the ''General Prologue'' of his tales, but never gives him his own tale. One tale, written by [[Thomas Occleve]], describes the miracle of the Virgin and the Sleeveless Garment. Another tale features a pelican and a griffin debating church corruption, with the pelican taking a position of protest akin to [[John Wycliffe]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Charlotte, ''Editing Piers Plowman: The Evolution of the Text'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 8–9. {{ISBN|0-521-34250-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Tale of Gamelyn'' was included in an early manuscript version of the tales, Harley 7334, which is notorious for being one of the lower-quality early manuscripts in terms of editor error and alteration. It is now widely rejected by scholars as an authentic Chaucerian tale, although some scholars think he may have intended to rewrite the story as a tale for the Yeoman. Dates for its authorship vary from 1340 to 1370.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlgren, Thomas, ''Medieval Outlaws'', Parlor Press, 2005, pp. 264–265. {{ISBN|1-932559-62-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary adaptations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}

Many literary works (both fiction and non-fiction alike) have used a similar frame narrative to ''The Canterbury Tales'' as an homage. Science-fiction writer [[Dan Simmons]] wrote his [[Hugo Award]] winning novel ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'' based on an extra-planetary group of pilgrims. Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used ''The Canterbury Tales'' as a structure for his 2004 non-fiction book about [[evolution]] titled ''[[The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution]]''. His animal pilgrims are on their way to find the common ancestor, each telling a tale about evolution.

[[Henry Dudeney]]'s book ''[[The Canterbury Puzzles]]'' contains a part reputedly lost from what modern readers know as Chaucer's tales.

Historical-mystery novelist [[P.C. Doherty]] wrote a series of novels based on ''The Canterbury Tales'', making use of both the story frame and Chaucer's characters.

Canadian author [[Angie Abdou]] translates ''The Canterbury Tales'' to a cross section of people, all snow-sports enthusiasts but from different social backgrounds, converging on a remote back-country ski cabin in British Columbia in the 2011 novel ''The Canterbury Trail''.

==Adaptations and homages==
''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, a retelling of "The Knight's Tale", was first performed in 1613 or 1614 and published in 1634. In 1961, [[Erik Chisholm]] completed his opera, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The opera is in three acts: The Wyf of Bath’s Tale, The Pardoner’s Tale and The Nun’s Priest’s Tale. [[Nevill Coghill]]'s modern English version formed the basis of a musical [[Canterbury Tales (musical)|version]] that was first staged in 1964.

''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'', a 1944 film jointly written and directed by [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]], is loosely based on the narrative frame of Chaucer's tales. The movie opens with a group of medieval pilgrims journeying through the Kentish countryside as a narrator speaks the opening lines of the ''General Prologue''. The scene then makes a [[Match cut#Notable examples|now-famous transition]] to the time of World War II. From that point on, the film follows a group of strangers, each with his or her own story and in need of some kind of redemption, who are making their way to Canterbury together. The film's main story takes place in an imaginary town in Kent and ends with the main characters arriving at Canterbury Cathedral, bells pealing and Chaucer's words again resounding. ''A Canterbury Tale'' is recognised as one of the Powell-Pressburger team's most poetic and artful films. It was produced as wartime propaganda, using Chaucer's poetry, referring to the famous pilgrimage, and offering photography of Kent to remind the public of what made Britain worth fighting for. In one scene a local historian lectures an audience of British soldiers about the pilgrims of Chaucer's time and the vibrant history of England.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Steve, ''Chaucer at Large'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2000, pp. 64–65. {{ISBN|0-8166-3376-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s 1972 film ''[[The Canterbury Tales (film)|The Canterbury Tales]]'' features several of the tales, some of which keep close to the original tale and some of which are embellished. The ''Cook's Tale'', for instance, which is incomplete in the original version, is expanded into a full story, and the ''Friar's Tale'' extends the scene in which the Summoner is dragged down to hell. The film includes these two tales as well as the ''Miller's Tale'', the ''Summoner's Tale'', the ''Wife of Bath's Tale'', and the ''Merchant's Tale''.&lt;ref&gt;Pencak, William, ''The Films of Derek Jarman'', Jefferson: McFarland &amp; Co, 2002, pp. 178–9. {{ISBN|0-7864-1430-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 1986, American radio personality [[Garrison Keillor]] opened "The News from Lake Wobegon" portion of the first live TV broadcast of his ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio show with a reading of the original Middle English text of the General Prologue.  He commented, "Although those words were written more than 600 years ago, they still describe spring."

Television adaptations include [[Alan Plater]]'s 1975 re-telling of the stories in a series of plays for BBC2: ''[[Trinity Tales]]''. In 2003, BBC again featured [[The Canterbury Tales (TV series)|modern re-tellings of selected tales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/canterburytales/ |title=BBC – Drama – Canterbury Tales |accessdate=6 May 2007 |work=[[BBC]] Drama article about the series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caravaggio]] created one of his most admired altarpieces, '''''The Entombment of Christ''''', in 1603–1604 for the second chapel on the right in [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]] (the ''Chiesa Nuova''), a church built for the [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri]].&lt;ref name=Hibbard&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=Caravaggio|year=1985|publisher=Westview Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780064301282|pages=171–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the painting is now in the chapel, and the original is in the [[Vatican Pinacoteca]].

==History==
On 11 July 1575, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] (1572-1585) issued a [[Papal bull|bull]] confirming the formation of a new society called the Oratory and granting it the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella. Two months after the bull, the rebuilding of the church commenced. Envisaged in the planned reconstruction of the Chiesa Nuova (new church), as it became known, was the dedication of all the altars to the mysteries of the Virgin. Starting in the left transept and continuing around the five chapels on either side of the nave to the right transept, the altars are dedicated to the [[Presentation of Mary|Presentation of the Temple]], the [[Annunciation]], the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], the [[Adoration of the Shepherds]], the [[Circumcision of Jesus|Circumcision]], the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], the [[Pietà]], the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], the Ascension, the [[Descent of the Holy Spirit|Descent of the Holy Ghost]], the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] and the [[Coronation of the Virgin|Coronation]].&lt;ref name=Graeve&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graeve|first1=Mary Ann|title=The Stone of Unction in Caravaggio's Painting for the Chiesa Nuova|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=September 1958|volume=40|issue=3|pages=223–238|doi=10.2307/3047779|jstor=3047779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Entombment'' was probably planned and begun in 1602/3.&lt;ref name=Hibbard/&gt; The chapel in which the ''Entombment'' was to be hung, was dedicated to the ''Pietà'', and was founded by [[Pietro Vittrice]], a friend of Pope Gregory XIII and close follower of [[Filippo Neri]].&lt;ref name=Langdon&gt;{{cite book|last=Langdon|first=Helen|title=Caravaggio: A Life|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813337944|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Caravaggio.html?id=PHwNAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Capella della Pietà occupied a 'privileged' position in the Chiesa Nuova: [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] could be celebrated from it and it was granted special indulgences.&lt;ref name=Graeve/&gt;

The chapel, placed in the right nave of the Chiesa Nuova, was conceded to Vittrice in June 1577, and the foundation of the chapel ratified in September 1580. Some time after his death in March 1600, a legacy of 1,000 scudi became available for the maintenance of the chapel, and it was built in 1602, which is then held to be the earliest date for the commission of Caravaggio's painting.&lt;ref name=Sickel/&gt; Indeed, on 1 September 1604, it is described as 'new' in a document recording that it had been paid for by [[Girolamo Vittrice]], Pietro's nephew and heir.&lt;ref name=Hibbard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Graham-Dixon&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham-Dixon|first=Andrew|title=Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780241954645|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lI76naiYuMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girolamo Vittrice had a direct connection with Caravaggio: in August 1586 he married Orinzia di Lucio Orsi, the sister of Caravaggio's friend [[Prospero Orsi]] and the niece of the humanist [[Aurelio Orsi]]. Aurelio, in turn, was a one-time mentor to the young [[Maffeo Barberini]], who became Pope Urban VIII in 1623. It is through these connections that Girolamo's son, [[Alessandro Vittrice|Alessandro]], became bishop of Alatri in 1632, and was able to bestow the gift of Caravaggio's ''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|Fortune Teller]]'' (now in the [[Louvre]]) on [[Pope Innocent X|Pope Innocent X Pamphilij]] after being appointed governor of Rome in 1647.&lt;ref name=Sickel/&gt;

The painting was universally admired and written about by such critics as [[Giulio Mancini]],{{efn|"The ''Cristo Deposto'' is in the Chiesa Nuova."

==Composition==
[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned edit.jpg|thumb|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'' (1498–1499), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]].]]
This [[counter-reformation]] painting &amp;ndash; with a diagonal cascade of mourners and cadaver-bearers descending to the limp, dead Christ and the bare stone &amp;ndash; is not a moment of transfiguration, but of mourning. As the viewer's eye descends from the gloom there is, too, a descent from the hysteria of [[Mary of Clopas]] through subdued emotion to death as the final emotional silencing. Unlike the gored post-[[crucifixion]] [[Jesus]] in morbid [[Spanish art|Spanish]] displays, [[Italian art|Italian]] [[Christ]]s die generally bloodlessly, and slump in a geometrically challenging display. As if emphasizing the dead Christ's inability to feel pain, a hand enters the wound at his side.  His body is one of a muscled, veined, thick-limbed laborer rather than the usual, bony-thin depiction.

Two men carry the body. [[John the Evangelist]], identified only by his youthful appearance and red cloak supports the dead Christ on his right knee and with his right arm, inadvertently opening the wound. [[Nicodemus]] (with the face of [[Michelangelo]]) grasps the knees in his arms, with his feet planted at the edge of the slab. Caravaggio balances the stable, dignified position of the body and the unstable exertions of the bearers.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Georgia|title=Caravaggio's Entombment Considered in Situ|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=March 1978|volume=60|issue=1|pages=35–42|doi=10.2307/3049742|jstor=3049742}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pieta Bandini Opera Duomo Florence n01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Michelangelo's ''Florentine Pietà'' (1547–1553), Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence]]
While faces are important in painting generally, in Caravaggio it is important always to note where the arms are pointing. Skyward in ''[[Conversion on the Way to Damascus|The Conversion of Saint Paul on the Road to Damascus]]'', towards Levi in [[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|''The Calling of Saint Matthew'']]. Here, the dead God's fallen arm and immaculate shroud touch stone; the grieving [[Mary of Cleophas]] gesticulates to [[Heaven]]. In some ways, that was the message of Christ: God come to earth, and mankind reconciled with the heavens. As usual, even with his works of highest devotion, Caravaggio never fails to ground himself. In the center is [[Mary Magdalene]], drying her tears with a white handkerchief, face shadowed.  Tradition held that the Virgin Mary be depicted as eternally young, but here Caravaggio paints the Virgin as an old woman. The figure of the [[Virgin Mary]] is also partially obscured behind John; we see her in the robes of a nun and her arms are held out to her side, imitating the line of the stone they stand upon. Her right hand hovers above his head as if she is reaching out to touch him. Seen together, the three women constitute different, complementary expressions of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;The Museo del Prado. The Entombment of Christ, Caravaggio. n.d. 3 July 2015. &lt;https://www.museodelprado.es/en/exhibitions/exhibitions/at-the-museum/la-obra-invitada-emel-descendimientoem-caravaggio/la-obra/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The left figure imitates the costume from Caravaggio's ''[[Penitent Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Penitent Magdalene]]'' ([[Doria Pamphilj Gallery]], Rome); the right figure reminds us of his Mary in ''[[Martha and Mary Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Conversion of the Magdalene]]'' ([[Detroit Institute of Art]]).&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt; [[Andrew Graham-Dixon]] asserts that these figures were modelled by [[Portrait of a Courtesan (Caravaggio)|Fillide Melandroni]], a frequent model in his works and about 22 years old at the time.&lt;ref name=Graham-Dixon/&gt;
[[File:Raffaello, pala baglioni, deposizione.jpg|thumb|Raphael's ''Deposition'' (1507), [[Galleria Borghese]], Rome]]
Caravaggio's composition also seems to be related to Michelangelo's ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'' as [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peters]] (especially in the figure of the Madonna),&lt;ref name=Hibbard/&gt; and his ''[[The Deposition (Michelangelo)|Florentine Pietà]]'' (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence), from which he takes the figure of Nicodemus. In the latter case, Caravaggio transports Michelangelo self-portrait to his own painting.&lt;ref name=Stechow&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wolfgang Stechow|authorlink1=Wolfgang Stechow|chapter=Joseph of Arimathea or Nicodemus|editor1-last=Lotz|editor1-first=Wolfgang|editor2-last=Moeller|editor2-first=Lise Lotte|title=Studien zur toskanischen Kunst : Festschrift für Ludwig Heinrich Heydenreich|date=1964|location=Munich|pages=289–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Caravaggio's Entombment of Christ is related to Michelangelo's Pieta, it is not a Pieta because even if there is the presence of the Virgin Mary in the painting there are not the right number nor types of people present.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Vatican Museums, Discover the history, the works of art, the collections|last=Bertoldi|first=Susanna|publisher=Sillabe|year=2011|isbn=978-88-8271-210-5|location=Vatican City|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio also sets up a comparison with Raphael by using as a source for the main group, that of [[Raphael|Raphael's]] ''[[The Deposition (Raphael)|Borghese Deposition]]''. This comparison contrasts [[High Renaissance]] idealism with Caravaggio's own naturalism.

Caravaggio's Entombment  of Christ is not a Burial because the body of Christ is not being lowered on to a tomb but instead being laid on a stone slab.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Interpretations ==
[[File:Jacopo Pontormo - Kreuzabnahme Christi.jpg|thumb|150px|Jacopo Pontormo, ''Deposition from the Cross'' (ca. 1525–1528), Church of Santa Felicita, Florence]]
Caravaggio's painting is a visual counterpart to the Mass, with the priest raising the newly consecrated host with the ''Entombment'' as a backdrop. The privileged placement of the altar would have meant that this was a daily occurrence; the act perfectly juxtaposing the body in the picture with the host as the priest intones "This is my very body." [[Jacopo Pontormo]]'s ''[[The Deposition from the Cross (Pontormo)|Deposition]]'' (ca. 1525–1528) in Florence performs a similar function, similarly displayed over an altar. Such pictures are presentations of the ''[[Corpus Domini]]'' rather than enactments of the deposition of entombment of Christ.&lt;ref name=Hibbard/&gt;
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden 013.1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Roger van der Weyden, ''Lamentation'' (ca. 1460–1463), Uffizi Gallery, Florence]]
Starting in the 17th-century, Caravaggio's picture has been considered a scene of active burial. This interpretation was based on heroic formula derived from antique sources, that of [[Adonis]] or [[Meleager]]: head thrown back and one arm hanging limply by the side. Indeed, Raphael's ''Borghese Deposition'' is an example of this formula. The placing of Christ's body on a flat stone also had precedents in painting, notably [[Roger van der Weyden]]'s ''[[Lamentation of Christ (van der Weyden)|Lamentation]]'' in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence.&lt;ref name=Graeve/&gt;

On closer inspection, Caravaggio painting does not fit this formula, since these ancient types are transportation scenes, whereas his, as in Van der Weyden's case, is decidedly not. Instead the composition assumes the traditional pyramidal shape of a traditional ''Pietà'' type. Given the interpretation of the picture as a ''Pietà'' type, the flat stone (previously interpreted as a lid or door to a tomb) can be reinterpreted as a reference to the Stone of Unction, today enshrined in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] at [[Jerusalem]]. This stone was used to place Christ's body when it was anointed and wound in linen clothes, as related in the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref name=Graeve/&gt;

Seldom noticed by modern viewers is Caravaggio's insertion of the plant in the lower left of the ''Entombment''. Commonly called mullein, ''[[Verbascum thapsus]]'' was thought to have medicinal properties and was said to ward off evil spirits. It was associated with the iconography of [[Saint John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Eric Marshall|title=Albrecht Altdorfer's botanical attribute for Saint John the Baptist|journal=Notes in the History of Art|date=Winter 1996|volume=15|issue=2|pages=15–21|jstor=23205516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio also uses it in his ''[[Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|Saint John the Baptist]]'' and ''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Caravaggio)|Rest on the Flight into Egypt]]''.&lt;ref name=Witting&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witting|first1=Felix|last2=Patrizi|first2=M.L.|title=Michelangelo da Caravaggio|date=2012|publisher=Parkstone International|location=New York|isbn=9781780427270|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Meaning of Liff''''' (UK Edition: {{ISBN|0-330-28121-6}}, US Edition: {{ISBN|0-517-55347-3}}) is a humorous [[dictionary]] of [[toponymy]] and [[etymology]], written by [[Douglas Adams]] and [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]],&lt;ref name="GD"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/15/douglas-adams-meaning-of-liff|title=Douglas Adams's Meaning of Liff redefined|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=15 October 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the United Kingdom in 1983 and the United States in 1984.

==Content==
The book is a "dictionary of things that there aren't any words for yet".&lt;ref name="art1"&gt;Gartner, Michael (15 March 1987). [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/104356826.html?dids=104356826:104356826&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+15%2C+1987&amp;author=By+Michael+Gartner&amp;pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&amp;desc=WORDS&amp;pqatl=google Words], ''[[Newsday]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than inventing new words, Adams and Lloyd picked a number of existing place-names and assigned interesting meanings to them,&lt;ref name="parkvall"&gt;{{cite book|title=Limits of Language: Almost Everything You Didn't Know about Language and Languages|first=Mikael|last=Parkvall|year=2006|publisher=William James &amp; Company|isbn=1590281985}}&lt;/ref&gt; meanings that can be regarded as on the verge of social existence and ready to become recognisable entities.&lt;ref name="kalaga"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nebulae of discourse: interpretation, textuality and the subject|first=Wojciech|last=Kalaga|year=1997|publisher=Peter Lang Pub.|isbn=082043289X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the words listed are [[toponyms]] and describe common feelings and objects for which there is no current English word. Examples are ''[[Shoeburyness]]'' ("The vague uncomfortable feeling you get when sitting on a seat that is still warm from somebody else's bottom") and ''[[Plymouth]]'' ("To relate an amusing story to someone without remembering that it was they who told it to you in the first place").

The book cover usually bears the tagline "This book will change your life", either as part of its cover or as an [[adhesive label]]. ''[[Liff, Angus|Liff]]'' (a village near [[Dundee]] in Scotland) is then defined in the book as "A book, the contents of which are totally belied by its cover. For instance, any book the [[dust jacket]] of which bears the words, 'This book will change your life'."

==Origin and publication==
According to Adams' account, the idea behind ''The Meaning of Liff'' grew out of an old school game and started when he and Lloyd were on holiday together in [[Corfu]] in 1978 during the writing of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|first Hitchhiker's novel]].&lt;ref name=GD/&gt;&lt;ref name=hitchhiker&gt;{{cite book|title=Hitchhiker|first=M.J.|last=Simpson|year=2003|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|isbn=0-340-82489-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was used as part of the ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' spin-off book ''Not 1982'' ({{ISBN|0-571-11853-4}}), where they were headed "Today's new word from the Oxtail English Dictionary". The suggestion of turning this into a complete book in itself came from Faber MD [[Matthew Evans, Baron Evans of Temple Guiting|Matthew Evans]]. The bulk of the text was written by Adams and Lloyd in Summer 1982 in [[Malibu, California]].&lt;ref name=hitchhiker /&gt;

Essentially the same idea was used by the English humourist [[Paul Jennings (UK author)|Paul Jennings]] in an article ''Ware, Wye, Watford'', published in the late 1950s. Adams speculated that the teacher who originated the school game may have done so after reading the article. He sent a note of apology to Jennings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams &amp; The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy|isbn=1-85286-411-7|first=Neil|last=Gaiman|publisher=Titan Books|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow humourist [[Miles Kington]] defended Adams and Lloyd in his column in ''The Times'', noting a difference in style.

The book was released in the UK in November 1983 in time for the Christmas market. It was a commercial success for [[Pan Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The rising of the lark: Britain's best-selling books|date=29 December 1983|publisher=Financial Times|first=Arthur|last=Sandles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the book was chosen to be very similar to [[Monty Python]]'s film ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' that was being produced at the same time, after Douglas Adams called [[Terry Jones]] to ask if it would be OK. Adams' idea was that the potential confusion with the film's script would help to sell more copies of the book.&lt;ref&gt;John Lloyd explained this in a BBC Radio 4 Documentary of the Week, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the book's publication, which included guest star Terry Jones (first aired 1 March 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in the beginning of the Monty Python film, the gravestone with the title "The Meaning of Liff" appears before a lightning bolt strikes the last F and converts it to an E.

==Versions==
A revised and expanded edition of the original book, with about twice as many definitions, was published in 1990 as '''''The Deeper Meaning of Liff''''' (UK Edition: {{ISBN|0-330-31606-0}}, US Edition: {{ISBN|0-517-58597-9}}), though the original remains in print. Some of the new words in ''Deeper'' had previously appeared in a Liff piece by Adams, Lloyd and [[Stephen Fry]] in ''[[The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book]]'' (1986). The main differences between the two editions (for either version of the book) are those of American English v. British English spellings, though ''The Deeper Meaning of Liff'' contains different definitions for both the word "Glossop" and the titular word "Liff". In ''The Deeper Meaning of Liff'', Liff is defined as a phenomenon for which there is no word.

Another edition in the series, ''Afterliff'', has been released, with more entries contributed by Lloyd, [[Jon Canter]] and Douglas Adams' daughter Polly.&lt;ref name=GD /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/09/afterliff-douglas-adams-jon-canter|title=Afterliff: The spirit of Douglas Adams|last=Canter|first=Jon|date=9 August 2013|work=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 2013, a 30th anniversary deluxe edition was published.&lt;ref name="deluxe1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://upcoming4.me/news/book-news/the-30th-anniversary-edition-of-the-meaning-of-liff-by-douglas-adams-and-john-lloyd-coming-out-on-15th-august|title=The 30th Anniversary edition of The Meaning of Liff by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd coming out on 15th August |last=|first=|date=7 October 2013|work=Upcoming4.me|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German adaptation was made by Sven Böttcher under the title ''Der tiefere Sinn des Labenz'', published in 1992 ({{ISBN|3-453-87960-0}}). The meanings are translated from the original but are matched to place names that convey the humorous effect in German. The most recent edition includes both the German adaptation and the English original ({{ISBN|3-453-87960-0}}).
 
In 1989, a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] version was published under the title ''Kunt U Breukelen?'' by Justus van Oel (Nijgh &amp; van Ditmar, {{ISBN|90 236 7311 5}}), utilising the same book size format as the standard UK version, 9.1 x 16.8&amp;nbsp;cm. The book used place names mainly from the Netherlands, as well as a handful from neighbouring Belgium and [[Luxembourg]]. There was no hardback edition, and neither was ''The Deeper Meaning of Liff'' adapted for the Dutch market. It was reissued in 2000 with a different cover.

The Finnish adaptations "Elimäen tarkoitus" and "Elimäen perimmäinen tarkoitus" were published in 1996 and 1997 ({{ISBN|952-9646-26-7}} and {{ISBN|952-9646-52-6}}).

Following the 2005 movie and the TV adaptations of ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' and ''Dirk Gently'', there was talk from ITV, never as yet acted upon, of a TV version of ''The Meaning Of Liff''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Comedian Anders Lund Madsen wrote a Danish version with the title ''Madsens ÆØÅ - Dictionary of things for which there funnily enough not yet exists words for'', published 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''''The Prison - A Book With A Soundtrack''''' (or simply '''''The Prison''''') is Michael Nesmith's seventh solo album of his post-[[Monkees]] career and his first to be released under his own record label, [[Pacific Arts]]. It includes a novella meant to be read while listening to the album as its "soundtrack". In 1994 Nesmith recorded a companion novella/album entitled ''[[The Garden (Michael Nesmith album)|The Garden]]''.  According to Nesmith's website (Videoranch), a third installment titled ''The Ocean'' has been released and completes the Infinitia trilogy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videoranch.com/html/frnezfaq.html Videoranch website FAQs.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Prison'' and ''The Garden'' were re-released together on CD in 2004 by Video Ranch.

==Critical reception==
[[Allmusic]] called ''The Prison'' "a brilliant multimedia concept marrying the personal and inner visual experience of Michael "Papa Nez" Nesmith's novella with the aural medium of an equally original soundtrack." [[Robert Christgau]] called it a "ghastly boxed audio-allegory-with-book."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Michael+Nesmith Robert Christgau mention of The Prison.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remixes==
"The Prison" was dramatically remixed by Michael Nesmith for CD release on "Rio Records" in 1990, and again in 2007 on "Edsel Records". Some changes on both remixes include the removal or addition of drum machines, extra reverb on vocals (in the case of the 2007 remix, a new or alternate lead vocal track in places), and many other changes. &lt;BR&gt;Although the iTunes download of "The Prison" is credited in the iTunes store as the 1990 remix, it is actually the 2007 remix. As of September 2013, the original mix that appeared on vinyl has not been officially released on CD.

'''''The Triumph of Bacchus''''' (Greek title is ''Ο Θρίαμβος του Βάκχου'') is a painting by [[Diego Velázquez]], now in the [[Museo del Prado]], in [[Madrid]]. It is popularly known as '''''Los borrachos''''' or ''The Drinkers'' (politely, also ''The Drunks'').

Velázquez painted ''The Triumph of Bacchus'' after arriving in [[Madrid]] from [[Seville]] and just before his voyage to [[Italy]]. The work was painted for [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], who paid Velázquez 100 [[ducats]] for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Triumph of Bacchus, or the Drinkers|url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-triumph-of-bacchus-or-the-drunkards/|work=On-line gallery|publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting shows [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] surrounded by drunks. In Madrid, Velázquez was able to study the king's collection of Italian paintings and was no doubt struck by the [[nudity]] in many paintings as well as the treatment of [[mythology|mythological]] subjects.

''The Triumph of Bacchus'' has been described as the masterpiece of Velázquez's 1620s paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxhDegm5N7oC&amp;pg=PA116|title=Painting in Spain: 1500-1700|page=116|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|publisher=Yale University Press|date=1998|isbn=0300064748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Niccoò Frangipane (attr) Bacchanal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Niccolò Frangipane]] (d. 1597, attributed to) ''Bacchanal''. Here too Bacchus has brought a single companion from the world of mythology.]]
In the work, Bacchus is represented as a person at the center of a small celebration, but his [[skin]] is paler than that of his companions, rendering him more easily recognizable. Unusually, the rest of the group, apart from the figure naked to the waist behind the god, are in the contemporary costume of poor people in 17th-century Spain. The work represents Bacchus as the god who rewards or gifts men with wine, temporarily releasing them from their problems. In [[Baroque literature]], Bacchus was considered an [[allegory]] of the liberation of man from the slavery of daily life.

The scene can be divided in two halves. On the left, there is the very luminous Bacchus figure, his dominant but relaxed pose somewhat reminiscent of that of Christ in many ''[[Last Judgement]]'' scenes, who is often shown seated and naked to the waist. Bacchus and the character behind him are represented in the traditional loose robes used for depictions of classical myth. The idealization of the god's face is highlighted by the clear [[light]] which illuminates him in a more [[classicism|classicist]] style.&lt;ref name= "MM"&gt;'''L. Cirlot''' (org.), ''Museo del Prado II'', Col. "Museos del Mundo", Volume 7, Espasa, 2007. {{ISBN|978-84-674-3810-9}}, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; The right side, however, presents some drunkards, men of the streets that invite us to join their party, with a very [[Spain|Spanish]] atmosphere similar to [[José de Ribera]] in style. There is no idealization present in their large and worn-out faces, though the figure kneeling in front of the god is younger and better dressed than the others, with a sword and tall boots. The light which illuminates Bacchus is absent on this side; the figures are shown with [[chiaroscuro]] and have much darker skin.

In this work, Velázquez adopted a realist treatment of a mythological subject, a tendency he would pursue further during the following years.

There are various elements of [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] in this work, such as the [[bottle]] and [[pitcher (container)|pitcher]] which appear on the ground close to the god's feet; Velázquez employed the contrast of the god's bright body to lend relief and texture to the bottle and pitcher, creating something akin to a [[still life]]. These jars are very similar to the ones which appear in paintings made by Velázquez during his period in Seville, and the combination of still life elements of naturalistic genre figures relates to the ''[[bodegon]]'' subjects he painted there.

== Influence ==
The ''Triumph of Bacchus'' received a number of rather grand and elaborate idealized treatments in Renaissance art, of which [[Titian]]'s ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'', then in the Spanish royal collection, was an imaginative variant. Usually Bacchus was processing in a chariot drawn by leopards, with a retinue of [[satyr]]s and revellers, including his guardian [[Silenus]].  The use of the title for Velázquez's painting is almost ironic given the very different treatment here. 
  
One inspiration for Velázquez is Caravaggio's treatments of religious subjects combining central figures in traditional iconographical robes with subsidiary figures in contemporary dress, and [[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera's]] naturalistic portraits of figures from antiquity, sometimes depicted as [[beggar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Harris in the Khan video&lt;/ref&gt;  Entertainments hosted by Bacchus appear as an occasional subject in art from the Renaissance onwards, as one type of the wider subject of the [[Feast of the gods (art)|''Feast of the gods'' in art]]: around 1550 [[Taddeo Zuccari]] painted a large feast at the ''Wedding of Bacchus and Ariadne'' in fresco in the [[Villa Giulia]], Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, H. (1998), ''Flemish art and architecture, 1585–1700'', p. 105, Yale University Press Pelican history of art. New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0300070381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some paintings show Bacchus with revellers in contemporary modern dress, as in the Frangipane illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;For example [[:File:Bastianino Baco Cassa Risparmio Ferrara.jpg|this]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Wallinger]] argued that ''The Triumph of Bacchus'' prefigured ''[[Las Meninas]]'' and stated, "Velázquez presents us with a complexity of focal points. [...] The look [the two liggers on the left of Bacchus] direct at the viewer slices clean through 350 years in the most disconcerting way. [...] However one might describe them, we are made complicit in the meaning of the work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/9613047/The-painting-that-changed-my-life.html|title=The painting that changed my life|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=October 17, 2012|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Train of Thought''' is an evolving community arts journey from west to east coast, with on-board activities and over 20 stops along the way. '''Train of Thought''' is produced by Toronto's [[Jumblies Theatre]] with partners all across Canada and will be taking place May and June 2015.

== History ==

'''Train of Thought''' was hatched by a group of artists sharing community engagement practices and projects across the country. Its focus is collaborations and alliances between First Nations and settler/immigrant artists and communities.

== Themes ==

In developing the idea for '''Train of Thought''', [[Jumblies Theatre]] and partners asked what theme merited such a huge cross-country undertaking, a question that led to a focus on collaborations and alliances between First Nations and settler/immigrant artists and communities: the most challenging and urgent matter that all of us are grappling with and learning about from our different regional and cultural perspectives. Thus, '''Train of Thought''' takes a counter-colonial route to collect and share stories, buried histories and imagined landscapes of the land where we live: as it might have been, as it is, as it could be: drawing on perception, memory, history and imagination; merging whimsy and serious intent, bringing together artists and community members, the land’s first people and all those who have found refuge here over the years and generations.

== Production ==

'''Train of Thought''' is an evolving community arts journey from west to east coast, with on-board activities and over stops along the way. At each stop, a travelling company will get off until the next train comes through. Local arts organizations will host interactive events, and add to creative tasks. Additional travellers will hop aboard to join in conversations and art-making en route.

== Purpose ==

'''Train of Thought''' is less about trains than about the relationships and discoveries that the journey will enable. The tour is an imperfect and incomplete adventure - part of a longer and unending imperative to learn, connect and help to change tracks.

[[File:Suushi Yurei.jpg|thumb|''Yūrei'' by Sawaki Sūshi (1737)]]
'''''Yūrei-zu''''' (幽霊図) are a genre of Japanese art consisting of painted or woodblock print images of ghosts, demons and other supernatural beings. They are considered to be a subgenre of ''fūzokuga'', "pictures of manners and customs."&lt;ref name="Schaap 1998, 17"&gt;Schaap 1998, 17&lt;/ref&gt; These types of art works reached the peak of their popularity in Japan in the mid- to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Addis"&gt;Addis 1985, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Yūrei''==
Literally translatable as ‘faint (''yū'' - 幽) spirit (''rei'' - 霊),’ ''[[yūrei]]'' is just one of several Japanese words used to refer to spirit beings. Other terms include: ''[[obake]]'' (お化け), ''[[yōkai]]'' (妖怪), ''bōrei'' (亡霊), and ''[[shiryō]]'' (死霊). There is a long tradition of belief in the supernatural in Japan stemming from a variety of influences. Imported sources include [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and [[List of supernatural beings in Chinese folklore|Chinese folklore]]. The most notable influence, however, is [[Shinto|Shintō]], a native Japanese [[animism|animistic religion]] which presupposes that our physical world is inhabited by eight million omnipresent spirits.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese ghosts are essentially spirits "on leave" from hell in order to complete an outstanding mission.&lt;ref name="Richie 1983, 7"&gt;Richie 1983, 7&lt;/ref&gt; The souls (''reikon'' - 霊魂) of those who die violently, do not receive proper funerary rites, or die while consumed by a desire for vengeance, do not pass peacefully to join the spirits of their ancestors in the afterlife. Instead, their ''reikon'' souls are transformed into ''ayurei'' souls, which can travel back to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;Monstrous.com&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddhist belief, the journey from the world of the living (''konoyo'' - この世) to that of the dead (''anoyo'' - あの世) takes 49 days, and it is in this limbo-like phase that they can attend to unresolved issues.&lt;ref&gt;Iwasaki and Toelken 1994, 15&lt;/ref&gt; There is a close relationship between the degree of an individual’s suffering in life and the severity of their actions in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan 1985, 27&lt;/ref&gt; While their intentions are not always evil, the results of their actions are almost always damaging for the humans involved.&lt;ref name="Richie 1983, 7"/&gt; Belief held that a ghost could only receive release through the prayers of a living individual that his/her soul be allowed to pass into the underworld.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

==Historical background ==
[[File:Shimobe Fudesuke and the Ghost of the Woman in the Waterfall LACMA M.84.31.442.jpg|thumb|''Shimobe Fudesuke and the Ghost of the Woman in the Waterfall'' by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (c. 1865)]]
Images of supernatural beings, as well as gory and grotesque scenes exist on Japanese painted scrolls going back to the medieval period. This tradition continued through the centuries, providing a foundation for ''yūrei-zu'', as well as for violent ''chimidoro-e'' (“bloody pictures” - 血みどろ絵) and ''muzan-e'' (“cruel pictures” - 無残絵) which were to become popular in [[Edo period|Edo Japan]].&lt;ref name="Fensom 2012"&gt;Fensom 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are prior examples, ''yūrei-zu'' reached the pinnacle of their popularity in the mid- through late 19th century,&lt;ref name="Addis" /&gt; along with ghost themed ''[[kabuki]]'' plays and ghost tales (''[[kaidan]]'' - 怪談).&lt;ref name="Schaap 1998, 17"/&gt; Scholars link the "persistent popularity"&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2004, 140&lt;/ref&gt; of the occult to the "unsettled social conditions" prevailing during the late Edo,&lt;ref name="Addis" /&gt; which included the oppressive [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] regime, the beginnings of westernization, and a number of natural disasters.
&lt;ref&gt;See Addis 1985, 178; Rubin 2000; Harris 2010, 156; Schaap 1998, 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In addition to floods and earthquakes, Japan was blighted by a series of droughts which led to twenty periods of famine between 1675 and 1837 (Dolan and Worden 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Yūrei-zu'' and theatre==
[[File:Funazu - Yoshitoshi ryakuga - Walters 95350.jpg|thumb|''Yoshitoshi ryakuga'' by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1882)]]
Japan has long had a vibrant folkloric tradition of ghost stories, and in the early eighteenth century these began to be dramatized for the [[Noh|''nō'']] stage and ''[[bunraku]]'' puppet theatre.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; As ''kabuki'' began to flourish throughout the later 1700s, so too did the number of dramas based on ghost stories, particularly those involving vengeful female ghosts returning to punish their wrong-doers.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; ''Kabuki'', like ''[[ukiyo-e]]'', was a populist art form, which aimed to satisfy the dramatic tastes of a “proletarian clientele”: the rising working and middle classes in [[Edo]] (present-day Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;Addis 1985, 179&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kabuki'' and ''ukiyo-e'' shared a close kinship, as woodblock artists attempted to tap into “the public’s ever-increasing appetite for tales of the bizarre and thrilling,” and share the ''kabuki'' audience demographic.&lt;ref name="Schaap 1998, 17"/&gt; As Sarah Fensom notes, "that prints of the macabre, the supernatural and the grotesque were so frequently designed and distributed is for the most part a greater reflection of 19th century Japanese tastes than of the agenda of the artists." &lt;ref&gt;2013&lt;/ref&gt; Artists produced images of ghosts as well as of actors in ghost roles, effecting a conflation of three prevailing trends in ''ukiyo-e'' of the period: depictions of the female form ([[Bijinga|''bijin-ga'']]), depictions of supernatural or macabre themes, and depictions of celebrated actors (''kabuki-e'' or ''shibai-e'').

==Censorship==
In an attempt to return Japan to its feudal, agrarian roots, the Tokugawa regime in 1842 instituted the [[Tenpō Reforms|Tempō Reforms]] (''Tempō no kaikaku'' - 天保の改革), a collection of laws governing many aspects of everyday life. In addition to the economy, the military, agriculture and religion, the Reforms reached into the world of art.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Tempō Reforms''&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the Reforms was essentially to valorize frugality and loyalty,&lt;ref name="The Fitzwilliam Museum"&gt;The Fitzwilliam Museum&lt;/ref&gt; thus ostentatious or morally dubious images such as depictions of ''geisha'', ''[[oiran]]'' courtesans and ''kabuki'' actors were banned.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; According to an 1842 decree aimed at print publishers: “To make woodblock prints of Kabuki actors, courtesans and geisha is detrimental to public morals. Henceforth the publication of new works [of this kind] as well as the sale of previously procured stocks is strictly forbidden. In future you are to select designs that are based on loyalty and filial piety and which serve to educate women and children, and you must insure that they are not luxurious.”&lt;ref name="The Fitzwilliam Museum"/&gt;

Given this climate of censorship, some artists used the ''yūrei-zu'' genre "to symbolically and humorously disguise … criticism of the social and political maladies of the day by having fantastic creatures appear as substitutes for real people, especially the ruling elite."&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris 2010, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Such critiques led the government to subsequently ban both ''yūrei-zu'' and ghost plays.&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt; The Tempō Reforms were ultimately unsuccessful,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and the strict regulation of art works was no longer enforced after 1845, once the shogunal advisor who had initiated the Reforms left the government.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse 2012, 95&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the rules remained nominally in effect, some artists invoked clever word- and picture-play to circumvent censorship.&lt;ref name="The Fitzwilliam Museum"/&gt;

==''Yūrei-zu'' physical characteristics==
[[File:Hokusai Kohada Koheiji.jpg|thumb|''Kohada Koheiji'' by Hokusai (1831-1832)]]
The ghosts featured in Edo period ''ukiyo-e'' come in various forms. They can appear as animal creatures both real and imagined, such as foxes, cats, dragons and demons. They can also be the discontent spirits of male warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Fensom 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ghosts featured, however, tend to be female, "specifically," as [[Donald Richie]] notes, "dissatisfied females."&lt;ref&gt;1983, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjects in ''yūrei-zu'' typically correspond to a very specific set of physical characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Jordan 1985, 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davisson 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* long, straight black hair, which is often unkempt
* white or pale-coloured kimono akin to the plain white ''katabira'' (帷子) or ''kyōkatabira'' (経帷子) funerary kimono
* long, flowing sleeves
* some are depicted with a triangular ''[[hitaikakushi]]'' (額隠) forehead cloth also associated with [[Japanese funeral|Japanese funerary tradition]]
* a thin, fragile frame
* outstretched arms, sometimes waving or beckoning
* hands hanging limply from the wrists
* no body below the waist
* often accompanied by ''[[hitodama]]'' (人魂), green, blue or purple floating flames
* transparent or semi-transparent

By nature, they:&lt;ref&gt;Richie 1983, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* are nocturnal
* avoid running water
* appear in true ghostly guise when reflected in a mirror or water surface

==Notable Edo examples==
[[File:Oyuki.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|''Ghost of Oyuki'' by Maruyama Ōkyo (1750–1780)]]

===''The Ghost of Oyuki''===
The earliest ''yūrei-zu'' is considered to be by [[Maruyama Ōkyo]] (円山 応挙), founder of the Maruyama school and one of the most significant artists of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Maruyama Ōkyo''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ghost of Oyuki]]'' (''Oyuki no maboroshi'' - お雪の幻) is a silk scroll painting dating to the second half of the 18th century &lt;ref&gt;Jordan suggests the painting was produced when Maruyama was “in his mid-forties” (1985, 33n), which would make it c. 1778; however, Stevenson states that it was completed for the shogun in or around 1760 (1983, 10), and yet another source believes it to date from 1750 (Chin Music Press).&lt;/ref&gt; In Maruyama’s naturalistic style,&lt;ref&gt;Apocryphally, Maruyama once painted such a realistic ghost image that it came to life and terrified him. The incident is immortalized in a painting by [[Taiso Yoshitoshi]] (1839-1892) entitled 'Yoshitoshi Ryakuga'. (Art History Reference)&lt;/ref&gt; it depicts a faintly coloured female ghost whose body tapers into transparency. It has been described as an “image of haunting beauty.”&lt;ref name="Jordan_a"&gt;Jordan 1985, 26&lt;/ref&gt; According to a scroll box inscription by a one-time owner, the subject of the painting is Maruyama’s lover,&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson suggests that in the absence of the subject, Maruyama’s dying aunt acted as his model (1983, 10)&lt;/ref&gt; a ''[[geisha]]'' who died young.&lt;ref name="Jordan_a"/&gt; Her ghost is said to have visited the artist in a dream and inspired him to paint her portrait.&lt;ref name="Jordan_a"/&gt;

===Other Edo artists===
All of the pre-eminent ''ukiyo-e'' artists of the later Edo period produced ''yūrei-zu'', including [[Kunisada]], [[Hokusai]] &lt;ref&gt;See the 1831 series ''One Hundred [Ghost] Tales'' (''Hyaku monogatari'')&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], who “designed the largest number of prints portraying ghosts as well as other strange, unusual and fantastic creatures.” &lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;

Another major producer of ''yūrei-zu'' was [[Yoshitoshi|Tsukioka Yoshitoshi]] who reputedly had personal encounters with ghosts in 1865 and 1880. In 1865 he produced the series ''One Hundred Ghost Stories of China and Japan'' (''Wakan hyaku monogatari''), his first series to feature ghosts. The original series, which was based on a popular game of the period involving ghost stories, included one hundred images; however, only twenty-six were published.&lt;ref&gt;Chiappa, J. Noel and Levine, Jason M. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His final print series, ''New Forms of 36 Ghosts'' (''Shinkei sanjūrokuten''), was "so freakishly popular," according to Sarah Fensom, "that the blocks from which it was printed wore out."&lt;ref name="Fensom 2012"/&gt;

==Contemporary examples==
[[File:Female Ghost.JPG|thumb|upright|''Female Ghost'' by Kunisada (1852)]]
Although patently no longer as pervasive as during the late Edo period, ''yūrei-zu'' and contemporary variations continue to be produced by Japanese artists in various media. One prominent example is the ''[[nihonga]]'' painter [[Fuyuko Matsui]] (b. 1974), whose ghostly images are described as “beautiful and eerie,”&lt;ref&gt;Japan Echo&lt;/ref&gt; “dark [and] Gothic,” and “disturbing and mesmerizing.”&lt;ref name="Liddell"&gt;Liddell&lt;/ref&gt; Matsui has identified a goal of her works as imparting “a condition that maintains sanity while being close to madness.”&lt;ref name="Liddell"/&gt; Matsui’s colour on silk hanging scroll “Nyctalopia” (2005) is particularly reminiscent of classic ''yūrei-zu'' such as Maruyama’s “The Ghost of Oyuki.”&lt;ref&gt;See image at http://www.matsuifuyuko.com/works-e/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Another artist whose works echo ''yūrei-zu'' is [[Hisashi Tenmyouya]] (b. 1966). Between 2004 and 2005, Tenmyouya completed a series of acrylic on wood paintings entitled ''New Version of Six Ghost Stories'' (新形六怪撰).  The six images are reworkings of famous Japanese ghost stories, such as [[Yotsuya Kaidan|''Tokaido Yotsuya'']] ''Ghost Story'' and ''Kohata Koheiji Ghost Story'', which were rendered in woodblocks by Edo artists.&lt;ref&gt;See images at http://www3.ocn.ne.jp/~tenmyoya/paintings/0_paintings.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Also creating contemporary ''yūrei-zu'' in a traditional style is American-born, Japanese-resident artist Matthew Meyer. His ''Japanese Yōkai'' series is collected in his illustrated book ''The Night Parade of One Hundred Demons''. According to Meyer, the intention of his paintings is "to recreate the feeling of old Japanese woodblock prints while adding a contemporary illustrative touch."&lt;ref&gt;http://matthewmeyer.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of ''yūrei-zu'' is also evident in the [[manga]] of [[Shigeru Mizuki]] (b. 1922) and [[Hiroshi Shiibashi]] (b. 1980), both of whom are renowned for their works dealing with traditional Japanese aspects of the supernatural.
