      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4819">The '''American Association of Public Health Dentistry''' (AAPHD), founded in 1937, focuses upon addressing the public health challenges to oral health at the population level. Its open membership for everyone who seeks improvement in oral health of the general public. supports developing and supporting effective programs of oral health promotion and disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphd.org/ Home page for the American Association of Public Health Dentistry (AAPHD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphd.org/abdph American Board of Dental Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is headquartered in [[Springfield, Illinois]].

== Mission ==
[[Public health]] dentistry is defined as by [[TheFreeDictionary.com]] as "that specialty of dentistry concerned with the prevention and control of dental diseases and promotion of oral health through organized community efforts."

== Organization ==

The American Association of Public Health Dentistry was founded in 1937.  AAPHD publishes a newsletter for AAPHD members and a journal, the Journal of Public Health Dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1752-7325 Journal of Public Health Dentistry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4439">The '''Applied Research in Patacriticism''' ('''ARP''') was a [[digital humanities]] lab based at the [[University of Virginia]] founded and run by [[Jerome McGann]] and [[Johanna Drucker]].  ARP's [[open-source]] tools include Juxta, IVANHOE, and Collex.  Collex is the [[social software]] and [[faceted classification|faceted browsing]] backbone of the NINES federation.  ARP was funded by the [[Mellon Foundation]].

==Projects==
===IVANHOE===

IVANHOE is an [[open source]] electronic [[role-playing game]] for educational use.  It was developed by ARP at the [[University of Virginia]].  It is so named because [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s novel, ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', was used as the source text for the very first IVANHOE game.  IVANHOE is notable as an example of the use of [[ludic interface|ludic]] or game-related techniques in higher education in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol12_2_06.pdf Geoffrey Rockwell, Serious Play at Hand: Is Gaming Serious Research in the Humanities? in: ''TEXT Technology'' 2 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NINES===

NINES is the '''Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-century Electronic Scholarship''', a scholarly organization in British and American nineteenth-century studies supported by ARP, a software development group assembling a suite of critical and editorial tools for digital scholarship.  It was founded in 2003 by [[Jerome McGann]] at the [[University of Virginia]].  

NINES serves as a clearinghouse for [[peer-reviewed]] digital resources, which can be collected, annotated, and re-used in online "exhibits."  It is powered by [[open-source]] [[Collex]] software.

In 2011, the NINES model was expanded to include a sister site in eighteenth-century studies, called 18thConnect.

===Collex===

Collex is an [[open source]] [[social software]] and [[faceted classification|faceted browsing]] tool designed for [[digital humanities]].  It includes [[folksonomy]] features and is under construction at ARP.  The first release of Collex is used in the [[NINES (initiative)|NINES initiative]], but it is a [http://collex.org generalizable tool] that can be applied to other subject domains.  Collex is an early example of a scholar-driven [[Library 2.0]] initiative and, like NINES, was conceived as a response to economic problems in [[tenure]] and [[academic publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nines.org/about/Nowviskie-Collex.pdf Bethany Nowviskie, Collex: Semantic Collections and Exhibits for the Remixable Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juxta===

Juxta is an [[open-source]] tool for performing [[bibliography|bibliographical]] collations for scholarly use in [[textual criticism]].  It was developed by ARP at the [[University of Virginia]] under the direction of textual theorist [[Jerome McGann]]. The original application was a Java-based client [http://www.juxtasoftware.org available for free download].

In October 2012, the Research and Development team at NINES released [http://juxtacommons.org Juxta Commons], a fully online version of the software.

The sculpture is usually integrated with the structure, but freestanding works that are part of the original design are also considered to be architectural sculpture.

It has also been defined as, ''an integral part of a building or sculpture created especially to decorate or embellish an architectural structure.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selectartusa.com/gloss.htm|title=Select Art Sculpture: Glossary|work=selectartusa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural sculpture has been employed by builders throughout history, and in virtually every continent on earth save pre-colonial Australia.

==Egyptian==

[[File:LuxTempleObelisk.JPG|left|200px|thumb|[[Luxor Obelisk]]]]
Modern understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on the religious monuments that have survived since antiquity, which are carved stone with post-and-lintel construction. These religious monuments dedicated to the gods or [[pharaoh]]s were designed with a great deal of architectural sculpture inside and out:  engaged statues, carved columns and pillars, and wall surfaces carved with bas-reliefs. The classic examples of Egyptian colossal monuments (the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], the [[Abu Simbel temples]], the [[Karnak]] Temple Complex, etc.) represent thoroughly integrated combinations of architecture and sculpture.

Obelisks, elaborately carved from a single block of stone, were usually placed in pairs to flank the entrances to temples and pyramids. Reliefs are also common in Egyptian building, depicting scenes of everyday life and often accompanied by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]].

==Assyro-Babylonian==
[[File:Ashurnasipal with official.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Ashurnasipal with officials]]
The [[Fertile Crescent]] architectural sculptural tradition began when [[Ashurnasirpal II]] moved his capitol to the city of [[Nimrud]] around 879 BCE.  This site was located near a major deposit of gypsum ([[alabaster]]).  This fairly easy to cut stone could be quarried in large blocks that allowed them to be easily carved for the palaces that were built there.  The early style developed out of an already flourishing mural tradition by creating drawings that were then carved in low relief.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Julian, ''Assyrian Sculpture'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts,  1983 pp. 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Another contributing factor in the development of architectural sculpture were the small carved seals that had been made in the area for centuries.

Classical Greek architecture, like the prototypical [[Parthenon]], incorporate architectural sculpture in a fairly narrow set of standard, formal building elements.  The names of these elements still comprise the usual vocabulary for discussion:  the [[pediment]], the [[Metope (architecture)|metope]], the [[frieze]], the [[caryatid]], the [[quadriga]], [[acroteria]], etc.

Greek examples of architectural sculpture are distinguished not only by their age but their very high quality and skillful technique, with rhythmic and dynamic modeling, figural compositions in friezes that continue seamlessly over vertical joints from one block of stone to the next, and mastery of depth and legibility.

The known Greek and Roman examples have been exhaustively studied, and frequently copied or adapted into subsequent neo-classical styles:  [[Greek Revival architecture]], usually the most strict; [[Neoclassical architecture]]; [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] with its exaggerated and romantic free interpretations of the vocabulary, and even Stalinist neo-classical architecture like the [[Central Moscow Hippodrome]] adapted to a totalitarian aesthetic.  These re-interpretations are sometimes dubious, for instance, there are many modern copies of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], like the [[National Diet Building]] in Tokyo, despite the fact that all classical descriptions of the Mausoleum are vague.

[[File:Pediment, Philly Art Museum (3).jpg|right|250px|thumb|pediment sculpture detail, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], sculptor [[C. Paul Jennewein]], 1933]]

Not until about 1870 did the U.S. develop the talent, the economic power, and the taste for buildings grand enough to need architectural sculpture.  The [[Philadelphia City Hall]], constructed 1871 through 1901, is recognized as the turning point,&lt;ref&gt;Gurney, George, Sculpture of a City—Philadelphia's Treasures in Bronze and Stone, Fairmount Park Association, Walker Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; because of the approximately 250 sculptures planned for the building, the large [[finial]] of [[William Penn]], and the practical effect of [[Alexander Milne Calder]] training many assistants there.

In the same years, [[H.H. Richardson]] began to develop his influential signature genre, which included romantic, medieval, and Romanesque stone carving.  [[Richard Morris Hunt]] became the first to bring the Parisian neo-classical [[École des Beaux-Arts]] style back to the United States, a style that depended on integrated figural sculpture and a highly ornamented building fabric for its aesthetic effect.  The Beaux-Arts style dominated for major public buildings between the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, through about 1912, the year of the [[San Francisco City Hall]].  The need for sculptors saw the emergence of a small industry of carvers and modelers, and a professional organization, the [[National Sculpture Society]].

The advent of steel frames and reinforced concrete encouraged, at first, more diverse building styles into the 1910s and 1920s.  The diversity of skyscraper Gothic, exotic "revivals" of Mayan and Egyptian, [[Stripped Classicism]], [[Art Deco]], etc. called for a similar diversity of sculptural approaches.  The use of sculpture was still expected, particularly for public buildings such as war memorials and museums.  In 1926 the pre-eminent American architectural sculptor, [[Lee Lawrie]], with his longtime friend and collaborator architect [[Bertram Goodhue]], developed perhaps the most sophisticated American examples at the [[Nebraska State Capitol]] and the [[Los Angeles Public Library]].

Goodhue's premature death ended that collaboration.  The [[Great Depression|Depression]], and the onset of World War II, decimated building activity.  The old building trades disbanded.  By the postwar years the aesthetic of architectural modernism had taken hold.  Except for a few diehards and regional sculptors, the profession was not only dead but discredited.  As of 2010 there are isolated signs of a revival of interest, for instance in the career of [[Raymond Kaskey]].

The '''Norman and Helen Asher Space Research Institute''' ('''ASRI''') is a specialized institute dedicated to multidisciplinary [[scientific research]] at [[Technion - Israel Institute of Technology]], in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].

ASRI was established in 1984. Its members come from five Technion faculties, and it has a technical staff of Technion scientists in a variety of space-related fields ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110519171541/http://physics.technion.ac.il/eng/ Physics], [[Technion Faculty of Aerospace Engineering|Aerospace Engineering]], [http://meeng.technion.ac.il/en/ Mechanical Engineering], [[Technion Faculty of Electrical Engineering|Electrical Engineering]], [http://tasp.technion.ac.il/ Autonomous Systems] and [http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/ Computer Sciences]). ASRI is a leading space research center in [[Israel]] and is involved in the development of space systems based on advanced and innovative technologies, as well as education&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jyi.org/SCC/Article.php?articleNum=84&lt;/ref&gt; through advanced degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://community.iknowfutures.eu/pg/file/popper/view/8789/ozone-space-vision&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Technion History}}

Technion is Israel's oldest university, founded in 1912 to bring young people the technical skills they would need to build a nation. In the spirit of anticipating future needs, Technion established the faculty of Aeronautical Engineering in 1948. At the time, it was the only place in Israel teaching and researching aeronautics, and it has been credited in bringing the expertise to create the airforce which guaranteed the survival on the young [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ae-www.technion.ac.il/home/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925051740/http://ae-www.technion.ac.il/home/history.php |archivedate=2013-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty evolved into today's Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at the Technion. Driven by a need for Israel to move into satellite technology in the 1980s, the Asher Space Research Institute was set up in 1984, four years before Israel formally rocketed into space with the launch of the [[Ofeq|Ofeq-1]] satellite in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Alpert]], ''TECHNION The Story of Israel's Institute of Technology''. {{ISBN|0-87203-102-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ASRI is the only center of higher education for space research in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ae-www.technion.ac.il/home/asher_heb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811044633/http://ae-www.technion.ac.il/home/asher_heb.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ASRI Building Back 1.JPG|thumb|The ASRI Building at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology']]
On February 12, 2009, the Norman and Helen Asher Space Building was dedicated at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. Chicago resident Helen S. Asher and her late husband Norman provided the $3.5 million lead gift for the building. The occasion also celebrated the 30-year anniversary of [[Israel Space Agency|Israel's space program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.org/site/News2?page%3DNewsArticle%26id%3D5933%26security%3D1141%26news_iv_ctrl%3D1461 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722021453/http://www.ats.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5933&amp;security=1141&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1461 |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Institute is today managed by ASRI Director Prof. Ehud Behar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.technion.ac.il/en/technion/sci-tech/100211-behar&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASRI Mission==

==Selected laboratories==
In parallel to system development activities, members of the Institute technical staff perform, in collaboration with faculty members, research in various space related fields.

===The Distributed Space Systems Laboratory (DSSL)===
The Distributed Space Systems Laboratory (DSSL) is focused on dynamics and control of multiple spacecraft formation flying. The experimental facility is designed and equipped to test methods and machinery under circumstances as close to actual operating conditions as possible, including cooperative control, relative position and attitude sensing and space-borne sparse-aperture imaging. The lab includes an air bearing table, model satellites, and sensing devices.
ASRI DSSL is currently working towards the launch of a formation flying mission into an Earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asri.technion.ac.il/dssl/|title=DSSL |publisher=[[ASRI]], [[Technion]]|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric Propulsion===
ASRI's research into electric propulsion of small satellites has culminated in the creation of the patented CAMILA, cited as the most efficient and effective rocket propulsion engine for space-craft and satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/Feb10/spaceStory1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006230929/http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/Feb10/spaceStory1.htm |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Working in collaboration with Israel's [[Soreq Nuclear Research Center|Soreq National Research Laboratory]] and [[RAFAEL]], ASRI's Electric Propulsion laboratory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asri.technion.ac.il/electric-propulsion|title=Electric Propulsion |publisher=[[ASRI]], [[Technion]]|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is said to be pioneering the next generation of small thrusters. The lab is headed by Prof. Alexander Kapulkin, a rocket scientist from the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.technion.ac.il/_local/includes/blocks/news-items/091129-camila/news-item-en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory for Space Interferometry (LaSI)===
The Laboratory for Space Interferometry (LaSI) at the Asher Space Research Institute seeks solutions for improving the angular resolution of telescopes for both astronomical and Earth observations from space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asri.technion.ac.il/space-interferometry/ |title=Space Interferometry|publisher=[[ASRI]], [[Technion]]|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
ASRI's educational activities include topical lectures for engineering students, supervision of undergraduate students space projects, and of graduate research theses'. 
One example of ASRI's educational initiatives was the DUSAT project. This consists of two identical Low Earth Orbit (LEO) [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellites]] designed for simultaneous three-dimensional mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asri.technion.ac.il/DUSAT |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707064446/http://asri.technion.ac.il/DUSAT |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A current example is SABRES:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asri.technion.ac.il/SABRES |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707064507/http://asri.technion.ac.il/SABRES |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a constellation of microsatellites for automated meter reading and other non-real time communication services.
In addition to undergraduate and graduate degrees, ASRI has opportunities for postdoctoral research positions and frequently hosts international scientists.

==Gurwin TechSat==
Gurwin TechSat was one of the world's first microsatellites to be designed, built and launched by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/May10/newsStory11.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929095838/http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/May10/newsStory11.htm |archivedate=2013-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Operations of TechSat II, also known as TechSat-1b and Gurwin-TechSAT-2, ceased in April 2010 when deterioration of its solar cells reduced power output so that the nominal performance of the satellite systems could no longer be supported.
In the early 1990s, the Technion proposed building three or four small satellites for continuous early warning coverage.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Space-Systems-and-Industry/TechSat-Gurwin-Series-Israel.html&lt;/ref&gt; The TechSat Gurwin I was named in honour of Joseph and Rosalind Gurwin, whose interest and support of Israeli space research enabled its development.
The flight model was completed in October 1994, but the first TechSat, also known as TechSat-1a, was lost when its Soviet converted ICBM Start launch vehicle failed. 
On 10 July 1998, the next microsatellite in the series, TechSat/Gurwin II, was successfully launched by Zenit 2 from Baikonur Cosmodrome.
 
The Asher Space Research Institute (ASRI) at Technion managed and conducted TechSat II operations from the university-based station. The solar cells used thin-film photovoltaic cell technology developed in Russia; they were mounted on four of the six outer aluminium panels. The box-shaped TechSat II carried six instruments to perform a range of experiments. 
Operations of TechSat II ceased in April 2010 when deterioration of its solar cells reduced power output so that the nominal performance of the satellite systems could no longer be supported.
The mission has been said to demonstrate that a reduction of the satellite mass, size, and power consumption can be achieved without deterioration of its basic characteristics, such as mission life, payload efficiency and measurements precision.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_techsat_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and outreach==

===Ilan Ramon Space Team Program===
[[File:Ilan Ramon.jpg|thumb|upright|Colonel Ilan Ramon,Israeli astronaut killed during the failed re-entry of the Space Shuttle Columbia.]]
In 2002, ASRI set up the Ilan Ramon Space Club, in collaboration with the Jerusalem-based [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322191940/http://www.excellence.org.il/eng/Index.asp?CategoryID=98&amp;ArticleID=56%20 Society for Excellence in Education.]
After the tragic loss of the Columbia Shuttle and its crew, the space club was renamed in honor of [[Ilan Ramon]] - Israel's first astronaut. Ramon had conducted experiments in space designed by high school students and commissioned by ASRI and [[Israel Ministry of Education|Israel's Ministry of Education]].
The club today consists of 12 nationwide groups of 20 high school students each. ASRI researchers prepare the syllabus for the clubs which are run with the help of Technion undergraduates.

===Science and communication===
Part of ASRI's global outreach drive involves a social media initiative to educated and inform the general public about space research in general and projects at Technion's ASRI in particular.

'''Attorney misconduct''' is unethical or illegal conduct by an attorney.  Attorney Misconduct may include: [[conflict of interest]], over billing, refusing to represent a client for political or professional motives, false or misleading statements, hiding evidence, abandoning a client, failing to disclose all relevant facts, arguing a position while neglecting to disclose prior law which might counter the argument, and'' in some instances'' having sex with a client.

The advent of electronic record keeping and "e-discovery" has also resulted in a record number of attorney sanctions for a range of abuses from failure to produce to the leaking of sealed documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.findlaw.com/strategist/2011/01/attorney-e-discovery-sanctions-at-all-time-high.html Attorney E-Discovery Sanctions At All-Time High], FindLaw blog, January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a case highlighting such abuses, in 2007 plaintiff's in a pharmaceutical lawsuit were found to conspire with attorneys and journalists to publicize protected discovery documents defying a judge's [[protective order]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlf.org/upload/042707womeldorf.pdf When conspirators defy protective orders], Washington Legal Foundation, April 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Durham County, North Carolina prosecutor, [[Mike Nifong]], gained national infamy for a pattern of '''attorney misconduct''' related to the [[2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal]].

[[Legal malpractice]] is a separate concept such as when an attorney fails to adequately, professionally, competently, or zealously represent a client.  While malpractice and misconduct may often be found in the same matter, they are separate concepts and need not both exist.

==Codification of rules and enforcement==

The [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) has established model rules of professional conduct expected of attorneys, which most states in the U.S. have incorporated as part of their state laws.  Each state issues its own set of rules governing the ethical rules and the related enforcement of those rules, generally through their state [[bar association]]s.  As the state bar organizations and their enforcement mechanisms are composed of lawyers who set the rules, the regulation of attorney ethics is [[Industry self-regulation|self regulated and self policed]].  The self-regulation of any industry by its economic participants poses an inherent [[conflict of interest]] between the professional objectives of the members of the profession and those for whom the regulation would protect.  Some academic researchers and industry pundits have asserted that attorney discipline in the U.S. is ineffective,&lt;ref&gt;Leslie C. Levin, The Emperor's Clothes and Other Tales About the Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline Sanctions, 48 American University Law Review 1 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paula A. Monopoli, Legal Ethics and Practical Politics: Musings on the Public Perception of Lawyer Discipline, 10 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 423, 425 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and favors lawyers and law firms.&lt;ref&gt;William T. Gallagher, "Ideologies of Professionalism and the Politics of Self-Regulation in the California State Bar," 22 Pepp. L. Rev. 485, 490-491.(1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual lawyers or their firms may be cited for misconduct by a judge in the originating proceedings or by a corresponding state bar.

'''BT Research''' is part of the ''Technology'' division of [[BT Group]], a provider of communications and services operating in 170 countries.

The organisation embodies an '[[open innovation]]' approach, drawing on external resources such as partnerships with universities, suppliers, partners, customers and start-ups to complement the BT's internal research and innovation programme.  [[BT Group]] is also a partner in collaborative research projects that are part of the UK's [[Technology Strategy Board]] programme, the EU [[Seventh Framework Programme]], and the EU [[Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme]].

__TOC__

== Location ==
[[File:Adastral Hub2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Adastral Park]]

BT's main research facility is located in the United Kingdom at [[Adastral Park]], near [[Ipswich]] in the county of Suffolk. The Adastral Park site was first planned around 1968 as the Martlesham Heath Post Office Laboratories&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage MOW 'Y' Series Y 6507 etc&lt;/ref&gt; and after completion in 1971 has grown since then to a facility today which has around 4,000 research and development people from both BT and some of its partner companies. Globally, BT has additional research labs in Beijing, Boston MA and Abu Dhabi. The focus of research at BT is Information and Communications Technology (ICT).

The [[Royal Air Force]] were the original residents of the site in Suffolk at [[RAF Martlesham Heath]]. Experimental aircraft test flights flew from the airfield and the name (Adastral Park) is intended to reflect the history of experimentation and innovation, which is the continuing focus for the Park.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The initial models and plans created by the MPBW [successor to the MOW] would appear to indicate the influence of the Thunderbirds TV series of the 1960s.

== History ==
[[File:BT, Martlesham Heath - geograph.org.uk - 161633.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Main building]]

Research in the company was first established in 1921 at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]], London. In 1968 BT began the move of its research to the new site at [[Martlesham Heath]] in Suffolk. By late 1969 small teams of researchers were working at Martlesham. The first new research building was formally opened on 21 November 1975 by Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]]. The architect was Mr Stanislaw Spielrein ARIBA of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works [MPBW].&lt;ref&gt;RIBA Kalendar 1964-5, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; The new building housed 1,700 people.

== Patents ==
By the turn of the century (2000), the site had produced over 10,000 patents.

== Innovations from BT Research ==

2006 [October] – BT implemented the world's first fully automated 'spam buster' system to track down and tackle professional spammers and 'botnet'-infected customers on the BT broadband network.

'''Black Mountain College''' was an experimental college founded in 1933 by [[John Andrew Rice]], Theodore Dreier, and several others. Based in [[Black Mountain, North Carolina]], the school was ideologically organized around [[John Dewey|John Dewey's]] principles of education, which emphasized holistic learning and the study of art as central to a [[Liberal arts|liberal arts education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/artists-black-mountain-college/5719/|title=The Artists of Black Mountain College {{!}} American Masters {{!}} PBS|date=2006-10-16|work=American Masters|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the school's faculty and students were or would go on to become highly influential in the arts, including [[Josef Albers|Josef]] and [[Anni Albers]], [[Charles Olson]], [[Ruth Asawa]], [[Walter Gropius]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Dorothea Rockburne]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Merce Cunningham]], [[John Cage]], [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Willem de Kooning|Willem]] and [[Elaine de Kooning]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]]. Although it was quite notable during its lifetime, the school closed in 1957 after 24 years due to funding issues. The history and legacy of Black Mountain College are preserved and extended by the [[Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center]] located in downtown Asheville, NC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/arts/artsspecial/in-the-spirit-of-black-mountain-college-an-avant-garde-incubator.html|title=In the Spirit of Black Mountain College, an Avant-Garde Incubator|last=Kino|first=Carol|date=2015-03-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Black Mountain was founded in 1933 by [[John Andrew Rice]], Theodore Dreier, Frederick Georgia, and Ralph Lounsbury, who were controversially dismissed as faculty from [[Rollins College#Firing of John Andrew Rice and required loyalty pledge|Rollins College]] for refusing to sign a loyalty pledge.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Seymour, "The Ghosts of Rollins (and Other Skeletons in the Closet)", ''Rollins Magazine'', fall 2011, http://www.rollins.edu/magazine/fall-2011/ghosts-of-rollins-2.html; John Andrew Rice, ''I Came Out of the Eighteenth Century'' (1942), reissued, with new introduction by Rice's grandson, William Craig Rice, University of South Carolina Press, 2014, {{ISBN|1611174368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Mountain was experimental in nature and committed to an [[interdisciplinary]] approach, prioritizing art making as a necessary component of education and attracting a faculty and lecturers that included many of America's leading visual artists, composers, poets, and designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/artists-black-mountain-college/5719/|title=The Artists of Black Mountain College {{!}} American Masters {{!}} PBS|date=2006-10-16|work=American Masters|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1930s and 1940s the school flourished, becoming well known as an incubator for artistic talent. Notable events at the school were common; it was here that the first large-scale geodesic dome was made by faculty member [[Buckminster Fuller]] and students, where [[Merce Cunningham]] formed his dance company, and where [[John Cage]] staged his first musical [[happening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/arts/artsspecial/in-the-spirit-of-black-mountain-college-an-avant-garde-incubator.html|title=In the Spirit of Black Mountain College, an Avant-Garde Incubator|last=Kino|first=Carol|date=2015-03-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the College was an important incubator for the American [[avant-garde]]. Black Mountain proved to be an important precursor to and prototype for many of the alternative colleges of today, ranging from [[College of the Atlantic]], [[Naropa University]], the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], and [[Marlboro College]] to [[Evergreen State College]], [[Hampshire College]], [[Shimer College]], [[Prescott College]], [[Goddard College]], [[World College West]] (1973-1992), and [[New College of Florida]], among others, including [[Warren Wilson College]] located just minutes down the road from where Black Mountain College was located. [[Bennington College]], based on the samr philosophy, was founded one year before Black Mountain College.

== Structure ==
[[File:Black Mtn College.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Main Building of the former Black Mountain College, on the current grounds of Camp Rockmont]]
The school operated using non-hierarchical methodologies that placed students and educators on the same plane. Revolving around 20th-century ideals about the value and importance of balancing education, art, and cooperative labor, students were required to participate in farm work, construction projects, and kitchen duty as part of their holistic education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/school-black-mountain-college.htm|title=The Art Story: School - Black Mountain College|website=www.theartstory.org|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/arts/artsspecial/in-the-spirit-of-black-mountain-college-an-avant-garde-incubator.html|title=In the Spirit of Black Mountain College, an Avant-Garde Incubator|last=Kino|first=Carol|date=2015-03-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/arts/design/the-short-life-and-long-legacy-of-black-mountain-college.html|title=The Short Life and Long Legacy of Black Mountain College|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=2015-12-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students were involved at all levels of institutional decision-making. They were also left in charge of deciding when they were ready to graduate, which notoriously few ever did. There were no course requirements, grades, or degrees. Graduates were presented with handcrafted diplomas as purely ceremonial symbols of their achievement. The liberal arts program offered at Black Mountain was broad, and supplemented by art making as a means of cultivating creative thinking within all fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/arts/design/the-short-life-and-long-legacy-of-black-mountain-college.html|title=The Short Life and Long Legacy of Black Mountain College|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=2015-12-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Albers led the school, the only two requirements were a course on materials and form taught by Albers and a course on Plato.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/arts/artsspecial/in-the-spirit-of-black-mountain-college-an-avant-garde-incubator.html|title=In the Spirit of Black Mountain College, an Avant-Garde Incubator|last=Kino|first=Carol|date=2015-03-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blue Ridge Assembly Robert E Lee Hall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|From 1933 to 1941, Black Mountain College was located at the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly.]]

== Sociopolitical context ==

In 1933, the Nazis shut down the [[Bauhaus]] in Germany, a similarly progressive arts-based educational institution. Many of the school's faculty left Europe for the US, and a number of them settled at Black Mountain, most notably,     [[Josef Albers]], who was selected to run the art program and his wife [[Anni Albers]], who taught weaving and textile design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww.albersfoundation.org/about-us/press/2015/|title=Josef and Anni Albers Foundation|website=ww.albersfoundation.org|access-date=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolph Hitler's rise to power and the subsequent persecution taking place in Europe led many artists and intellectuals to flee and resettle in the US, populating Black Mountain College with an influx of both students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blackmountaincollege.org/history/|title=Black Mountain College: A Brief Introduction - Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center|work=Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the college was operating in the South during the period of legal racial segregation at other colleges and universities in the region. While not immune from racial tensions, the student [[Alma Stone Williams]], an African-American woman, is considered by some to be the first black student to enroll in an all-white institution of higher education in the South during the [[Jim Crow]] era.&lt;ref name="A Pioneer in Southern Racial Integration2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anonymous|title=Black Mountain College: A Pioneer in Southern Racial Integration|journal=[[The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]]|volume=54|page=46|jstor=25073557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locations ==
For the first eight years the college rented the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly buildings south of Black Mountain, North Carolina. In 1941, it moved across the valley to its own campus at Lake Eden, where it remained until its closing in 1956. The property was later purchased and converted to an ecumenical Christian boys' residential summer camp ([[Camp Rockmont]]). This has been used for years as the site of the Black Mountain Festival and the [[Lake Eden Arts Festival]]. A number of the original structures are still in use as lodgings or administrative facilities.

== Closing ==
Black Mountain College closed in 1957, a few years after Albers left to direct the first design department at [[Yale University|Yale]]. The college suspended classes by court order due to debts, being unable to sustain their finances given the greatly decreased number of students. In 1962, the school's books were finally closed, with all debts covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artesmagazine.com/2010/09/north-carolina%E2%80%99s-black-mountain-college-a-new-deal-in-american-art-education/|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530070825/http://www.artesmagazine.com/2010/09/north-carolina%E2%80%99s-black-mountain-college-a-new-deal-in-american-art-education/|archivedate=2012-05-30|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:BMCRP VM Bx89 Nakagawa Portraits 11ee--Sum1949 (6506073429).jpg|thumb|[[Buckminster Fuller]] at Black Mountain College in 1949]]

== Legacy ==
The [[Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center|Black Mountain College Museum &amp; Arts Center]] continues the legacy of Black Mountain College through talks, exhibitions, performances, and an annual fall conference that examines the college's legacy. Black Mountain College was the subject of the museum exhibition ''Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933-1957,'' which opened at the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]] on October 10, 2015. The show was curated by [[Helen Molesworth]] with Ruth Erickson.&lt;ref name="Art in America"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/ldquoleap-before-you-look-black-mountain-college-1933-1957rdquo/|title=Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933-1957|last1=Swenson|first1=Kirsten|date=December 16, 2015|work=Art in America}} (exhibit review)&lt;/ref&gt; The show later exhibited at the [[Hammer Museum]] February 21, 2016 to May 15, 2016, which was organized by Anne Ellegood, senior curator, with MacKenzie Stevens, curatorial assistant, and January Parkos Arnall, curatorial assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2016/leap-before-you-look-black-mountain-college-1933-1957/|title=Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933-1957|website=Hammer Museum|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Mountain College was featured in [[Nicholas Sparks]]' novel, ''[[The Longest Ride]]'' (2013) and the [[The Longest Ride (film)|2015 movie adaptation]] of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nicholassparks.com/stories/the-longest-ride/|title=The Longest Ride|last=Creative|first=The Uprising|website=Nicholas Sparks|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But I quickly found there was nothing like it there—in fact, the only other school I have found that offered the same kind of open experience was Black Mountain.’”&lt;/ref&gt;

Although currently a [[Theravada]] Buddhism flourishing country, the [[Mahayana]] cult of worshipping '''Bodhisattva statues''' has existed in ancient [[Sri Lanka]]. Archaeological evidences show that [[Bodhisattva]] cult had existed as a secondary cult inferior to worship of [[Buddha]] during the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sanath Dharmabandu|title=චිත්‍ර හා මූර්ති කලාව|publisher=M.

==History==
During the middle [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]], [[Bodhisattva]] cult became very popular in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ranjith Hewage|title=විස්මිත අතීත උරුමයන්|publisher=Susara Publishers |date=2012 |chapter=වෙහෙරගල අව‍ලෝකිතේශ්වර බෝධිසත්ත්ව මූර්තිය|isbn=9789556761658}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early period, [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Buddhism]] was predominantly flourished with [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravāda]] Buddhist ideas. Later, [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] aspects were developed. In the [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, [[Bodhisattva]]s were worshipped with a major significance. During the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]] it is mentioned that, [[Mahasena of Anuradhapura|King Mahāsēna]] had built Bodhisattva images.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura|King Dhatusena]] (459–477 CE) had built a statue of [[Maitreya]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nandadeva Wijesekara|title=පැරණි සිංහල ප්‍රතිමා ශිල්පය|publisher=M. D. Gunasena and Company Ltd. |date=1997|chapter=සොයාගැනීම්වල ඉතිහාසය|isbn=9789553061812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several inscriptions mentioning [[Avalokitesvara]] has found from the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During 7th–10th centuries AD, [[Mahayana]] Buddhism had spread along the [[Sri Lanka]]n territory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is evidenced by many surviving Bodhisattva statues and carvings belonging to the period. It is mentioned that King [[Dappula I of Anuradhapura]] had built a 15 cubits-high [[Maitreya]] image in [[Ruhuna]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This image is believed to be the recently restored [[Dambegoda Bodhisattva statue]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is an evidence for the strong Maitreya cult in ancient Sri Lanka.

[[Bhuvanaikabahu IV of Gampola|King Bhuwanekabāhu IV]] of [[Kingdom of Gampola|Gampola]] has built Maitreya and [[Natha (Buddhist deity)|Nātha]] (Avalokitesvara) statues in [[Lankatilaka Vihara]]. It is mentioned that King [[Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy|Kirti Sri Rajasinghe]] had built a [[Maitreya]] image in [[Ridi Viharaya]]. ''Dambulu Viahara thudapatha'', a text dated to1780 CE mentions about some Maitreya and Nātha images of the temple. These images can be seen flanking the standing Buddha near the central entrance of [[Dambulla cave temple]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist art''' is the [[art|artistic practices]] that are influenced by [[Buddhism]]. It includes art media which depict [[Buddha]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; [[mandala]]s and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as [[vajra]]s, bells, [[stupa]]s and [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist temple architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Buddhist Art? |url=http://buddhistartnews.wordpress.com/what-is-buddhist-art/ |publisher=Buddhist Art News |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BCE, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and co-developed with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] art, with cave temple complexes built together, each likely influencing the other.&lt;ref name=blurton113&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 113-116, 160-162, 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-iconic phase (5th century – 1st century BCE)==
{{See also|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Footprint of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. 1st century BCE, [[Gandhara]].]]
During the 2nd to 1st century BCE, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha’s life and teachings. These took the form of votive tablets or [[frieze]]s, usually in relation to the decoration of stupas.
Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form, but only through [[Buddhist symbolism]]. This period may have been [[aniconism in Buddhism|aniconic]].

Artists were reluctant to depict the Buddha anthropomorphically, and developed sophisticated aniconic symbols to avoid doing so (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear). This tendency remained as late as the 2nd century CE in the southern parts of India, in the art of the [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district#Amaravati School|Amaravati School]] (see: [[Mara (demon)|Mara's assault on the Buddha]]).
It has been argued that earlier anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha may have been made of wood and may have perished since then. However, no related archaeological evidence has been found.

The earliest works of Buddhist art in India date back to the 1st century BCE The
[[Mahabodhi Temple]] at Bodh Gaya became a model for similar structures in Burma
and Indonesia. The frescoes at [[Sigiriya]] are said to be even older than the
[[Ajanta Caves]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art ]  Frontline Magazine 13–26 May 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconic phase (1st century CE – present)==
{{see also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Padmapani, cave 1, Ajanta, India.jpg|thumb|left|Over life-size figure of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Padmapani]], cave 1, [[Ajanta Caves]], 5th century]]
Anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha started to emerge from the 1st century CE in [[Northern India]]. The two main centers of creation have been identified as [[Gandhara]] in today’s [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]], in [[Pakistan]], and the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern India.

Hellenistic culture was introduced in Gandhara during the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign: 321–298 BCE), founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]], conquered the Macedonian satraps during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]] of 305–303 BCE. Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]] (reign: 268-232 BCE), who formed the largest Empire in the Indian subcontinent, converted to Buddhism following the [[Kalinga War]]. Abandoning an expansionist ideology, Ashoka worked to spread the religion and philosophy throughout his empire as described in the [[edicts of Ashoka]]. Ashoka claims to have converted the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

After the overthrow of the Mauryan Empire by the [[Shunga Empire]], the  [[Greco-Bactrian]] and subsequently the [[Indo-Greek]] Kingdoms invaded north-western India. They facilitated the spread of Greco-Buddhist art style to other parts of the subcontinent. The Indo-Greek King [[Menander I]] was renown as a great patron of Buddhism, attaining the title of an [[arhat]].&lt;ref&gt;"(In the Milindapanha) Menander is declared an arhat", McEvilley, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] persecuted Buddhism, presumably to further erase the legacy of the Mauryan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Caleb; Sarao, K. T. S. (2010). "Pushyamitra Sunga, a Hindu ruler in the second century BCE, was a great persecutor of Buddhists". In Danver, Steven L. Popular Controversies in World History. ABC-CLIO. p. 89. {{ISBN|9781598840780}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the decline of Buddhist art east of Mathura.

Gandharan Buddhist sculpture displays [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Hellenistic artistic influence]] in the forms of human figures and ornament. Figures were much larger than any known from India previously, and also more naturalistic, and new details included wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, and [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf ornament.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Inscribed Seated Buddha Image in Abhaya Mudra - Kushan Period - Katra Keshav Dev - ACCN A-1 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5972.JPG|thumb|Mathura school Buddha, [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]]]]

The art of Mathura tends to be based on an Indian tradition, exemplified by the anthropomorphic representation of divinities such as the [[Yaksha|Yaksas]], although in a style rather archaic compared to the later representations of the Buddha. The Mathuran school contributed clothes covering the left shoulder of thin [[muslin]], the wheel on the palm, the lotus seat.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Mathura and Gandhara also influenced each other. During their artistic florescence, the two regions were even united politically under the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], both being capitals of the empire. It is still a matter of debate whether the anthropomorphic representations of Buddha was essentially a result of a local evolution of Buddhist art at Mathura, or a consequence of Greek cultural influence in Gandhara through the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] [[syncretism]].

This iconic art was characterized from the start by a realistic idealism, combining realistic human features, proportions, attitudes and attributes, together with a sense of perfection and serenity reaching to the divine. This expression of the Buddha as both man and God became the iconographic canon for subsequent Buddhist art.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Remains of early Buddhist painting in India are vanishingly rare, with the later phases of the [[Ajanta Caves]] giving the great majority of surviving work, created over a relatively short up to about 480 CE.  These are highly sophisticated works, evidently produced in a well-developed tradition, probably painting secular work in palaces as much as religious subjects.

Buddhist art continued to develop in India for a few more centuries. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of Mathura evolved during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (4th to 6th century CE) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. The art of the Gupta school was extremely influential almost everywhere in the rest of Asia. At the end of the 12th century CE, Buddhism in its full glory came to be preserved only in the Himalayan regions in India. These areas, helped by their location, were in greater contact with Tibet and China - for example the art and traditions of [[Ladakh]] bear the stamp of Tibetan and Chinese influence.
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|240px|Buddhist expansion throughout Asia.]]
As Buddhism expanded outside of India from the 1st century CE, its original artistic package blended with other artistic influences, leading to a progressive differentiation among the countries adopting the faith.
* A '''Northern route''' was established from the 1st century CE through [[Central Asia]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], in which [[Mahayana]] Buddhism prevailed.
* A '''Southern route''', where [[Theravada]] Buddhism dominated, went through [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]].

==Northern Buddhist art==
[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|left|thumb|A Chinese wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE)]]

The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] to Central Asia, China and ultimately Korea and Japan started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Ming]] (58-75&amp;nbsp;AD). However, extensive contacts started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]], with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]], were either [[Parthia]]n, [[Kushan]], [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] or [[Kuchean]].

Central Asian missionary efforts along the [[Silk Road]] were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of [[Serindian art]] from the 2nd through the 11th century in the Tarim Basin, modern [[Xinjiang]]. Serindian art often derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Pakistan]], combining Indian, Greek and [[Roman art|Roman]] influences. Silk Road Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs, Buddhist imagery, and a select few representations of [[Kami|Japanese gods]].

The art of the northern route was also highly influenced by the development of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, an inclusive branch of Buddhism characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]], and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. Mahāyāna goes beyond the traditional [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist]] ideal of the release from suffering ([[dukkha|duḥkha]]) of [[arhat]]s, and emphasizes the [[bodhisattva]] path. The Mahāyāna sutras elevate the Buddha to a transcendent and infinite being, and feature a pantheon of bodhisattvas devoting themselves to the [[Paramita|Six Perfections]], ultimate knowledge ([[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]]), enlightenment, and the liberation of all sentient beings. Northern Buddhist art thus tends to be characterized by a very rich and syncretic Buddhist pantheon, with a multitude of images of the various [[Buddhahood|buddhas]], bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings ([[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]).

===Afghanistan===
[[File:GBA1(trimmed).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue from a Buddhist monastery, 700&amp;nbsp;AD, Afghanistan]]
Buddhist art in [[Afghanistan]] (old [[Bactria]]) persisted for several centuries until the spread of Islam in the 7th century. It is exemplified by the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Other sculptures, in [[stucco]], [[schist]] or [[clay]], display very strong blending of Indian post-[[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] mannerism and Classical influence, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]].

Although Islamic rule was somewhat tolerant of other religions "[[People of the Book|of the Book]]", it showed little tolerance for Buddhism, which was perceived as a religion depending on "[[idolatry]]". Human figurative art forms also being prohibited under Islam, Buddhist art suffered numerous attacks, which culminated with the systematic destructions by the [[Taliban]] regime. The Buddhas of Bamyan, the sculptures of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], and many of the remaining artifacts at the Afghanistan museum have been destroyed.

The multiple conflicts since the 1980s also have led to a systematic pillage of archaeological sites apparently in the hope of reselling in the international market what artifacts could be found.

===Central Asia===
{{See also|Dunhuang|Mogao Caves|Kingdom of Khotan|Silk Road|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
[[File:SerindianGroup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Serindian art]], 6th-7th century [[Terra cotta|terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang).]]
[[Central Asia]] long played the role of a meeting place between China, India and [[Iran|Persia]]. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] to the West led to increased contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

Thereafter, the expansion of Buddhism to the North led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oasis of Central Asia. Some [[Silk Road]] cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between East and West.

The eastern part of Central Asia  ([[Chinese Turkestan]] ([[Tarim Basin]], [[Xinjiang]]) in particular has revealed an extremely rich [[Serindian art]] ([[cave painting|wall paintings]] and [[relief]]s in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. Works of art reminiscent of the Gandharan style, as well as scriptures in the Gandhari script [[Kharoshti]] have been found. These influences were rapidly absorbed however by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.

===China===
{{see also|Chinese Buddhist sculpture}}
Buddhism arrived in [[China]] around the 1st century CE, and introduced new types of art into China, particularly in the area of [[statue|statuary]]. Receiving this distant religion, strong Chinese traits were incorporated into Buddhist art.

====Northern Dynasties====
In the 5th to 6th centuries, the [[Northern Dynasties]] developed rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible and realistic manner, progressively led to a change towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

Sites preserving Northern Wei Dynasty Buddhist sculpture:
*[[Yungang Grottoes]], [[Shanxi]]
*[[Longmen Grottoes]], [[Henan]]
*[[Bingling Temple]], [[Gansu]]

====Tang Dynasty====
[[File:Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets by Chang Huai-hsing.jpg|thumb|right|''{{ill|Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets|yue|熾盛光佛並五星圖}}'', 897 A.D.]]
Following a transition under the [[Sui Dynasty]], Buddhist sculpture of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. Because of the dynasty's openness to foreign influences, and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India, Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Indian art of the Gupta period. During that time, the Tang capital of [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) became an important center for Buddhism. From there Buddhism spread to [[Korea]], and [[Japanese missions to Tang China]] helped it gain a foothold in Japan.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang China|Wuzong]] outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) in order to support the indigenous religion, [[Taoism]]. He confiscated Buddhist possessions, and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the development of the religion and its arts in China.

[[Chán]] Buddhism however, as the origin of Japanese [[Zen]], continued to prosper for some centuries, especially under the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), when Chan monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.

[[File:Chinesischer Maler von 1238 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of the Chinese [[Zen]] Buddhist [[Wuzhun Shifan]], painted in 1238&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Song Dynasty]].]]

Early paintings by Chán monks tended to eschew the meticulous realism of [[Gongbi]] painting in favour of vigorous, monochrome paintings, attempting to express the impact of enlightenment through their brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, A; ''The imperial capitals of China: an inside view of the celestial empire'', Random House 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84595-010-1}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Neo-Confucianism]] under [[Zhu Xi]] in the twelfth century resulted in considerable criticism of the monk-painters. Connected as they were with the then-unpopular school of Chan Buddhism, their paintings were discarded and ignored. Some paintings survived after being transported to Japan by visiting Zen monks, but the school of Chan painting gradually diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Valérie Malenfer; ''Dreaming the southern song landscape: the power of illusion in Chinese painting'', BRILL 1999, {{ISBN|978-90-04-11011-3}} p161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qing Dynasty====
During the Qing Dynasty, Manchu emperors supported Buddhist practices for a range of political and personal reasons. The [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was a devotee of Chan Buddhism, while his successor, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] promoted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], claiming to be the human embodiment of the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref&gt;Weidner, Marsha Smith, and Patricia Ann Berger. Latter Days of the Law : Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850-1850. Lawrence, KS: Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was under the rule of the third Qing ruler, the [[Qianlong Emperor]], that imperial patronage of the Buddhist arts reached its height in this period. He commissioned a vast number of religious works in the Tibetan style, many of which depicted him in various sacred guises.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.113&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art produced during this period are characterized by a unique fusion of Tibetan and Chinese artistic approaches. They combine a characteristically Tibetan attention to iconographic detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements. Inscriptions are often written in Chinese, Manchu, Tibetan, Mongolian and Sanskrit, while paintings are frequently rendered in vibrant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p.webm|thumb|Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p]]
Additionally, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] initiated a number of large-scale construction projects; in 1744 he rededicated the [[Yonghe Temple]] as Beijing's main Tibetan Buddhist monastery, donating a number of valuable religious paintings, sculptures, textiles and inscriptions to the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xumi Fushou Temple]], and the works housed within, is another project commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] that embodies the unique blend of Tibetan and Manchu artistic styles that characterized Buddhist art produced in China under Qianlong's reign.

After the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s abdication in 1795, the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism at the Qing court declined. The motives behind the Qing emperors' promotion of Tibetan Buddhism have been interpreted as a calculated act of political manipulation, and a means of forging ties between Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan communities, though this has been challenged by recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Patricia Ann. Empire of Emptiness : Buddhist Art and Political Authority In Qing China. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legacy====
[[File:Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p.webm|thumb|Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p]]
The popularization of Buddhism in China has made the country home to one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts in the world. The [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] and the [[Bingling Temple]] caves near [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] province, the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province, and the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] near [[Chongqing]] municipality are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.

===Korea===
{{see also|Buddhism in Korea|Korean Buddhist sculpture|Korean art}}
[[Korea]]n Buddhist art generally reflects an interaction between other Buddhist influences and a strongly original Korean culture. Additionally, the art of the steppes, particularly Siberian and [[Scythia]]n influences, are evident in early Korean Buddhist art based on the excavation of artifacts and burial goods such as [[Silla]] [[Crown of Silla|royal crowns]], belt buckles, daggers, and comma-shaped [[gogok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/crown.htm |title=Crown |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Arts of Korea |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this indigenous art was geometric, abstract and richly adorned with a {{clarify span|characteristic "barbarian" luxury|date=November 2012}}. Although many other influences were strong, Korean Buddhist art, "bespeaks a sobriety, taste for the right tone, a sense of abstraction but also of colours that curiously enough are in line with contemporary taste" (Pierre Cambon, ''Arts asiatiques- Guimet''').

====Three Kingdoms of Korea====

Particularly important in the transmission of sophisticated art styles to the Korean kingdoms was the art of the "barbarian" Tuoba, a clan of non-Han Chinese Xianbei people who established the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty in China in 386. The Northern Wei style was particularly influential in the art of the Goguryeo and Baekje. Baekje artisans later transmitted this style along with Southern Dynasty elements and distinct Korean elements to Japan. Korean artisans were highly selective of the styles they incorporated and combined different regional styles together to create a specific Korean Buddhist art style.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), pp. 27 &amp; 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture, 5th&amp;ndash;9th Century |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Timeline of Arts History |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Goguryeo Buddhist art exhibited vitality and mobility akin with Northern Wei prototypes, the Baekje Kingdom was also in close contact with the [[Southern Dynasties]] of China and this close diplomatic contact is exemplified in the gentle and proportional sculpture of the Baekje, epitomized by Baekje sculpture exhibiting the fathomless smile known to art historians as the [[Baekje smile]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture (5th–9th century) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=metmuseum.org |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silla Kingdom also developed a distinctive Buddhist art tradition epitomized by the [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], a half-seated contemplative maitreya whose Korean-made twin, the Miroku Bosatsu, was sent to Japan as a proselytizing gift and now resides in the Koryu-ji Temple in Japan.&lt;ref name="kenyon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln275/Jap-Kor-art.htm |title=Japanese Art and Its Korean Secret |publisher=www2.kenyon.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms period stimulated massive temple-building projects, such as the [[Mireuksa]] Temple in the Baekje Kingdom and the [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple in Silla.

Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Korean style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the Koryu-ji Miroku Bosatsu and the Chugu-ji Siddhartha statues. Although many historians portray Korea as a mere transmitter of Buddhism, the Three Kingdoms, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Korea: A Religious History |author=Grayson, J.H. |date=2002 |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |isbn=9780700716050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1BzL2lwPqEC |page=33 |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unified Silla====
[[File:Goryeo Pagoda.jpg|thumb|160px|The Goryeo era [[Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda]] sits on the first floor of the [[National Museum of Korea]].]]
During the [[Unified Silla]] period, [[East Asia]] was particularly stable with China and Korea both enjoying unified governments. Early Unified Silla art combined Silla styles and Baekje styles. Korean Buddhist art was also influenced by new [[Tang Dynasty]] styles as evidenced by a new popular Buddhist motif with full-faced Buddha sculptures. Tang China was the cross roads of East, Central, and South Asia and so the Buddhist art of this time period exhibit the so-called international style. State-sponsored Buddhist art flourished during this period, the epitome of which is the [[Seokguram]] Grotto.

====Goryeo Dynasty====
The fall of the Unified Silla Dynasty and the establishment of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty in 918 indicates a new period of Korean Buddhist art. The Goryeo kings also lavishly sponsored Buddhism and Buddhist art flourished, especially Buddhist paintings and illuminated sutras written in gold and silver ink. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/eak/ht07eak.htm]. The crowning achievement of this period is the carving of approximately 80,000 woodblocks of the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] which was done twice.

====Joseon Dynasty====
The [[Joseon Dynasty]] actively suppressed Buddhism beginning in 1406 and Buddhist temples and art production subsequently decline in quality in quantity although beginning in 1549, Buddhist art does continue to be produced.

[[File:ASURA detail Kohfukuji.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The ASURA in [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (734)]]
Before the introduction of Buddhism, [[Japan]] had already been the seat of various cultural (and artistic) influences, from the abstract linear decorative art of the indigenous Neolithic [[Jōmon]] from around 10500&amp;nbsp;BC to 300&amp;nbsp;BC, to the art during the [[Yayoi]] and [[Kofun]] periods, with developments such as [[Haniwa]] art.

The cultural exchange between India and Japan was not direct, as Japan received Buddhism through Korea, China, Central Asia and eventually India. The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled to the islands together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The cultural contact between Indian Dharmic civilization and Japan through the adoption of Buddhist ideas and aesthetic has contributed to the development of a national cultural order in the subsequent century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Indian Influence on the Art of Japan | author = Sampa Biswas | publisher = Northern Book Centre | year = 2010 | isbn = 9788172112691 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=fLjcMfMGP10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Japan&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisg5jQrPrVAhWKMo8KHXxoBpEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Japan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century. Being geographically at the end of the [[Silk Road]], Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.

From 711, numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], including a five-story [[pagoda]], the Golden Hall of the Horyuji, and the [[Kōfuku-ji]] temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. Indian, Hellenistic, Chinese and Korean artistic influences blended into an original style characterized by realism and gracefulness. The creation of Japanese Buddhist art was especially rich between the 8th and 13th centuries during the periods of [[Nara period|Nara]], [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]].
Japan developed an extremely rich figurative art for the pantheon of Buddhist deities, sometimes combined with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Shinto]] influences. This art can be very varied, creative and bold.

From the 12th and 13th, a further development was [[Zen]] art, and it faces golden days in [[Muromachi Period]], following the introduction of the faith by [[Dogen]] and [[Eisai]] upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as [[sumi-e]]) and poetry (especially [[haiku]]s), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned "non-dualistic" representations. The search for enlightenment "in the moment" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the [[Chanoyu]] tea ceremony or the [[Ikebana]] art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques ([[martial art]]s).

Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Still around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved. Many of them are in wood and are regularly restored.

===Tibet and Bhutan===
{{See also|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}
[[File:Yama tibet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]] 18th century, Tibet]]
[[Tantric Buddhism]] started as a movement in eastern India around the 5th or the 6th century. Many of the practices of Tantric Buddhism are derived from [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] (the usage of [[mantra]]s, [[yoga]], or the burning of sacrificial offerings). Tantrism became the dominant form of Buddhism in [[Tibet]] from the 8th century. Due to its geographical centrality in Asia, Tibetan Buddhist art received influence from Indian, [[Nepal]]i, Greco-Buddhist and Chinese art.

One of the most characteristic creations of Tibetan Buddhist art are the [[mandala]]s, diagrams of a "divine temple" made of a circle enclosing a square, the purpose of which is to help Buddhist devotees focus their attention through meditation and follow the path to the central image of the Buddha.
Artistically, Buddhist [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art and Hindu art tend to be the two strongest inspirations of Tibetan art.

In 10th to 11th centuries, [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], Northern India (at that time part of Western Tibet Kingdom) serves an important role as an intermediary between India and Tibet cultural exchange, especially Buddhist art and philosophy. Notable example of Tibetan Buddhist art in Tabo is its exquisite frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tabo: a lamp for the kingdom : early Indo Tibetan Buddhist art in the western Himalaya, Archeologia, arte primitiva e orientale | author1 =Deborah E.

===Vietnam===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The boy Buddha rising up from lotus. Crimson and gilded wood, Trần-Hồ dynasty, Vietnam, 14th-15th century]]
Chinese influence was predominant in the north of [[Vietnam]] (Tonkin) between the 1st and 9th centuries, and [[Confucianism]] and Mahayana Buddhism were prevalent. Overall, the art of Vietnam has been strongly influenced by Chinese Buddhist art.

In the south thrived the former kingdom of [[Champa]] (before it was later overtaken by the Vietnamese from the north). [[Champa]] had a strongly Indianized art, just as neighboring [[Cambodia]]. Many of its statues were characterized by rich body adornments. The capital of the kingdom of Champa was annexed by Vietnam in 1471, and it totally collapsed in the 1720s, while [[Cham (Asia)|Cham people]] remain an abundant minority across [[Southeast Asia]].

==Southern Buddhist art==
The orthodox forms of Buddhism, also known as Southern Buddhism are still practised in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. During the 1st century CE, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise of the [[Parthia]]n empire in the [[Middle East]], an unvanquished enemy of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connections, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Trade routes linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Thailand|Siam]], lower [[Cambodia]] and southern [[Vietnam]], and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.

[[File:CambodianBuddha.JPG|thumb|upright|A Cambodian Buddha, 14th century]]
For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[Pāli|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and the Indian script, together with [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhism, [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. This expansion provided the artistic context for the development of Buddhist art in these countries, which then developed characteristics of their own.

Between the 1st and 8th centuries, several kingdoms competed for influence in the region (particularly the Cambodian [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] then the Burmese [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdoms) contributing various artistic characteristics, mainly derived from the Indian [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] style. Combined with a pervading Hindu influence, Buddhist images, votive tablets and Sanskrit inscriptions are found throughout the area. Between 8th- and 12th-century, under the patronage of [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]], arts and ideas of Buddhism and Hinduism co-developed and became increasingly intermeshed.&lt;ref name=richardblurton202/&gt; However, with Muslim invasion and sacking of monasteries in India, states Richard Blurton,  "Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India".&lt;ref name=richardblurton202&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 202-204, Quote: "Buddhism flourished in this part of India throughout the first millennium AD, especially under the patronage of Pala kings of the eighth and twelfth centuries. Towards the end of this period, popular Buddhism and Hinduism became increasingly intermeshed. However, when Muslim invaders from further west sacked the monasteries in the twelfth century, Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple.]]

By the 8th to 9th century, [[Sailendra]]n Buddhist art were developed and flourished in [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] kingdom of [[Central Java]], Indonesia. This period marked the renaissance of Buddhist art in Java, as numerous exquisite monuments were built, including [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Mendut]] and [[Borobudur]] stone mandala. The traditions would continue to the 13th century [[Singhasari]] Buddhist art of East Java.

From the 9th to the 13th centuries, Southeast Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The [[Sri Vijaya]] Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence, but both were adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, and their art expressed the rich Mahayana pantheon of the [[Bodhisattva]]s.
The [[Theravada]] Buddhism of the Pali canon was introduced to the region around the 13th century from [[Sri Lanka]], and was adopted by the newly founded [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]]. Since in Theravada Buddhism of the period, Monasteries typically were the central places for the laity of the towns to receive instruction and have disputes arbitrated by the monks, the construction of temple complexes plays a particularly important role in the artistic expression of Southeast Asia from that time.

From the 14th century, the main factor was the spread of [[Islam]] to the maritime areas of Southeast Asia, overrunning [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and most of the islands as far as the [[Southern Philippines]]. In the continental areas, Theravada Buddhism continued to expand into Burma, [[Laos]] and Cambodia.

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddha statue in Sri Lanka.]]
According to tradition, Buddhism was introduced in Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE by Indian missionaries under the guidance of Thera [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], the son of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]]. Prior to the expansion of Buddhism, the indigenous population of Sri Lanka lived in an animistic world full of superstition. The assimilation and conversion of the various pre-Buddhist beliefs was a slow process. In order to gain a foothold among the rural population, Buddhism needed to assimilate the various categories of spirits and other supernatural beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The earliest monastic complex was the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahāvihāra]] at [[Anuradhapura|Anurādhapura]] founded by [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Devānampiyatissa]] and presented to Mahinda Thera. The Mahāvihāra became the centre of the orthodox Theravāda doctrine and its supreme position remained unchallenged until the foundation of the [[Abhayagiri Vihāra]] around BC 89 by [[Valagamba of Anuradhapura|Vaţţagāmaņĩ]].

The Abhayagiri Vihāra became the seat of the reformed Mahāyāna doctrines. The rivalry between the monks of the Mahāvihāra and the Abhayagiri led to a further split and the foundation of the [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavanarama]] near the Mahāvihāra. The main feature of Sinhala Buddhism was its division into three major groups, or ''nikāyas'', named after the three main monastic complexes at Anurādhapura; the Mahāvihāra, the Abhayagiri, and the Jetavanārāma. This was the result in the deviations in the disciplinary rules ''(vinaya)'' and doctrinal disputes. All the other monasteries of Sri Lanka owed ecclesiastical allegiance to one of the three. Sri Lanka is famous for its creations of Buddhist sculptures made of stone and cast in bronze alloy.&lt;ref&gt;von Schroeder, Ulrich. 1990. ''Buddhist Sculptures of Sri Lanka''.

===Myanmar===
[[File:Buddha 00004.JPG|thumb|upright|A Mandalay-style statue of Buddha]]
A neighbor of India, [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was naturally strongly influenced by the eastern part of Indian territory. The [[Mon people|Mon]] of southern Burma are said to have been converted to Buddhism around 200&amp;nbsp;BC under the proselytizing of the Indian king [[Ashoka]], before the schism between [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

Early Buddhist temples are found, such as Beikthano in central Myanmar, with dates between the 1st and the 5th centuries. The Buddhist art of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in Southeast Asia following the expansion of the Mon Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries.

Later, thousands of Buddhist temples were built at [[Bagan]], the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries, and around 2,000 of them are still standing. Beautiful jeweled statues of the Buddha are remaining from that period. Creation managed to continue despite the seizure of the city by the [[Mongols]] in 1287.
[[File:Bodleian MS. Burm. a. 12 Life of the Buddha 15-18.jpg|thumbnail|left|Scenes from the life of the Buddha in an 18th-century Burmese watercolour]]
During the [[Ava Kingdom|Ava period]], from the 14th to 16th centuries, the Ava (Innwa) style of the Buddha image was popular. In this style, the Buddha has large protruding ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, thin lips and a hair bun that is pointed at the top, usually depicted in the bhumisparsa [[mudra]].&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part1/post_pagan_period__part_1.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 1 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Konbaung dynasty]], at the end of the 18th century, the Mandalay style of the Buddha image emerged, a style that remains popular to this day.&lt;ref name="niu2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part3/post_pagan_period__part_3.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 3 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a marked departure from the Innwa style, and the Buddha's face is much more natural, fleshy, with naturally-slanted eyebrows, slightly slanted eyes, thicker lips, and a round hair bun at the top. Buddha images in this style can be found reclining, standing or sitting.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/mandalay_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalay-style Buddhas wear flowing, draped robes.

Another common style of Buddha images is the Shan style, from the [[Shan people]], who inhabit the highlands of Myanmar. In this style, the Buddha is depicted with angular features, a large and prominently pointed nose, a hair bun tied similar to Thai styles, and a small, thin mouth.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/shan_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===
{{See|Khmer art|Khmer sculpture}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Lokesvara statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Bodhisattva [[Avalokitesvara|Lokesvara]], [[Cambodia]] 12th century.]]
[[Cambodia]] was the center of the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] kingdom, which expanded into Burma and as far south as Malaysia between the 3rd and 6th centuries. Its influence seems to have been essentially political, most of the cultural influence coming directly from India.

Later, from the 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu [[Khmer Empire]] dominated vast parts of the Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was foremost in the development of Buddhist art in the region. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of [[Jayavarman VII]], a Buddhist king that built [[Angkor Thom]] walled city, adorned with the smiling face of [[Lokeshvara]] in Angkor Thom ''dvaras'' (gates) and ''prasat'' towers [[Bayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Monuments and Temples of Cambodia and Laos | author = W.

A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.

Often, Khmer art manages to express intense spirituality through divinely beaming expressions, in spite of spare features and slender lines.

===Thailand===

[[File:Wat Si Chum in Sukhothai.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Phra Atchana [[Wat Si Chum]], [[Sukhothai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]
The Thai Buddhist art encompasses period for more than a millennia, from pre Thai culture of Dvaravati and Srivijaya, to the first Thai capital of Thai 13th century Sukhothai, all the way to  succeeding Thai kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"&gt;{{cite book | title = Thai Buddhist Art: Discover Thai Art | author = Dawn F.

From the 1st to the 7th centuries, Buddhist art in [[Thailand]] was first influenced by direct contact with Indian traders and the expansion of the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdom, leading to the creation of Hindu and Buddhist art inspired from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] tradition, with numerous monumental statues of great virtuosity.

From the 9th century, the various schools of Thai art then became strongly influenced by Cambodian [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] art in the north and [[Sri Vijaya]] art in the south, both of Mahayana faith. Up to the end of that period, Buddhist art is characterized by a clear fluidness in the expression, and the subject matter is characteristic of the [[Mahayana]] pantheon with multiple creations of [[Bodhisattva]]s.

From the 13th century, [[Theravada]] Buddhism was introduced from Sri Lanka around the same time as the [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] was established.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; The new faith inspired highly stylized images in Thai Buddhism, with sometimes very geometrical and almost abstract figures.

During the [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period (14th-18th centuries), the Buddha came to be represented in a more stylistic manner with sumptuous garments and jeweled ornamentations. Many Thai sculptures or temples tended to be [[gilding|gilded]], and on occasion enriched with inlays.

The ensuing period of [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] saw the further development of Thai Buddhist art.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; By the 18th century, [[Bangkok]] was established as the royal center of the kingdom of [[Siam]]. Subsequently, the Thai rulers filled the city with imposing Buddhist monuments to demonstrate their Buddhist piety as well as to showcase their authority. Among others are the celebrated [[Wat Phra Kaew]] which hosts the [[Emerald Buddha]]. Other Buddhist temples in Bangkok includes [[Wat Arun]] with ''prang'' style towers, and [[Wat Pho]] with its famous image of [[Reclining Buddha]].

[[File:Borobudur-perfect-buddha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Buddha in [[Borobudur]].]]
Like the rest of Southeast Asia, [[Indonesia]] seems to have been most strongly influenced by India from the 1st century CE. The islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java (island)|Java]] in western Indonesia were the seat of the empire of [[Sri Vijaya]] (8th-13th century), which came to dominate most of the area around the Southeast Asian peninsula through maritime power. The Sri Vijayan Empire had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, under a line of rulers named the [[Sailendra]]. The Sailendras was the ardent temple builder and the devoted patron of Buddhism in Java.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java | author1 = Jean Philippe Vogel | author2 = Adriaan Jacob Barnouw | publisher = Asian Educational Services | year = 1936 | isbn = 9788120612259 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=wQ2x0cbZkn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Java&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLm_6o6PfVAhXKo48KHUc_DuEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Java&amp;f=false| pages = 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sri Vijaya spread Mahayana Buddhist art during its expansion into the Southeast Asian peninsula. Numerous statues of Mahayana [[Bodhisattva]]s from this period are characterized by a very strong refinement and technical sophistication, and are found throughout the region. One of the earliest Buddhist inscription in Java, the [[Kalasan inscription]] dated 778, mentioned about the construction of a [[Kalasan|temple]] for the goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt;

Extremely rich and refined architectural remains are found in Java and Sumatra. The most magnificent is the temple of [[Borobudur]] (the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built  around 780-850&amp;nbsp;AD), built by Sailendras.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt; This temple is modelled after the Buddhist concept of universe, the [[Mandala]] which counts 505 images of the seated Buddha and unique bell-shaped stupa that contains the statue of Buddha. Borobudur is adorned with long series of bas-reliefs narrated the holy Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas | author = John Miksic | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781462909100 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=borobudur+golden+tales+of+the+buddhas&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP45O7r_rVAhWJtY8KHcpuAfYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20art&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Buddhist structure in Indonesia probably is the [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] stupas at Karawang, West Java, dated from around the 4th century. This temple is some plastered brick stupas. However, Buddhist art in Indonesia reach the golden era during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty rule in Java. The bas-reliefs and statues of [[Boddhisatva]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], and [[Kinnara]] found in [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sewu|Sewu]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], and [[Candi Plaosan|Plaosan]] temple is very graceful with serene expression, While [[Mendut]] temple near Borobudur, houses the giant statue of [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]].

In [[Sumatra]] Sri Vijaya probably built the temple of Muara Takus, and [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]]. The most beautiful example of classical Javanese Buddhist art is the serene and delicate statue of [[Prajnaparamita]] (the collection of National Museum Jakarta) the goddess of transcendental wisdom from [[Singhasari]] kingdom.&lt;ref name ="VCM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prajnaparamita | publisher =Virtual Collections of Asian Masterpieces| url  =http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=12147| accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian Buddhist Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the [[Chola]] rulers of India, then followed by [[Majapahit]] empire.

==Contemporary Buddhist art==
[[File:Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism (1916) (14779469804).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration from the book "Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism" (1916).]]
Many contemporary artists have made use of Buddhist themes. Notable examples are [[Bill Viola]], in his video installations,&lt;ref&gt;Buddha Mind in Contemporary Art, University of California Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Connell]], in sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;ARTlines, April 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allan Graham]] in his multi-media "Time is Memory".&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Rail, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK [[The Network of Buddhist Organisations]] has interested itself in identifying Buddhist practitioners across all the arts. In 2005 it co-ordinated the UK-wide Buddhist arts festival, "A Lotus in Flower";&lt;ref&gt;a poster advertising one of the events is archived here - http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824213345/http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf# |date=24 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 it helped organise the two-day arts conference, "Buddha Mind, Creative Mind".&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwbo-news.blogspot.com/2009/07/report-from-buddha-mind-creative-mind.html |title=Triratna Buddhist Community News: Report from ‘Buddha Mind - Creative Mind?’ conference |author=Lokabandhu |publisher=fwbo-news.blogspot.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the latter an association of Buddhist artists was formed.&lt;ref name="ning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dharmaarts.ning.com/ |title=Dharma Arts Network - Launched at Buddha Mind - Creative Mind ? |publisher=dharmaarts.ning.com |accessdate=2014-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010000408/http://dharmaarts.ning.com/# |archive-date=10 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative negligence''', or non-absolute [[contributory negligence]] outside the United States, is a partial legal defense that reduces the amount of damages that a plaintiff can recover in a negligence-based claim, based upon the degree to which the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to cause the injury.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Negligence and Tort Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the defense is asserted, the factfinder, usually a jury, must decide the degree to which the [[plaintiff]]'s negligence and the combined negligence of all other relevant actors all contributed to cause the plaintiff's damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Victor E.|title=Strict Liability and Comparative Negligence|journal=Tennessee Law Review|date=1974|volume=42|page=171|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/tenn42&amp;div=17&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modification of the doctrine of contributory negligence that disallows any recovery by a plaintiff whose negligence contributed even minimally to causing the damages.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

== Explanation ==
Prior to the late 1960s, only a few states had adopted the system. When comparative negligence was adopted, three main versions were used. The first was called "pure" comparative negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooter|first1=Robert D.|last2=Ulen|first2=Thomas S.|title=An Economic Case for Comparative Negligence|journal=New York University Law Review|date=1986|volume=61|page=1067|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2289&amp;context=facpubs|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff who was 90% to blame for an accident could recover 10% of his losses. (Of course, defendants who suffered injuries in such a case could counter claim and recover 90% of losses from the other party.)

The second and third versions are lumped together in what is called "modified" comparative negligence. One variant allows plaintiffs to recover "only" if the plaintiff's negligence is "not greater than" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must not be more than 50% of the combined negligence of both parties).

The other variant allows plaintiffs to recover "only if" the plaintiff's negligence is "not as great as" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must be less than 50% of the combined negligence). The apparently minor difference between the two modified forms of comparative negligence is thought by lawyers handling such cases to be significant, as juries who ordinarily assign degrees of fault are much less willing to award damages to a plaintiff who is equally at fault than to one who is less at fault than the defendant.

== Contributory negligence doctrine ==
Some states, though, still use the [[contributory negligence]] doctrine to evaluate negligence in a tort. For instance, [[Alabama]], [[Maryland]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]] continue to use contributory negligence.

Neither comparative negligence nor contributory negligence should be confused with [[joint and several liability]], which generally holds each of two or more culpable [[defendants]] responsible for all the damages sustained by a plaintiff. For practical reasons, a plaintiff who faces the defense of comparative negligence may wish to join all potentially culpable defendants in his action since the plaintiff's negligence will be balanced against the combined negligence of all defendants in apportioning damages even if the plaintiff may not be able actually to get compensation from some of them: for example, if an insolvent individual and a major corporation were both negligent in causing plaintiff's harm.

'''Contamination''' is the presence of an unwanted constituent, contaminant or [[impurity]] in a material, [[physical body]], [[natural environment]], [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], etc.
Contaminants are biological, chemical, physical or radiological substance.

==Sciences==
"Contamination" has also more specific meanings in science:
*In [[chemistry]], the term usually describes a single constituent, but in specialized fields the term can also mean chemical mixtures, even up to the level of cellular materials. All chemicals contain some level of [[impurity]]. Contamination may be recognized or not and may become an issue if the impure chemical is mixed with other chemicals or mixtures and causes additional [[chemical reaction]]s. The additional chemical reactions can sometimes be beneficial, in which case the label ‘contaminant’ is replaced with [[reactant]] or [[catalyst]]. If the additional reactions are detrimental, other terms are often applied such as [[toxin]], [[poison]] or [[pollutant]], depending on the type of [[molecule]] involved. A major fraction of chemistry is involved with identifying, isolating, and studying contaminants.
*In [[environmental chemistry]] the term is in some cases virtually equivalent to [[pollution]], where the main interest is the harm done on a large scale to humans or to organisms or environments that are important to humans.
*In [[radiation protection]] the [[radioactive contamination]] is radioactive substances on surfaces, or within solids, liquids or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable, or the process giving rise to their presence in such places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=IAEA Safety Glossary: Terminology Used in Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn=92-0-100707-8 |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1290_web.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Programmes and Systems for Source and Environmental Radiation Monitoring.

: Also used less formally to refer to a quantity, namely the amount of [[radioactive decay#Radioactive decay rates|radioactivity]] in a location or on a surface, or on a unit area of a surface, such as a square meter or centimeter. 
:Contamination may include residual [[radioactive material]] remaining at a site after the completion of [[nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] of a site where there was a [[nuclear reactor]], such as a [[power plant]], [[experimental reactor]], [[isotope reactor]] or a [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear powered ship]] or [[nuclear submarine|submarine]].
:The term [[radioactive contamination]] may have a connotation that is not intended. The term refers only to the presence of [[radioactivity]], and gives no indication of the magnitude of the hazard involved.
*In [[organic agriculture]] contamination with [[genetically modified organisms]] (GMOs) has been a cause for decertification of a farm.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2014) [http://orgprints.org/26549/7/26549.pdf  Organic versus GMO farming: Contamination, what contamination?]. Journal of Organic Systems, 9 (1), pp. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Western Australia]] a Parliamentary Inquiry was set up in December 2017 to examine mechanisms for compensating farmers where there has been contamination by [[genetically modified organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37501069/Compensation_for_GMO_contamination  Compensation for GMO contamination]. International Sustainable Development Research Society (ISDRS) Newsletter, Issue 3: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[food chemistry]] and [[medicinal chemistry]], the term "contamination" is used to describe harmful intrusions, such as the presence of [[toxin]]s or [[pathogen]]s in [[food]] or [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, see [[food contaminant]].
*In [[forensic science]], a contaminant can be [[fingerprint]]s, [[hair]], [[human skin|skin]] or [[DNA]] from [[first responder]]s or from sources not related to the ongoing investigation, such as family members or friends of the victim who are not suspects. 
*In the [[biology|biological sciences]], accidental introduction of "foreign" material ('contamination') can seriously distort the results of experiments where small samples are used. In cases where the contaminant is a living [[microorganism]], it can often multiply and take over the experiment, especially cultures, and render them useless.
*In [[geology]] and especially [[geochemistry]], it can have similar effects where even a few grains of "modern" dust can distort results of sophisticated experiments.
*the term "contamination" is sometimes used to describe accidental transfers of organisms from one natural environment to another.
*it has even been used in the "directed [[panspermia]]" hypothesis about the origin of life on Earth, which suggests that visiting aliens accidentally infected the planet with [[microbe]]s from their own world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''''Craposyncrasies''''' or '''''Doozakhrafat''''' is a book by Sorush Pakzad of satirical pieces in [[Persian language|Persian]], which were posted on his personal blog before publication. The book includes 107 stories about gods, prophets, and angels and was published in February 2012 by [[H&amp;S Media]]. The publisher included the book among its top-sellers in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article/-2618581558.html "H&amp;S Media's best sellers" (in Persian), March 03, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Pakzad’s critical approach towards the religious beliefs in the contemporary practices of [[Islam]] caught the attention of many critics. In his foreword to the book, [[Ebrahim Nabavi]], one of the leading Iranian satirists, contends “I have never seen or heard of a book like Doozakhrafat… it is unique, pleasant, and deep.” In an article published in [[openDemocracy]], Nabavi describes Doozakhrafat as "a unique magnum opus" for its "elegance, charm, and wonder" and praises the author as someone "who knows his job, has read much, is well-informed, and has studied theology and philosophy before fooling around with God." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.opendemocracy.net/ebrahim-nabavi/why-so-serious-on-doozakhrafat "Why so serious? on ‘Doozakhrafat’", Ebrahim Nabavi, openDemocracy, November 7, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nabavi encourages his readers to read the book before they die: “I have read many metaphysical and religious texts and I know the literature quite well. I have even tried to write along the path myself. But what Sorush Pakzad has done is way deeper… It has been a while since I have felt so inspired by reading a book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/archive/2012/may/02/article/-8d0e65bd2f.html "Sorush Pakzad's Doozakhrafat" (in Persian), Ebrahim Nabavi, Roozonline, May 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Nabavi has described Sorush Pakzad as "an unparalleled talent in satire. His book, 'Doozakhrafat,' is full of original jokes with the universe, God, humans, the creation, heaven, and hell. This genre of satire [in Persian literature] has often lacked elegance and grace.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/Ebrahim.Nabavi.Page/posts/895683890443496 "Interview" (in Persian), Ebrahim Nabavi, Facebook, October 19, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In an article published by [[Il Libraio]], Doozakhrafat has been praised for its success in introducing a creative level of religious satire, without showing hostility in its language&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illibraio.it/satira-religiosa-persia-211603/ "Com’è cambiata la satira religiosa in Iran?", Redazione Il Libraio, Il Libraio, April 23, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;.

[[Mahmud Farjami]], author, journalist, and researcher on Iranian comedy calls ''Doozakhrafat'' “an indisputable masterpiece in Persian parody.” Pakzad, Farjami believes, “is not only familiar with religious texts, fictions, and symbolism, but usually draws a parallel style to develop his story… It is difficult to find another book that contains so many original subjects that have been polished so masterfully.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debsh.com/1391/03/14/2805/ "Book Review" (in Persian), Mahmud Farjami, Rain in an open mouth, June 3, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101035421/http://www.debsh.com/1391/03/14/2805/ |date=November 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://tehranreview.net/articles/13868 "A book review: On Doozakhrafat, on a Fine Parody!", Mahmud Farjami, TehranReview, April 19, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Yaser Mirdamadi]], an Iranian scholar of analytic philosophy of religion and epistemology of Islam, in his interview about freedom of expression in ridiculing religion refers to ''Doozakhrafat'' as a book that satirizes religious beliefs without humiliation and insult:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“[The book] is a successful example of critical religious comedy that, although radical, is not humiliating or offensive. The critical aspect forces you to think while the comic aspect puts a smile on your face. The basis of all satirical pieces on religion in this book is to creatively emphasize this fact that the realm of gods, as depicted in religious practices, is humanly and affected by anthropomorphic perceptions of the divine… One might argue that this approach although morally justifiable, is religiously wrong. It seems that Sorush Pakzad’s critical satire is not only morally inoffensive but also insightful from a religious point of view.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://bamdadkhabar.com/2012/10/18098/ "The Right to Humor" (in Persian), Yaser Mirdamadi, Bamdad Khabar, October 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roya Sadr]], Iran’s leading female satirist and researcher on [[Persian satire]], in her review of the book, points out some of its literary qualities: “The forms are diverse, unbelievably diverse. The parodies are masterful; moreover, their innovative approach makes them more enjoyable. The writing is minimalistic and does not bore the reader with unnecessary information. Every detail is professionally and artistically designed in its correct position. Even the subtitles are obsessively and thoughtfully picked. Most of the stories enjoy a precise tone, a theatrical atmosphere, believable dialogues, and a surprise element.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/culture/doozakhrafat-a-unique-satirical-voice-in-persian-literature_31084 "Doozakhrafat: a unique satirical voice in Persian literature" , Roya Sadr, Your Middle East, April 1, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;"

“The form and language of the book,” she concludes, “confirms that the author knows what he is doing and has a well crafted view on the topic… All these qualities mixed with the author’s thorough knowledge of the wide range of subjects touched in the book make ''Doozakhrafat'' a rich and insightful piece.”

Using ''Doozakhrafat'' to open a discussion on the little touched topic of the relationship between satire and religion in Iran, Roya Sadr argues, “[the book] aims to challenge the masses’ superstitious perception of the divine in order to… show how anthropomorphic the images of God and the divine is in religious practices… Doozakhrafat enjoys a strong, deep, and penetrating perspective. I do not know the author, but Sorush Pakzad shows from this book that he is a unique and unmatched satirist [among his Persian peers].”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbgoal.com/archives/000587.php "Thoughts on a book: Doozakhrafat" (in Persian), Roya Sadr, BBGoal, October 29, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Facebook post, [[Mehdi Khalaji]], a scholar of [[Islamic studies]], admires ''Doozakhrafat''’s “powerful humor.” “I started reading the book this evening,” writes Khalaji, “it’s a powerful satirical work that applies humor to religious material. Returning the jokes that God plays on us, the book makes fun of God and his kingdom. Well, what goes around comes around!”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/mehdi.khalaji1/posts/414256645372921 " Facebook Post," Mehdi Khalaji, December 21, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The '''discourse of power''' is used when it comes to differentiating the levels of [[Power (social and political)|power]] due to cultural and social characteristics that come about through societal upbringing. The ways we think and talk about a subject influence and reflect the ways we act in relation to that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karlburg|first1=Michael|title=The Power of Discourse and the Discourse of Power: Pursuing Peace Through Discourse Intervention|url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol10_1/Karlberg_101IJPS.pdf|website=International Journal of Peace Studies|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of the discourse of power within media has a domino effect and it can play a huge role in determining the patterns of access to the mass media: who has preferential access to journalists, who will be interviewed, who will be quoted and described in news reports, and whose opinions will influence the public? Through access to the mass media, dominant groups also may have access to and partial control over the public at large.&lt;ref name="Discourse Power and Access"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Dijk|first1=Teun|title=Discourse Power and Access|url=http://www.discourses.org/OldArticles/Discourse,%20power%20and%20access.pdf|website=discourse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of mass media and power in the United States ==
{{See also|Media of the United States}}

Those with power and influence know that media control or influence is crucial. A free press is crucial for a functioning democracy, but if not truly free, paves the way for manipulation and concentration of views, thus undermining democracy itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shah|first1=Anup|title=Media in the United States|url=http://www.globalissues.org/article/163/media-in-the-united-states|website=Global Issues|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Amendment to the U.S Constitution, which provides that "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press," has given the media an exceptionally strong basis for resisting government controls in the United States. A limited number of controls, such as regulatory laws, court decisions, and informational social pressures guard against excess by the media. In the United States courts have been loath to impose restraints prior to publication, such as granting injunctions that would stop publication of information on the grounds that it would cause irreparable harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graber|first1=Doris|last2=Dunaway|first2=Johanna|title=Mass media and American politics|date=2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452287287|edition=9th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major mass media conglomerates in the United States===
*[[Walt Disney Company]]
*[[News Corporation]]
*[[Time Warner]]
*[[CBS Corporation]]
*[[Viacom]]
*[[General Electric]]

These media conglomerates control 90% of the traditional media that is present in our daily lives, media has never been more consolidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lutz|first1=Ashley|title=These 6 Corporations Control 90% of the Media in America|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6|website=Business Insider|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power of media versus reality==
The shaping of ones reality or perception is based on three elements including experienced reality, symbolic reality, and socially constructed reality. Much of the symbolic reality is based on media practices that we are exposed to daily. Individuals make assumptions on the world based on what their media tells them. The media is a [[hegemony|hegemonic]] form of power that maintains their position, not through force, but through elaboration of a particular world view, an ideology, or a particular notion of common sense, which is widely infused into everyday cultural practices. This results in people consenting to power even when it may not be in their best interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bybee|first1=Carl|title=Mass Media and Society|url=http://journalism.uoregon.edu/~cbybee/j201/overheads/hegemony_def.htm|website=University of Oregon - Journalism Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of media hegemony is that the ideas of the ruling class become ruling ideas in society, because of this the mass media are controlled by the dominant class in society which uses it as a vehicle for exerting control over the rest of society.&lt;ref name="Discourse Power and Access"/&gt;

=== Socially constructed reality ===
[[Social constructionism|Social construct]] examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world. It assumes that understanding, significance, and meaning are developed not separately within the individual, but in coordination among other human beings. To say something that it is socially constructed is to emphasize its dependence on contingent aspects of an individuals social selves. It can say this thing could not have existed had we not built it. Had someone been brought up in a different kind of society, had different needs, values, or interests, an individual might have built a different kind of thing, or built this social construct differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boghossian|first1=Paul|title=What is Social Construction?|url=http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1153/socialconstruction.pdf|website=New York University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to be aware that the values we hold, the beliefs we harbor and the decisions we make are based on our assumptions, our experiences, our education and what we know for a fact. Social construct allows us rely on mass media for the current news and facts about what is important and what we should be aware of.  We trust the media as an authority for news, information, education and entertainment. Considering that powerful influence, then, we should know how it really works. The degree of influence depends on the availability and pervasiveness of media.  Traditional mass media still has a great influence within society today. Books once were supremely influential because they came first before newspapers, magazines, radio or television. Newspapers and magazines became large influencers after they were developed. Sound recordings and film were and still are influential. Radio and then television were very influential. As the 20th century closed, TV exposed us to a number of new examples advertising and marketing, suffering and relief, sexuality and violence, celebrity entertainment, and much more. New and influential media-distribution channels have appeared in the 21st century. We are currently being influenced through the internet by daily by blogs, popular culture websites and various social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=A|title=Mass Media Influence on Society|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Media&amp;Society/MassMediaInfluenceOnSociety.html|website=University of North Carolina Pembroke|accessdate=27 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215065257/http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Media%26Society/MassMediaInfluenceOnSociety.html|archivedate=15 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experienced reality===
Experienced reality is that reality that comes to us via the senses and also via insight or intuition. It underlies all of our cognitive efforts. Because direct experience is largely sensory, automatic and constant, we pay less attention to it than the reality we have to work at to construct. It is somewhat of an illusion that effort equates to importance in our culture.&lt;ref name="Guide to Reality"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim|title=A beginner's guide to reality : [exploring our everyday adventures in wonderland]|date=2006|publisher=Pegasus books|location=New York|isbn=9781933648040|edition=1st Pegasus Books}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Events or experiences spark change in an individual. Through societal influence we are becoming a generation that needs to see to believe, and experienced reality is what initiates this idea. Power through this idea of experienced reality is relayed through the ideologies of the major media conglomerates and the way that they have created such a large cultural bias towards what we have experienced.

===Symbolic reality===
Symbols exist everywhere for an individual. Symbols are the intermediary between the world internal and the world external, between inner and external reality of human being as a person. The appeal to symbolic reality allows us to overcome [[personal boundaries]] including power struggles. Symbolic reality exists in and through person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ekaterina|first1=Dr. Dvoretskaya|title=Personal approach to Symbolic reality|url=http://www.crvp.org/seminar/05-seminar/Ekaterina.htm|website=Council for Research in Values and Philosophy|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols are objects, characters, or other representations of ideas, concepts, or abstractions; they are the universal language in a culture. Symbols have been used for thousands of years, they help individuals communicate and interact with one another. Thus, as a representation, their meaning is neither instinctive nor automatic. The culture’s members must interpret, and over time reinterpret, Symbols convey meaning and occur in different forms, such as: verbal or nonverbal, written or unwritten, words on the page, drawings, pictures, gesture. They are things which act as triggers to remind people, in the culture, of its rules, beliefs… Symbols can also be used to indicate status within a culture. Every society has evolved a system of symbols that reflects a specific cultural logic; and every symbolism functions to communicate information between members in much the same way as, but more subtly than, conventional language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Power of Symbols|url=http://bizshifts-trends.com/2012/01/23/power-of-symbols-symbolisms-and-brand-in-developing-global-markets-anthropology-of-business-marketing-leadership/|website=Business Shifts and Trends|accessdate=5 May 2015|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the level of power, media conglomerates have been using symbolic reality to relay their messages for years.

[[File:Fairtrade Certification Mark.svg|thumb|[[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]]]

The '''Fairtrade certification''' initiative was created to form a new method for [[trade|economic trade]]. This method takes an ethical standpoint, and considers the [[Producer (agriculture)|producers]] first.

Several attempts to market fair trade products were observed in the 1960s and 1970s, fair trade sales became widespread with the Max Havelaar labeling initiative in 1988 and the establishment of Fairtrade International in 1997. Fairtrade sales prior to labeling initiatives were contained to relatively small world shops (also called charity shops), operated by alternative trading organizations (ATOs) such as Oxfam and Traidcraft.

At the initiative of Mexican coffee farmers, the first fair trade labeling initiative, Stichting Max Havelaar, was launched in the Netherlands on November 15, 1988, by Nico Roozen, Frans van der Hoff, and Dutch ecumenical development agency Solidaridad. In 1992, the organization was founded by Michael Gidney. The initiative offered coffee producers following various social and environmental standards an above market price for their crop. The coffee, originating from the UCIRI cooperative in Mexico, was imported by Dutch company Van Weely, roasted by Neuteboom, sold directly to shops and, for the first time, to mainstream retailers across the Netherlands.

The initiative was groundbreaking as for the first time Fairtrade coffee was being offered to a larger consumer segment. Fairtrade labeling certification provided some assurance that the products were really benefiting the farm workers at the end of the supply chain.

Fairtrade International started with the coffee industry, but now covers a range of products such as [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[fruit]], [[cotton]], [[flower]]s, [[tea]] and others. The established buyers of these products make up a [[niche market]], which makes marketing for Fairtrade a challenge.

As of 2016, 1,411 producer organizations in 73 developing countries were Fairtrade certified, representing over 1.66 million [[farmers]] and workers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monitoringreport2017.fairtrade.net/en/|title=Monitoring the Scope and Benefits of Fairtrade: Impact Report 2017 - Fairtrade Monitoring Report - 9th Edition|website=Fairtrade Monitoring Report - 9th Edition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The fair trade movement stemmed from an initiative established by the Dutch development agency, Solidaridad, and aimed to create more equality between coffee producers and roasters. The agency recognized that the producers were not being treated fairly, and strived to create a more ethical system to trade. 

The Max Havelaar seal, which was based on a fictional character, was established "to license existing roasters and retailers who complied with its fair trade criteria".The seal provided specific benefits for cooperatives of small coffee producers in Mexico, with the aim of balancing the production of crops to be exported, as well as crops for the local population. The four benefits in this early model of the fairtrade initiative were:

#  A guaranteed minimum price to protect producers from any potential falls in the global market.
#  An additional 10% of the market price for their investment in social and environmental projects.
#  A 60% advance to producers to reduce the pressure of selling their product "immediately after harvest when its price is lowest"
#  A commitment by roasters to eliminate any other parties within the supply chain, with the aim of dealing more directly with producers.
The initiative was a great financial success and was replicated in several other markets: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called "Max Havelaar" (in [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[France]]), "Transfair" (in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Italy]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Japan]]), or carrying a national name: "Fairtrade Mark" in the [[UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], "Rättvisemärkt" in [[Sweden]], and "Reilu kauppa" (Finnish) or "Rejäl handel" ([[Finland Swedish|Swedish]]) in [[Finland]].

Initially, while the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs co-operated product by product with equivalent standards and producer lists there was no contractual agreement to ensure global standards. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations&amp;nbsp;– or "LIs" (for "Labelling Initiatives")&amp;nbsp;– started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], now simply known as Fairtrade International (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade Standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In 2002, FLO launched a new [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]], effectively replacing most previous Max Havelaar and TransFair certification marks. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross-border trade and simplify export procedures for both producers and exporters.

Today, all but one labeling initiative have fully adopted the new mark. [[TransFair USA]] has apparently elected to continue with its own [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]] for the time being,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfairusa.org/content/resources/faq-advanced.php#bluegreen TransFair USA FAQ] - "TransFair USA, has elected to continue using its current label."&lt;/ref&gt; while the Canadian organization currently allows certified products to carry either mark, it is transitioning toward the sole use of the International Fairtrade Certification Mark.

In January 2004, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International was divided into two independent organizations: Fairtrade International (FLO), which sets Fairtrade Standards and provides producer business support, and FLO-CERT, which inspects and certifies producer organizations. The aim of the split was to ensure the impartiality, the independence of the certification process and compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 65 standards for product certification bodies.

At present, over 25 labelling initiatives and producer networks are members or associate members of Fairtrade International. There are now FAIRTRADE Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, [[tea]], [[rice]], [[banana]]s, [[mango]]es, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[fruit juice]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit|fresh fruit]], [[quinoa]], [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s, [[wine]] and [[Football (ball)|footballs]].

In 2009, fair trade coffee was sufficiently mainstream that [[Walmart]], the world's largest retailer began selling it, and pricing it about the same as regular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505144_162-51372457/what-to-buy-at-walmart/ What to Buy at Walmart] 2009; revised 2011; accessed 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairtrade and Fairmined dual certification for [[gold]] was launched across the United Kingdom on 14 February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/14/fairtrade-gold?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Fairtrade hallmark sets the gold standard|author=Kate Carter|date=14 February 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a joint scheme between [[The Fairtrade Foundation]] and [[The Association for Responsible Mining]].

==The global market==

The Solidaridad informed large audiences of the mistreatment of coffee producers and poor living conditions in developing countries. They worked with other associations as well as the mass media to spread the message and create an awareness of their fair trade initiative. Because of their efforts, in 1988 the first bag of Max Hevelaar sealed coffee from Mexico was delivered to Holland's Prince Claus, and was launched to be sold in supermarkets throughout Holland. By the 1990s every western European country had established their own national version of the Max Hevelaar initiative.

Between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s, multiple national initiatives following a fair trade system coexisted within Europe, the US, Canada, and Japan.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Nicholls, A., &amp; Opal, C. (2005). Fairtrade certification. In ''Fair trade: Market-driven ethical consumption'' (p. 128). London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, however, 17 national initiatives joined forces to create one international umbrella organisation called the Fair Trade Organization (FLO). FLO is based in Bonn, Germany, and has quickly become the largest organisation of its kind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; FLO also has branches and field workers in Africa, Central and South America and China.  The international fair trade label was introduced in 2002 to improve visibility for consumers. The Fairtrade producers did not like the way they were treated.

==Marketing fair trade==
A key part of the fair trade initiative is to inform consumers through innovative marketing. The marketing must create a value proposition for the initiative that encompasses the ethical side, as well as the quality of the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==How it works==
As an example: [[fair trade]] coffee packers in developed countries pay a fee to their country's Fairtrade organization for the right to use the brand and logo. Nearly the entire fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified Fairtrade cooperative, which pays certification and inspection fees. The importer is obliged to pay the exporter a base price which keeps the price from sinking below that level. It is sometimes higher than the going world price, but at times when coffee prices are high, it may be lower than the going price. There is an additional "producer premium" (20c/lb for coffee). For a few products, like coffee, there is also a minimum price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations|date=April 1, 2011|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf |page=4|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cooperatives or other Fairtrade certified firms incur additional costs including increased marketing costs, certification and inspection fees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/35.html|title=Fee System Small Producer Organization - Explanatory Document|year=2011|publisher=FLO-CERT Gmbh|accessdate= January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and costs of conforming to the specifications.

Any deficit after paying these costs means a lower price for farmers, while any surplus from the premium price must be spent on "social projects" for "common goals" organized by the exporting cooperative rather than being an extra payment for farmers.&lt;ref name="EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations|date=April 1, 2011|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf |accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

Retrieved January 3, 2013, from Fairtrade International: http://www.fairtrade.net/coffee.html.&lt;/ref&gt; These may include the building of classrooms, baseball pitches, or the establishment of women's groups.

Fairtrade farmers have to meet a large range of criteria on production: there are limits on using child labour, pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified products and so on.&lt;ref name="GTS_EN.pdf p11"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V. |date=April 2, 2012 |title=Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard |page=11 |url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |accessdate=January 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |archivedate=May 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairtrade standards==
[[File:FairtradeCertifiedCottonTShirt.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A T-shirt made from Fairtrade certified cotton]]

Fairtrade standards contain minimum requirements that all producer organizations must meet to become certified as well as progress requirements in which producers must demonstrate improvements over time. To become certified Fairtrade producers, the cooperatives and their member farmers must operate to certain standards laid down by Fairtrade International. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;FLO-CERT (2008). [http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en FLO-CERT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en |date=2009-09-18 }}. URL accessed on August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of Fairtrade standards, including standards for contract situations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade standard for Contract Production|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-09-25_CP_EN.pdf|date=September 25, 2012|accessdate=January 23, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510191206/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-09-25_CP_EN.pdf|archivedate=May 10, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for importers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|date=April 2, 2012|title=Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 15, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf|archivedate=May 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also for the different products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our standards|url=https://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/List_of_Fairtrade_Standards.pdf|website=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards for small farmers' organizations include requirements for [[democracy|democratic]] decision making, so that farmers may have a say in how the Fairtrade Premiums are invested. They also include requirements for capacity building and economic strengthening of the organization.&lt;ref name="SPO_EN.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.|date=July 11, 2011|title=Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards for hired labour situations specify that employees receive minimum wages and [[collective bargaining]]. The standards also specify that Fairtrade-certified [[plantation]]s should have no forced or [[child labour]] and that health and safety requirements are met. In a hired labour situation, Fairtrade standards require a "joint body" to be set up with representatives from both the management and the employees. This joint body decides on how Fairtrade Premiums will be spent to benefit [[plantation]] employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|date=December 29, 2011|title=Fairtrade standard for Hired Labour|url=
http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2011-12-29-HL_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards and procedures are approved by the Fairtrade International Standards Committee, an external committee comprising all FLO stakeholders (labeling initiatives, producers and traders) and external experts. Fairtrade standards are set by FLO in accordance to the requirements of the ISEAL Code of Good Practice in standard setting and are in addition the result of a consultation process, involving a variety of stakeholders: producers, traders, external experts, inspectors, and certification staff.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (2006). [http://www.fairtrade.net/standard_setting.html Standard Setting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925031518/http://www.fairtrade.net/standard_setting.html |date=2006-09-25 }}. Accessed October 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairtrade pricing==

The main aspects of the Fairtrade system are the Minimum Price and the Premium. These are paid to the exporting firm, usually a second tier cooperative, not to the farmer. They are not paid for everything produced by the cooperative members, but for that proportion of their output they are able to sell with the brand 'Fairtrade Certified', typically 17% of their turnover, rising to as much as 60% in a few cases.
* The '''Fairtrade Premium''' is an extra payment over the market price (e.g. an extra 20c/lb for coffee) which is paid to the exporting organization. The residual after extra costs incurred in producing and marketing Fairtrade have been met must be spent on "social projects"  for social and economic development in the producing communities, rather than being given to farmers as extra payment.&lt;ref name="EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPO_EN.pdf p28"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.|date=July 11, 2011|title=Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 3, 2013|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers themselves decide how these funds are to be spent. They are generally used for improvements in [[health]], [[education]] or other social facilities, although it may also be used for certain development projects to enable farmers to improve productivity or reduce their reliance on single commodities. Fairtrade producer organizations are required to be able to show what happened to the money, and FLO-CERT should check whether they have such a system in place. 
* The '''Fairtrade Minimum Price''' is a guaranteed price to be paid for a few products like coffee when the world prices collapse. Again, it would usually be spent on "social projects" rather than going to the farmers.

==Fairtrade inspection and certification==

Fairtrade inspection and certification are carried out by [[FLO-CERT]], an independent, for-profit body created by Fairtrade International. FLO-CERT certifies that both producers and traders have met with Fairtrade standards.FLO-CERT inspections and certification follow the international ISO standards for product certification bodies (ISO 65).&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net"&gt;[http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/35.html FLO-CERT Gmbh, (2011) Fee System Small Producer Organization - Explanatory Document. www.flo-cert.net, Retrieved January 3, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

FLO-CERT works with a network of around 100 independent inspectors that regularly visit producer and trade organizations and report back to FLO-CERT. All certification decisions are then taken by a Certification Committee, composed of stakeholders from producers, traders, national labelling organisations and external experts. An Appeals Committee handles all appeals.

In 2006, a ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist found that ten out of the ten mills they visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported that they were "also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received Fairtrade certification despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weitzman|first1=Hal|title=The bitter cost of ‘fair trade’ coffee|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d191adbc-3f4d-11db-a37c-0000779e2340|accessdate=18 January 2018|work=An emerging criticism of Fairtrade within the industry is that the organisation misleads consumers about its ability to monitor production practices. FLO Cert, a body officially independent of FLO, monitors the certification process. Critics say there is a need for an outside auditor. “The way Fairtrade promotes itself is a little irresponsible,” says Mr Watts. “The certifiers need an external watchdog.”|agency=Financial Times|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd.|date=9 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification costs and returns==

Certified organizations such as cooperatives have to pay FLO-CERT a fee to become certified and a further annual fee for audit and continued certification&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net" /&gt; The first year certification fee per unit sold as "Fairtrade certified"  varies but has been over 6c/lb with an annual fee of 3c/lb to 3.4c/lb for coffee up to 2006 in some countries, at a time when the "Fairtrade premium" was 5c to 10c/lb.&lt;ref&gt;de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010). Fair Trade and Free Entry:The Dissipation of Producer Benefits in a Disequilibrium Market. Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade farmers also have to meet a large range of criteria on production: there are limits on using child labour, pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified products and so on.&lt;ref name="GTS_EN.pdf p11" /&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

The '''Fourth Way enneagram''' is a figure published in 1949 in ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]'' by [[P.D. Ouspensky]], and an integral part of the [[Fourth Way]] esoteric system associated with [[George Gurdjieff]]. The term "[[enneagram (shape)|enneagram]]" derives from two Greek words, ''ennea'' (nine) and ''gramma'' (something written or drawn).

[[File:Enneagram as an octave.svg|thumb|400px|right|Enneagram with point numbers and octave designations for octave beginning at point 9. Points 3 and 6 show "shock points" at which a new Do may enter and develop alongside the existing octave.]]

The enneagram is a nine-pointed figure usually inscribed within a circle.  Within the circle is a triangle connecting points 9, 3 and 6. The inscribed figure resembling a web connects the other six points in a cyclic figure 1-4-2-8-5-7. This number is derived from or corresponds to the recurring decimal .[[142857 (number)|142857]] = 1/7. These six points together with the point numbered 9 are said to represent the main stages of any complete process, and can be related to the notes of a musical [[octave]], 9 being equivalent to "Doh" and 1 to "Re" etc. The points numbered 3 and 6 are said to represent "shock points" which affect the way a process develops. The internal lines between the points; that is, the three-point figure and the six-point figure, are said to show certain non-obvious connections, although here very little elucidation is offered.

==Origins==
As reported by [[P. D. Ouspensky]] the enneagram was introduced by [[George Gurdjieff]] to his study groups in [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Moscow]] in 1916. Ouspensky records this original explication in his book of Gurdjieff's teaching [[In Search of the Miraculous]] where the enneagram  appears as Figure 44 and in further diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching, 1949, (reprinted 1977), PD Ouspensky, Routledge and Keegan Paul Ltd, London, pp. 285-295, 376-8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented as an ancient secret being released for the first time, the truth behind for example the [[philosopher's stone]]. Ouspensky quotes Gurdjieff as saying; "The knowledge of the enneagram has for a very long time been preserved in secret and if it now is, so to speak, made available to all, it is only in an incomplete and theoretical form without instruction from a man who knows". Gurdjieff also remarked "In order to understand the enneagram it must be thought of as in motion, as moving. A motionless enneagram is a dead symbol, the living symbol is in motion"

Although no earlier record of the Fourth Way version of the enneagram can be cited, it has been proposed that it may derive from, or be cognate to the reversed Kabbalistic [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]] as used in “Etude sur les origines de la nature du Zohar”, by S. Karppe, Paris, 1901, pp. 387, the Great Magical Arcanum of [[Eliphas Levi]] which is also composed of a circle triangle and hexad, the Magical Acanum of [[Helena Blavatsky]] in ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877), and [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[nine-point circle]].

== Background of the enneagram in Gurdjieff's cosmology ==

The enneagram according to Gurdjieff shows the "Law of Seven" and the "Law of Three" united and so some explanation of these laws is necessary here.

The Law of Seven or law of octaves, according to which phenomena evolves in seven steps; and the Law of Three, according to which phenomena are produced by three forces, are presented by Gurdjieff as global laws appearing on all scales and essential to his [[cosmology]]. This cosmology offers a view of how the world operates said to derive from [[alchemy]] and more ancient sources, and to complement or complete modern experimental science rather than to contradict it. According to this cosmology everything is material, including [[consciousness]] and [[spirit]], and all matter can be assigned a "density"; consciousness and spirit for example having lower "densities" (and therefore higher "vibrations") than,for example, [[water]] while, for example, [[Rock (geology)|rock]] has a higher "density" and lower "vibration" than water, and so on.

The [[diatonic scale]] in music is said to be an ancient application of the Law of Seven and a convenient way to study it.&lt;ref&gt;In Search of the Miraculous, page 124 Routledga and Keegan, 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; The major musical scale is used with short intervals at mi-fa and ti-do (Ouspensky refers to Ti as "Si" and So as "Sol" and the diagrams on this page reflect his usage). In other words if one thinks of a standard [[musical keyboard]] and takes for example middle C as Do then the following six white keys, DEFGAB will represent the rest of the octave, and the next white key will be the higher C. There will be black keys between each of the white keys, except between E and F (the mi-fa interval) and between B and the higher C (the si-do interval)

In any process described in terms of the Law of Seven, the Mi-Fa interval and the Ti-Do interval are said to be shock points where outside help is needed if the octave is to  continue to develop as intended. A failure to recognize this in terms of human projects is said to be a major reason why things go wrong in general.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page 126=129, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; The octave of [[electromagnetic radiation]] that appears as visible [[light]], and the [[periodic table]] are said to be examples of physical phenomena where the underlying Law of Seven can be detected (although no detail is offered here). It should be noted that the musical scale Gurdjieff is quoted as using &lt;ref&gt;In Search of the Miraculous Fig 11, page 125 Routledga and Keegan, 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; is not the modern standard musical scale but  [[Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale]], a [[just intonation]] scale associated with the Renaissance composer and musical theorist [[Gioseffo Zarlino]].

The Law of Three holds that three forces act on any event, which can be called  Active, Passive, and Neutralizing forces, or simply First, Second, and Third forces respectively. These three forces can appear in any order, 123 for example or 312, giving 6 possible "triads" of forces describing 6 very broad types of event. &lt;ref&gt; [[Ouspensky: A Further Record]] p174, accessed through web, http://holybooks.lichtenbergpress.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/A-Further-Record.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;[[Human|Humanity]] is said to be "third force blind", to have difficulty recognizing the third force, which may appear to us in the guise of a result or of a background environment."People cannot perceive the third force directly any more than they can spatially perceive the '[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]'" Gurdjieff is quoted as saying.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page 77, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the Law of Seven one of the three forces appears as the "do" of the octave and the other two appear as the "shocks" (which also function as the do of new octaves) The explanation of these laws in [[In Search of the Miraculous]] is largely in abstract terms, with some detail given for the so-called "food diagram" described below and the cosmic octave, the [[Ray of Creation]].

The enneagram shows the Law of Seven and the Law of Three in a single symbol with the three forces joined in a triangle at the 3,6 and 9 points, and in addition six inner lines (hexad) following the 1,4,2,8,5,7,1,... sequence. The meaning of these six inner lines is not, by Ouspensky's account, made clear by Gurdjieff. One shock point is shown on the enneagram at point 3, which is the Mi-Fa interval where it might be expected. However the other is at point 6, at the So-La interval. It might have been expected to be at the Ti-Do interval, and Gurdjieff is presented as offering this apparent mistake as a mystery to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page291, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; Ouspensky offers the solution that the shock at point 3 itself develops as an octave to point 6, where its own Mi-Fa interval occurs. This second octave cannot develop unless it has a shock at its own Mi-Fa, and this is the shock which in fact occurs at point 6.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page378, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; The example of the "food diagram" enneagram summarized below might clarify this.

==Application to processes: the food diagram==

As the enneagram figure is a symbol said to represent the "law of seven" and the "law of three" in unity, therefore, according to this view, the figure can be used to describe any natural whole phenomenon, cosmos, process in life or any other piece of knowledge. The figure is the central organizing glyph of the Fourth Way's view of the material world which Gurdjieff is quoted by Ouspensky as relating to [[alchemy]].

[[File:Enneagram evolution of food.svg|thumb|310px|right|Enneagram representing the evolution of food with "self remembering" at point 6]]

The most detailed example of how this is said to work, given in ''In Search of the Miraculous'', is an explanation of how Gurdjieff believed inputs to the human body ("food", "air" and "impressions", collectively regarded as types of food) are processed into the so-called "higher substances" necessary for higher consciousness to function. In Gurdjieff's view "everything is material"; consciousness and spirit are to be regarded as aspects of matter, although more refined or of a "higher vibration" than perceptible aspects. This proposition is an essential basis for Gurdjieff's view of the evolution of food into the "higher substances" necessary for higher consciousness; briefly summarized below from the account in ''In Search of the Miraculous''.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM figures 25-39, pages 182-192;figures 59 and 60, Routledge and Kegan Paul,1950&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Fourth Way]], a later collection of Ouspensky's talks, is a supplementary source for the same material.

At point 9 ordinary food (beginning as Do) is eaten and enters the body and digestion begins. The "density" of human food is assigned a number, 768.

At point 1 it is said to be processed in the gut  as Re and is refined to a "density" of 384 the same "density" as water.

At point 2 the food is further refined to  Mi and assigned a density of 192, the same density as air. It is ready to enter the blood stream.

At point 3, Mi-Fa, occurs a "shock". Air can provide this shock because it also is of density 192, and furthermore this air enters as a new Do

At point 4 the original food octave is at "Fa" but  the new air octave is at Re. They are both in the bloodstream at "density" 96, the "density" of hormones and vitamins and rarefied gases and animal magnetism "and so on". At this point we reach the end of "what is regarded as matter by our physics and chemistry" &lt;ref&gt;ISOTM 1950 page 175&lt;/ref&gt; It should be remembered that Gurdjieff is here speaking in 1916.

The substances or energies at point 5  are assigned a "density" of 48 and used in thought. These are the So or "Sol" part of the original food octave and the Mi part of the air octave.

Point 6 being where "impressions", regarded as a type of food, are said to enter the body. "Impressions" are said to also have a "density" of 48, and can serve as a shock if they are intensified by some such means as the exercise of "self-remembering" taught by Gurdjieff, thus allowing the air and impressions octaves to proceed. Otherwise only the ordinary food octave, shown in black in the diagram, proceeds.

Point 7 represents emotional and other energies, of a "density" of 24. If "self-remembering" occurs this will be the Fa point for the air octave and the Re point for the impressions octave. Otherwise it will just be the La point for the original food octave.

At point 8, the "Si" or Ti at the end of the first "ordinary food" octave represents the sexual energies, of "density" 12; which are the "highest substance" according to Gurdjieff which the body produces naturally without conscious intervention. A desire to conserve this "higher substances" for esoteric use is said to be the original reason for religious celibacy. With the conscious intervention at point 6 of "self remembering" further and more useful "higher substances" are created, represented by the air octave's So or "Sol" at point 8 and the impression octave's Mi at point 8. This Mi of "density" 12 is the "higher substance" primarily necessary for Gurdjieff's esoteric method.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM 1950, page 193&lt;/ref&gt;(Ouspensky makes some further remarks on the nature of this Mi 12 and Sol 12 in his book ''[[Fourth Way (book)|Fourth Way]]''.) A further conscious shock, requiring "a special type of control over the emotions" at point 9 would enable a new "higher" or spiritual body to begin to grow, this is represented by Gurdjieff as the aim of his and other esoteric traditions. Although not shown in the diagram on this page, the Air octave, if it has a shock at Point 6 in fact may proceed to La with a "density" of 6.

Ouspensky related the inner six-line figure  of the Food Diagram enneagram to the circulation of the blood. Point 1, he wrote, represented the digestive system, point 2 the blood stream, point 4 the breathing system, point 5 the brain, point 7 the spinal cord and point 8 the sympathetic nervous system and sex organs, and the lines "showed the direction of the flow or distribution of arterial blood in the organism and then its return in the form of venous blood" &lt;ref&gt;ISOTM 1950, page 378&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other applications to processes==
Other applications of the enneagram to describing processes can be found in writings influenced by those of Gurdjieff,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[A.G.E. Blake]]'s ''The Intelligent Enneagram'' (Shambhala, 1995), an excerpt from this book plus other material and references on the enneagram of process can be found on Blake's [http://www.duversity.org/ideas/enneagram.html "Duversity" site ], accessed 25 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; notably in the writings of [[J.G. Bennett]]. In his book ''Gurdjieff: Making a New World''&lt;ref&gt;''Gurdjieff: Making a New World'', Spiritual Classics Edition 1992, Appendix on the enneagram&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett describes the workings of a community kitchen in terms of the enneagram and offers some explanation of the meaning of the internal lines. Another of his books, ''Enneagram Studies'',&lt;ref&gt;''Enneagram Studies''. York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; is devoted to the subject, offering nine examples of enneagrams in various applications. [[Rodney Collin]] in his book ''The Theory of Celestial Influence'' relates the enneagram to the planets of the solar system, and the yearly cycle, and also offers some explanation of the inner lines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Theory-of-Celestial-Influence.pdf pages 108 and 190, Figures 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications to human typology==

The [[Enneagram of Personality]] originates from the mapping of nine "ego fixations" on the enneagram by [[Oscar Ichazo]]. A book published in 2017, "The Enneagram: Living and Dead" by Plavan N. Go, attempts to verify it from the viewpoint of Gurdjieff's theories, showing the relevance of the nine personality types and their mapping on the enneagram based on the interpretation of the enneagram according to the Law of Three, the logic of three into four (O+C+N &gt; H), and the Law of Seven.&lt;ref&gt;http://gurdjieff.la.coocan.jp/literature/The_Enneagram_ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hasmonean royal winter palaces''' are a complex of Hasmonean and Herodian buildings from the [[Second Temple]] period, which were discovered in the western plain of [[Jericho]] valley, at '''Tulul Abu al-'Alayiq''', near the place where the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] road connecting Jericho with [[Jerusalem]] enters [[Wadi Qelt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/Jericho%20-%20The%20Winter%20Palace%20of%20King%20Herod Jericho - The Winter Palace of King Herod]&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Tell (archaeology)|tells]] are located on either side of Wadi Qelt.

The [[palaces]] are evidence of the luxurious lifestyle of the [[Hasmonean]] dynasty and of [[Herod the Great]]. They made extensive use of [[swimming pools]], [[Public bathing|bathhouses]], ornamental gardens and orchards. The palaces were not far from Jerusalem – 20&amp;nbsp;km along the ancient [[Roman roads|Roman road]].

== History of excavations ==
[[File:Roman_aqueduct_near_Jericho,_Eretz_Israel,_edited.jpg|thumb|Roman aqueduct near Jericho]]
The site was excavated in the 19th century by [[Charles Warren]], who attempted to locate the place of Biblical Jericho. After making an archaeological trench, he concluded that this site is from the Roman period. Additional excavations were conducted by the Germans [[Ernst Sellin]] and [[Carl Watzinger]], in 1910–1911, but the results have never been published. In 1950, two expeditions from the United States dug on the site. An ornamental garden with magnificent remains from the time of Herod was discovered north of the southern tell, and labeled "the sunken garden."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=hXHDCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=hasmonean+winter+palaces&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W82weO1Whh&amp;sig=lxvb4HwcvT117MeRYlISIuIyg0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1zLS-uNrSAhUBBsAKHfBUAJA4ChDoAQgaMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=hasmonean%20winter%20palaces&amp;f=true Herod's Judaea: A Mediterranean State in the Classic World, Samuel Rocca]&lt;/ref&gt; Farther north were discovered the remains of a building, identified as a gymnasium.

After the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, extensive excavations were conducted on site by [[archaeologist]] [[Ehud Netzer]]. The excavations continued for ten seasons and covered an area of 30 hectares. The excavations also revealed remains of [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] to the west of Jericho. At the oasis of Jericho, Netzer uncovered new wings of Herod's winter palace, as well as a Hasmonean ([[Maccabean]]) winter palace containing a number of swimming pools and gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.huji.ac.il/exhibitions/exhibit_Hasmonean.asp The Hasmonean Winter Palaces in the Jericho Valley, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;  The complex includes the [[Jericho Synagogue]], built 70{{ndash}}50 BC and identified as one of the [[Oldest synagogues in the World|oldest synagogues]] ever found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Oldest Synagogue Found in Israel|date=29 March 1998|publisher=The Associated Press|url=http://www.pohick.org/sts/jericho.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site description ==
[[File:Jerycho60.jpg|thumb|Excavation site]]
Survey and excavations show that the site covers an area of 120 hectares, and is only part of Second Temple-period Jericho. A series of winter palaces were discovered, some which were shown to have been built by the [[Hasmonean]]s, and others by Herod the Great, who inherited the older estate and substantially expanded the palatial compound with new buildings. It turned out that the area of the city of Jericho was very broad. South of one of the palaces, in the area that today is the [[Aqabat Jaber]] refugee camp, remains  of luxurious houses were discovered, scattered over dozens of acres. A royal farm was discovered north of the palaces, covering an area of 450 dunams. A close connection was found between the farm and the winter palaces.

Aqueducts, which were built during the Hasmonean period, enabled the construction of the winter palaces and the farm. Two aqueducts brought water to the site from the following springs that flow year-round:

* Wadi Qelt: Ein Perat, Ein Mabua, Ein Qelt.
* Nahal Na'aran: Ein Noema, Ein Diuk, Ein Shusha.

== Hasmonean palace ==
The Hasmonean winter palace, at the northern part of the site, consisted of the following structures:
* The main building
* Swimming pool complex
* Southern division ("twin palaces")

The Hasmonean palace was built on a hill overlooking the city of Jericho. The palace was built by [[John Hyrcanus I]] (134-104 BCE) and believed to have been fortified during the reign of [[Alexander Jannaeus]] (103-76 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eshel |first=Hanan |title=The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Hasmonean State |page=75 |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=t05okj1LB3QC&amp;pg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong [[earthquake]] in 31 BCE destroyed the palace. Evidence to this was found in different parts of the complex. On its site King Herod built an artificial tell, or mound, on which he built his second palace. The establishment of the mound resulted in coverage of the Hasmonean palace, and thus parts of it were preserved, such as a building wall remaining 7 metres high.

The main structure of the Hasmonean palace was 50 by 50 metres. Elements of the building were as was customary for luxury palaces in the area:

* Rooms were decorated with colorful [[frescoes]], imitating marble.
* [[Stucco]] decorations in the form of building stones.
* An unroofed central courtyard.
* The water flowed into the swimming pools and buildings through clay and lead pipes, buried in the ground, and aqueducts supplied water to gardens and orchards.

Remains were found of two pairs of swimming pools: a small pair west of the palace, and a large pair north of it. It is speculated that the pools were the focus of entertainment and enjoyment of the inhabitants of the palace. Perhaps they are also the place where, according to historian [[Josephus]], [[Aristobulus III]] (53-36 BC), the last high priest from the Hasmonean dynasty, was drowned. South of the large pools was a luxurious 21 by 17 metres building, the so-called pavilion, built in the style of a [[Doric order|Doric]] temple. An axis of symmetry passed through the pools, the open courtyard, and the temple{{dubious|Pavilion? But then: north or south?|date=June 2018}} north of them.

The "twin palaces" were two surprisingly similar buildings. The hypothesis is that they were built by Queen [[Salome Alexandra|Shlomtzion]] (ruled 67–76 BCE) for her two sons, [[Hyrcanus II|Hyrcanus]] and [[Aristobulus II|Aristobulus]], in order to soften the rivalry between them that lasted nearly thirty years. The size of the palaces was 25 by 25 metres. Each of the two palaces contained a luxurious bathhouse.

Many ritual baths were found around the palace, required by their priestly owners, who had to be ritually purified before eating [[terumah]]. A ritual bath for vessels was also found, containing the remains of 800 bowls. The palace also served the last Hasmonean king, [[Antigonus II Mattathias|Antigonus Matityahu II]] (r. 40-37 BCE), as evidenced by a hoard of 20 coins.

== Herod's first palace ==
The first palace was situated on the southern bank of Wadi Qelt, on land leased from [[Cleopatra]], Queen of Egypt, who received it as a gift from [[Mark Antony]] in 36 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/israelexperience/history/pages/jericho%20-%20the%20winter%20palace%20of%20king%20herod.aspx Jericho- The Winter Palace of King Herod]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in the north, the Hasmonean palace was still standing. The palace was a rectangular building, 86 by 46 meters. In the center was an open courtyard with perimeter columns and a central pool draining the rainwater. In the palace were a magnificent hall, a luxurious bathhouse, and a pair of deep pools, which were apparently ritual baths.

The palace was exposed in 1951 by [[James B. Pritchard|Pritchard]], who thought it was a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]. After excavation of the palace, it was covered over with sand.

== Herod's second palace ==
The second palace was built in 31 BCE. Herod won the trust of Emperor [[Augustus]] and in return received the Jericho area he had previously lost to the by then defunct Queen Cleopatra. After the earthquake of 31 BCE Herod decided to build a second palace on the ruins of the Hasmonean palace. He combined the pools of the Hasmonean palace into one large pool, 32 by 18 meters. The second palace (north of Wadi Qelt), along with the first palace (south of Wadi Qelt), served Herod for residential and ceremonial purposes.

A unique feature of the second palace was its residential wing, which contained a designated recreation area. The villa was built on an artificial tell covering the Hasmonean palace: 35 by 43 meters tall,{{dubious|Nonsensical. Check source.|date=June 2018}} eight meters above the surroundings, providing a view of the estate's orchards and the surroundings. The second palace was full of gardens. In the pleasure wing were the big pool and a bathhouse, which has been well preserved.

== Herod's third palace ==
[[File:Jericho Herodian bath.JPG|thumb|250px|Bath from Herod's third palace]]

The third palace was the most magnificent of the palaces. It was established on both sides of Wadi Qelt. [[Ehud Netzer]], the editor of excavations at the site, believe that palace residents could see water flowing in the riverbed for up to two months a year, letting the viewers feel like they were on the edge of an actual river. The builders, who apparently were from [[Italy]], used construction methods that were common in their homeland such as:

* [[Opus reticulatum]] - small stones, 10&amp;nbsp;cm by 10&amp;nbsp;cm, placed in diagonal rows. In Jericho they were anointed with white or colored plaster.
* [[Opus Koodroas]] - rectangular stones.

Local [[mud bricks]] were also layered on top of stone construction. After being covered with plaster, there was no difference between them and the models from Italy.

The third palace of Herod, in the center of the site, included the following buildings:

* The north wing.
* Sunken garden.
* The southern mound.
* Big pool.

== Industrial area ==
The industrial area was next to residential buildings and service buildings.

== Royal estate ==
In the estate a huge wine-press was found, which was probably used for making wine and "date honey". Farm crops, according to literary sources, were: [[palm trees]], [[persimmon]] resin, and sap, which produced perfumes and medicines. Some of them were sent overseas. It was an intelligent use of the warm climate of the place.

'''Hat puzzles''' are [[logic problem]]s that date back to as early as 1961. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardin | first1 = Christopher | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Alan D. | year = 2008 | title = An introduction to Infinite Hat Problems | journal = Mathematical Intelligencer | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | url = http://www.math.union.edu/~hardinc/pub/introinf.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120405023010/http://www.math.union.edu/~hardinc/pub/introinf.pdf | archivedate = 2012-04-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such hat puzzles, frequently contextualized as '''prisoners and hats puzzles''', are [[induction puzzles]] (a kind of [[logic puzzle]]) that involve reasoning about the actions of other people, drawing in aspects of [[Game theory]] sometimes called the [[hierarchy of beliefs]]. There are many variations, but the central theme remains the same.

A number of players are each wearing a hat, which may be of various specified colours.  Players can see the colours of at least some other players' hats, but not that of their own.  With highly restricted communication or none, some of the players must guess the colour of their hat.  The problem is to find a strategy for the players to determine the colours of their hats based on the hats they see and what the other players do.  In some versions, they compete to be the first to guess correctly; in others, they can work out a strategy beforehand to cooperate and maximize the probability of correct guesses.&lt;ref name=B&amp;T&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Ezra | last2 = Tanton | first2 = James | date = April 2009 | title = A Dozen Hat Problems |journal = Math Horizons |pages= 22–25 | url = http://www.math.vt.edu/people/brown/doc/dozen_hats.pdf | accessdate = 2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One variation received some new publicity as a result of Todd Ebert's 1998 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] [[thesis]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Peter|title=Mathematical Puzzles: A Connoisseur's Collection|year=2004|publisher=A K Peters|pages=125–126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6qkdCHM7_EC&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=hat%20puzzle%20todd&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q=hat%20puzzle%20todd&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a strategy question about a [[cooperative game]], which has connections to [[algebraic coding theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/cecs/views/personnel/fulltime/ebert.shtml Biography of Todd Ebert at California State University, Long Beach]&lt;/ref&gt;

==A competitive version==
Three players are told that each of them will receive either a red hat or a blue hat.  They are to raise their hands if they see a red hat on another player as they stand in a circle facing each other.  The first to guess the colour of his or her hat correctly wins.

All three players raise their hands. After the players have seen each other for a few minutes without guessing, one player announces "Red", and wins.  How did the winner do it, and what is the color of everyone's hats?

First, if two people had blue hats, not everyone's hand would have been raised. Next, if player 1 had seen a blue hat on player 2 &amp; a red hat on player 3, then player 1 would have known immediately that his own hat must be red. Thus any player who sees a blue hat can guess at once. Finally, the winner realizes that since no one guesses at once, there must be no blue hats, so every hat must be red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gardner | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Gardner | year = 1978 | title = Aha! Insight | publisher = Scientific American | page = 102 | isbn = 0-89454-001-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EV2y4z95_KQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A cooperative version==
In the case where every player has to make a guess, but they are free to choose when to guess, there is a cooperative strategy that allows every player to guess correctly unless all the hats are the same colour.  Each player should act as follows:

# Count the numbers ''b'' of black hats and ''w'' of white hats that you see.
# Wait ''b'' seconds or ''w'' seconds, whichever is sooner.
# If nobody has yet spoken, guess that your hat is black if you can see fewer black hats than white hats, or white if you can see fewer white hats than black hats.
# If you have not yet spoken, guess that your hat is of the opposite colour to that of one of the first people to speak.

Suppose that in total there are ''B'' black hats and ''W'' white hats.  There are three cases.

If ''B'' = ''W'' then those players wearing black hats see ''B−1'' black hats and ''B'' white hats, so wait ''B''−1 seconds then correctly guess that they are wearing a black hat.  Similarly, those players wearing a white hat will wait ''W''−1 seconds before guessing correctly that they are wearing a white hat.  So all players make a correct guess at the same time.

If ''B'' &lt; ''W'' then those wearing a black hat will see ''B''−1 black hats and ''W'' white hats, whilst those wearing a white hat will see ''B'' black hats and ''W''−1 white hats.  Since ''B''−1 &lt; ''B'' ≤ ''W''−1, those players wearing a black hat will be the first to speak, guessing correctly that their hat is black.  The other players then guess correctly that their hat is white.

The case where ''W'' &lt; ''B'' is similar.

==Prisoners and hats puzzle==
According to the story, four [[prison]]ers are arrested for a [[crime]], but the jail is full and the jailer has nowhere to put them. He eventually comes up with the solution of giving them a puzzle so if they succeed they can go free but if they fail they are executed.

[https://xaben.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/4men.gif?e7d560]

The jailer seats three of the men into a line. B faces the wall, C faces B, and D faces C and B. The fourth man, A, is put behind a screen (or in a separate room). The jailer gives all four men party hats. He explains that there are two black hats and two white hats, that each prisoner is wearing one of the hats, and that each of the prisoners see only the hats in front of him but neither on himself nor behind him. The fourth man behind the screen can't see or be seen by any other prisoner. No communication among the prisoners is allowed.

If any prisoner can figure out what color hat he has on his own head with 100% certainty (without guessing) and tell the jailer, ''all four prisoners go free''. If any prisoner suggests an incorrect answer, all four prisoners are executed. The puzzle is to find how the prisoners can escape.

=== The solution ===

The prisoners know that there are only two hats of each color. So if D observes that B and C have hats of the same color, D would deduce that his own hat is the opposite color. However, if B and C have hats of different colors, then D can say nothing. The key is that prisoner C, after allowing an appropriate interval, and knowing what D would do, can deduce that if D says nothing the hats on B and C must be different; able to see B's hat, he can deduce his own hat color.

In common with many puzzles of this type, the solution relies upon the assumption that all participants are totally rational and intelligent enough to make the appropriate deductions.

After solving this puzzle, some insight into the nature of [[communication]] can be gained by pondering whether the meaningful silence of prisoner D violates the "No communication" rule (given that communication is usually defined as the "transfer of information").

===Four-Hat Variant===
In a variant of this puzzle, the prisoners know that there are 3 hats of one color and only 1 hat of another (e.g. 3 black and 1 white), and the 3 prisoners can see each other i.e. D sees B &amp; C, B sees D &amp; C, and C sees D &amp; B. (A again cannot be seen and is only there to wear the last hat.)

====The solution====
There are two cases: in the trivial case, one of the three prisoners wears the single off-color hat. Each of the other two prisoners can see that one prisoner is wearing the off-color hat.
In the non-trivial case, the three prisoners wear hats of the same color, while A wears the off-color hat.
After a while, all three prisoners should be able to deduce that, because neither of the others was able to state the color of his own hat, A must wear the off-color hat.

===Five-Hat Variant===
In another variant, only three prisoners and five hats (supposedly two black and three white) are involved. 
The three prisoners are ordered to stand in a straight line facing the front, with A in front and C at the back. They are told that there will be two black hats and three white hats. One hat is then put on each prisoner's head; each prisoner can only see the hats of the people in front of him and not on his own. The first prisoner that is able to announce the color of his hat correctly will be released. No communication between the prisoners is allowed.

====The solution====
Assume that A wears a black hat: 
*If B wears a black hat as well, C can immediately tell that he is wearing a white hat after looking at the two black hats in front of him.
*If B wears a white hat, C will be unable to tell the color of his hat (because there is a black and a white). So B can quickly deduce from A's black hat and C's lack of response that he (B) is wearing a white hat.
So if A wears a black hat there will be a fairly quick response from B or C.

Assume that A wears a white hat: 
*C does not see two black hats, so he is unable to tell his hat color.
*B sees only a white hat, so he can't tell anything about his hat.
In this case A, B and C would remain silent for some time, until A finally deduces that he must have a white hat because C and B have remained silent for some time.

As mentioned, there are three white hats and two black hats in total, and the three prisoners know this. In this riddle, you can assume that all three prisoners are very clever and very smart. If C could not guess the color of his own hat that is because he saw either two white hats or one of each color. If he saw two black hats, he could have deduced that he was wearing a white hat.

===Three-Hat Variant===
In this variant there are 3 prisoners and 3 hats. Each prisoner is assigned a random hat, either red or blue. In all, there are three red hats and two blue. Each person can see the hats of two others, but not their own. On a cue, they each have to guess their own hat color or pass. They win release if at least one person guessed correctly and none guessed incorrectly (passing is neither correct nor incorrect).

This puzzle doesn't have a 100% winning strategy, so the question is: What is the best strategy? Which strategy has the highest probability of winning?

If you think of colors of hats as bits, this problem has some important applications in [[coding theory]].

The solution and the discussion of this puzzle can be found [http://www.relisoft.com/science/hats.html here] (also a solution to the analogous 7-hat puzzle) and other 3 variants are available on this [http://brainden.com/logic-puzzles.htm Logic Puzzles] page (they are called Masters of Logic I-IV).

===Ten-Hat Variant===
In this variant there are 10 prisoners and 10 hats.  Each prisoner is assigned a random hat, either red or blue, but the number of each color hat is not known to the prisoners.  The prisoners will be lined up single file where each can see the hats in front of him but not behind.  Starting with the prisoner in the back of the line and moving forward, they must each, in turn, say only one word which must be "red" or "blue".  If the word matches their hat color they are released, if not, they are killed on the spot.  A sympathetic guard warns them of this test one hour beforehand and tells them that they can formulate a plan where by following the stated rules, 9 of the 10 prisoners will definitely survive, and 1 has a 50/50 chance of survival.  What is the plan to achieve the goal?

==== The solution====
The prisoners agree that if the first prisoner sees an odd number of red hats, he will say "red". This way, the nine other prisoners will know their own hat color after the prisoner behind them responds.

===Ten-Hat Variant without Hearing===
As before, there are 10 prisoners and 10 hats.  Each prisoner is assigned a random hat, either red or blue, but the number of each color hat is not known to the prisoners.  The prisoners are distributed in the room such that they can see the hats of the others but not their own.  Now, they must each, simultaneously, say only one word which must be "red" or "blue".  If the word matches their hat color they are released, and if enough prisoners resume their liberty they can rescue the others. A sympathetic guard warns them of this test one hour beforehand.  If they can formulate a plan following the stated rules, 5 of the 10 prisoners will definitely be released and be able to rescue the others.  What is the plan to achieve the goal?

====The solution====
The prisoners pair off. In a pair (A,B) of the prisoners A says the color he can see on the head of B, who says the opposite color he sees on the head of A. Then, if both wear hats with the same color, A is released (and B is not), if the colors are different, B is released (and A is not). In total, 5 prisoners answer correctly and 5 do not.  This assumes the pair can communicate who is A and who is B, which may not be allowed.

Alternatively, the prisoners build two groups of 5. One group assumes that the number of red hats is even, the other assumes that there is an odd number of red hats. Similar to the variant with hearing, they can deduce their hat color out of this assumption. Exactly one group will be right, so 5 prisoners answer correctly and 5 do not.

Note that the prisoners cannot find a strategy guaranteeing the release of more than 5 prisoners. Indeed, for a single prisoner, there are as many distributions of hat colors where he says the correct answer than there are where he does not. Hence, there are as many distributions of hat colors where 6 or more prisoners say the correct answer than there are where 4 or fewer do so.

===Countably Infinite-Hat Variant without Hearing===
In this variant, a [[countable|countably infinite]] number of prisoners, each with an unknown and randomly assigned red or blue hat line up single file line.  Each prisoner faces away from the beginning of the line, and each prisoner can see all the hats in front of him, and none of the hats behind.  Starting from the beginning of the line, each prisoner must correctly identify the color of his hat or he is killed on the spot.  As before, the prisoners have a chance to meet beforehand, but unlike before, once in line, no prisoner can hear what the other prisoners say.  The question is, is there a way to ensure that only finitely many prisoners are killed?

====The solution====
If one accepts the [[axiom of choice]], and assumes the prisoners each have the (unrealistic) ability to memorize an [[uncountable set|uncountably infinite]] amount of information and perform computations with uncountably infinite [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], the answer is yes. In fact, even if we allow an [[uncountable set|uncountable]] number of different colors for the hats and an uncountable number of prisoners, the axiom of choice provides a solution that guarantees that only finitely many prisoners must die provided that each prisoner can see the hats of every other prisoner (not just those ahead of them in a line), or at least that each prisoner can see all but finitely many of the other hats. The solution for the two color case is as follows, and the solution for the uncountably infinite color case is essentially the same:

The prisoners standing in line form a sequence of 0s and 1s, where 0 is taken to represent blue, and 1 is taken to represent red.  Before they are put into the line, the prisoners define the following [[equivalence relation]] over all possible sequences that they might be put into:  Two sequences are equivalent if they are identical after a finite number of entries.  From this equivalence relation, the prisoners get a collection of equivalence classes.  Assuming the axiom of choice, there exists a set of representative sequences—one from each equivalence class. ([[Almost everywhere|Almost every specific value]] is impossible to compute, but the axiom of choice implies that ''some'' set of values exists, so we assume that the prisoners have access to an [[Oracle machine|oracle]].)

When they are put into their line, each prisoner can see all but a finite number of hats, and can therefore see which equivalence class the ''actual'' sequence of hats belongs to. (This assumes that each prisoner can perform an ''uncountably infinite'' number of comparisons to find a match, with each class comparison requiring a ''countably infinite'' number of individual hat-comparisons).  They then proceed guessing their hat color as if they were in the ''representative'' sequence from the appropriate equivalence class.  Because the actual sequence and the representative sequence are in the same equivalence class, their entries are the same after some finite number ''N'' of prisoners.  All prisoners after these first ''N'' prisoners are saved.

Because the prisoners have no information about the color of their own hat and would make the same guess whichever color it has, each prisoner has a 50% chance of being killed. It may seem paradoxical that an infinite number of prisoners each have an even chance of being killed and yet it is certain that only a finite number are killed. However, there is no contradiction here, because this finite number can be arbitrarily large, and no probability can be assigned to any particular number being killed.

This is easiest to see for the case of zero prisoners being killed. This happens [[if and only if]] the actual sequence is one of the selected representative sequences. If the sequences of 0s and 1s are viewed as binary representations of a real number between 0 and 1, the representative sequences form a [[non-measurable set]]. (This set is similar to a [[Vitali set]], the only difference being that equivalence classes are formed with respect to numbers with finite binary representations rather than all rational numbers.) Hence no probability can be assigned to the event of zero prisoners being killed. The argument is similar for other finite numbers of prisoners being killed, corresponding to a finite number of variations of each representative.

===Countably Infinite Hat Problem with Hearing===
This variant is the same as the last one except that prisoners can hear the colors called out by other prisoners.  The question is, what is the optimal strategy for the prisoners such that the fewest of them die in the worst case?

====The solution====
It turns out that, if one allows the prisoners to hear the colors called out by the other prisoners, it is possible to guarantee the life of every prisoner except the first, who dies with a 50% probability.

To do this, we define the same equivalence relation as above and again select a representative sequence from each equivalence class.  Now, we label every sequence in each class with either a 0 or a 1.  First, we label the representative sequence with a 0.  Then, we label any sequence which differs from the representative sequence in an even number of places with a 0, and any sequence which differs from the representative sequence in an odd number of places with a 1.  In this manner, we have labeled every possible infinite sequence with a 0 or a 1 with the important property that any two sequences which differ by only one digit have opposite labels.

Now, when the warden asks the first person to say a color, or in our new interpretation, a 0 or a 1, he simply calls out the label of the sequence he sees.  Given this information, everyone after him can determine exactly what his own hat color is.  The second person sees all but the first digit of the sequence that the first person sees. Thus, as far as he knows, there are two possible sequences the first person could have been labeling: one starting with a 0, and one starting with a 1.  Because of our labeling scheme, these two sequences would receive opposite labels, so based on what the first person says, the second person can determine which of the two possible strings the first person saw, and thus he can determine his own hat color.  Similarly, every later person in the line knows every digit of the sequence except the one corresponding to his own hat color.  He knows those before him because they were called out, and those after him because he can see them.  With this information, he can use the label called out by the first person to determine his own hat color.  Thus, everyone except the first person always guesses correctly.

==Ebert's version and Hamming codes==
Ebert's version of the problem states that all players who guess must guess at the same predetermined time, but that not all players are required to guess.  Now not all players can guess correctly, so the players win if at least one player guesses and all of those who guess do so correctly.  How can the players maximise their chance of winning?

One strategy for solving this version of the hat problem employs [[Hamming code]]s, which are commonly used to detect and correct errors in [[data transmission]]. The probability for winning will be much higher than 50%, depending on the number of players in the puzzle configuration: for example, a winning probability of 87.5% for 7 players.

Similar strategies can be applied to team sizes of ''N'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;−1 and achieve a win rate (2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-1)/2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus the Hamming code strategy yields greater win rates for larger values of ''N''.

In this version of the problem, any individual guess has a 50% chance of being right. However, the Hamming code approach works by concentrating wrong guesses together onto certain distributions of hats.  For some cases, all the players will guess incorrectly; whereas for the other cases, only one player will guess, but correctly.  While half of all guesses are still incorrect, this results in the players winning more than 50% of the time.

A simple example of this type of solution with three players is instructive.  With three players, there are eight possibilities; in two of them all players have the same colour hat, and in the other six, two players have one colour and the other player has the other colour.

The players can guarantee that they win in the latter cases (75% of the time) with the following strategy:
# Any player who observes two hats of two different colours remains silent.
# Any player who observes two hats of the same colour guesses the opposite colour.

In the two cases when all three players have the same hat colour, they will all guess incorrectly.  But in the other six cases, only one player will guess, and correctly, that his hat is the opposite of his fellow players'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Havil | first = Julian | year = 2008 | title = Impossible?

The idea of human artifacts being given life has fascinated humankind for as long as people have been recording their myths and stories.  Whether [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] or [[Frankenstein]], humanity has been fascinated with the idea of [[artificial life]].

== Pre-computer ==

[[Automaton]]s were quite a novelty.  In the days before computers and electronics, some were very sophisticated, using [[pneumatics]], [[mechanics]], and [[hydraulics]]. The first automata were conceived during the third and second centuries BC and these were demonstrated by the theorems of [[Hero of Alexandria]], which included sophisticated mechanical and hydraulic solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Droz, Edmond. (April 1962), From joined doll to talking robot, New Scientist, vol. 14, no. 282. pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his notable works were included in the book ''Pneumatics'', which was also used for constructing machines until early modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Synthetic Biology Analysed: Tools for Discussion and Evaluation|last=Engelhard|first=Margret|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=9783319251431|location=Cham|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1490, Leonardo Da Vinci also constructed an armored knight, which is considered the first humanoid robot in Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Mobile Robot Control|last=Tzafestas|first=Spyros|publisher=Elsevier|year=2014|isbn=9780124170490|location=Waltham, MA|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early famous examples include [[al-Jazari]]'s [[humanoid robot]]s. This Arabic inventor once constructed a band of automata, which can be commanded to play different pieces of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science Year by Year , Dorling Kindersley, 2013: Science Year by Year|last=Winston|first=Robert|publisher=DK|year=2013|isbn=9781409316138|location=London|pages=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of [[Jacques de Vaucanson]]'s [[digesting Duck|artificial duck]] exhibited in 1735, which had thousands of moving parts and one of the first to mimic a biological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cellular Automaton Modeling of Biological Pattern Formation: Characterization, Examples, and Analysis, 2nd edition|last=Deutsch|first=Andreas|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2018|isbn=9781489979780|location=New York|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duck could reportedly eat and digest, drink, quack, and splash in a pool.  It was exhibited all over Europe until it fell into disrepair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyu.edu/pages/linguistics/courses/v610051/gelmanr/ling.html| title=Gallery of Automata| accessdate=2006-03-03| first=Rony| last=Gelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it wasn't until the invention of cheap computing power that [[artificial life]] as a legitimate science began in earnest, steeped more in the theoretical and computational than the mechanical and mythological.

==1950s&amp;ndash;1970s==
One of the earliest thinkers of the modern age to postulate the potentials of artificial life, separate from [[artificial intelligence]], was math and computer prodigy [[John von Neumann]].  At the [[Hixon Symposium]], hosted by [[Linus Pauling]] in [[Pasadena, California]] in the late 1940s, von Neumann delivered a lecture titled "The General and Logical Theory of Automata."  He defined an "automaton" as any machine whose behavior proceeded logically from step to step by combining information from the environment and its own programming, and said that natural organisms would in the end be found to follow similar simple rules.  He also spoke about the idea of [[self-replicating machine]]s.  He postulated a machine &amp;ndash; a [[kinematic automaton]] &amp;ndash; made up of a control computer, a construction arm, and a long series of instructions, floating in a lake of parts.  By following the instructions that were part of its own body, it could create an identical machine.  He followed this idea by creating (with [[Stanislaw Ulam]]) a purely logic-based automaton, not requiring a physical body but based on the changing states of the cells in an infinite grid &amp;ndash; the first [[cellular automaton]].  It was extraordinarily complicated compared to later CAs, having hundreds of thousands of cells which could each exist in one of twenty-nine states, but von Neumann felt he needed the complexity in order for it to function not just as a self-replicating "machine", but also as a [[universal computer]] as defined by [[Alan Turing]].  This "[[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]]" read from a tape of instructions and wrote out a series of cells that could then be made active to leave a fully functional copy of the original machine and its tape. Von Neumann worked on his [[automata theory]] intensively right up to his death, and considered it his most important work.

[[Homer Jacobson]] illustrated basic self-replication in the 1950s with a model train set &amp;ndash; a seed "organism" consisting of a "head" and "tail" boxcar could use the simple rules of the system to consistently create new "organisms" identical to itself, so long as there was a random pool of new boxcars to draw from.
[[Edward F. Moore]] proposed "Artificial Living Plants", which would be floating factories which could create copies of themselves.  They could be programmed to perform some function (extracting fresh water, harvesting minerals from seawater) for an investment that would be relatively small compared to the huge returns from the exponentially growing numbers of factories.  [[Freeman Dyson]] also studied the idea, envisioning self-replicating machines sent to explore and exploit other planets and moons, and a NASA group called the Self-Replicating Systems Concept Team performed a 1980 study on the feasibility of a self-building lunar factory.

University of Cambridge professor [[John Horton Conway]] invented the most famous cellular automaton in the 1960s.  He called it the [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]], and publicized it through [[Martin Gardner]]'s column in ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine.

==1970s&amp;ndash;1980s==
Philosophy scholar [[Arthur Burks]], who had worked with von Neumann (and indeed, organized his papers after Neumann's death), headed the Logic of Computers Group at the [[University of Michigan]].  He brought the overlooked views of 19th century American thinker [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] into the modern age.  Peirce was a strong believer that all of nature's workings were based on logic (though not always deductive logic).  The Michigan group was one of the few groups still interested in alife and CAs in the early 1970s; one of its students, [[Tommaso Toffoli]] argued in his PhD thesis that the field was important because its results explain the simple rules that underlay complex effects in nature.  Toffoli later provided a key proof that CAs were [[Reversible computing|reversible]], just as the true universe is considered to be.

[[Christopher Langton]] was an unconventional researcher, with an undistinguished academic career that led him to a job programming [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] mainframes for a hospital.  He became enthralled by Conway's Game of Life, and began pursuing the idea that the computer could emulate living creatures.  After years of study (and a near-fatal hang-gliding accident), he began attempting to actualize Von Neumann's CA and the work of [[Edgar F. Codd]], who had simplified Von Neumann's original twenty-nine state monster to one with only eight states.  He succeeded in creating the first self-replicating computer organism in October 1979, using only an [[Apple II]] desktop computer.  He entered Burks' graduate program at the Logic of Computers Group in 1982, at the age of 33, and helped to found a new discipline.

Langton's official conference announcement of Artificial Life I was the earliest description of a field which had previously barely existed:&lt;ref&gt;Langton, C.G. (1989) "Artificial Life", in ''Artificial Life'', Langton (ed), (Addison-Wesley:Reading, MA) page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Artificial life is the study of artificial systems that exhibit behavior characteristic of natural living systems.  It is the quest to explain life in any of its possible manifestations, without restriction to the particular examples that have evolved on earth.  This includes biological and chemical experiments, computer simulations, and purely theoretical endeavors.  Processes occurring on molecular, social, and evolutionary scales are subject to investigation.  The ultimate goal is to extract the logical form of living systems.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Microelectronic technology and genetic engineering will soon give us the capability to create new life forms ''in silico'' as well as ''in vitro''.  This capacity will present humanity with the most far-reaching technical, theoretical and ethical challenges it has ever confronted.  The time seems appropriate for a gathering of those involved in attempts to simulate or synthesize aspects of living systems.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ed Fredkin]] founded the Information Mechanics Group at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], which united Toffoli, [[Norman Margolus]], [[Gerard Vichniac]], and [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]].  This group created a computer especially designed to execute cellular automata, eventually reducing it to the size of a single circuit board.  This "cellular automata machine" allowed an explosion of alife research among scientists who could not otherwise afford sophisticated computers.

In 1982, computer scientist named [[Stephen Wolfram]] turned his attention to cellular automata.  He explored and categorized the types of [[complexity]] displayed by one-dimensional CAs, and showed how they applied to natural phenomena such as the patterns of seashells and the nature of plant growth.
[[Norman Packard]], who worked with Wolfram at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], used CAs to simulate the growth of snowflakes, following very basic rules.

Computer animator [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] similarly used three simple rules to create recognizable [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]] behaviour in a [[Boids|computer program]] in 1987 to animate groups of boids.  With no top-down programming at all, the boids produced lifelike solutions to evading obstacles placed in their path.  [[Computer animation]] has continued to be a key commercial driver of alife research as the creators of [[Film|movie]]s attempt to find more realistic and inexpensive ways to animate natural forms such as plant life, animal movement, hair growth, and complicated organic textures.

The Unit of Theoretical Behavioural Ecology at the [[Free University of Brussels]] applied the self-organization theories of [[Ilya Prigogine]] and the work of entomologist [[E.O. Wilson]] to research the behavior of social insects, particularly [[allelomimesis]], in which an individual's actions are dictated by those of a neighbor.  They developed partial differential equations which modeled the shapes created by termites when constructing their nest.  They then compared that to the reaction of real termites to identical changes in laboratory colonies, and refined their theories about the rules which underlay the behavior.

[[J. Doyne Farmer]] was a key figure in tying artificial life research to the emerging field of [[complex adaptive system]]s, working at the [[Center for Nonlinear Studies]] (a basic research section of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]), just as its star chaos theorist [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] was leaving.  Farmer and Norman Packard chaired a conference in May 1985 called "Evolution, Games, and Learning", which was to presage many of the topics of later alife conferences.

==2000s==
On the ecological front, research regarding the evolution of animal cooperative behavior (started by [[W. D. Hamilton]] in the 1960s &lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, W. D. The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I and II. J. Theor.
Biol. 7, 1&amp;ndash;52 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, R. &amp; Hamilton, W. D. The evolution of cooperation. Science 211,
1390&amp;ndash;1396 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in theories of kin selection, reciprocity, multilevel selection and cultural group selection) was re-introduced via artificial life by [[Peter Turchin]] and Mikhail Burtsev in 2006. Previously, [[game theory]] has been utilized in similar investigation, however, that approach was deemed to be rather limiting in its amount of possible strategies and debatable set of payoff rules. The alife model designed here, instead, is based upon [[Conway's Game of Life]] but with much added complexity (there are over 10&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; strategies that can potentially emerge). Most significantly, the interacting agents are characterized by external phenotype markers which allows for recognition amongst in-group members. In effect, it is shown that given the capacity to perceive these markers, agents within the system are then able to evolve new group behaviors under minimalistic assumptions. On top of the already known strategies of the bourgeois-[[hawk-dove game]], here two novel modes of cooperative attack and defense arise from the simulation.

For the setup, this two-dimensional artificial world is divided into cells, each empty or containing a resource bundle. An empty cell can acquire a resource bundle with a certain probability per unit of time and lose it when an agent consumes the resource. Each agent is plainly constructed with a set of receptors, effectors (the components that govern the agents' behavior), and neural net which connect the two. In response to the environment, an agent may rest, eat, reproduce by division, move, turn and attack. All actions{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} &lt;!--is this true? (see next comment)--&gt; expend energy taken from its internal energy storage; once that is depleted, the agent dies. Consumption of resource, as well as other agents after defeating them, yields an increase &lt;!--or should this say "a net increase"?--&gt; in the energy storage. Reproduction is modeled as being asexual while the offspring receive half the parental energy. Agents are also equipped with sensory inputs that allow them to detect resources or other members within a parameter{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} in addition to its own level of vitality. As for the phenotype markers, they do not influence behavior but solely function as indicator of 'genetic' similarity. Heredity is achieved by having the relevant information be inherited by the offspring and subjected to a set rate of mutation.

The objective of the investigation is to study how the presence of phenotype markers affects the model's range of evolving cooperative strategies. In addition, as the resource available in this 2D environment is capped, the simulation also serves to determine the effect of environmental carrying capacity on their emergence.

One previously unseen strategy is termed the "raven". These agents leave cells with in-group members, thus avoiding intra-specific competition, and attack out-group members voluntarily. Another strategy, named the 'starling', involves the agent sharing cells with in-group members. Despite individuals having smaller energy storage due to resource partitioning, this strategy permits highly effective defense against large invaders via the advantage in numbers. Ecologically speaking, this resembles the [[mobbing behavior]] that characterizes many species of small birds when they collectively defend against the predator.

In conclusion, the research claims that the simulated results have important implications for the evolution of [[territoriality (ethology)|territoriality]] by showing that within the alife framework it is possible to "model not only how one strategy displaces another, but also the very process by which new strategies emerge from a large quantity of possibilities".&lt;ref&gt;Burtsev M, Turchin P. 2006. Evolution of cooperative strategies from first principles. Nature&lt;/ref&gt;

Work is also underway to create [[computational biomodeling|cellular models of artificial life]].  Initial work on building a complete biochemical model of cellular behavior is underway as part of a number of different research projects, namely [[Blue Gene]] which seeks to understand the mechanisms behind [[protein folding]].

In [[economics]], an '''input–output model''' is a quantitative economic technique that represents the interdependencies between different branches of a national economy or different regional economies.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;Thijs Ten Raa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nu0FAvNiFhYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Input–output economics: theory and applications: featuring Asian economies]'', World Scientific, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Leontief]] (1906–1999) is credited with developing this type of analysis and earned the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for his development of this model.&lt;ref name="ref"/&gt;

==Origins==
[[Francois Quesnay]] had developed a cruder version of this technique called [[Tableau économique]], and [[Léon Walras]]'s work ''Elements of Pure Economics'' on [[general equilibrium theory]] also was a forerunner and made a generalization of Leontief's seminal concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Éléments d'économie politique pure, ou théorie de la richesse sociale |trans-title=Elements of Pure Economics, or The Theory of Social Wealth |first=L. |last=Walras |location= |publisher= |year=1874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Bogdanov]] has been credited with originating the concept in a report delivered to the [[First Conference on Scientific Organization of Labour|All Russia Conference on the Scientific Organisation of Labour and Production Processes]], in January 1921.&lt;ref name=Belykh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belykh|first=A. A.|title=A Note on the Origins of Input-Output Analysis and the Contribution of the Early Soviet Economists: Chayanov, Bogdanov and Kritsman|journal=Soviet Studies|date=July 1989|volume=41|issue=3|pages=426–429|doi=10.1080/09668138908411823}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was also developed by L. N. Kritsman and T. F. Remington, who has argued that their work provided a link between Quesnay's tableau économique and the subsequent contributions by [[Vladimir Groman]] and [[Vladimir Bazarov]] to [[Gosplan]]'s method of [[material balance planning]].&lt;ref name=Belykh /&gt;

Wassily Leontief's work in the input-output model was influenced by the works of the classical economists [[Karl Marx]] and [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]]. Karl Marx's economics provided an early outline involving a set of tables where the economy consisted of two interlinked departments.&lt;ref name="Planning and the Real Origins of Input-Output Analysis, 1984"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planning and the Real Origins of Input-Output Analysis |first=D. L. |last=Clark |year=1984 |journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=408–429 |doi=10.1080/00472338485390301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leontief was the first to use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representation of a national (or regional) economy.

== Basic derivation ==
The model depicts inter-industry relationships within an economy, showing how output from one industrial sector may become an input to another industrial sector. In the inter-industry matrix, column entries typically represent inputs to an industrial sector, while row entries represent outputs from a given sector. This format therefore shows how dependent each sector is on every other sector, both as a customer of outputs from other sectors and as a supplier of inputs. Each column of the input–output [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] shows the monetary value of inputs to each sector and each row represents the value of each sector's outputs.

Say that we have an economy with &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; sectors. Each sector produces &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; units of a single homogeneous good. Assume that the &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt;th sector, in order to produce 1 unit, must use &lt;math&gt; a_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; units from sector &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, assume that each sector sells some of its output to other sectors (intermediate output) and some of its output to consumers (final output, or final demand). Call final demand in the &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;th sector &lt;math&gt; d_i &lt;/math&gt;. Then we might write

:&lt;math&gt;

x_i = a_{i1}x_1 + a_{i2}x_2 + \ldots + a_{in}x_n + d_i,

&lt;/math&gt;

or total output equals intermediate output plus final output. If we let &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; be the matrix of coefficients &lt;math&gt; a_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; be the vector of total output, and &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; be the vector of final demand, then our expression for the economy becomes

:&lt;math&gt;

x = Ax + d

&lt;/math&gt;

which after re-writing becomes &lt;math&gt; (I - A)x = d &lt;/math&gt;. If the matrix &lt;math&gt; I - A &lt;/math&gt; is invertible then this is a linear system of equations with a unique solution, and so given some final demand vector the required output can be found. Furthermore, if the principal [[Minor (linear algebra)|minors]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt; I - A &lt;/math&gt; are all positive (known as the [[Hawkins–Simon condition]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nikaido |first=H. |title=Introduction to Sets and Mappings in Modern Economics |location=New York |publisher=Elsevier |year=1970 |isbn=0-444-10038-5 |pages=13–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the required output vector &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative.

=== Example ===

Consider an economy with two goods, A and B. The matrix of coefficients and the final demand is given by

:&lt;math&gt;

A = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0.5 &amp; 0.2 \\ 0.4 &amp; 0.1 \end{array}\right) \text{ and } d = \left(\begin{array}{c} 7 \\ 4 \end{array}\right).

&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, this corresponds to finding the amount of output each sector should produce given that we want 7 units of good A and 4 units of good B. Then solving the system of linear equations derived above gives us

:&lt;math&gt;

x = (I - A)^{-1} d = \left(\begin{array}{c} 19.19 \\ 12.97 \end{array}\right).

&lt;/math&gt;

=== Further research ===

There is an extensive literature on these models. There is the Hawkins–Simon condition on producibility. There has been research on disaggregation to clustered inter-industry flows, and on the study of constellations of industries. A great deal of empirical work has been done to identify coefficients, and data has been published for the national economy as well as for regions. The Leontief system can be extended to a model of general equilibrium; it offers a method of decomposing work done at a macro level.

=== Introducing transportation ===

Transportation is implicit in the notion of inter-industry flows. It is explicitly recognized when transportation is identified as an industry – how much is purchased from transportation in order to produce. But this is not very satisfactory because transportation requirements differ, depending on industry locations and capacity constraints on regional production. Also, the receiver of goods generally pays freight cost, and often transportation data are lost because transportation costs are treated as part of the cost of the goods.

[[Walter Isard]] and his student, [[Leon Moses]], were quick to see the spatial economy and transportation implications of input–output, and began work in this area in the 1950s developing a concept of interregional input–output. Take a one region versus the world case. We wish to know something about interregional commodity flows, so introduce a column into the table headed "exports" and we introduce an "import" row.

A more satisfactory way to proceed would be to tie regions together at the industry level. That is, we could identify both intra-region inter-industry transactions and inter-region inter-industry transactions. The problem here is that the table grows quickly.

Input–output is conceptually simple. Its extension to a model of equilibrium in the national economy has been done successfully using high-quality data. One who wishes to do work with input–output systems must deal skillfully with industry classification, data estimation, and inverting very large, ill-conditioned matrices. Moreover, changes in relative prices are not readily handled by this modeling approach alone. Of course, input–output accounts are part and parcel to a more flexible form of modeling, [[Computable general equilibrium]] models.

Two additional difficulties are of interest in transportation work. There is the question of substituting one input for another, and there is the question about the stability of coefficients as production increases or decreases. These are intertwined questions. They have to do with the nature of regional production functions.

==Usefulness==

Because the input–output model is fundamentally linear in nature, it lends itself to rapid computation as well as flexibility in computing the effects of changes in demand. Input–output models for different regions can also be linked together to investigate the effects of inter-regional trade, and additional columns can be added to the table to perform [[environmentally extended input-output analysis]] (EEIOA). For example, information on fossil fuel inputs to each sector can be used to investigate flows of embodied carbon within and between different economies.

The structure of the input–output model has been incorporated into national accounting in many developed countries, and as such can be used to calculate important measures such as national GDP. Input–output economics has been used to study regional economies within a nation, and as a tool for national and regional economic planning. A main use of input–output analysis is to measure the economic impacts of events as well as public investments or programs as shown by [[IMPLAN]] and [[Regional Input-Output Modeling System]]. It is also used to identify economically related industry clusters and also so-called "key" or "target" industries (industries that are most likely to enhance the internal coherence of a specified economy). By linking industrial output to satellite accounts articulating energy use, effluent production, space needs, and so on, input–output analysts&lt;!-- Who? --&gt; have extended&lt;!-- Font? --&gt; the approaches application to a wide variety of uses.

===Input-output and socialist planning===
The input-output model is one of the major conceptual models for a [[socialist]] [[planned economy]]. This model involves the direct determination of physical quantities to be produced in each industry, which is used to formulate a consistent economic plan of resource allocation. This method of planning is contrasted with price-directed [[Lange model|Lange-model socialism]] and Soviet-style [[material balance planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loucks|first1=William Negele|last2=Whitney|first2=William G.|title=Comparative Economic Systems|date=1973|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=9780060440459|pages=178–179|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the economy of the [[Soviet Union]], planning was conducted using the method of material balances up until the country's dissolution. The method of material balances was first developed in the 1930s during the Soviet Union's rapid industrialization drive. Input-output planning was never adopted because the material balance system had become entrenched in the Soviet economy, and input-output planning was shunned for ideological reasons. As a result, the benefits of consistent and detailed planning through input-output analysis was never realized in the [[Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]].&lt;ref&gt;''Towards A New Socialism'', 1993, by Paul cockshott and Allin Cottrell. Coronet Books Inc. 978-0851245454. "Planning in the USSR", (P.79)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring input–output tables ==

The mathematics of input–output economics is straightforward, but the data requirements are enormous because the expenditures and revenues of each branch of economic activity have to be represented. As a result, not all countries collect the required data and data quality varies, even though a set of standards for the data's collection has been set out by the United Nations through its System of National Accounts (SNA):&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna.asp About SNA], UN&lt;/ref&gt; the most recent standard is the 2008 SNA. Because the data collection and preparation process for the input–output accounts is necessarily labor and computer intensive, input–output tables are often published long after the year in which the data were collected—typically as much as 5–7 years after. Moreover, the economic "snapshot" that the benchmark version of the tables provides of the economy's cross-section is typically taken only once every few years, at best.

However, many developed countries estimate input–output accounts annually and with much greater recency. This is because while most uses of the input–output analysis focus on the matrix set of inter-industry exchanges, the actual focus of the analysis from the perspective of most national statistical agencies is the [[benchmarking]] of [[gross domestic product]]. Input–output tables therefore are an instrumental part of [[national accounts]]. As suggested above, the core input–output table reports only intermediate goods and services that are exchanged among industries. But an array of row [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s, typically aligned at the bottom of this matrix, record non-industrial inputs by industry like payments for labor; indirect business taxes; dividends, interest, and rents; capital consumption allowances (depreciation); other property-type income (like profits); and purchases from foreign suppliers (imports). At a national level, although excluding the imports, when summed this is called "gross product originating" or "gross domestic product by industry." Another array of column vectors is called "final demand" or "gross product consumed." This displays columns of spending by households, governments, changes in industry stocks, and industries on investment, as well as net exports. (See also Gross domestic product.) In any case, by employing the results of an economic census which asks for the sales, payrolls, and material/equipment/service input of each establishment, statistical agencies back into estimates of industry-level profits and investments using the input–output matrix as a sort of double-accounting framework.

==Input–output analysis versus consistency analysis==
Despite the clear ability of the input-output model to depict and analyze the dependence of one industry or sector on another, Leontief and others never managed to introduce the full spectrum of dependency relations in a market economy. In 2003, Mohammad Gani [https://web.archive.org/web/20070826172321/http://sb.iub.edu.bd/Dr_Mohammad_Osman_Gani.html], a pupil of Leontief, introduced [[consistency analysis]] in his book 'Foundations of Economic Science' ({{ISBN|984320655X}}), which formally looks exactly like the input–output table but explores the dependency relations in terms of payments and intermediation relations. Consistency analysis explores the consistency of plans of buyers and sellers by decomposing the input–output table into four matrices, each for a different kind of means of payment. It integrates micro and macroeconomics into one model and deals with money in a value-free manner. It deals with the flow of funds via the movement of goods.

The '''Institute of International Finance, Inc.''' ('''IIF''') is a global association or trade group of [[financial institution]]s. It was created by 38 [[bank]]s of leading industrialized countries in 1983 in response to the [[Latin American debt crisis|international debt crisis]] of the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="IIP27apr2000"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.unescap.org/drpad/publication/survey2000/ch5_8.htm|title=Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific, 2000|chapter=Economic and financial monitoring and surveillance: Institute of International Finance|date=27 April 2000|accessdate=9 August 2013|quote=|author=UNESCAP|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803224651/http://www.unescap.org/drpad/publication/survey2000/ch5_8.htm|archivedate=3 August 2013}} This section in UNESCAP's annual report reviewed the IIF along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and credit rating agencies in terms of financial monitoring and surveillance.&lt;/ref&gt; See the arguments in support of this in.&lt;ref name="White16March1998"&gt;{{cite conference|author=William R. White|title=Promoting international financial stability: the role of the BIS|conference=Conference on Coping with Financial Crises in Developing and Transition Countries: Regulatory and Supervisory Challenges in a New Era of Global Finance|series=Forum on Debt and Development|publisher=Nederlandsche Bank|location=Amsterdam|date=16–17 March 1998|url=http://fondad.org/uploaded/Regulatory%20and%20Supervisory%20Challenges/Regulatory-White.pdf|format=PDF|laysummary=}} By March 1998 a new paradigm had emerged in terms of regulation and policy-making in a new era of global finance with increasingly "sophisticated and rapidly changing markets." At a conference on debt and development White argued that "policy makers and regulators" would have to "rely increasingly on market-led processes to provide the discipline required to lead to prudent and stabilizing behaviour."&lt;/ref&gt;

The IIF's mission is to support the financial industry in the prudent management of risks; to develop sound industry practices; and to advocate for regulatory, financial and economic policies that are in the broad interests of its members and foster global financial stability and sustainable economic growth.

The IIF serves its membership by:

* Providing analysis and research to its members on [[emerging markets]] and other issues in global finance.
* Developing and advancing views and proposals that influence the public debate on policies, including those of multilateral agencies, and on themes of common interest to participants in global financial markets.
* Coordinating a network for members to exchange views and offer opportunities for dialogue among policy-makers, regulators, and private sector financial institutions.

The Institute's Board of Directors &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iif.com/about/bod/&lt;/ref&gt; numbers 38, led by Chairman [[Axel A. Weber|Axel Weber]]; Vice Chairmen Brian Porter (also Treasurer of the IIF) and [[Walter Kielholz]]. The IIF's President and Chief Executive Officer is [[Timothy D. Adams]], who has held the position since February 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Adams appointed to succeed Charles Dallara as IIF Managing Director|url=http://www.iif.com/press/press+402.php|work=IIF Press Release|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], and has satellite offices in Dubai, Beijing, Singapore and London.

== Membership ==

The Institute of International Finance is the global association of the financial industry, with close to 500 members from 70 countries. IIF members include most of the world's largest [[commercial bank]]s and [[investment banking|investment bank]]s, a growing number of [[insurance]] companies and [[investment management]] firms. Associate members include multinational corporations, trading companies, [[export credit agency|export credit agencies]], and multilateral agencies.

The '''International Institute for Sustainable Development''' ('''IISD''') is an independent think tank founded in 1990. The institute has offices in [[Winnipeg]], [[Ottawa]], [[New York City]], and [[Geneva]]. It has over 100 staff and associates working in over 30 countries.

As a registered charitable organization in Canada, IISD has 501 (c) (3) status in the U.S. IISD receives core operating support from the Government of Canada, as provided through the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the Province of Manitoba. The institute also receives project funding from numerous governments inside and outside Canada, United Nations agencies, foundations and the private sector.

== Core areas ==

IISD's 2014-19 strategic plan is focused on six areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iisd.org/about/about-iisd|title=Our Mission {{!}} IISD|website=www.iisd.org|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Reporting Services

== Initiatives and Projects ==

=== IISD Experimental Lakes Area ===

[[Experimental Lakes Area|IISD Experimental Lakes Area]] (IISD-ELA) is a natural laboratory consisting of 58 small lakes and their watersheds set aside for scientific research. Located in Northwestern Ontario, Canada, the lakes in the region are not affected by human impacts. By manipulating these small lakes, scientists are able to examine how all aspects of the ecosystem—from the atmosphere to fish populations—respond. Findings from these real-world experiments are often much more accurate than those from research conducted at smaller scales, such as in laboratories. IISD took over operation of the Experimental Lakes Area in 2014.

=== IISD Reporting Services ===
IISD Reporting Services (IISD-RS) provides independent coverage of intergovernmental policy-making efforts related to the environment and sustainable development, including daily reporting, analysis and photos of international environment and development negotiations and events. IISD Reporting Services’ flagship publication, the Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB), aims to provide a balanced, timely and independent reporting of daily information regarding multilateral environmental and sustainable development negotiations. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin was first published during the preparations for the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), and has been published on most follow-up negotiations since then. IISD-RS also reports on workshops and international fora that seek to contribute to intergovernmental policy making, and manages a suite of knowledgebases that report on activities that seek to contribute to or implement decisions taken at the intergovernmental policy making level.


Intergovernmental processes covered by Earth Negotiations Bulletin include: the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] (CSD); the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC); the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD); the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD); the United Nations Forum on Forests; the chemicals conventions (Stockholm, Basel and Rotterdam); the [[Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]]; the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES); the [[Convention on Migratory Species]] (CMS); and the [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] (ITPGR). The Earth Negotiations Bulletin archives link to all of the processes and ENB reports covered by IISD RS.

''Earth Negotiations Bulletin''{{Main article|Earth Negotiations Bulletin}}

=== Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI) ===
The IISD Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI) supports international processes, national governments and civil society organizations to align subsidies with sustainable development. GSI does this by promoting transparency on the nature and size of energy subsidies; evaluating the economic, social and environmental impacts of energy subsidies; and, where necessary, advising on how inefficient and wasteful subsidies can best be reformed. GSI is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and works with partners located around the world. Its principal funders have included the governments of Denmark, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, as well as the KR Foundation.

=== National Adaptation Planners (NAP) Global Network ===
IISD hosts the Secretariat for the NAP Global Network, which was initiated by adaptation policy-makers and practitioners from 11 developing and developed countries in December 2014, based on the recognition that the NAP process will require sustained dialogue and coordination to leverage and learn from each other’s approaches, experiences and programs. It aims to enhance national adaptation planning and action in developing countries through coordination of bilateral support and in-country actors. The Network also facilitates international peer learning and exchange. It brings together individuals and institutions representing developing country adaptation policymakers and bilateral development agencies. 

=== Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development (IGF) ===
The IGF emerged from the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa where delegates recognized the challenges and opportunities related to mining and sustainable development. The IGF supports more than 60 nations committed to leveraging mining for sustainable development to ensure that negative impacts are limited and financial benefits are shared. IISD has served as Secretariat for the IGF since October 2015. 

The IGF is devoted to optimizing the benefits of mining to achieve poverty reduction, inclusive growth, social development and environmental stewardship. The IGF is focused on improving resource governance and decision making by governments working in the sector. It provides a number of services to members including: in-country assessments; capacity building and individualized technical assistance; guidance documents and conference which explore best practices and provide an opportunity to engage with industry and civil society.

'''Intimacy''' is the degree to which a person can share feelings with another in a [[Intimate relationship|relationship]]. Intimacy is occasionally linked with [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] but it can also occur in a [[Platonic love|nonsexual]] or unromantic relationship. The [[dialectic]]s of connection-autonomy and openness-closedness manipulate the communication of intimacy between partners.

The '''Malcolm Knapp Research Forest''' is located in the [[Coast Mountains]], about 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Vancouver]], in [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia]]. The forest is approximately 5,157 hectares and has many different types of terrain. The forest is home to some 400-year-old trees, though the vast majority of trees are 70–120 years old. It was a site of major logging from the 1800s to 1931, but was officially established as the UBC/Malcolm Knapp Research Forest in 1949 because of the major influence from the late UBC professor [[Malcolm Knapp]]. Although today it is dedicated to research and education, it is also a popular destination for trail hiking and camps. 

__TOC__

==Historic influence and UBC research==

In 1922 when the forestry program at UBC was just two years old, [[Malcolm Knapp]], a professor of forestry, had a vision to conduct research for forestry. He taught courses on logging, wood technology and forestry products. At this time, the university only had a small forest on the edge of campus for research, so his influence was immense{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} when the [[University of British Columbia]] took over management of the forest in 1949. His vision of having a large and vast forest became reality. This vision, along with his passion for [[salvage archaeology|salvaging]] and [[silviculture]] for the Forestry Program at UBC, was of great importance{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} as his 41 years of service for the university ended in 1963. After his many years of service to the forest and the university, the Research Forest officially changed its name to Malcolm Knapp/UBC Research Forest in 1988, and then he died a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malcolm Knapp&amp;#124; History|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UBC also holds a spot at the top of one of the mountains for a [[liquid mirror telescope]] observatory (UBC LMTO). It was established in 1995 as part of development for liquid-mirror technology. The telescope overlooks the [[Fraser Valley]] and is far enough away from the city lights to provide a great{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} research facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UBC LMTO|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/research/liquid-mirror-telescope/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently{{When|date=June 2015}} 84 research projects going on at the forest, all related to riparian management, silviculture, wildlife, hydrology, ecology, and other applied science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UBC Research Projects Database|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/research/research-projects-database/}}&lt;/ref&gt; UBC also releases annual reports in which one can see what is going on in the forest, what research they are conducting and any updates on projects. Staff changes, silviculture reports (including clear-cuts, thinning, etc.), along with major events for the forest are all summarized in these reports. Please see external links for archives.

==Ecology==

[[File:Old growth Douglas-fir, Malcolm Knapp Research Forest, BC, Canada.jpg|thumb]]

[[File:Blooming Skunk Cabbage.JPG|thumb]]

The forest is about {{convert|5,157|ha}}. It measures 13&amp;nbsp;km from west to east and 4&amp;nbsp;km north to south. It contains every type of terrain found on Coastal B.C which means that it has a wide variety of many plants, animals and trees. The highest elevation is in the north-east corner and is about 1000m above sea level in the [[Golden Ears (peaks)|Golden Ears Mountains]], and it spans down to sea level, touching [[Pitt Lake]]. Typically, the most precipitation that is seen at the forest is rain, which averages about 2200mm in the northern end of the forest. This end also receives snow in the winter. However, the south end is closer to sea level and receives around 3000mm of rain per year.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malcolm Knapp Research Forest|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/about/location-and-ecology/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Knapp Research Forest is categorized in the [[Biogeoclimatic zones of British Columbia|Coast Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic zone]], with the lower portion of the forest in the dry maritime subzone and the upper portion in the very wet maritime subzone. It has a vast collection of trees, plants and animals including [[Douglas fir]], [[western red cedar]], [[western hemlock]] and [[amabilis fir]] trees. The forest still has some patches of intact old growth forest that is over 400 years old, but since ongoing research is being done, some of the forest is as young as 40 years old, though most of the forest is covered in trees that are about 70 years old.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some other trees and plants you can find are [[bigleaf maple]], [[vine maple]], [[Lysichiton americanus|skunk cabbage]] (yellow flower pictured beside), [[Oregon grape]], [[salmonberry]], and many ferns like [[Polystichum munitum|sword fern]] and [[Dryopteris expansa|spiny wood fern]].

==Recreation==
[[File:Trails at Malcolm Knapp.JPG|thumb]]
The maximum trail length is about 8&amp;nbsp;km; that will take the average hiker around 3 hours to walk. The trails at Malcolm Knapp are categorized as an intermediate hike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vancouver Trails &amp;#124; UBC Malcolm Knapp|url=http://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/ubc-malcolm-knapp-research-forest/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Malcolm Knapp hiking===
[[File:Markers.JPG|thumb]]
The south part of Malcolm Knapp Research Forest has an abundance of trails which are all colour coded into Red, Green, Yellow, and blue, with red being the easiest and blue being the hardest. Please see external links for a map of the trails.

===Loon Lake hiking===
The Loon Lake Trail is for guests of Loon Lake Research and Education Centre wishing to embark on this 6&amp;nbsp;km hike. Please see external links for a map of the trails.

====Loon Lake Research and Education Center====

On the trails at Loon Lake, there is a research and education center. Loon Lake is the largest lake in the forest, which has its own trail around the lake that will take about 6 hours to complete as it is 6&amp;nbsp;km in length. The lake opened an outdoor education camp in 2000, and now provides an area for forestry and environmental education, as well as outdoor recreation with activities such as:&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Loon Lake Lodge and Retreat Center|url=http://loonlake.ubc.ca/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Canoe &amp; Water Adventures
* SKY Helicopter Tours
* Eco-Tours and Hiking
* Inspired Learning educational programs
* Pinnacle Pursuits
* Rock-climbing, rappelling, high/low ropes, team building

====Camp Goodtimes====
Loon Lake also houses Camp Goodtimes, a summer recreation program for children and teens affected by cancer and their families. It is divided into six weeks throughout July and August: four weeks for kids' camp, one week for teen, and one week for family. It is held at Loon Lake at no cost to participants. Camp Goodtimes is accredited by the [[British Columbia Camping Association]] and the [[Canadian Association of Pediatric Oncology Camps]] (CAPOC).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The '''Maon Synagogue''' is a 6th-century [[synagogue]] and archaeological site located in the [[Negev Desert]] near Kibbutz [[Nirim]] and Kibbutz [[Nir Oz]].   It is noted for its "magnificent" [[mosaic]] floor.&lt;ref name=Schaalje&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/99mag/maon/maon.htm] "Mamshit &amp; the Ancient Synagogue of Maon, Jacqueline Schaalje, Jewish Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological finds==
[[Image:Nirim Mosaic1.jpg|thumb|250px|Mosaic detail]]
The original date of the synagogue is uncertain but is before the 6th century.  In a sixth-century renovation, the northern wall (closest to [[Jerusalem]]) was opened and a semi-circular [[apse]] to contain a [[Torah Ark]] was constructed.  The floor level was raised and marble columns and a "breathtakingly beautiful"  mosaic floor installed.&lt;ref name=IAA&gt;[http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1513&amp;module_id=#as] "One of the Most Spectacular Mosaic Floors Ever Discovered in Israel was Restored and Renovated and Can Now be Seen by the General Public," (30/3/09), Israel Antiquities Authority.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the bottom of the mosaic floor is an  [[amphora]] flanked by a pair of peacocks.  A vine flows out of the amphora, forming loops, in each loop is a bird, animal, fruit, or a depiction of steps in the wine making process.   The design is  so similar to the mosaics in the church floor at nearby Shallal that they are thought to have been designed by the same artist.  Both floors depict animals and have similar patterns: the synagogue floor is distinguished by a menorah flanked by two lions and several other Jewish ritual objects.  The seven-branched menorah stands on three legs, like the menorah in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The legs in Maon are shaped like a lion's paws. Alongside the menorah are the symbols of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], palm trees and lions.  [[Etrog]]s,  a [[shofar]] and a [[lulav]] are depicted nearby.   The Mosaic has an inscription in Aramaic.  The upper part of the inscription blesses all members of the community, the lower part honors three donors.&lt;ref name=Schaalje/&gt;&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land, Avraham Negev, Shimon Gibson, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;  An identical floor was found in the ancient synagogue in Gaza.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

The synagogue is built on the [[basilica]] plan.  The mosaic is in the central area, the two side aisles were paved with stone.  The ceiling was made of wooden beams and clay.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

A number of small objects were found by the [[Rescue archaeology|salvage dig]] on the floor facing the [[Torah Ark]].  These include coins and bone and metal [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] that are thought to have been associated with the Torah Ark and its ornamental curtain.  There were also  fragments of glass and ceramic lamps.  Dozens of amulets were also found, some of them were used by women who were asking for good health.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

Adjacent to the ruins of the synagogue a cistern, water channels and a [[mikvah]].&lt;ref name=Schaalje/&gt;

==History==
The synagogue was built at the site of Hellenistic [[Menois]], a city marked on the [[Map of Madaba]]. It is one of three ancient synagogues discovered in the western [[Negev]].&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

The synagogue and its mosaic floor were discovered during the construction of a road in 1957. The mosaic was damaged, but the undamaged segment was preserved by a salvage excavation. After its discovery, the mosaic was neglected, causing deterioration.  Restoration work began in 2006, sponsored by the [[Jewish National Fund]], [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and Eshkol Regional Council, and paid for by philanthropist [[Sandy Galet]]. The mosaic was lifted off its original foundation and carefully cleaned.  A new foundation was installed and the mosaic was securely attached.  The mosaic is now protected and was opened to the public in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiannewstoday.com/christian_news_report_227.html ANCIENT SYNAGOGUE'S MOSAIC FLOOR RESTORED TO ORIGINAL BEAUTY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215121144/http://www.christiannewstoday.com/Christian_News_Report_227.html |date=2010-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Julian&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/130674]"1,500-year-old Mosaic Floor Unveiled in Ancient Synagogue Ruins,"  03/30/09, Israel National News,   Hana Levi Julian.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23400">[[File:PreservedFood1.jpg|thumb|A collection of mason jars filled with preserved foods]]

A '''Mason jar''', named after [[John Landis Mason]] who first invented and patented it in 1858, is a molded [[glass]] [[jar]] used in [[home canning]] to [[food preservation|preserve food]]. The jar's mouth  has a [[screw thread]] on its outer perimeter to accept a metal ring (or "band"). The band, when screwed down, presses a separate [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] tin-plated steel disc-shaped [[lid (container)|lid]] against the jar's rim. An integral rubber ring on the underside of the lid creates a [[hermetic seal]]. The bands and lids usually come with new jars, but they are also sold separately. While the bands are reusable, the lids are intended for single use when canning. Largely supplanted by other products and methods for commercial canning, such as tin cans and plastic containers, glass jars and metal lids are still commonly used in [[home canning]]. Mason jars are also called '''Ball jars''', in reference to the [[Ball Corporation]], an early and prolific manufacturer of glass canning jars; '''fruit jars''' for a common content; and '''glass canning jars''' a generic term reflecting their material and purpose. '''Lightning fruit jars''', another type of Mason jar, were not as common as the screw-thread version, but they were popular for home canning in the late nineteenth (19th)  and early twentieth (20th) centuries.

==The jar==
[[File:CucumberDillPickles.jpg|thumb|upright|A wide-mouth Mason jar filled with pickles]]
In the United States, standard-size Mason jars are made of [[soda-lime glass]] and come in two sizes: regular mouth, {{convert|2+3/8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} inner and {{convert|2+3/4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} outer diameter, and wide mouth, {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} inner and {{convert|3+3/8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} outer diameter, versions. They are also produced in a variety of volumes, including [[Cup (unit)|cup]] (half-pint), [[pint]], [[quart]], and half-[[gallon]].

Among the most common U.S. brands of Mason jars are Ball, Kerr, and Golden Harvest. [[Jarden]] Corporation, based in [[Boca Raton, Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;"After years of moving its employees south, Jarden Corp. has officially switched its headquarters to Boca Raton to give the city another major corporate player to boast about."

== Use ==
[[Image:Mason-jar-lids.jpg|thumb|300px|Mason jar lids and bands. The integral soft rubber ring on the underside of the lid seals onto the rim of the jar during processing.]]
{{main article|Home canning}}
In home canning, food is packed into the mason jar, leaving some empty "head space" between the level of food and the top of the jar. The lid is placed on top of the jar with the integral rubber seal resting on the rim. A band is screwed loosely over the lid, allowing air and steam to escape. The jar is heat [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] in boiling water or steam and the lid is secured. The jar is then allowed to cool to room temperature.

The cooling of the contents creates a vacuum in the head space, pulling the lid into tight contact with the jar rim to create a hermetic seal. Once cooled, the band is removed to prevent residual water between the jar threads and the lid from rusting the band. If the jar seal is properly formed, internal vacuum will keep the lid tightly on the jar. Most metal lids used today are slightly domed to serve as a seal status indicator. The vacuum in a properly sealed mason jar pulls the lid down to create a  concave-shaped dome. An improper or failed seal or microbial growth will cause the dome to pop upward.

== History ==
[[File:Boutappertcolljpb.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Nicolas Appert]]’s canning jar]]
French chef [[Nicolas Appert]] invented the method of preserving food by enclosing it in sealed containers. Among the earliest glass jars used for home canning were wax sealers, named in reference to the sealing wax that was poured into a channel around the lip to secure a tin lid. This process, which was complicated and error-prone, became popular in the late 1830s or early 1840s and was commonly used to seal fruit jars from the early 1850s until about 1890. The wax sealing process was largely the only one available until other sealing methods were developed,&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars&gt;{{cite web |author=Bill Lindsey | title =Fruit/Canning Jar Closures | work = | publisher =Society for Historical Archaeology | date = | url =http://www.sha.org/bottle/closures.htm#Canning%20Jars | format =| accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and widely used into the early 1900s.

[[Image:JohnLandisMason.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[John Landis Mason]], inventor of the Mason jar]]
By far the most popular and longest used form of closure for the glass canning jar was a zinc [[screw cap|screw-on cap]], the precursor to today's screw-on lids. It usually had a milk-glass liner, but some of the earliest lids may have had transparent glass liners.&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars/&gt; In 1858, a Vineland tinsmith named [[John Landis Mason]] (1832–1902) invented and patented a screw finish glass jar or bottle that became known as the Mason jar (U.S. Patent No. 22,186.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Landis Mason| publisher =National Inventors Hall of Fame | date =|url=http://www.invent.org/inductee-detail/?IID=287| format = | accessdate =2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Edmund F.

Since they were made in such quantity and used for such long periods, many of them have survived to the present day.

Between 1860 and 1900, many other patents were issued for Mason jar improvements and closures.&lt;ref name=Masons&gt;{{cite web| author=Bill Lindsey| title =Bottle Finishes &amp; Closures, Part III: Types of Bottle Closures | work = | publisher =Society for Historical Archaeology | date = |url=  http://www.sha.org/bottle/closures.htm#Masons | format = | accessdate =2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more esoteric closures were quickly abandoned, and thus can fetch high prices in today's antique market.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Mason applied for and received a United States trademark, which was registered on May 23, 1871, as U.S. Trademark no. 276.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Letters of patent issued to Mason on May 10, 1870, for improvements to his fruit-canning jar was determined to be invalid as a result of a patent infringement case brought before the Southern District of New York on June 11, 1874. The court acknowledged that Mason had invented the jar in 1859, but he did not apply for a patent for an improved version of the fruit jar until 1868. In the meantime, several others had patented designs and Mason had known these jars were being produced and sold. The court ruled that Mason's delay in protecting his patent indicated he had abandoned his invention in the intervening years between 1859 and 1868 and had forfeited his patent. The court's decision allowed other manufacturers to patent, produce, and sell glass jars for canning.&lt;ref&gt;"The Consolidated Fruit Jar Company vs. James T. Wright.

One of the more popular styles of closures for the Mason jar was the wire bail. The closure consists of a metal wire arrangement with a lever that applies leverage to a glass lid when pivoted downward against the side of the jar, clamping it down over a separate rubber [[O ring]]. The bail-style jars are still widely used in Western Europe, particularly France and Italy, where the two largest manufacturers (France's Le Parfait and Italy's [[Bormioli Rocco]]) produce the Le Parfait and Fido brands, respectively. While bail-type jars are widely available in the United States, they are generally marketed there exclusively for dry storage and only rarely used for home canning.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

On January 5, 1875, Charles de Quillfeldt of New York City invented a wire-bail closure known as the Lightning closure. Within a short time he sold the patent rights to several individuals, including Henry Putnam and Karl Hutter. The stopper or lid was typically made from metal, porcelain, or ceramic, while a rubber gasket was used to seal the container. Putnam modified de Quillfeldt's design so that the lid was secured by centering the wire bail between two raised dots or in a groove along the lid's center. Putnam's closure was patented 1882 (U.S. Patent #256,857).&lt;ref name=Closure-Type&gt;{{cite web| author=Bill Lindsey| title =A. General Closure Types | work = | publisher =Society for Historical Archaeology | date = | url = http://www.sha.org/bottle/closures.htm#General%20Closure%20Types| format = | accessdate =2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Quillfeldt used the term "Lightning" to refer to the sealing method, but the closure's popular use on fruit jars led to the name, Lightning fruit jar. The sealing surface on the jar was a "shelf" that supported the lower edge of the lid. A rubber gasket between the shelf and the bottom surface of the lid formed a secure seal when the wire closure was tightened. Although Lightning jars were popular for home canning use from the early 1880s to the early 1900s, they were not as common as screw-thread Mason jars.&lt;ref name=Closure-Type/&gt; The first U.S.-made brand of jars to use this type of closure was embossed with "Lightning" on the side.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A new type of Mason jar known as a "bead" jar was introduced around 1910 to 1915. These continuous screw-thread jars were designed with a bead between the screw threads and the shoulder as a sealing surface. The Ball Perfect Mason jar, one of the most common jars of this style, was introduced around 1913 and produced until the mid-twentieth century. It had several variations, including a square-shaped jar.&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=William F. Brantley | title =A Collector's Guide to Ball Jars | publisher = Rosemary Humbert Martin  | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1975 | location =Muncie, IN | page =55 | url = | oclc =3104299}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the twentieth century, bead jars were sealed with two-piece metal lids. The jar lid had a rubber or rubber-like sealing surface and was held in place by a separate metal band. This type of jar and closure, which first became popular in the late 1910s and 1920s, is still in use.&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars/&gt;

The decline in Mason jar manufacturing in North America is due to several factors: the lack of U.S.-based manufacturers of bail-closure jars since the early 1960s, a sharp decline in popularity of home canning in the 1950s and 1960s, consolidation of the U.S. canning jar industry, and the resulting higher cost of imported European-made jars.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The Ball Corporation, which once dominated the market as the largest domestic manufacturer of home-canning jars, spun off its home-canning business in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Ball Corporation was the largest domestic manufacturer of home canning jars prior to 1933. In 1939 the company manufactured fifty-four percent of all the canning jars made in the United States. See {{cite book | author=Frederic A.

Alltrista was renamed Jarden Corporation in 2001.

Older styles of home canning jars are "Not Recommended" by the U.S.-based National Center for Home Food Preservation, the United States Department of Agriculture, and University Extension Services.  These include: (A) those using a zinc cap and a rubber jar ring,  and (B) those using a glass lid, wire bail, and rubber sealing ring. These provide "no definitive way to determine if a vacuum seal is formed."&lt;ref&gt;Patti Griffith, University of Wyoming Cooperative Extension Service, in her reference to the use of older versions of Mason jar closures, explains, "Jars requiring a zinc cap and jar rubber or jars requiring a glass lid, wire bail, and jar rubber have not been recommended since 1989 because there is no definitive way to determine if a vacuum seal is formed." See {{cite journal| author=Patti Griffith | title=The Time is Ripe for Summer Melons |journal=Canner's Corner: Enjoying Summer's Bounty| volume=MP-119-2| issue=2 |publisher=University of Wyoming Cooperative Extension Service| location =Laramie, WY| url=http://www.wyomingextension.org/agpubs/pubs/MP119_2.pdf |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2017, the Registrar at National Day Calendar proclaimed National Mason Jar Day to be observed annually as a National Holiday on November 30th, beginning in 2017.

== Collecting ==
[[File:Antique Mason jars.jpg|thumb|300px|Antique Mason jars.]]
Antique canning jars are often sold through antique stores and auction sites such as [[eBay]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} The value of a jar is related to its age, rarity, color, and condition. A jar's age and rarity can be determined by the color, shape, mold and production marks of the glass, and the jar's closure. Mason jars usually have a proprietary brand embossed on the jar. Early jars embossed with "Mason's Patent November 28th 1858" that date from the late 1850s to early 1860s closely match the illustrations of Mason's 1858 patents. Mouth-blown (or hand-blown) jars embossed with a version of "Mason's Patent November 28th 1858" were made about 1857 to 1908 and often had a ground lip as well. By 1908 semi-automatic machines manufactured the majority of these jars. Machine-made Mason jars that originated around 1909 have a sealing surface on a bead ledge below the threads. This type of jar dominated the market by the mid to late 1910s. Manufacturers continued to make jars with the beaded seal after the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars/&gt; Ball's "Ideal" canning jar, which first appeared around 1915 and was discontinued in 1962, is one of the company's best-known jars and is popular among collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colored jars were considered better for canning because the color blocked some light from reaching the food, which helps to retain flavor and nutritional value longer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Most antique jars that are not colorless are aqua or  "Ball blue," a blue-green shade that was named for the Ball Corporation, a prevalent jar manufacturer. Most mouth-blown Mason jars embossed with some type of 1858 patent date were produced in aqua glass. The Ball brand of Mason jars were manufactured in several colors, but the most common color was the distinctive "Ball blue," which the Ball Corporation used in its jars from about 1910 to 1930. Mason jars with this particular color of glass may be attributed to Ball, since "virtually no other bottle or jar was made in that color."&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars/&gt; More rarely, jars will turn up in amber, and occasionally in darker shades of green. Rarer still are cobalt blue, black, and milk-glass jars. Some unscrupulous dealers will irradiate jars to bring out colors not original to the jar.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

'''Medical simulation,''' or more broadly, '''healthcare simulation,''' is a branch of [[simulation]] related to education and training in medical fields of various industries. Simulations can be held in the classroom, in situ, or in spaces built specifically for simulation practice.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; It can involve simulated human patients - artificial, human or a combination of the two, educational documents with detailed simulated animations, casualty assessment in [[homeland security]] and military situations, [[emergency response]], and support virtual health functions with holographic simulation. In the past, its main purpose was to train medical professionals to reduce error during surgery, prescription, crisis interventions, and general practice. Combined with methods in '''debriefing''', it is now also used to train students in anatomy, physiology, and communication during their schooling. This occurs in professions which include medicine, nursing, sonography, pharmacy assistants, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and more.  Medical simulation is somewhat unique, as it is continuously evolving to function across the medical operations, patient care and clinical spaces, with the future of medical simulation blurring the line between these sectors of medicine.  Advances in technology are advancing geometrically and a McGraw Hill textbook, Medical Simulation, by VanCura and Bisset interfaces the simulator technology with any medically related course of study.

Many medical professionals are skeptical about simulation, saying that medicine, surgery, and general healing skills are too complex to simulate accurately. However, technological advances in the past two decades have made it possible to simulate practices from yearly family doctor visits to complex operations such as heart surgery. Research regarding healthcare simulation has advanced and proliferated in the past decade. There exists dedicated websites to the field including [https://www.thesimtech.com theSimTech.com] and [https://www.Healthysimulation.com HealthySimulation.com] and several academic peer reviewed journals including: [http://www.ssih.org/News/Journal Simulation in Healthcare], [https://www.nursingsimulation.org/ Clinical Simulation in Nursing], [https://stel.bmj.com/ BMJ Simulation &amp; Technology Enhanced Learning] and [https://advancesinsimulation.biomedcentral.com/ Advances in Simulation].

An increase in recent emergency and military scenario simulation has helped medical providers in Middle East war zones.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Disaster response is made easier and conducted by better trained individuals due to the rapid availability of simulators in schools, hospitals, military facilities, and research labs.

==History==
[[File:Link-trainer-ts.jpg|thumb|Link Trainer.]]

The first uses of medical simulation can be traced back to the first time that a person utilized something other than a patient in order to train, hone, or sustain medical skills.  Modern day simulation for training was first utilized by [[anesthesia]] physicians in order to reduce accidents.&lt;ref name="academicResident" /&gt; When simulation skyrocketed in popularity during the 1930s due to the invention of the [[Link Trainer]] for flight and military applications, many different field experts attempted to adapt simulation to their own needs. Due to limitations in technology and overall medical knowledge to a specific degree at the time, medical simulation did not take off as acceptable training until much later.&lt;ref name="academicResident"&gt;Chakravarthy, Bharath. Academic Resident.  Medical Simulation in EM Training and Beyond&lt;/ref&gt; When the sheer cost effectiveness and training of which simulation was capable surfaced during extensive military use, hardware/software technology increased exponentially, and medical standards were established, medical simulation became entirely possible and affordable, although it remained un-standardized, and not widely accepted by the larger medical community.&lt;ref name="academicResident" /&gt;

By the 1980s software simulations became available. With the help of a [[UCSD School of Medicine]] student, ''Computer Gaming World'' reported that ''Surgeon'' (1986) for the [[Apple Macintosh]] very accurately simulated operating on an [[aortic aneurysm]].&lt;ref name="boosman1988611"&gt;{{cite news | title=Macintosh Windows | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&amp;pub=2&amp;id=32 | work=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1986 | accessdate=1 November 2013 | author=Boosman, Frank | pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others followed, such as ''[[Life &amp; Death]]'' (1988).

In 2002, the [[Society for Simulation in Healthcare]] (SSH) was formed to become a leader in international interprofessional advances the application of medical simulation in healthcare&lt;ref name=Riley2008&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard H. Riley|title=Chapter 38: Society for Simulation in Healthcare by Raemer, Dan IN: Manual of Simulation in Healthcare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oABbAg2sjxYC&amp;pg=PA532|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920585-1|pages=532–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for a "uniform mechanism to educate, evaluate, and certify simulation instructors for the health care profession" was recognized by McGaghie et al. in their critical review of simulation-based medical education research.&lt;ref name=pmid20078756&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGaghie WC, Issenberg SB, Petrusa ER, Scalese RJ |title=A critical review of simulation-based medical education research: 2003-2009 |journal=Medical Education |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=50–63 |year=2010 |pmid=20078756 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03547.x |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03547.x |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the SSH piloted two new certifications to provide recognition to educators in an effort to meet this need.&lt;ref name=StruijkASPE2013&gt;{{cite journal |author=Struijk, Jennie |title=Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator (CHSE) – an update for ASPE |date=2013-04-11 |journal=Association of Standardized Patient Educators News |url=http://aspenews.org/2013/04/11/certified-healthcare-simulation-educator-chse-an-update-for-aspe/ |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern medical simulation==
The American Board of Emergency Medicine employs the use of medical simulation technology in order to accurately judge students by using "patient scenarios" during oral board examinations.&lt;ref name="academicResident" /&gt; However, these forms of simulation are a far cry from high [[fidelity]] models that have surfaced since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed K, Jawad M, Abboudi M, Gavazzi A, Darzi A, Athanasiou T, Vale J, Khan MS, Dasgupta P. Effectiveness of Procedural Simulation in Urology: A Systematic Review.  J Urol. 2011 May 13. {{PMID|21571338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that computer simulation technology is still relatively new with regard to flight and military simulators, there is still much research to be done about the best way to approach medical training through simulation, which continues to remain un-standardized although much more universally accepted and embraced by the medical community. That said, successful strides are being made in terms of medical education and training. Although amount of studies have shown that students engaged in medical simulation training have overall higher scores and retention rates than those trained through traditional means.&lt;ref name="academicResident" /&gt;

The Council of Residency Directors (CORD) has established the following recommendations for simulation&lt;ref name="academicResident" /&gt;
# Simulation is a useful tool for training residents and in ascertaining competency.  The core competencies most conducive to simulation-based training are patient care, interpersonal skills, and systems based practice.
# It is appropriate for performance assessment but there is a scarcity of evidence that supports the validity of simulation in the use for promotion or certification.
# There is a need for standardization and definition in using simulation to evaluate performance.
# Scenarios and tools should also be formatted and standardized such that EM educators can use the data and count on it for reproducibility, reliability and validity.

The [[Association of Surgeons in Training]] has produced recommendations for the introduction, availability and role of simulation in surgical training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milburn|first=J.A.|author2=Khera, G. |author3=Hornby, S.T. |author4=Malone, P.S.C. |author5= Fitzgerald, J.E.F. |title=Introduction, availability and role of simulation in surgical education and training: Review of current evidence and recommendations from the Association of Surgeons in Training|journal=International Journal of Surgery|year=2012|volume=10|issue=8|pages=393–398|doi=10.1016/j.ijsu.2012.05.005|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2012.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical Skills and Simulations Centers (CSSC) for Medical Simulation ==

The two main types of medical institutes train people in the latest medical simulations are medical schools and teaching hospitals. According to survey results from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) simulation content taught at medical schools are done throughout all four years of study while hospitals use simulations during the residency and subspecialty period. Internal medicine, emergency medicine, obstetrics / gynecology, pediatrics, surgery and anesthesiology are the most common areas taught in medical schools and hospitals.&lt;ref name=AAMC&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Passiment|first1=Morgan|last2=Sacks|first2=Heather|last3=Huang|first3=Grace|title=Medical Simulation in Medical Education: Results of an AAMC Survey|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The AAMC reported that there were six main types of facility location, centralized, decentralized, mobile units, other or a small mixture of centralized &amp; decentralized and centralized &amp; mobile. Most CSSC are owned by the facilities, 84% for medical schools and 90% for teaching hospitals, the majority of simulation centers where housed in a centralized location, 77% for medical schools and 59% for teaching hospitals.&lt;ref name=AAMC /&gt; Common medical school CSSC locations contain rooms for debriefs training/scenario, exam /standardized patient rooms, partial task trainer, offices, observation area, control room, class and storage. On average a medical schools CSSC can have around 27 rooms dedicated to training with simulations.&lt;ref name=AAMC /&gt;

The origins of [[debriefing]] can be traced back to the military, whereby upon return from a mission or war game exercise, participants were asked to gather as a group and recount what had happened.&lt;ref name=Pearson1986&gt;Pearson, M . &amp; Smith, D. (1986). Debriefing in experience-based learning. ''Simulation/Games for Learning'', 16, 155-172.&lt;/ref&gt; These gatherings had the primary intention of developing new strategies to use in future encounters; these gatherings also provided a learning opportunity for other members of the team who were not present at the events being debriefed.

In the field of [[psychology]], debriefing is used in the processing of traumatic events. Here, the emphasis is on the narrative; in a facilitator-led environment, participants reconstruct what happened and review facts, share reactions, and develop a shared meaning of the events. The aim is to reduce stress, accelerate normal recovery, and assist in both the cognitive and emotional processing of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, J.T. &amp; Everly, G.S. (1993). ''Critical incident stress debriefing: An operations manual for the prevention of traumatic stress among emergency services and disaster workers''. Ellicott City, MD: Chevron Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyregrov, A. (1989). Caring for helpers in disaster situations: Psychological debriefing. ''Disaster Management'', 2. 25-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all instances, debriefing is the process by which people who have gone through an experience are intentionally and thoughtfully led through a discussion of that experience.&lt;ref name=Lederman1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pearson1986 /&gt; Debriefing in simulation is a critical component of learning in simulation and is necessary to facilitate change “on an individual and systematic level”.&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013&gt;Sawyer, T. L., &amp; Deering, S. (2013). Adaptation of the US Army’s after-action review for simulation debriefing in healthcare. Simulation in Healthcare, 8(6), 388-397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dieckmann2009&gt;Dieckmann, P.,  Friis, S.M.,  Lippert, A.,  &amp; Østergaard, D. (2009). The art and science of debriefing in simulation: Ideal and practice, ''Medical Teacher'', 31(7), 287-294, DOI: 10.1080/01421590902866218&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|e287}} It draws from the above-mentioned forms of debriefing, but the emphasis here is on education. Debriefing in education can be described as a “facilitator-led participant discussion of events, reflection, and assimilation of activities into [participants’] cognitions [which] produce long-lasting learning”.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; More specific descriptions of debriefing can be found, such as the following in relation to debriefing in healthcare simulations, described by Cheng et al. (2014): “...a discussion between two or more individuals in which aspects of a performance are explored and analysed with the aim of gaining insights that impact the quality of future clinical practice”.&lt;ref name=Cheng2014 /&gt;{{rp|658}} Or another regarding debriefing in gaming, by Steinwachs (1992), “…a time to reflect on and discover together what happened during game play and what it all means."&lt;ref name="Steinwachs1992"/&gt;{{rp|187}}

===Debriefing in Medical Simulation===
Medical simulation is often defined as, “a technique (not a technology) to replace and amplify real life experiences with guided ones, often “immersive” in nature, that evoke or replicate substantial aspects of the real world in a fully interactive fashion”.&lt;ref name=Lateef2010&gt;Lateef, F. (2010). Simulation-based learning: Just like the real thing. ''Journal of Emergencies, Trauma, and Shock''. 3(4), 348-352.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition deliberately defines simulation as a technique and not a technology, implying that simulation is greater than the technology or tools which it adopts. Also note the use of the word ''guided'' in the definition, further implying that the interactions which occur in a simulated environment are not left solely to those persons immersed in the simulation, but that a “guide” also be present. This guide may be virtual in nature, such as prompts from a computer program, or may be physically present, in the form of an instructor or teacher. The human guide is often referred to as a “facilitator”.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007&gt;Fanning, R.M., &amp; Gaba, D.M. (2007). The role of debriefing in simulation-based learning. ''Simulation in Healthcare'', 2(2), 115-125. DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SIH.0b013e3180315539&lt;/ref&gt; It is this facilitator who guides the debriefing which occurs after a simulation scenario has completed.

Indeed, for simulation to be of value and for learning to occur, there must be “…instructional elements that help a learner explore, navigate or obtain more information about that system or environment [being simulated] that cannot generally be acquired from mere experimentation”.&lt;ref name=IS2017&gt;Instructional Simulation. (n.d.) In ''Wikipedia''. Retrieved July 3, 2017 from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_simulation&lt;/ref&gt; When these elements are present, the simulation is often referred to as “Instructional simulation,” “Educational simulation,”&lt;ref name=IS2017 /&gt; or “Simulation-based learning”.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; Favourable and statistically significant effects for nearly all knowledge and process skill outcomes when comparing simulation AND debriefing versus simulation with no intervention (in healthcare) has been shown.&lt;ref name=Cheng2014&gt;Cheng, A., Eppich, W., Grant, V., Sherbina, J., Zendejas, B., &amp; Cook, D. (2014). Debriefing for technology-enhanced simulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis. ''Medical Education'', 48, 657-666. DOI: 10.1111/medu.12432&lt;/ref&gt; When applied in a capacity to further professional development, simulation and debriefing may be referred to as “Simulation-based training”.&lt;ref name=Ziv2003&gt;Ziv, A., Wolpe, P.R., Small, S.D.,  &amp; Glick, S.

=== Simulation, Debriefing, &amp; Education Theory ===

[[Experiential learning]], which draws from prominent scholars such as [[John Dewey]], [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Carl Rogers]], amongst others,&lt;ref name=Kolb2005&gt;Kolb, A.Y. &amp; Kolb, D.A. (2005). Learning Styles and Learning Spaces: Enhancing Experiential Learning in Higher Education. ''Academy of Management &amp; Learning Education'', 4(2), 193-212.&lt;/ref&gt; underpins simulation-based learning.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lederman1992&gt;Lederman, L. C. (1992). Debriefing: Toward a systematic assessment of theory and practice. ''Simulation &amp; gaming,'' 23(2), 145-160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016&gt;Sawyer, T., Eppich, W., Grant, V., Brett-Fleegler, M., &amp; Cheng, A. (2016). More Than One Way to Debrief: A Critical Review of Healthcare Simulation Debriefing Methods. ''Simulation in Healthcare'', 11, 209-217. DOI: 10.1097/SIH.0000000000000148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011&gt;Zigmont, J. J., Kappus, L. J., &amp; Sudikoff, S. N. (2011, April). The 3D model of debriefing: defusing, discovering, and deepening. ''Seminars in perinatology,'' 35(2), 52-58. WB Saunders.&lt;/ref&gt; Often referred to as “learning by doing”,&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; or more broadly, a “theory of experience”,&lt;ref name=Dewey1938&gt;Dewey, J. (1938). ''Education and experience''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiential Learning Theory states that experience plays a central role in human learning &amp; development.&lt;ref name=Kolb2005 /&gt;
The six principles of Experiential Learning Theory align with educational simulation. The six principles are:
#	Engaging students in a process that enhances learning. This includes “feedback on the effectiveness of their learning efforts,” (p.&amp;nbsp;194) and focus on the process, not the outcome.
#	Students have prior beliefs and ideas. A process which draws these beliefs &amp; ideas out, with the intent of re-examining &amp; re-testing them against a topic in order to accommodate new ideas, will lead to learning.
#	Learning is a process which cycles between reflection and action, feeling and thinking. “Conflict, differences, and disagreement are what drive the learning process” (p.&amp;nbsp;194); the resolution of these is what leads to learning.
#	Learning happens in interactions between the person and the environment which surrounds them. 
#	Learning is more than cognition; it also involves thinking, feeling, perceiving, and behaving.
#	Learning is grounded in constructivist philosophy; “Learning is the process of creating knowledge”.&lt;ref name=Kolb2005 /&gt;{{rp|194}}

Simulation also aligns with Guided [[Discovery learning]]. Developed by [[Jerome Bruner]] in the 1960s, discovery learning also stems from the work of Jean Piaget and can be described as a learning environment where there is little to no instructor-guidance.&lt;ref name=Mayer2004&gt;Mayer, R. E. (2004). Should there be a three-strikes rule against pure discovery learning?. ''American psychologist,'' 59(1), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Guided discovery learning, on the other hand, continues to place learners in a discovery environment, but where an instructor is available to help guide learning via coaching, feedback, hints, and/or modeling.&lt;ref name=Mayer2004 /&gt;

Both Experiential &amp; Discovery Learning are based on constructivist philosophy.&lt;ref name=Kolb2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer2004 /&gt; Broadly, [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]] is based on the belief that learning is an active process whereby learners make sense of new knowledge by building upon their prior experiences; each person has a unique set of experiences which frame their interpretation of information.&lt;ref&gt;Fosnot, C. T., &amp; Perry, R. S. (1996). Constructivism: A psychological theory of learning. ''Constructivism: Theory, perspectives, and practice'', 2, 8-33. New York &amp; London: Teachers College Press, Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debriefing Frameworks===
While many models for debriefing exist, they all follow, at a minimum, a three-phase format.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lederman1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sawyer2016"/&gt; Debriefing models can be divided into two categories: the “Three-Phase Debriefing Structure,” and the “Multiphase Debriefing Structure”.&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;

==== Three-Phase Debriefing Structure ====
A benchmark in all forms of facilitator-guided, post-event debriefing conversational structures, the three conventional phases of debriefing are: description, analysis, and application.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015&gt;Jaye, P., Thomas, L., &amp; Reedy, G. (2015). ‘The Diamond’: a structure for simulation debrief. ''The Clinical Teacher'', 12, 171-175. DOI: 10.1111/tct.12300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; Frameworks which make use of the three-phase debriefing format include Debriefing with Good Judgment,&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt; the 3D Model,&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; the GAS model,&lt;ref name=Phrampus2013 /&gt; and Diamond Debrief.&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;

===== ''Description'' =====
Also labelled as “reaction,”&lt;ref name=Eppich2015&gt;Eppich, W., &amp; Cheng, A. (2015). Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation (PEARLS): Development and Rationale for a Blended Approach to Health Care Simulation Debriefing. ''Simulation in Healthcare'', 10, 106-115. DOI: 10.1097/SIH.0000000000000072&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013&gt;Kolbe, M., Weiss, M., Grote, G., Knauth, A., Dambach, M., Spahn, D.R., &amp; Grande, B. (2013). TeamGAINS: a tool for structured debriefings for simulation-based team trainings. ''BMJ Qual Saf'', 0, 1-13. DOI: 10.1136/bmjqs-2012-000917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006&gt;Rudolph, J., Simon, R., Dufresne, R. &amp; Raemer, D. (2006.) There’s no such thing as “nonjudgmental” debriefing: a theory and method for debriefing with good judgment. ''Simulation in Healthcare'', 1(1), 49-55.&lt;/ref&gt; "defusing,"&lt;ref name="Zigmont2011"/&gt; "gather,"&lt;ref name=Phrampus2013&gt;Phrampus, P. E., &amp; O’Donnell, J. M. (2013). Debriefing using a structured and supported approach. ''The comprehensive textbook of healthcare simulation,'' 73-84. Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and "identify what happened,"&lt;ref name="Sawyer2013"/&gt; the description phase of debriefing sees simulation participants describing and exploring their reactions, emotions, and overall impact of the experience.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;  It is the opening phase of systematic reflection, enabled by a facilitator who poses key questions such as:
*	“How did that feel?” 
*	“How did that go?” 
*	“Can you take us through the scenario as it unfolded?”&lt;ref name=Phrampus2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;
A facilitator is to keep asking these questions of the learners until they feel confident that all participants have voiced their understanding of the situation.&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt; The point of the description phase is to identify the impact of the experience, gain insights into what mattered to the participants throughout the simulation, and to establish a shared mental model of the events which occurred.&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lederman1992 /&gt; A debate in the healthcare simulation community exists regarding the exploration of feelings in the descriptive phase. One camp believes that the descriptive phase should allow an opportunity for participants to “blow off steam,” and release any tension which may have accumulated during the simulation scenario in order for learners to continue the debrief and subsequent reflection without pent-up emotion.&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; Others believe that the “venting” phase is not necessary and may explicitly make this statement in their debriefing models, or simply omit any reference to emotions or feelings at all.&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;

===== ''Analysis'' =====
The second phase of debriefing is often referred to as “analysis,”&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lederman1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Phrampus2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; "description,"&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt; or "discovering".&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; This is the phase in which the bulk of the time of debriefing is spent, with a focus on participant performance, rationales, &amp; frames.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt;  It is meant to be a time of reflective practice on what actually occurred during the scenario, and the reasons why events unfolded as they did.&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; The analysis phase uncovers the decision-making process behind observed actions.&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; Common questions posed, or statements made, by a facilitator during this phase include:
*	“Tell me about [insert performance/event here, i.e. teamwork] during the scenario.”&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;
*	“What went well? Why?”
*	“What made things challenging?”
*	“Why do you think that happened?”
Participant performance is a key component during the analysis phase. However, performance can often be a difficult topic to broach with participants, as criticism or constructive feedback often incur negative feelings. There exists a framework for questioning named “Advocacy-Inquiry,” or the “debriefing with good judgment” approach, which aims to reduce negative experiences in medical simulation debriefing.&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;

'''Advocacy Inquiry.''' The use of advocacy-inquiry (AI) questioning is highly encouraged by nearly all authors of debriefing models.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; Advocacy-inquiry consists of pairing “an assertion, observation, or statement” (advocacy), together with a question (inquiry), in order to elicit the mental frameworks – or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] – of both the facilitator and the participants.&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;{{rp|53}} In phrasing questions this way, participants are made aware of the facilitator’s own point of view in relation to the question being posed. Note that the use of AI is most encouraged when a facilitator has a judgment about something which was observed during the simulation scenario. Using AI eliminates the tone of judgment as well as the “guess what I’m thinking” which can occur when asking questions.

===== ''Application'' =====
The third and final phase of three-phase debriefing structures is most commonly referred to as “application,"&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt; or "summary".&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Phrampus2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt; Participants are asked to move any newly acquired insights and/or knowledge gained throughout the simulation experience forward to their daily activities or thought processes.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lederman1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; This includes learning which may have occurred during the previous phases in the debriefing process. Common questions posed, or statements made, by a facilitator during this phase include:
*	“What are you going to do differently in your practice tomorrow?”&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;
*	“What new insights have you gained?”
*	“What one thing will you commit to doing differently after this?”
Note that the summary here is not always in terms of re-stating the major points which were visited throughout the simulation &amp; debrief, but more so emphasize the greatest impact of learning. The summary may be done by either the facilitator or the participants – debriefing models differ in which they suggest. In the latter, the participants summarize what was of most value for them.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt; A summary by the facilitator consists of re-stating key learning points which occurred throughout the debrief.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;

==== Multi-Phase Debriefing Structure ====
While all debriefing models include the phases of the three-part debriefing structure, there are several with additional phases. These additions either explicitly call out specific features which may be included in the three-part debriefing model, such as reviewing learning objectives, or provide additional process recommendations, such as immediately re-practicing any skills involved in the original simulation scenario.&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt; Examples of multi-phase debriefing structures include the Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation (PEARLS) framework,&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt; TeamGAINS,&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt; and Healthcare Simulation After-Action Review (AAR).&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt;

=== Learning Objectives ===
As with any other educational initiative, [[learning objective]]s are of paramount importance in simulation and debriefing. Without learning objectives, simulations themselves and the subsequent debriefs are aimless, disorganized, and often dysfunctional. Most debriefing models explicitly make mention of stating learning objectives.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt;

The exploration of learning objectives ought to answer at least two questions: What competencies – knowledge, skills, and/or attitudes – are to be learned, and what specifically should be learned about them?&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; The method of debriefing chosen should align with learning objectives through evaluation of three points: performance domain – cognitive, technical, or behavioural; evidence for rationale – yes/no; and estimated length of time to address – short, moderate, or long.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;

Learning objectives may be predetermined and included in the development of a simulation scenario, or they may be emergent as the scenario unfolds.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; It can be challenging for the novice facilitator to adapt to emergent learning objectives, as the subsequent discussion may be purely exploratory in nature with no defined outcome. Conversely, the discussion may lead to a specific area of expertise which neither the facilitator nor participants are familiar with. In such situations, the facilitator and participants must be flexible and move on to the next objective, and follow-up with the debriefing of the emergent outcome at a later time.

=== Environment ===
The debriefing environment consists of two main features: the physical setting, as well as the psychological environment.

==== Physical setting ====
When choosing a space in which to debrief, one must consider whether the scenario which unfolded was a complex case. Complex cases usually involve heightened emotions, interdependent processes, and require more time spent debriefing. As such, it is recommended that these types of debriefings occur in a separate room from where the simulation scenario took place. This allows for a release of tension as participants move from one place to another and encounter new surroundings.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; Note, however, that it is important to remind participants not to begin debriefing during the walk to the new room. The momentum of the simulation leads participants to begin debriefing with one another as soon the scenario has finished.&lt;ref name=Steinwachs1992&gt;Steinwachs, B. (1992). How to facilitate a debriefing. ''Simulation &amp; Gaming'', 23(2), 186-195.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order to establish a shared mental model with all participants, debriefing must occur in a fashion whereby all participants can hear one another and have a chance to respond. This is difficult to accomplish while walking down a hallway, or in any disorganized fashion.

The location of the debriefing is ideally somewhere comfortable and conducive to conversation and reflection, where chairs can be maneuvered and manipulated.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt; It is recommended that, during the debriefing, the facilitator(s) and/or participants be seated in a circle.&lt;ref name=Steinwachs1992 /&gt; This is done so that everyone can see each other and increase group cohesion. Furthermore, the use of a circle implies equality amongst the group, and decreases any sense of hierarchy which may be present.

==== Psychological environment ====
Establishing psychological safety and a safe learning environment is of utmost importance within both the simulation and the debriefing period.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2014&gt;Rudolph, J.W., Raemer, D.B., &amp; Simon, R. (2014). Establishing a Safe Container for Learning in Simulation: The Role of Presimulation Briefing. ''Simulation in Healthcare'', 9, 339-349.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; As simulation participants often find the experience stressful and intimidating, worried about judgment from their peers and facilitator(s), establishing safety must be done from the outset of the simulation event.&lt;ref&gt;Savoldelli, G.L., Naik, V.N., Hamstra, S.J. &amp; Morgan, P.J. (2005). Barriers to the use of simulation-based education. ''Can J Anesth'', 52(9), 944-950. DOI: 10.1007/BF03022056&lt;/ref&gt; Note that psychological safety does not necessarily equate to comfort, but rather that participants “feel safe enough to embrace being uncomfortable…without the burden of feeling that they will be shamed, humiliated, or belittled”.&lt;ref name=Rudolph2014 /&gt;{{rp|340}}

It is recommended that establishing safety begin in the pre-brief phase&lt;ref name=Rudolph2014 /&gt; by alerting participants to the “basic assumption.” The basic assumption, derived from the [https://harvardmedsim.org/ Centre for Medical Simulation] at Harvard University (n.d.), is an agreed upon, predetermined mental model whereby everyone involved in the simulation &amp; debrief believe that all participants are intelligent, well-trained, want to do their best, and are participating to learn and promote development.&lt;ref name=Rudolph2008&gt;Rudolph, J., Simon, R., Raemer, D.B., &amp; Eppich, W. (2008). Debriefing as Formative Assessment: Closing Performance Gaps in Medical Education. ''Academic Emergency Medicine'', 15, 1010-1016. doi:10.1111/j.1553-2712.2008.00248.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; Additionally, Rudolph et al. (2014) have identified four principles to guide the formulation of a psychologically safe environment:
#	Communicate clear expectations
#	Establish a “fiction contract”
#	Attend to logistic details
#	Declare &amp; enact a commitment to respecting learners &amp; concern for their psychological safety&lt;ref name=Rudolph2014 /&gt;

Included in these principles is the notion of [[confidentiality]]. Explicitly reminding participants that their individual performance and debriefing reflections are not meant to be shared outside of the simulation event can help foster participation. Confidentiality builds trust by increasing transparency and allowing participants to practice without fear.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2014 /&gt;

===Evidence &amp; Further Study===
There exists a paucity of quantitative data regarding the effectiveness of debriefing in medical simulation,&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheng2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Raemer2011&gt;Raemer, D., Anderson, M., Cheng, A., Fanning, R., Nadkarni, V. &amp; Savoldelli, G. (2011). Research Regarding Debriefing as Part of the Learning Process. ''Simulation in Healthcare'', 6, S52-S57. DOI: 10.1097/SIH.0b013e31822724d0&lt;/ref&gt; despite Lederman’s 1992 seminal Model for the Systematic Assessment of Debriefing.&lt;ref name=Lederman1992 /&gt; Nearly every article reviewed had a cry for objective studies regarding the effectiveness of debriefing, whether it be comparing: the myriad options of conversational structures,&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; debriefing models,&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;  or the comprehensive 5 W’s of Who – debriefer, What – content &amp; methods, When – timing, Where – environment, and Why – theory.&lt;ref name=Raemer2011 /&gt;

Currently, there are critical limitations in the presentation of existing studies, a sparsity of research related to debriefing topics of importance, and debriefing characteristics are incompletely reported.&lt;ref name=Raemer2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheng2014 /&gt;  Recommendations for future debriefing studies include:
* Duration of debriefing
* Educator presence
* Educator characteristics
* Content of debriefing
* Structure &amp; method of debriefing
* Timing of debriefing&lt;ref name=Cheng2014 /&gt; 
and/or:
* Who: debriefer number &amp; characteristics
* What: the purpose of the debrief, formative vs summative assessment, individual vs team debriefing, method of debriefing, content covered, mechanics, etc.
* When: duration, post-event vs during-event vs delayed, etc.
* Where: in-situ, separate room, hospital, learning centre, etc.
* Why: theoretical underpinning of the debriefing model chosen &amp; rationale

Current research has found that simulation training with debriefing, when compared with no intervention, had favourable, statistically significant effects for nearly all outcomes: knowledge, process skill, time skills, product skills, behaviour process, behaviour time, and patient effects. When compared with other forms of instruction, simulation and debriefing showed small favourable effects for knowledge, time &amp; process outcomes, and moderate effects for satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Cheng2014 /&gt;

== Types of Simulations used in Medical Schools and Teaching Hospitals ==

There many different types of simulations that are used for training purposes. Some of the most known are the use of mannequins (referred to by the simulation company METI as Human Patient Simulators, or HPS for short) and standardized patients.

As seen in the chart titled "Types of Simulation Used in Medical Education" retrieved from the AAMC article, medical schools are leading the way when it comes to the use of standardized patients, but teaching hospitals and medical schools are close when it comes to full-scale mannequins and partial task trainers.

== Medical Simulation Efficiency in Education ==

According to a study conducted by Bjorn Hoffman, to find the level of efficiency of simulation based medical training in a hi-tech health care setting, "simulation's ability to address skilful device handling as well as purposive aspects of technology provides a potential for effective and efficient learning."&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;{{cite web|title=Why simulation can be efficient: on the preconditions of efficient learning in complex technology based practices|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1472-6920-9-48.pdf|website=BioMedCentral|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More positive information is found in the article entitled, "The role of medical simulation: an overview," by Kevin Kunler. Kunkler states that, "medical simulators can be useful tools in determining a physician's understanding and use of best practices, management of patient complications, appropriate use of instruments and tools, and overall competence in performing procedures."&lt;ref name=Kunkler&gt;{{cite web|title=The role of medical simulation: an overview|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rcs.101/pdf|website=WileyOnlineLibrary|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
The main purpose of medical simulation is to properly educate students in various fields through the use of high technology simulators. According to the Institute of Medicine, 44,000 to 98,000 deaths annually are recorded due primarily to medical mistakes during treatment.&lt;ref name="medicalMistakes"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Institute of Medicine (IOM)|title=To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System|year= 2000|url= http://www.nap.edu/books/0309068371/html/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other statistics include:
* 225,000 deaths annually from medical error including 106,000 deaths due to "nonerror adverse events of medications"&lt;ref name="medicalMistakes2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Barbara |last=Starfield, MD, MPH|title=Is US Health Really the Best in the World?|website= jama.ama-assn.org|volume= 284, No. 4|date= July 26, 2000|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/issues/v284n4/ffull/jco00061.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7,391 deaths resulted from medication errors

If 44,000 to 98,000 deaths are the direct result of medical mistakes, and the CDC reported in 1999 that roughly 2.4 million people died in the United States, the medical mistakes estimate represents 1.8% to 4.0% of all deaths, respectively.&lt;ref name="wrongDiagnosis"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Common Are Medical Mistakes|year=2008|accessdate= November 30, 2008|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/mistakes/common.htm|website=wrongdiagnosis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A near 5% representation of deaths primarily related to medical mistakes is simply unacceptable in the world of medicine. Anything that can assist in bringing this number down is highly recommended and medical simulation has proven to be the key assistant.

===Advantages===
Studies have shown that students perform better and have higher retention rates than colleagues under strict traditional methods of medical training. The table below shows the results of tests given to 20 students using highly advanced medical simulation training materials and others given traditional paper based tests. It was found that high technology learning students outperformed traditional students significantly.&lt;ref name="studiesTable"&gt;Kincaid, Bala, et al. (2001), IST-TR-01-06.

In addition to overall better scores for medical students, several other distinct advantages exist not specifically related to training.
* Less costly
* Time efficient
* Less personnel required
* Many automated processes
* Ability to store performance history
* Track global statistics for many linked medical simulators
* Less medical related accidents

==Military and emergency response==
One of the single largest proponents behind simulators has always been the United States government. Billions (and perhaps trillions, at this point) of dollars have been spent in the name of advancing simulators for space exploration, computer advancements, medical and military training, and other projects funded for research by the government. The Department of Defense (most notably, the Army) is one of the largest fund producers for simulation research, training, and support. As such, most simulators tend to be created for military purposes including soldier, tank, and flight training in combat situations. In terms of medical simulation, military applications have played a large part in its success and funding. Some examples of scenarios useful for medical applications include casualty assessment, war trauma response, emergency evacuations, training for communications between teams, team/individual after action assessment, and scenario recreation from recorded data. Medical simulation of combat trauma through the use of [[moulage]] applied to soldiers, dummies or fake body parts to emulate casualties, helps to provide a realistic combat environment while having the benefit of lessening psychological trauma and PTSD when exposed to the real thing.

| &lt;center&gt;This network-based application, which is physiologically similar to the HPS, models and queues casualties to be treated when an HPS is available&lt;/center&gt;
|}

The Combat Trauma Patient Simulation Program is perhaps the largest in terms of processes and people involved at any given time. According to Kincaid, Donovan, and Pettitt, the CTPS program has been created in order to assess and analyze the feasibility of simulation in a battlefield environment.&lt;ref name="emergencyJournal"&gt;Kincaid, J.P., Donovan, J., &amp; Pettitt, B. (2003). Simulation Techniques for Training Emergency Response. International Journal of Emergency Management.&lt;/ref&gt; Combat casualties, massively destructive outbreaks, chemical spills, gas leaks, and other forms of large scale negative events can be accurately simulated in a safe, inexpensive, and relatively small environment.&lt;ref name="handsOnMedic"&gt;Jaganathan, B., Kincaid, J.P., &amp; Kimrey, S. (2002). Interoperable Surgical Simulation: Hands-on Medic Training for Common Battlefield Scenarios.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the rather large advantages to such a massive simulation of intertwining processes is the fact that people ranging from the field medics all the way up to the hospitals located in key military bases receive proper training for potential casualty prevention. The process of simulation begins with the Point of Injury and leads into Casualty Collection Points, Ground Medical Evacuations, Medical Aid Stations, and finally Hospitals.&lt;ref name="emergencyJournal" /&gt; Another advantage is that all casualties can be monitored through high-tech computer software and GPS receivers located in medical vehicles and in key medical clothing. By monitoring such data, leaders can be aware of which areas in the flow needs to be sped up, slowed down, moved to a different format, or removed completely. The flow between the Point of Injury and Hospital is required to be uninterrupted if a successful goal is to be met.

Live field exercises are another benefit of the CTPS program. By allowing many individuals to engage in a "live fire" simulation, people can become acquainted with the processes involved in transferring duties among teammates in order to keep the flow moving between locations. While there is the chance of these simulations not inspiring true dedication into the actions of some participants because it is not necessarily a real disaster, the truly dedicated individuals will shine in their ability to remedy the destruction. Leaders can spot weaknesses and strengths in the participants of the simulation without worrying about every single piece of the simulation. In a real disaster, leaders would need to concentrate on individual success, team success, and overall progression. Alternatively, in a simulation of exactly the same event, the leaders could ignore certain areas in order to concentrate on the individuals involved in order to analyze weaknesses.  Overall, the CTPS program is beneficial to everyone involved due to cost savings, risk reduction, personnel safety, enhanced effectiveness, and reduction of the learning curves.

CTPS contains many different technologies and smaller simulations within the rather gigantic "mother" simulation. Because the smaller simulations are potentially developed by separate companies (at times even competing companies), the interfaces have the high chance of being non-communicative or are simply incompatible without some sort of translation between the competing interfaces. All of this integration is made possible through a highly researched and deeply developed High Level Architecture containing interface modules to link up incompatible parts of the complete CTPS process.&lt;ref name="HLA"&gt;Petty, M. D., Windyga, P. S. (1999). A High Level Architecture-based Medical Simulation System. SIMULATION, 73, 281-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The simulation federates (subsystems) of the CTPS involves the Lockheed Martin MILES system, the Operational Requirements-based Casualty Assessment system (ORCA), the Jackson Medical Simulation library (JMSL), and the Human Patient Simulator (HPS).&lt;ref name="emergencyJournal" /&gt; By combining these systems together, trainees can be contained to their respective areas of study while also studying the possible hindrances between stages of transition.

Beginning the military casualty treatment simulation is the MILES engagement simulator, which accurately simulates gunfire and other combat engagements.&lt;ref name="miles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Miles Shootback Device (MSD)|year=2008|accessdate=November 30, 2008|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/products/MILESShootbackDevice/index.html|website=lockheedmartin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miles2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES XXI) |year=2008 |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/products/MultipleIntegratedLaserEngagement/index.html |website=lockheedmartin.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006114119/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/products/MultipleIntegratedLaserEngagement/index.html |archivedate=October 6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When trainees under the simulated engagement system fire upon each other and register virtual hits, the simulated casualties are moved to the next stage.&lt;ref name="miles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miles2" /&gt; At first glance, this system may seem similar to entertainment driven laser tag centers found within urban cities of the United States. But after a deeper look, the overall training that a user would go through involves much more than pointing, shooting, and laughing at the outcome. Proper combat procedures can be taught to single users, team based squads, or larger squads. Obvious advantages to this approach include reductions in physical harm to trainees, increase in physical realism by tagging individuals as "dead," and providing immediate feedback to users who score a hit. While the MILES training system is not necessarily a medically based simulation; however, it is completely necessary to begin the process into medical procedures. Without proper combat engagement, realistic casualties and injuries cannot be simulated and cannot be transferred into the beginning medical stages in a manner that would provide meaning to a medical trainee.&lt;ref name="HLA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miles2" /&gt;

The next stage involves casualty assessment based on results driven by simulated engagements under the MILES system. Any and all casualties are transferred to the ORCA stage, given initial wound assessments, put into an initial medical state (severe, critical, dead), and finally passed on to the JMSL. Under the JMSL, all casualties generated by MILES and assessed initially by ORCA are sent through transition phases in order to accurately simulate a casualty progressing to a more and more deadly state while awaiting treatment under average circumstances.&lt;ref name="HLA" /&gt;

After casualties have been generated, processed, and sent through various stages, actual training under a medic or doctor can be attained through the HPS. By using a physiologically realistic test dummy, users can treat a patient and receive immediate, accurate feedback regarding the results. Using this approach, users can engage in proper medical training as if a live patient was being used without subjecting the patient to physical harm in the case of accidents. From a financial standpoint, the entire system offers a cheaper alternative to throwing untrained medics into a potentially hazardous and live situation. On the job training simply does not cut it when it comes to lives and equipment on the line.&lt;ref name="HLA" /&gt;

===In the classroom===
There are many other medical systems that exist in forms other than "live fire" and "on the field" exercises. Simulation-Based Medical Education is one form that allows students to learn for educational purposes in a classroom. SBME works well with all forms of classroom learning such as lectures, problem solving, in hospital teaching, and other traditional forms of education.&lt;ref name="medEd"&gt;Ziv, A., Ben-David, S., &amp; Ziv, M. (2005). Simulation Based Medical Education: an opportunity to learn from errors. Medical Teacher, 27, 193-199.&lt;/ref&gt; Several advantages appear while using this approach such as patient safety, higher knowledge retaining, teamwork, competence, and skill at the bedside.

One of the most prominent versions of SBME that stands out is Adobe Flash based medical simulations and animations. While textbooks are sufficient for certain diagrams and process flow explanations, certain high quality animations created in Adobe Flash are extremely beneficial when it comes to learning. Some of the advantages to Flash-based medical simulations and animations include a visually animated representation of blood flow within a body or other physiological processes occurring within the body that would otherwise seem awkward or impossible to understand through static images. A rather annoying disadvantage to these animated approaches stems from the fact that they are extremely costly to create in terms of time and money. Some of the better animations require teams of people equal in size to major movie productions when it comes to after effects.

The newest progression of medical simulation, is the application of simulation to the medical operations, patient care and clinical sectors of medicine.  This evolution, can be seen with respect to the application of holographic simulation within the area of Virtual Health (VH), most known as telehealth with holographic simulation capability integrated into the delivery of healthcare through health information technologies to remote locations where medical care is not readily available.  As described earlier regarding medical simulation in general, the operational, patient care and clinical use of simulation will most likely travel the same road of acceptance and integration into the medical community.  Additional capabilities are expected to help drive this use of simulation to become common, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), and unmanned medical platforms. The recent introduction of virtual-reality surgical simulators is also gaining ground amongst high quality medical simulator tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Papagiannakis|first=George|title=Psychomotor Surgical Training in Virtual Reality|date=2018|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-64177-5_41|work=The Adult Hip - Master Case Series and Techniques|pages=827–830|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319641751|access-date=2018-08-27|last2=Trahanias|first2=Panos|last3=Kenanidis|first3=Eustathios|last4=Tsiridis|first4=Eleftherios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6955">'''Modern studies''' is a subject unique to the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish secondary school curriculum|secondary school curriculum]]. The focus of Modern Studies is to develop learners' knowledge and understanding of contemporary political and social issues in local, Scottish, United Kingdom and international contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/45629.html|title=SQA|last=resources@sqa.org.uk|first=Scottish Qualifications Authority, Resource Management,|website=www.sqa.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Studies is offered both at National Qualification level and also in the Broad General Education stage of Scottish education. Pupils in primary school and up to S3 in secondary school have the opportunity to study Modern Studies concepts through the 'People in Society, Economy and Business' area of the broader Social Studies Curriculum for Excellence experiences and outcomes. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.scot/Documents/social-studies-eo.pdf|title=Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes|last=|first=|date=|website=Education Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Senior Phase, Modern Studies is offered as a discrete subject. Ray Gunnion, history teacher in Brannock High School until 2004, was largely involved in introducing Modern Studies into the Scottish Education system as he felt it was a valuable subject for kids in Scotland.

== The Value of a Modern Studies Course ==
Modern Studies helps you develop knowledge and understanding of the processes that determine political, social and economic life. These processes are studied locally, nationally and internationally.

Modern Studies helps you develop important skills. For example you will become better at critically evaluating information, analysing complex sources and report writing. In some instances, the skills involved in using information technology will also be developed.

Together, the knowledge you acquire and the skills you develop will allow you to become a more informed individual, able to participate more effectively in society in a more tolerant and responsible manner.

== Study Themes ==
Common study themes exist across Modern Studies qualifications, from Broad General Education to Senior Phase.

=== Democracy in the UK ===
Pupils are given the opportunity to learn about the democratic processes of the United Kingdom with a focus on either UK democracy or Scottish democracy.  This includes examining rights and responsibilities, the political process, participation and representation at various levels.

=== Social Issues ===
Pupils examine social issues in society using sociological processes.  The focus of this unit is either Social Inequality or Crime and the Law.

A focus on social inequalities would examine issues of health, education, income and wealth inequalities in the UK by studying selected groups such as the unemployed, working poor, women, children, the elderly, [[LGBT|LBGT]]* people, [[Black and Minority Ethnic|BME]] people and others.

A focus on Crime and the Law would explore the types of crime committed in the UK, the sociological and individualistic theories of the causes of crime, the impact of crime and attempts to tackle crime.  The unit would examine the role of the criminal justice system, the police and the government.

=== International Issues ===
The International Issues unit is intended to broaden the scope of pupils' experiences to international contexts.  The focus of this unit will examine either a World Power or a World Issue.

A focus on a World Power will consist of a socioeconomic and political study of a [[G20]] country (excluding the United Kingdom).  This focus will be on the country's constitutional arrangements and opportunities for participation, the nature of recent socioeconomic issues and attempts to revolve them and the international influence of the world power.

A focus on a World Issue would put in the spotlight a contemporary significant conflict or issue which extends beyond the borders of a single country and has had impacts regionally or globally.  Examples of areas of study in this area would be [[terrorism]] or the [[Syrian Civil War]].  A study of a world issue would focus on the causes of, the impacts of and attempts to resolve the issue.

==The Primary Curriculum==

All schools in Scotland follow the 3-18 Curriculum for Excellence. Modern Studies is not offered as a discrete subject at primary school level, rather, it is delivered within the integrated Social Studies curricular area (which also encompasses history and geography themes).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the early, first and second stages (P1-P7); pupils are introduced to social studies key themes and are encouraged to develop analytical and evaluative skills.

==In S1, S2 &amp; S3==
Each school has the freedom to develop a course to suit the needs and interests of both pupils and teachers within the parameters of the Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes.

==National Qualifications==
Modern Studies is offered at National 3, 4 &amp; 5 levels and at Higher and Advanced Higher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is scope for a great deal of personalisation and choice across the NQ levels within the Course Assessment Specification. There are three areas of study and within these areas, teachers have the opportunity to teach a number of combinations of topic; these are:
* Democracy in Scotland and the UK:
** Democracy in Scotland OR
** Democracy in the United Kingdom
* Social Issues
** Social Inequality OR
** Crime and the Law
* International Issues
** World Power OR
** World Issue
At Advanced Higher level, there is a greater emphasis on depth of knowledge and so, one area of study is chosen from: Political Issues OR Law and Order OR Social Inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Studies Advanced Higher Course Assessment Specification|last=|first=|publisher=SQA|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each level above National 3, there also exists the requirement for pupils to complete an independent research project under the supervision of their teacher.  This project makes up some of the final overall award.

==University==

Modern Studies does not exist as a separate subject at [[University]] level though it is a sound basis for further study of a range of subjects from which Modern Studies is composed, such as Crime and the Law, [[Politics]], [[International Relations]], [[Sociology]], [[Criminology]], [[Economics]], [[Social Policy]] and [[Public Policy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14894">Naphthalene poisoning (or mothball poisoning) is a form of poisoning that occurs when [[naphthalene]] is ingested. Severe poisoning can result in [[Hemolytic anemia|haemolytic anaemia.]]{{cn|date=November 2018}} Naphthalene was introduced in 1841 by Rossbach as as an antiseptic to counteract [[typhoid fever]]. Although naphthalene was widely used industrially, only 9 cases of poisoning were reported since 1947, as a result, the condition was had limited coverage within medical journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gidron|first=E.|last2=Leurer|first2=J.|date=1956|title=NAPHTHALENE POISONING|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673656911527|journal=The Lancet|volume=267|issue=6910|pages=228–230|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(56)91152-7|issn=0140-6736|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of Exposure ==
Until the late 1950s coal tar was the principal source of naphthalene. In 1981-83 the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found numbers over 100,000 workers were potentially exposed to toxic levels of naphthalene, working primarily for major industrial and agricultural businesses. Exposure may often be a result of oral ingestion, inhalation, or through prolonged skin exposure.

===Industrial chemistry===
Naphthalene is a precursor in the production of [[phthalic anhydride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jia|first=Chunrong|last2=Batterman|first2=Stuart|last3=Jia|first3=Chunrong|last4=Batterman|first4=Stuart|date=2010-07-20|title=A Critical Review of Naphthalene Sources and Exposures Relevant to Indoor and Outdoor Air|url=https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/7/7/2903|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|language=en|volume=7|issue=7|pages=2903–2939|doi=10.3390/ijerph7072903|pmc=2922736|pmid=20717549}}&lt;/ref&gt; This application has been displaced by alternative technologies.

===Mothballs===
[[Naphthalene]] is a major component of some [[mothball]]s.  It repels moths as well as some animals.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Since mothballs that contain naphthalene are considered hazards, safer alternatives have been developed, such as the use of [[1,4-Dichlorobenzene|1,4-dichlorobenzene]], however, 1,4-dichlorobenzene has been delcared as a potential neurotoxin. 1,4-dichlorobenzene has been linked to potentially causing depression as a form of encephalopathy. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Suzanne B.|last2=Dwight-Johnson|first2=Megan|last3=Levy|first3=Mitchell R.|date=2010|title=Mothball induced encephalopathy presenting as depression: it's all in the history|journal=General Hospital Psychiatry|volume=32|issue=3|pages=341.e7–341.e9|doi=10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2009.04.008|pmid=20430245|issn=0163-8343}}&lt;/ref&gt; This complication resulted with an increased use of Camphor as a moth repellent. [[Camphor]] is frequently used in place of naphthalene in Asia.

====Regulation====
The European Union enforced a ban on the distribution and production of mothballs containing naphthalene in 2008, as a part of the new regulations of the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH), regulating chemical use within its representative countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3463893/Holy-straight-bananas-now-the-Eurocrats-are-banning-moth-balls.html|title=Holy straight bananas – now the Eurocrats are banning moth balls|last=Reporter|first=Andrew Alderson, Chief|date=2008-11-15|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, New Zealand banned the distribution of mothballs after the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=11267602|title=Mothballs banned due to toxic risk|date=2014-06-04|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothballs are restricted within Australia, only being distributed in forms that prevent them from being ingested.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-02-national-mothballs-naphthalene-brain-babies.html|title=National ban on mothballs containing naphthalene may prevent brain damage in babies|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tobacco===
Tobacco is also a source of exposure, creating an estimated range of 0.3 to 4 micrograms of naphthalene inhalation per cigarette that is consumed. A regular pack a day smoker on average would be inhaling amounts of 6-80 micrograms of naphthalene daily, which is a small and negligible amount of naphthalene, and is similar in magnitude to normal exposure near highways and areas where car exhaust is frequently inhaled or consumed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Paul S.|last2=Jayjock|first2=Michael A.|date=2008|title=Available data on naphthalene exposures: Strengths and limitations|journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|volume=51|issue=2|pages=15–21|doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2007.10.010|pmid=18078699|issn=0273-2300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The napthalene within cigarettes is different to other sources of naphthalene. The naphthalene that is produced in cigarette smoke is bound to other particles and is not presented as a free vapour, meaning the exposure is small. Napthalene exposure is usually insignificant unless exposed to large amounts of naphthalene within production or being near proximity of a product that contains naphthalene. Naphthalene levels within an area are very unstable and frequently change over time and space. Due to this variance, sampling protocols must be conducted carefully and are usually analysed using different analytical methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Natural occurrence===
Naphthalene has also been found to be secreted by [[Termite|termites]] in order to protect their nests. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-08-09|title=Correction|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/548141a|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt;The termites use naphthalene to repel ants and any intruders who try to invade their nests. This naphthalene produced is not only toxic for the insects but can also affect humans in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jian|last2=Henderson|first2=Gregg|last3=Grimm|first3=Casey C.|last4=Lloyd|first4=Steven W.|last5=Laine|first5=Roger A.|date=1998|title=Naphthalene in Formosan Subterranean Termite Carton Nests|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|language=en|volume=46|issue=6|pages=2337–2339|doi=10.1021/jf9709717|issn=0021-8561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naphthalene poisoning via termite nest was featured within "''The Truth"'' , episode eleven of season one of the American television medical drama House'','' where the final diagnosis ended up as acute naphthalene poisoning as a result of a termite nest being contained within the walls of the patients room, inhaling naphthalene in his sleep and becoming sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sciencing.com/naphthalene-poisoning-termites-6522077.html|title=Naphthalene Poisoning and Termites|website=Sciencing|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment of naphthalene toxicity usually follows the same treatments involved for haemolytic anaemia, which involves a series of blood transfusions, in order to restore healthy levels of haemoglobin. This may include intravenous methylene blue and ascorbic acid. The methylene blue allows the methaemoglobin to be converted to haemoglobin. Supportive treatment is also usually provided, depending on the severity of the toxicity, that resulted in the anaemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kundra|first=Tanveer Singh|date=2015|title=Naphthalene Poisoning following Ingestion of Mothballs: A Case Report|url=https://jcdr.net/article_fulltext.asp?issn=0973-709x&amp;year=2015&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=8&amp;page=UD01&amp;issn=0973-709x&amp;id=6274|journal=Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research|volume=9|issue=8|pages=UD01–2|language=en|doi=10.7860/jcdr/2015/15503.6274|issn=2249-782X|pmc=4576617|pmid=26436023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ascorbic acid is used to treat methemoglobinemia, a symptom of naphthalene poisoning and is used when methylene blue is not available, or in conjunction with methylene blue in order to restore haemoglobin count.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahu|first=Kamal Kant|last2=Dhibar|first2=Deba Prasad|last3=Gautam|first3=Archana|last4=Kumar|first4=Yogeesh|last5=Varma|first5=Subhash Chander|date=2016|title=Role of ascorbic acid in the treatment of methemoglobinemia|journal=Turkish Journal of Emergency Medicine|volume=16|issue=3|pages=119–120|doi=10.1016/j.tjem.2016.07.003|issn=2452-2473|pmc=5103054|pmid=27857990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms of toxicity ==
According to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], naphthalene is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+184|title=NAPHTHALENE - National Library of Medicine HSDB Database|website=toxnet.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol82/82-06.html|title=NAPHTHALENE (IARC Summary &amp; Evaluation, Volume 82, 2002)|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as there is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of naphthalene, however there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of naphthalene. The carcinogenicity was tested on rats in mice, via intraperitoneal administration and subcutaneous administration, of newborns and adult rats, providing evidence of tumours. The IARC also discovered that naphthalene toxicity also had potential to cause cataracts in humans, rats, rabbits and mice, however the tests were considered inefficient to substantiate a diagnosis resulting in naphthalene as a potential carcinogen classification. Likewise, the [[European Chemicals Agency|European Chemical agency]] classified naphthalene as Group C, a possible human carcinogen. This was classified due to lack of evidence of naphthalene alone causing carcinogenic properties in rats, and limited human contact with naphthalene within industrial environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/naphthalene.pdf|title=Naphthalene|last=|first=|date=2000|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haemolysis occurs either through haemoglobin defects, such as formation of [[Heinz body|Heinz bodies]], or cell membrance defects, especially those with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] and a low tolerance to oxidative stress. This haemolysis is usually accompanied by neurological effects such as vertigo, lethargy and convulsions, usually caused by cerebral edema. Gastrointentinal bleeding may also appear as a symptom after ingestion of mothballs, especially for those who are younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamalai|first=Karthick C|last2=Shrikiran|first2=A|last3=Mundkur|first3=Suneel C|last4=Chaitanya Varma|first4=PV|date=2012|title=Acute naphthalene toxicity presenting with metabolic acidosis: a rare complication|journal=Journal of Acute Disease|volume=1|issue=1|pages=75–76|doi=10.1016/s2221-6189(13)60018-9|issn=2221-6189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acute exposure to naphthalene is unlikely to cause toxicity and must be ingested unless prolonged contact is provided along the skin or eyes. After ingestion of mothballs containing naphthalene, symptoms of haemolytic anaemia are presented and treated normally through the use of methylene blue and regular blood transfusions, and patients are usually released after 6-10 days depending on their haemoglobin levels.

Repeated naphthalene exposure has also been found to potentially cause airway epithelial damage, aberrant repair, and inflammation. Greater numbers of peribronchial Mac-3-positive macrophages and CD3-positive T-cells were observed throughout the airways which displays acute inflammation within the airways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aoshiba|first=Kazutetsu|last2=Tsuji|first2=Takao|last3=Itoh|first3=Masayuki|last4=Semba|first4=Seitaro|last5=Yamaguchi|first5=Kazuhiro|last6=Nakamura|first6=Hiroyuki|last7=Watanabe|first7=Hidehiro|date=2014|title=A murine model of airway fibrosis induced by repeated naphthalene exposure|journal=Experimental and Toxicologic Pathology|volume=66|issue=4|pages=169–177|doi=10.1016/j.etp.2014.01.001|pmid=24480153|issn=0940-2993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naphthalene metabolites of 1,2-hydroxynaphthalene has also been found to be a mechanism of oxidative DNA damage within humans. In the presence of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohnishi|first=Shiho|last2=Hiraku|first2=Yusuke|last3=Hasegawa|first3=Keishi|last4=Hirakawa|first4=Kazutaka|last5=Oikawa|first5=Shinji|last6=Murata|first6=Mariko|last7=Kawanishi|first7=Shosuke|date=2018-03-01|title=Mechanism of oxidative DNA damage induced by metabolites of carcinogenic naphthalene|journal=Mutation Research/Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis|volume=827|pages=42–49|doi=10.1016/j.mrgentox.2018.01.005|pmid=29502736|issn=1383-5718}}&lt;/ref&gt;The damaging activity of the DNA of the activity of 1,2-hydroxynaphthalene was observed at much larger levels. 1,2-hydroxynaphthalene is reduced by NADH to be formed as a part of the redox cycle, resulting in the speeding up of DNA damage, however, this is only presented within larger prolonged exposure to naphthalene, values that are unrealistic for any individual not working near a place where naphthalene production occurs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Biomarkers of excessive exposure ===
1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene has been used as a potential biomarker of excessive exposure to naphthalene levels and was tested on smokers and those exposed to naphthalene among the working population. After collecting the urine samples of multiple workers, Median 1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene values were 1012 micrograms per litre for those exposed to naphthalene and 8 micrograms per litre for those who were in the control group indicating that it is useful as a biomarker for exposure within humans. The median results for the concentrations of 1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene were about ten times the amount of the standard markers of 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol within human urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klotz|first=Katrin|last2=Angerer|first2=Jürgen|date=2016|title=Quantification of naphthoquinone mercapturic acids in urine as biomarkers of naphthalene exposure|journal=Journal of Chromatography B|volume=1012-1013|pages=89–96|doi=10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.12.052|pmid=26812176|issn=1570-0232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klotz|first=Katrin|last2=Schindler|first2=Birgit Karin|last3=Angerer|first3=Jürgen|date=2011|title=1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene as biomarker for a naphthalene exposure in humans|journal=International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health|volume=214|issue=2|pages=110–114|doi=10.1016/j.ijheh.2010.11.003|pmid=21147027|issn=1438-4639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Coding Week''' was founded by former headteacher [[Richard Rolfe]] and tech entrepreneur Jordan Love, who was appointed EU Code Week Ambassador for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Love|first1=Jordan|title='DIGITAL JERSEY HUB RESIDENT APPOINTED AS EU CODE WEEK AMBASSADOR'|url=https://www.digital.je/news/eucodeweekambassador|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Digital Jersey|publisher=Digital Jersey|date=16 September 2014|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took place during the week commencing September 21, 2014 with the aim of helping adults to improve their digital literacy  in order to fill the growing skills gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bateman|first1=Kayleigh|title='Training firm Codex DLD launches National Coding Week for Adults'|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240227952/Training-firm-Codex-DLD-launches-National-Coding-Week-for-Adults|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Computer Weekly|publisher=TechTarget|date=2 September 2014|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The week is run by volunteers in hubs, libraries, schools, businesses and NGOs with the intention of supporting adults to learn digital skills including coding. [[Richard Rolfe]] and Jordan Love were inspired to create the week when they trained a group of unemployed people in coding skills which eventually led to many of them getting jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Training course for coders launched'|url=https://www.gov.je/News/2014/Pages/CodingTrainingCourse.aspx|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Gov.je|publisher=Government of Jersey|date=28 March 2014|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU predicts a significant number of digital jobs being unfilled by 2020 due to a skills shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs'|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/grand-coalition-digital-jobs-0|website=DIGITAL AGENDA FOR EUROPE|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 February 2016|ref=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard and Jordan saw an opportunity to try to inspire adults to gain the skills necessary to fill the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Coding Week|url=http://www.bailiwickexpress.com/jsy/business/national-coding-week/#.VrcrA_mLTIU|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Bailiwick Express|publisher=Bailiwick Express|date=22 September 2014|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2015 National Coding Week ran from 21 September and spread beyond the UK. The week gained coverage and support in the EU and in the US. 
A  number of  prominent business leaders offered support to National Coding Week including Brian Doll VP of GitHub,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=STYLES|first1=KIRSTY|title='Q&amp;A: National Coding Week with Github'|url=http://techcitynews.com/2015/09/24/qa-national-coding-week-with-github/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Tech City News|agency=Tech City Ventures Ltd.|publisher=Publishing Group|date=24 September 2015|ref=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Andrew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Code club: the interview'|url=https://twitter.com/TheDukeOfYork/status/646324359037100033|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=7 February 2016|ref=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Kevin|title='It's National Coding Week!'|url=https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/646038102985850880|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=7 February 2016|ref=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 
[[Tim Lovejoy]].

[[Boris Johnson]] the Mayor of London stated that “Coding is a language that is increasingly important for both young people and adults to understand, but it can be an intimidating prospect. National Coding Week will help to make whole generations of Brits more comfortable with coding, allowing them to embrace the business opportunities of the future.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='National Coding Week aims at adult learners'|url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/design/legislation/national-coding-week-aims-adult-learners-2015-09/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Electronics Weekly|publisher=Electronics Weekly|date=8 September 2015|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aims of the week was to also encourage women to get involved in coding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Atcheson|first1=Sheree|title='National Coding Week - A Great Opportunity to Reflect on the State of Play for Women in Tech'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/sheree-atcheson/national-coding-week_b_8170292.html|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Huffington Post Tech|publisher=Huffington Post|date=22 September 2015|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martha Lane Fox’s drive to bridge the gender gap in tech gave prominence  to the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Card|first1=Jon|title='Gender imbalance in tech sector must change for startups to thrive'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/apr/13/gender-imbalance-tech-sector-martha-lane-fox|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=13 April 2015|ref=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 events and 1000 people took part in 2015. Events occurred all over Wales in libraries and hubs and was supported by [[WEA YMCA Community College Cymru]] and the [[Welsh Government]]

Speaking at the launch event in [[Cardiff Central Library]] Hub’s new digital floor, the Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism, [[Ken Skates]], said “Learning new skills such as coding can open new doors to people. We are increasingly moving into an online world and it is important that people do not miss out on opportunities to develop these skills, which have the potential to create employment opportunities. I’m delighted to launch the National Coding Week in Wales and am pleased this is taking place in a library, which is the ideal place to get support to learn new skills. It’s particularly good to launch it in the new digital floor of Cardiff Central Library, which received a grant from the Welsh Government towards its modernisation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Developing Wales as a nation of Coders'|url=http://www.weacymru.org.uk/en/news/109/0/developing-wales-as-a-nation-of-coders|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=WEA YMCA CC Cymru|publisher=WEA YMCA CC Cymru|date=28 August 2015|ref=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opus Anglicanum''' or '''English work''' is fine [[needlework]] of [[Medieval England]] done for ecclesiastical or secular use on [[clothing]], hangings or other [[textiles]], often using gold and silver threads on rich velvet or linen grounds. Such English embroidery was in great demand across Europe, particularly from the late 12th to mid-14th centuries and was a luxury product often used for diplomatic gifts.

==Uses==
Most of the surviving examples of Opus Anglicanum were designed for liturgical use.  These exquisite and expensive [[embroidery]] pieces were often made as [[vestment]]s, such as [[cope]]s, [[chasuble]]s and [[orphrey]]s, or else as [[antependium|antependia]], shrine covers or other church furnishings. Secular examples, now known mostly just from contemporary inventories, included various types of garments, horse-trappings, book covers and decorative hangings.

==Manufacture==
Opus Anglicanum was usually [[embroidery|embroidered]] on [[linen]] or, later,  [[velvet]], in [[Backstitch|split stitch]] and [[couching (embroidery)|couching]] with [[silk]] and [[gold]] or [[goldwork (embroidery)|silver-gilt thread]].&lt;ref&gt;Levey, S. M. and D. King, ''The Victoria and Albert Museum's Textile Collection Vol. 3: Embroidery in Britain from 1200 to 1750'', Victoria and Albert Museum, 1993, {{ISBN|1-85177-126-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold-wound thread, pearls and jewels are all mentioned in inventory descriptions.
Although often associated with nunneries, by the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (reg. 1216–72), who purchased a number of items for use within his own court and for [[diplomatic gift|diplomatic gifting]], the bulk of production was in lay workshops, mainly centred on London. The names of various (male) embroiderers of the period appear in the [[Pipe Rolls|Westminster royal accounts]].&lt;ref&gt;Article: Opus Anglicanum, ''Grove Dictionary of Art'', Oxford, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
[[File:Butlerbowden cope.jpg|thumb|right|500px|[[The Butler-Bowden Cope]], 1330–50, V&amp;A Museum]]

English needlework had become famous across Europe during the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period (though very few examples survive) and remained so throughout the Gothic era.  A Vatican inventory of 1295  lists over 113 pieces from England, more than from any other country;&lt;ref&gt;Remnant 1964:111; Bonnie Young, "Opus Anglicanum" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series, '''29'''.7 (March 1971:291–298) p. 291; the article was occasioned by an exhibition at The Cloisters.&lt;/ref&gt; a request by [[Pope Innocent IV]], who had envied the gold-embroidered [[cope]]s and mitres of English priests, that Cistercian religious houses send more is reported  by the Benedictine [[chronicle]]r [[Matthew Paris]] of [[St Albans]]: "This command of my Lord Pope did not displease the London merchants who traded in these embroideries and sold them at their own price."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted Young 1971:291.&lt;/ref&gt; The high water mark of style and refinement is normally considered to have been reached in the work of the 13th and early 14th centuries. An influential exhibition at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] from September–November 1963 displayed several examples of Opus Anglicanum from this period alongside contemporary works of wood and stone sculpture, metalwork and ivories.&lt;ref&gt;King, David (ed), ''Opus Anglicanum'' (exhibition catalogue), London, V&amp;A Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Survival rates for Opus Anglicanum are low (especially for secular works) as is clear from comparing the large number listed in contemporary inventories with the handful of examples still existing. Sometimes ecclesiastical garments were later modified for different uses, such as altar coverings or book covers. Others were buried with their owners, as with the vestments of the mid-13th century Bishops, [[Walter de Cantilupe]] and [[William de Blois (bishop of Worcester)|William de Blois]], fragments of which were recovered when their tombs in [[Worcester Cathedral]] were opened in the 18th century. The majority however were lost to neglect, destroyed by [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] or else unpicked or burnt to recover the precious metals from the gold and silver threads.
Although fragmentary examples can be found in a number of museums, the most important specialised collections of Opus Anglicanum garments are at the [[Cloisters Museum]] in New York, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London and in the Treasury of [[Sens Cathedral]].

Only a few [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] pieces have survived, including three pieces at [[Durham, England|Durham]] that had been placed in the coffin of [[St Cuthbert]], probably in the 930s, after being given by [[King Athelstan]]; they were however made in [[Winchester]] between 909 and 916. These are works "of breathtaking brilliance and quality", according to Wilson, including figures of saints, and important early examples of the Winchester style, though the origin of their style is a puzzle; they are closest to a wall-painting fragment from Winchester, and an early example of [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 154–156, quote 155; Dodwell (1993), 26; Golden Age, 19, 44, though neither these nor any textiles could be lent for the exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest group of survivals, now re-arranged and with the precious metal thread mostly picked out, are bands or borders from vestments, incorporating pearls and glass beads, with various types of scroll and animal decoration. These are probably 9th century and now in a church in [[Maaseik]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 108; Dodwell (1993), 27, who gives details of further fragments.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further style of textile is a vestment illustrated in a miniature portrait of [[Saint Aethelwold]] in [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold|his Benedictional]], which shows the edge of what appears to be a huge acanthus "flower" (a term used in several documentary records) covering the wearer's back and shoulders.  Other written sources mention other large-scale compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 183–185; [http://img49.imageshack.us/img49/5295/benedictional1am1.jpg portrait of Saint Aethelwold]&lt;/ref&gt;

One particularly fine example is ''The Adoration of the Magi'' [[chasuble]] from c.&amp;nbsp;1325 in red velvet embroidered in gold thread and pearls at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.  It depicts a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity]] scene with emphasis on decorative motifs, flowers, animals, birds, beasts, and angels.  [[The Butler-Bowden Cope]] at the Victoria and Albert Museum is another surviving example; the same collection has a late cope made for a set of vestments given by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] to [[Westminster Abbey]].

Within the work of the Austrian psychoanalyst [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1897–1957), '''orgastic potency''' is the ability to experience an [[orgasm]] with specific [[psychosomatic]] characteristics and, among others, requiring the ability to love.&lt;ref&gt;"Reich's account of the ideal sexual act is remarkable both for its explicitness, which must have required courage in the pre-Kinsey, pre-Masters and Johnson era in which it was written, and for its omission of the word 'love'. And yet it is clear that it is love that he is talking about. Orgastic potency as formulated by Reich is the capacity to love body and soul, psychosomatically."{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 33.
*Mah, Kenneth and Yitzchak M. Binik (2001) "The nature of human orgasm: a critical review of major trends," ''Clinical Psychology Review'' '''21'''(6): 823-56: Reich's model takes a unisex, "integrated biopsychological perspective."
*Corrington, Robert S. (2003) ''Wilhelm Reich: Psychoanalyist and Radical Naturalist'', New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux, p. 88.: "The coda to the entire argument of ''Genitality'' was sounded in two striking sentences: 'Satisfied genital object love is thus [the justified aim] of our therapeutic efforts.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

For Reich, "orgastic impotence", or failure to attain orgastic potency (not to be confused with [[anorgasmia]], the inability to reach orgasm) always resulted in [[neurosis]], because during orgasm that person could not discharge all [[libido]] (which Reich regarded as a biological energy). According to Reich, "not a single neurotic individual possesses orgastic potency."&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Yiannis. ''Freud and Society''. Routledge, 1983, [https://books.google.com/books?id=suI9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 p. 178].&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich coined the term ''orgastic impotence'' in 1924 and described the concept in his 1927 book ''[[Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neurosis|Die Funktion des Orgasmus]]'', the manuscript of which he presented to [[Sigmund Freud]] on the latter's 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 91-2, 100, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Reich regarded his work as complementing Freud's original theory of anxiety neurosis, Freud was ambivalent in his reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud's view was that there was no single cause of neurosis.&lt;ref name=Freudletter&gt;[http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=ipl.089.0174a "Letter from Freud to Lou Andreas-Salomé, May 9, 1928"], The International Psycho-Analytical Library, 89:174-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich continued to use the concept as an indicator of a person's health in his later therapeutic methods, such as [[vegetotherapy]].&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 238-41, 243"/&gt; During the period 1933–1937, he attempted to ground his orgasm theory in physiology, both theoretically and experimentally.&lt;ref name="Boadella 1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 102, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Wilhelm Reich in his mid-twenties.JPG|thumb|[[Wilhelm Reich]]]]
Reich developed his orgasm theory between 1921 and 1924 and it formed the basis for all his later contributions, including the theory of [[Character Analysis|character analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The starting point of Reich's orgasm theory was his clinical observation of genital disturbance in all neurotics,&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 86-105.&lt;/ref&gt; which he presented in November 1923, in the paper "Über Genitalität vom Standpunkt der psychoanalytischen Prognose und Therapie" ("Genitality from the viewpoint of psycho-analytic prognosis and therapy"). That presentation was met with a chilling silence, much hostility, and was partially discredited because Reich could not adequately define normal sexual health. In response, and after a further year of research, Reich introduced the concept "orgastic potency" at the 1924 Psycho-analytic Congress, Salzburg in the paper "Die therapeutische Bedeutung des Genitallibidos" ("Further Remarks on the Therapeutic Significance of Genital Libido").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his own patients' love lives, Reich examined through interviews and case records those of 200 patients seen at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Polyclinic. Reich was impressed by the depth and frequency of genital disturbances he observed. One example was a patient who had reported having a normal sex life, but on closer interviewing by Reich revealed not experiencing orgasm during intercourse and having thoughts of murdering her partner following the act. Such observations made Reich very suspicious of superficial reports about sexual experience.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/&gt; His analysis of these cases led Reich to conclude that genital disturbance was present in all neuroses and correlated in severity to the severity of the neurosis, and that all patients who improved in therapy and remained symptom-free achieved a gratifying genital sex life.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"&gt;{{harvnb|Raknes|1944}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This led Reich to establish criteria for satisfactory sexual intercourse. Based on interviews with people who appeared to have satisfactory sex lives, he described the sex act as being optimally satisfactory only if it follows a specific pattern.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt; Orgastic potency is Reich's term for the ability to have this maximally fulfilling type of sexual experience, which in the Reichian view is limited to those who are free from neuroses and appears to be shared by all people free of neuroses.&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt;

==Definition ==
Reich's precise definition for the phrase "orgastic potency" changed over time as he changed his understanding of the phenomenon. He first described it in detail in his 1927 book ''Die Funktion Des Orgasmus.'' In the 1980 English translation of the book, ''Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neuroses'', he defined orgastic potency as "the ability to achieve full resolution of existing sexual need-tension".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1980}}: 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1940 book ''Die Entdeckung des Orgons Erster Teil: Die Function des Orgasmus'', published in English in 1942 as ''The Discovery of the Orgone, Volume 1: The Function of the Orgasm'', he defined it as "the capacity to surrender to the flow of biological energy, free of any inhibitions; the capacity to discharge completely the dammed-up sexual excitation through involuntary, pleasurable convulsions of the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 102. Note: the original reads "damned-up" but this is probably a typo.&lt;/ref&gt;

His last published definition of orgastic potency, which is part of his 1960 published ''Selected Writings'', is "the capacity for complete surrender to the involuntary convulsion of the organism and complete discharge of the excitation at the acme of the genital embrace."&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 10"/&gt;

Reich related orgastic potency and orgastic impotence to a, respectively, healthy and unhealthy sexual experience for the adult.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Boadella|1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 17-8.&lt;/ref&gt; He described that the healthy experience has specific biological and psychological characteristics; is identical for men and women;&lt;ref&gt;Reich's model takes a unisex, "integrated biopsychological perspective."

== Orgasm theory ==
Reich was strongly influenced by [[Sigmund Freud]]'s distinction between psychoneuroses and actual neuroses, the latter being considered of a physiological origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the related [[libido]] as the energy of an unconscious sexual instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 18-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Reich emphasised the libido theory exactly when it was being discarded by psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud observed that one group of patients suffering from neurosis had sexual disturbances&amp;mdash;practising [[coitus interruptus]], conflicts related to [[masturbation]] or [[sexual abstinence]]&amp;mdash;and were cured when these disturbances were removed. Hence, Freud reasoned that sexual maladaption caused the active damming-up of "sexual stuff"&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt; and defined "actual neurosis" as [[anxiety]] based on dammed-up [[libido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kovel|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, those with [[Psychoneurosis|psychoneuroses]] had conflicts related to the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]: repressed impulses, desires and memories, and repressed unresolved conflicts and childhood [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]s.&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt; Freud abandoned this view in the 1920s and postulated the never popularly accepted [[death instinct]] to explain the destructive behaviour that was earlier attributed to frustrated libido.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 34, 36-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich distinguished between complete release of accumulated sexual tensions in orgasm, resulting in the restoration of energy equilibrium, and orgastic impotence, in which the release of energy is incomplete.&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}: "Neurotic Sexuality."&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, he argued that the inability of psychoneurotics to wholly discharge sexual energy caused a damming up of energy (or sexual stasis), leaving them in a vicious circle: the actual neurosis physiologically provided the energy for the psychoneurosis, while the psychoneurosis provided a psychological mechanism to maintain the actual neurosis.&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Reich defined neurosis as the sum total of all chronic and automatic inhibitions of natural sexual excitations&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/&gt; and which results in an outer rigidity and inner anxiety fuelling harshness, brutality, sexual sadism, restriction, mechanisation, confinement to routines and becoming filled with compulsions or phobias as well as loneliness, helplessness, craving for authority, fear of responsibility and mystical longing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 3, 10 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; Orgastic potency enables the individual to receive satisfaction in the sex act, whereas those lacking in it are forever seeking it, and are therefore likely to be more sexually needy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 12 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich's view of the relationship between actual and psychoneuroses has not found its way into psychoanalytic thinking. However, it has the advantage of connecting psychopathology with physiology and, according to [[Charles Rycroft]], this makes Reich the only psychoanalyst to provide any explanation as to why childhood pathogenic experiences (causing neuroses in classical psychoanalysis) do not disappear when neurotics leave their childhood environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recurrence in Reich's work==
Reich expanded on the concept throughout his career. In his 1942 scientific autobiography ''The Discovery of Orgone, Vol. 1: The Function of the Orgasm'', Reich provided the following summary of his findings regarding orgastic potency: it is an outcome of [[health]], he argued, because full orgastic potency can only come about if a person is psychologically free of neurosis (pleasure [[anxiety]] absent), physically free from "body armor" (chronic [[Muscle contraction|muscular contraction]] absent), socially free from [[Compulsive behavior|compulsive]] morality and duty as imposed by [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and mechanistic ways of life, and has the natural ability to love.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, Reich held that the vast majority of people do not meet these criteria and thus lack orgastic potency.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Konia|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich retained the idea of a sexual energy and the concept orgastic potency as central elements in [[sex-economy]], a general Reichian theory of health dealing with an organism's energy household.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raknes|1944}}: "Lead."&lt;/ref&gt; Reich progressively called this energy libido, sexual energy, emotional energy, bioelectric energy, biophysical energy and, finally, [[orgone]] ("life") energy. In terms of this theory, an individual lacking in orgastic potency is unable to fully discharge energy in orgasm, and thus remains in a constant state of tension, both physical rigidity and mental anxiety, which constitutes neurosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 2, 10 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character and muscular armor ===
In Reichian psychology, the individual lacking orgastic potency is seen to have developed a neurotic [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] "armor" that blocks the experience of pleasure. This is differentiated between the functionally identical "character armor" and "muscular armor."&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 10"&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1961}}: 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Reichian character analysis is the concept of "character resistance" or "character defence", by which a person's character&amp;mdash;what the patient did rather than what he or she said&amp;mdash;was seen as his or her primary defence mechanism. Character attributes include posture, expression, and way of speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich defined character armor as "[t]he sum total of typical character attitudes which an individual develops as a blocking against his emotional excitations, resulting in rigidity of the body, lack of emotional contact, and 'deadness'."&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 10"/&gt;

===Genital and neurotic character===
Reich used the terms "genital character" and "neurotic character" respectively to distinguish between characters with and without orgastic potency. Real characters of actual people are considered to be somewhere on a continuum between the two. The genital character is the non-neurotic character structure, which is free from armor and, therefore, has the capacity of natural-self regulation on the basis of orgastic potency.&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 9-12"&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1961}}: 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The genital character is able to fully focus on a task or object, has a natural yearning for continued human contact that finds expression in work and social life, feels a healthy sympathy for fellow human beings in sorrow and happiness, and experiences life as a fulfilment and unfolding of his or her natural tendencies and struggle to achieve objectives. His or her sex life attains full bloom in a context of heterosexual intercourse with full surrender, without identifying the partner either consciously or unconsciously with a parent, without wishing to torment or to be tormented, without accepting celibacy except for strongly convincing reasons, and without looking for another partner so long as his or her affection for the partner is reciprocated.&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt;

The neurotic character operates under a principle of compulsive moral regulation due to chronic energy stasis.&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 9-12"/&gt; The neurotic character's work and life is permeated by struggle to suppress original and even more basic urges or tendencies. The various forms of neurotic character correspond to the equally many ways of suppressing such urges or tendencies that the human being in question considers to be dangerous or is ashamed of. A feeling of inferiority may sometimes lead to a striving for power and honor; work is directed by such desires or by duty, rather than by a striving for joy and happiness. His or her sex life is disturbed by impulses derived from pregenital wishes, so strong that they prevent the experience of full release during orgasm, or else genital wishes are so suppressed by prohibitions and a guilty conscience that they either inhibit a full release during orgasm or prevent the establishment of an adult sex life.&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt; Sexual discharge will leave him or her empty, unsatisfied, and not fully at peace,&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/&gt; resulting in sensations of emptiness and a feeling of inferiority, a widespread phenomenon termed [[post-coital tristesse]].&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt;

Reich argued that if repression occurred, this energy, in the form of stored emotions or [[affect (psychology)|affect]]s, was held back by [[Muscle contraction|muscular contraction]] or armor, which restricts and immobilises the body and becomes the [[Somatopsychic|somatic]] core of neuroses, making full orgastic discharge impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 2 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; Reich defined muscular armor as: "The sum total of the muscular attitudes (chronic muscular spasms) which an individual develops as a block against the breakthrough of emotions and organ sensations, in particular anxiety, rage, and sexual excitation."&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 9-12"/&gt; Muscular armor prevents the sexual climax from being experienced throughout the body.&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Orgiastic"&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}: "Orgiastic Potency" {{sic}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, forms of armoring are pulling back the [[pelvis]] or tightening the [[thigh]] and [[buttock]] muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}: "Sexuality and Armoring."&lt;/ref&gt; Reich regarded the ego as playing an active part in the act of perception, since whereas some people perceive the gentle stroking of an [[erogenous zone]] as pleasurable, for others it is merely a tactile sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Resolving armor ====
{{Main|Vegetotherapy}} {{Further|Body psychotherapy|Neo-Reichian massage|Bioenergetic analysis|Gestalt therapy|Primal therapy}}
Dissolving character and muscular rigidifications or armorings is the basic principle of Reichian [[vegetotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This dissolution softens movement, eases breathing, and can also bring back the repressed memory of the childhood situation that caused the repression, Reich wrote.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 238-41, 243"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 238-41, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; The two goals of vegetotherapy are the attainment of orgastic potency during sexual intercourse and of the "orgasm reflex" during therapy. The orgasm reflex may be observed as waves of pleasure moving through the body, a series of spontaneous, involuntary movements,&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 238-41, 243"/&gt; and signifies that the person is free of body armoring, entailing the ability to give and receive love in all its forms.&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/&gt;

=== Implications for society ===

==== Prevention through social reform ====
''The Invasion of Compulsory Sex-Morality'', written in 1931, was Reich's first step in approaching the answer to the problem of mass neuroses in society, followed by ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' and ''[[Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf|The Sexual Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary sociological issues with which Reich dealt included in particular the following three:
# How to prevent neurosis through correct upbringing and education.
# How to prevent sex-negative attitudes in society through sexual reform.
# How to prevent authoritarian repression through general social reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Negative social effects ====
Reich coined the term "emotional plague" to refer to a special group dynamic when the destructive, pathological impulses of a group of neurotic characters become mutually reinforcing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 215.&lt;/ref&gt;
“Emotional” refers to the element of social irrationalism in people. “Plague” refers to the contagious, infectious nature and the difficulty of resisting it. Thus, whereas the neurotic character struggles with feelings of guilt in order to suppress destructive drives (e.g. a torture fantasy), people with the emotional plague unconsciously provide each other with a social alibi to act out these suppressed drives. That is, they adopt a group ideology that rationalises acting on irrational, secondary drives. An example would be the [[Salem witch trials]] in which dissident Christians were tortured and executed by their own group.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Bio-electric experiments===
In 1934, Reich expanded his orgasm theory in the essay "Der Orgasmus als Elektro-physiologische Entladung" ("The Orgasm as an Electrophysiological Discharge").&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 103-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Through clinical observations in his sex-counseling centers, Reich concluded that conceiving of the orgasm as only mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience gratification and others do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1982}}: 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, based on the work of [[Friedrich Kraus]] and others, Reich proposed that the orgasm is a bio-electric discharge, and is part of what Reich termed the orgasm formula:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
mechanical tension &gt; bioelectric charge &gt; bioelectric discharge &gt; mechanical relaxation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Secondly, in 1934 Reich published the paper "Der Urgegensatz des Vegetatives Lebens" ("Sexuality and Anxiety: The Basic Antithesis of Vegetative Life"). The paper is a literature study in which Reich explored "the physiology of the ''autonomic nervous system'', the ''chemistry'' of anxiety, the ''electro-physiology'' of the body fluids and the ''hydro-mechanics'' of plasma movements in protozoa."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 103-4, italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt; In conclusion, Reich proposed a functional psychosomatic antithesis between the [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] and [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] nervous systems, captured respectively as pleasure or movement "towards the world", and anxiety or movement "away from the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1982}}: 68-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The corollary is the idea that bioelectric energy displayed an antithetic function: if it flows outward to the skin surface, causing a build-up of charge at the skin, it is experienced as [[pleasure]]; in contrast, if it flows inward, away from the skin surface, resulting in a lowering of charge at the skin, then it is experienced as an increase in central tension or [[anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 6-7 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, in 1937 Reich published ''Experimentelle Ergebnisse über die elektrische Funktion von Sexualitat und Angst'' (''The Bioelectrical Function of Sexuality and Anxiety'') in which he thought he experimentally verified the existence of what he first termed the "libidinal economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 131, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The report summarised two years of research into the reaction of the skin to states of pleasure and anxiety. His findings included the following: normal skin has a constant, basic electrical charge of 40 milivolts that does not change with mood states; erogenous zones have a wandering potential that can at times be much higher (200 milivolts) or lower, depending on the mood states; change in potential does not depend on the mechanical nature of the stimulus, but on changes in the subject's sensation or emotion; and, erogenous zones can have mechanical tension (be tumescent) without changes in levels of the charge, e.g. as in the case of a 'cold erection'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 131-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orgone energy===
A common misconception about Reich's later developed [[orgone energy accumulator]] is that he claimed it could provide orgastic potency to those sitting inside the device. Reich maintained the opposite: "The orgone accumulator, as has been clearly stated in the relevant publications (''The Cancer Biopathy'', etc.), cannot provide orgastic potency."&lt;ref&gt;Reich, W. (1950, April) ''Orgone Energy Bulletin'' '''2'''(2), quoted in [http://www.wilhelmreichtrust.org/update_11_11.html November 2011 Update From The Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust and The Wilhelm Reich Museum], Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust (accessed 26 January 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in ''The Orgone Energy Accumulator, its Scientific and Medical Use'', Reich wrote: ”Neuroses cannot be cured with physical [[orgone]] energy."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Gardner, Martin (1957) ''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science'', Courier Dover Publications: 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Academic and psychoanalytic reception===
According to [[Myron Sharaf]], Reich's view that the capacity to unite tender and sensuous feelings is important for a healthy love relationship was not a new concept. Freud had noted this as early as 1912. However, Sharaf states that the involuntary physical aspects of the full genital discharge in Reich's work were new.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/&gt; He called the concept orgastic potency and the manner in which Reich "connected a series of psychological, social, and biological findings with the presence or absence of this function" unique to Reich.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--needs academic/psychoanalytic sources--&gt;When Reich first introduced the orgasm theory at the psychoanalytic congress in Salzburg he was congratulated by [[Karl Abraham]] for successfully formulating the economic element of neurosis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, Reich's presentation of the orgasm theory came exactly when psychoanalysis was moving away from the original Freudian instinct theory based on psychic energy. In his 1926 book ''Inhibitions, Symptoms, Anxiety'' Freud completely abandoned his earlier position and wrote: "Anxiety never arises from repressed libido."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1948}}: 54, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud was ambivalent in his reception. When Reich presented him the manuscript of ''Die Funktion des Orgasmus'' in May 1926, Freud replied, "That thick?" Later that year he wrote to Reich that the book was "valuable, rich in observation and thought,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1942}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; but in May 1928 wrote to [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]]: "We have here a Dr. Reich, a worthy but impetuous young man, passionately devoted to his hobby-horse, who now salutes in the genital orgasm the antidote to every neurosis. Perhaps he might learn from your analysis of K. to feel some respect for the complicated nature of the psyche."&lt;ref name=Freudletter/&gt;

Sharaf writes that the theory was immediately unpopular within psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 86.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Federn]] (1871–1950), Reich's training assistant, and [[Hermann Nunberg]] (1884–1970) were particularly opposed to it. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The German psychiatrist [[Arthur Kronfeld]] (1886–1941) wrote a positive review of ''Die Funktion des Orgasmus'' in 1927: "In this extremely valuable and instructive work the author has really succeeded in broadening as well as deepening Freud's theory of sex and of the neuroses. He broadens it by clarifying for the first time the significance of the genital orgasm for the development and the whole structure of the neuroses; he deepens it by giving Freud's theory of the actual neuroses an exact psychological and physiological meaning. I do not hesitate to consider this work of Reich's the most valuable contribution since Freud's ''[[The Ego and the Id]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kronfeld|1927}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent Freudian to make clinical use of the concept orgastic potency was Edward Hitschmann, the Director of the Psychoanalytic Polyclinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 21.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

&lt;!--needs academic/psychoanalytic sources--&gt;Two further reactions to Reich's work in the psychoanalytic movement were either completely ignoring it or using the concept as if it was commonly accepted, but without referring to Reich as the source. As a result, the theme orgastic potency survived but became divorced from the concepts in which Reich embedded it. For example, in ''Clinical Psychology'' Charles Berg uses Reich's sex economic theory of anxiety as his own without attributing it to Reich.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 23-4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Erikson]] was another psychoanalytic writer who partially adopted Reich's concept without acknowledgement. In his bestselling ''[[Childhood and Society]]'', Erikson wrote: "Genitality, then, consists in the unobstructed capacity to develop an orgastic potency so free of pregenital interferences that the genital libido . . . is expressed in heterosexual mutuality . . . and with a convulsion-like discharge of tension from the whole body."&lt;ref&gt;Erikson quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 23-5.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

&lt;!--needs academic/psychoanalytic sources--&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], in the classic textbook ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neuroses'', uses aspects of Reich's orgasm theory but disguised that they were Reich's contribution, and furthermore he hid the conflicts in the psychoanalytic movement that were explicit in Reich's work. A major entry mainly based on Fenichel's work appeared in the 1953, 1970 ''Psychiatric Dictionary'' by L. Hinsie and R. Campbell: "''Impotence'', orgastic: The incapacity for achieving the orgasm or acme of satisfaction in the sexual act. Many neurotics cannot achieve adequate discharge of their sexual energy through the sexual act. . . . According to Fenichel, an important concomitant of orgastic impotence is that these patients are incapable of love."&lt;ref&gt;Hinsie and Campbell quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

{{As of|2012|09}}, there are no peer-reviewed articles in the [[PubMed]] database that discuss the concept of orgastic potency or Reich's orgasm theory.&lt;ref&gt;PubMed (2012) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=reich%20AND%20orgas* "Orgastic Potency"]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--needs a secondary source: Reich's experimental investigating regarding the biological grounding of the orgasm theory, published as ''The Bioelectrical Investigations of Sexuality and Anxiety'', were reproduced in 2010 at the University of Vienna.

===Reichian legacy===
The two colleagues of Reich who build most on Reich's orgasm theory and orgastic potency are Philipson and Lowen. They emphasised the importance of human relationship in orgastic functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tage Philipson, in his 1952 book ''Kaerlighedslivet: Natur Eller Unnatur'', studied natural and unnatural love-life. He wrote that "in healthy people sexuality and love will always be associated together. Sex will come from the heart and return to the heart. . . . the fully healthy person must be the person with completely free love feelings. . . . When this is the case other feelings will also be able to stream through the entire organism: hate, sorrow, anxiety, etc., and the orgasm, as the highest point of sexuality, will also be able to affect the entire organism."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Philipson|1952}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Lowen]] in his 1966 book ''Love and Orgasm'' distinguishes between achieving orgasm in the Kinsey meaning of sexual performance, and the entering into a love relationship as a whole human, similar to Reich. Like Reich, Lowen considers the latter to be the expression of health, not a means to it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

Theodore Wolfe, an American pioneer in psychosomatic medicine and later colleague of Reich, thought that anxiety was the cause of both neuroses and psychosomatic distortions. When reading Reich's ''Der Funktion des Orgasmus'' he found in it what he called the key to understanding the dynamics of this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Reich's sexual theories Elsworth Baker, a psychiatrist and colleague of Reich, wrote that in particular Reich's sexual theories were commonly misinterpreted and misunderstood. While Reich was portrayed as advocating "a wild frantic promiscuity" to seek "mystical, ecstatic orgasm" that could cure all neuroses and physical ills, Baker continues, Reich in fact found that the healthy person needs less sexual activity and that the orgasm has a function to maintain health only for the healthy person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 1, 12 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparing definitions of orgasm==
The concepts of the sexual acme used in the famous 1948 and 1953 [[Kinsey report]]s and the 1966 research by [[Masters and Johnson]] were different from the one used by Reich. Reich directly related orgastic potency with the total response system, the personality, contact-ability, total psychosomatic health of a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Kinsey and Masters and Johnson restricted their conclusions to phenomena that all sexual climaxes had in common.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 28.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Kinsey defined the male orgasm as "all cases of ejaculation"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kinsey|1948}}: 59-60, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and the female orgasm as "the sudden and abrupt release . . . from sexual tension, [excluding] the satisfaction that may result from sexual experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kinsey|1953}}:628, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 26-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Kinsey focusses on the physiology, anatomy and technique involved in inducing a discharge of tension. Therefore, Kinsey's usage of the term orgasm covers behaviour that in the Reichian typology ranges from orgastic potency to orgastic impotence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 26-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, examples of physiological distinctions Reich made but which were not pursued by Kinsey and Masters and Johnson include the difference between local and total bodily responses, and between voluntary and involuntary movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 28-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Mature orgasm
{{See also|Orgasm#Clitoral and vaginal categories}}
In 1905, Freud developed the psychoanalytic distinction between clitoral and vaginal orgasm, with only the latter being identified with [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual maturity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 27.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction has since been challenged among others on physiological grounds. For example, Masters and Johnson wrote: "Are clitoral and vaginal orgasms truly separate and anatomic entities? From a biological point of view the answer to this question is an unequivocal NO."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Masters|1963}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 28.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a clinically  grounded qualitative distinction between psychosexual maturity and immaturity was only introduced with Reich's concept orgastic potency vs. orgastic impotence (instead of vaginal vs. clitoral).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; As Masters and Johnson focussed on phenomena shared by all sexual climaxes - ranging from what Reich categorised as orgastic potency to impotence - their finding has no direct relevance to or implications for Reich's distinction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6163">'''Stages of play''' is a theory and classification of children's participation in [[Play (activity)|play]] developed by [[Mildred Parten Newhall]] in her 1929 dissertation.&lt;ref name=fh&gt;{{cite book |first=Fergus P. |last=Hughes |title=Children, Play, and Development |publisher=SAGE |year=2009 |isbn=1-4129-6769-4 |pages=100–103 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbnOVfinznEC&amp;pg=PA100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parten observed American [[preschool]] age (ages 2 to 5) children at free play (defined as anything unrelated to survival, production or profit).

Parten recognized six different types of play:
*Unoccupied (play) – when the child is not playing, just observing. A child may be standing in one spot or performing random movements.&lt;ref name=San&gt;{{cite book |last=Santrock |first=J. W. |year=2007 |chapter=Parten's classic study of play |title=A topical approach to life-span development |edition=3rd |page=573 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-313376-0 |orig-year=2002 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2J_0sgEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Solitary (independent) play – when the child is alone and maintains focus on its activity. Such a child is uninterested in or is unaware of what others are doing. More common in younger children (age 2–3) as opposed to older ones.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;&lt;ref name=San/&gt;&lt;ref name=rr&gt;Renee Roberson, [http://www.toddlerstoday.com/articles/play-time/side-by-side-in-the-sandbox-4841/ Side-by-Side in the Sandbox. The Importance of Parallel Play in Toddlers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717065524/http://www.toddlerstoday.com/articles/play-time/side-by-side-in-the-sandbox-4841/ |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Onlooker play (behavior) – when the child watches others at play but does not engage in it.&lt;ref name=San/&gt; The child may engage in forms of [[social interaction]], such as conversation about the play, without actually joining in the activity.&lt;ref name=rr/&gt; This type of activity is also more common in younger children.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;
*[[Parallel play]] (adjacent play, social coaction) – when the child plays separately from others but close to them and mimicking their actions.&lt;ref name=San/&gt;&lt;ref name=rr/&gt; This type of play is seen as a transitory stage from a socially immature solitary and onlooker type of play, to a more socially mature associative and cooperative type of play.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;
*Associative play – when the child is interested in the people playing but not in coordinating their activities with those people, or when there is no organized activity at all. There is a substantial amount of interaction involved, but the activities are not in sync.&lt;ref name=San/&gt;&lt;ref name=rr/&gt;
*Cooperative play – when a child is interested both in the people playing and in the activity they are doing. In cooperative play, the activity is organized, and participants have assigned roles. There is also increased [[self-identification]] with a group, and a [[group identity]] may emerge. This is relatively uncommon in the preschool and Kindergarten years, because it requires more social maturity and more advanced organization skills. Examples would be dramatic play activities with roles, like playing school, or a game with rules, such as [[Tag (game)|freeze tag]].&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;&lt;ref name=San/&gt;&lt;ref name=rr/&gt;

According to Parten, as children became older, improving their communication skills, and as opportunities for peer interaction become more common, the nonsocial (solitary and parallel) types of play become less common, and the social (associative and cooperative) types of play become more common.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomlin|first=Carolyn Ross|title=Play: A Historical Review|url=http://www.earlychildhoodnews.com/earlychildhood/article_view.aspx?ArticleID=618|accessdate=June 29, 2012|newspaper=Early Childhood News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars agree that Parten's theory has contributed substantially to our understanding of play, and while alternative classification schemes have been proposed, Parten's stages of play are still widely used.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt; However, there is disagreement on whether there is indeed a sequence of play stages that children go through – for example, whether toddlers are really unable to play cooperatively, and whether solitary play in older children is less common or a sign of immaturity.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt; Alternative explanations suggest that types of play may be influenced by other circumstances (such as how well the children know one another).&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;

{{Sociology}}
'''Public sociology''' is a subfield of the wider [[Sociology|sociological discipline]] that emphasizes expanding the disciplinary boundaries of sociology in order to engage with non-academic audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a ''style'' of sociology rather than a particular [[Scientific method|method]], [[theory]], or set of [[politics|political]] values. Since the twenty-first century, the term has been widely associated with [[University of California, Berkeley]] sociologist [[Michael Burawoy]], who delivered an impassioned call for a disciplinary embrace of public sociology in his 2004 [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA) presidential address.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his address, Burawoy contrasts public sociology with what he terms "professional sociology", a form of sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other academic sociologists.

Burawoy and other advocates of public sociology encourage the discipline to engage with issues that are of significant public and political concern. These include debates over public policy, political [[activism]], the purposes of [[social movements]], and the institutions of [[civil society]]. If public sociology is considered to be a "movement" within the discipline, it is one that aims to revitalize the discipline of sociology by leveraging its [[empirical]] methods and theoretical insights to contribute to debates not just about ''what is'' or ''what has been'' in society, but about what society ''might yet be''. Thus, many versions of public sociology have had an undeniably [[Norm (sociology)|normative]]&lt;ref&gt;Hanemaayer, A., &amp; Schneider, C.J. (eds) (2014).

==History==
The term "public sociology" was first introduced by [[Herbert Gans]] in his 1988 ASA presidential address, "Sociology in America: The Discipline and the Public".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gans|first=Herbert J.|date=1989-01-01|title=Sociology in America: The Discipline and the Public American Sociological Association, 1988 Presidential Address|jstor=2095658|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=54|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.2307/2095658}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Gans, primary examples of public sociologists included [[David Riesman]], author of ''The Lonely Crowd'' (one of the best-selling books of sociology ever to be written), and [[Robert Bellah]], the lead author of another best-selling work, ''Habits of the Heart''. In 2000 (four years before Burawoy's ASA address), sociologist [[Ben Agger]] wrote the book ''Public Sociology: From Social Facts to Literary Acts,'' which called for a sociology that addressed major public issues.

However, the [[Northwestern University]] race scholar [[Aldon Morris]] argues in his book ''The Scholar Denied: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology'' (2015) that [[W. E. B. Du Bois|W. E .B. Du Bois]] was practicing public sociology long before the term was incorporated into the mainstream disciplinary vocabulary, and that [[scientific racism]] prevented Du Bois' contributions from being recognized by the discipline for nearly a century.

Morris argues that Du Bois built the first actual scientific department of sociology during his tenure at [[Atlanta University]], a historically black college, predating the "scientific revolution" of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] (who are often credited with turning sociology into a rigorous, empirical social science).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scholar Denied: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology|last=Morris|first=Aldon|publisher=University of California Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~lutters/pubs/1996_SWLNote96-1_Lutters,Ackerman.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Chicago School of Sociology|last=Lutters|first=Wayne G.|last2=Ackerman|first2=Mark S.|date=1996|website=|publisher=University of Maryland, Baltimore County|access-date=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Du Bois, robust empirical sociological research was necessary in order to emancipate American blacks from the tyrannies and oppressions built into the racist fabric of American society. Through thorough [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] research, Du Bois sought to dismantle and delegitimize [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]], biological, and cultural deficiency explanations for racial inequality, which were ''not'' grounded in empirical evidence, but relied on grand [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] narratives that had no basis in scientific analysis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Du Bois and his colleagues made use of the scientific method and robust empirical inquiry with the dual goal of turning sociology into a ''real'' social science committed to empirical investigation, and using their findings to liberate, empower, and emancipate American blacks from the violence of racist oppression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, long before Gans or Burawoy began emphasizing the virtues of public sociology, Du Bois had been serving a marginalized public through his scholarly research, failing to receive credit where credit was due.

Debates over public sociology have rekindled questions concerning the extra-academic ''purpose'' of [[sociology]]. Public sociology raises questions about what sociology is and what its goals ought to (or even could) be. Such debates (over science and political advocacy, scholarship and public commitment) have a long history in American sociology and in American social science more generally. Historian Mark C. Smith, for instance, has investigated earlier debates over the purpose of social science in his book ''Social Science in the Crucible: The American Debate over Objectivity and Purpose,1918-1941'' (1994), while Stephen P. Turner and Jonathan H. Turner argue in their book, ''The Impossible Science: An Institutional Analysis of American Sociology'' (1990), that sociology's search for purpose, through dependence on external publics, has limited the discipline's potential.

==Today==
While there is no one definition of public sociology, the term has come to be widely associated with Burawoy's particular perspective of sociology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An excerpt from Burawoy's 2004 ASA presidential address provides a succinct summary of his understanding of the term: &lt;blockquote&gt;"As mirror and conscience of society, sociology must define, promote and inform public debate about deepening [[Social class|class]] and racial inequalities, new gender regimes, [[environmental degradation]], [[market fundamentalism]], state and non-state violence. I believe that the world needs public sociology - a sociology that transcends the academy - more than ever. Our potential publics are multiple, ranging from [[Mass media|media]] audiences to policy makers, from silenced minorities to social movements. They are local, global, and national. As public sociology stimulates debate in all these contexts, it inspires and revitalizes our discipline. In return, theory and research give legitimacy, direction, and substance to public sociology. Teaching is equally central to public sociology: students are our first public for they carry sociology into all walks of life. Finally, the critical imagination, exposing the gap between what is and what could be, infuses values into public sociology to remind us that the world could be different."&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, M. 2004 American Sociological Association Presidential address: For public sociology. ''American Sociological Review'', 2005, Vol. 70, Issue 1, 4-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Elsewhere, Burawoy has articulated a vision of public sociology that is consonant with the pursuit of [[democratic socialism]]. In ''Critical Sociology'', Burawoy writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"We might say that critical engagement with real [[utopias]] is today an integral part of the project of sociological socialism. It is a vision of socialism that places human society, or social humanity at its organizing center, a vision that was central to [[Karl Marx|Marx]] but that was too often lost before it was again picked up by Gramsci and Polanyi. If public sociology is to have a progressive impact it will have to hold itself continuously accountable to some such vision of democratic socialism."&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael: "The Critical Turn to Public Sociology", ''Critical Sociology'', Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As [[Mark D. Jacobs]] and [[Amy Best]] write, "The mission of public sociology, in Michael Burawoy’s formulation, is to strengthen the institutions of civil society against the encroachments of both state and market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mayjun08/mason.html|title=Footnotes--May/June 2008 Issue--George Mason Introduces New PhD Program in Public Sociology|website=www.asanet.org|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Burawoy maintains that, since the last half of the twentieth century and into the twenty first, the political stance of sociology has drifted more [[Left-wing politics|leftward]], while the all encompassing influence of [[neoliberalism]] has dragged the rest of world more [[Right-wing politics|rightward]]. In the aftermath of [[Reaganomics]], the state and market have begun to work in collusion to propagate the ideals of market fundamentalism, replacing the state's role in redistributing resources and providing social welfare services, to one of creating economic opportunities for enterprise. In his view, this will have devastating consequences for civil society, the very subject of sociology itself, unless the discipline embraces his call to unashamedly engage with the world's diverse (and at-risk) publics to achieve some greater good, thus resisting the perverse allure of neoliberalism. One example of this can be seen in the vast increase in adjunct professors in universities and the impact that has had on the inability of professors to publish articles that would give them credence in the eyes of not only publics but also within the discipline itself.

Even in the face of such adversity, many sociologists remain optimistic about the potential latent within sociology to develop an alternative paradigm to the market fundamentalism at the heart of Burawoy's critique. The sociological discipline is dynamic and ever changing, and has a long history of incorporating new theoretical and empirical insights into its analyses, often with the goal of empowering marginalized publics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Daniel|title=Understanding Society|journal=Sociology as a Social Science Discipline|date=November 9, 2007|pages=1|url=http://understandingsociety.blogspot.ca/2007/11/sociology-as-social-science-discipline.html|accessdate=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the sociology of work has evolved from processes of adaptation to the study of domination and [[Labour movement|labor movements]]; the concepts of [[Social stratification|stratification theory]] have shifted from the study of mobility within a hierarchy of occupational prestige, to the examination of changing structures of social and economic inequality along the axes of class, race and gender; the sociology of race has moved from theories of [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]], to those of [[political economy]], to the study of [[Racial formation theory|racial formations]]; and social theory has allowed, and introduced, more radical interpretations of canonical figures such as [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]], and [[Karl Marx]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} and has incorporated "[[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]]" subfields, such as [[feminism]] and [[ethnic studies]], which have had a significant impact on the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Sociology: Fifteen Eminent Sociologists Debate Politics and the Profession in the Twenty-first Century|last=Glenn|first=Evelyn Nakano|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=213–230|chapter=Whose Public Sociology?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists have not been alone in debating the public role of social science. Similar debates have occurred recently in the disciplines of [[economics]], [[political science]], [[anthropology]], [[geography]] and [[history]], and various sub-disciplines, including [[political ecology]]. In an effort to move these various disciplines "toward a more public social science", [[Craig Calhoun]], the President of the [[Social Science Research Council]], has encouraged sociologists and other social scientists to "ask better social science questions about what encourages [[scientific]] innovation, what makes [[knowledge]] useful, and how to pursue both these agendas, with attention to both immediate needs and long-term capacities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssrc.org/programs/calhoun/ ssrc.org] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416003140/http://www.ssrc.org/programs/calhoun/ |date=2013-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calhoun has also entered the debate about public sociology, critically evaluating the project of public sociology while acknowledging its specific "promise", and arguing that "how sociology matters in the public sphere is vital to the future of the field".&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, C. 2004 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00065.x/full "The promise of public sociology"]. ''The British Journal of Sociology'', 2005, Vol. 56, Issue 3, 355-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Following the 2004 annual meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), at which Michael Burawoy's vision of public sociology was introduced during his presidential address,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burawoy|first=Michael|date=2005|title=For Public Sociology|url=http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/Public%20Sociology,%20Live/Burawoy.pdf|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=70|pages=4–28|doi=10.1177/000312240507000102|pmid=|access-date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been continued interest in the topic. In recent years, numerous books and special issues have addressed public sociology, including:

Building on the conversation sparked by Burawoy in 2004, the 2007 ASA meeting in New York City contained many facets of public sociology. Many of the presentations engaged directly with the public sociology debate, such as: "Constituting a Practical Public Sociology: Reflections on Participatory Research at the Citizenship Project"&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Paul. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p185050_index.html "Constituting a Practical Public Sociology: Reflections on Participatory Research at the Citizenship Project"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, TBA, New York, New York City, Aug 11, 2007. 2011-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; by Paul Johnston; "A New Public Sociology of Punishment"&lt;ref&gt;Schoenfeld, Heather. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p184842_index.html "1. A New Public Sociology of Punishment"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association (ASA), TBA, New York, New York City, Aug 11, 2007. 2011-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; by Heather Schoenfeld; "What Do Activists Want? Public Sociology for Feminist Scholars of Reproduction"&lt;ref&gt;Bessett, Danielle. and Morton, Christine. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p184413_index.html "What Do Activists Want?

Lambros Fatsis' doctoral thesis on public sociology, [http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/51588/ "Making Sociology Public: A Critical Analysis of an Old Idea and a Recent Debate"], can also be recommended as a critical review of the contemporary disciplinary debate about public sociology, incorporating such developments as "e-public sociology" into the scholarly discussion. E-public sociology is a form of public sociology that involves publishing sociological materials in online accessible spaces and subsequent interaction with publics in these spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C.J. (2014). Social Media and e-Public Sociology. In Ariane Hanemaayer and [[Christopher J. Schneider]], editors, The Public Sociology Debate: Ethics and Engagement, University of British Columbia Press: 205-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate over public sociology is having far reaching consequences for how many sociology departments teach and ''do'' sociology, with several reorienting their programs to encompass elements of public sociology. For example, the sociology department at the [[University of Minnesota]] has begun advocating for sociology to claim a larger role in public life, providing "useful, accurate, and scientifically rigorous information to policy makers and community leaders".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/nov04/fn14.html "The Engaged Department: Public Sociology in the Twin Cities"] by Ronald Aminzade, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Footnotes nov. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at [[George Mason University]] began offering a doctoral degree in sociology in the fall of 2008, grounding its two specializations in Institutions and Inequalities and the Sociology of Globalization within a context of public sociological praxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mayjun08/mason.html|title=Footnotes--May/June 2008 Issue--George Mason Introduces New PhD Program in Public Sociology|website=www.asanet.org|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], too, most institutions that provide undergraduate sociology degrees now advertise the public or "applied" nature of the curriculum (or various key modules that form part of the curriculum). Some examples here would include: [[Birmingham City University]]; [[Queen Margaret University|Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh]]; [[Nottingham Trent University]]; the [[University of Exeter]]; [[Cardiff University]]; and [[Bishop Grosseteste University]]'s newly established [https://web.archive.org/web/20160113173152/http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/study/courses/Pages/sociology.aspx BA Sociology program].

Indeed, with so many programs incorporating the ideals of public sociology into their curriculums, this will have significant consequences for how future sociologists are trained to ''do'' sociology.

==Criticism==
A significant number of those who practice sociology either as public intellectuals or as academic professionals do not subscribe to the specific version of "public sociology" defended by Michael Burawoy or to any version of "public sociology" at all. And in the wake of Burawoy's 2004 Presidency of the American Sociological Association, which put the theme of public sociology in the limelight, the project of public sociology has been vigorously debated on the web, in conversations among sociologists, and in a variety of academic journals.

Specifically, Burawoy's vision of public sociology has been critiqued both by "[[Critical theory|critical]]" sociologists and by representatives of academic sociology. These various discussions of public sociology have been included in forums devoted to the subject in [[academic journal]]s such as ''Social Problems'', ''Social Forces'', ''Critical Sociology'', and the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051125044631/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/BURAWOY/workingpapers.htm].

Public sociology faces fierce criticism on the grounds of both of its logic and its goals.  Its critics claim that it is based on a [[false premise]] of consensus in the sociological community, arguing that "it greatly overestimates the uniformity of the moral and political agenda of sociologists".&lt;ref name="nielsen"&gt;Francois Nielsen. 2004. "The Vacant 'We': Remarks on Public Sociology."  Social Forces, Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1619-1627&lt;/ref&gt;  They question the possibility and the desirability of such moral agreement, pointing out that "almost every social issue involves moral dilemmas, not moral clarity. What is or is not 'just' is almost never unambiguous".&lt;ref name="tittle"/&gt;  Others argue that public sociology is based on an uncritical and overly idealistic perception of the public sphere.&lt;ref name="brady"&gt;Brady, David. 2004. "Why Public Sociology May Fail."  ''Social Forces'', Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1629-1638&lt;/ref&gt; Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. Sociological Spectrum. 36 (3). P. 183-190. DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2015.1102666&lt;/ref&gt; argues that public sociology relies on a dialectical, unilineal evolutionary view of social change. If a public sociologist assumes a multi-lineal interpretation of social change, public sociology will fail to affect social change for three reasons: (1) there's no objective criteria for the assessment of different goals (2) the rejection of one goal does not necessarily lead to an adherence to some other particular goal and (3) criticizing a goal maintains its relevance at the expense of possible alternatives.

Even stronger critiques come from academics who believe that the program of public sociology will unduly politicize the discipline and thus endanger the legitimacy sociology has in the public dialogue.&lt;ref name="tittle"&gt;Tittle, Charles. 2004. [http://cooley.ad.wsu.edu/schwartj/pdf/PublicSoc.pdf "The Arrogance of Public Sociology"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Social Forces'', June 2004, 82(4).&lt;/ref&gt;  These critics argue that the project of building a reliable body of knowledge about society is fundamentally incompatible with the goals of public sociology: "To the extent that we orient our work around moral principles, we are less likely to attend to theoretical issues. The greater the extent to which we favor particular outcomes, the less able are we to design our work to actually access such outcomes. And the more ideologically oriented our objectives, the less the chance that we can recognize or assimilate contrary evidence. In other words, rather than good professional sociology being mutually interactive with public sociology, I believe that public sociology gets in the way of good professional sociology."&lt;ref name="tittle"/&gt;

One outspoken critic of public sociology was sociologist [[Mathieu Deflem]] of the [[University of South Carolina]], who wrote various papers against public sociology and argued that public sociology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"is neither public nor sociology. Public sociology is not a plea to make sociology more relevant to the many publics in society nor to connect sociology democratically to political activity. Of course sociologists should be public intellectuals. But they should be and can only be public intellectuals as practitioners of the science they practice, not as activists left or right. Yet public sociology instead is a quest to subsume sociology under politics, a politics of a specific kind, not in order to foster sociological activism but to narrow down the sociological discipline to activist sociology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://deflem.blogspot.com/2004/08/letter-to-editor-proper-role-of.html Deflem, Mathieu. 2004. "The Proper Role of Sociology in the World at Large" (letter to the editor), ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', October 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In opposition to public sociology, Deflem used to maintain the website, [http://www.savesociology.org/ SaveSociology.org].

==Applied sociology==

"Applied sociology" and "sociological practice" (also referred to as [[policy sociology]]) has come to refer to [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] using sociological knowledge in an applied setting. Applied sociologists work in a wide variety of settings including universities, government, and private practice, using sociological methods to help communities solve everyday problems, such as improving community policing and crime prevention, evaluating and improving drug courts, assessing the needs of [[inner city]] neighborhoods, developing the capacity of an educational system, or promoting the development of housing and related resources for aging populations.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Roger A, ''Preface'' in Price, Jammie, Straus, Roger and Breese, Jeffrey, editors, ''In Doing Sociology. Case Studies in Sociological Practice'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] (2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7391-3395-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological practice is different from pure academic sociology in which sociologists work in an academic setting such as a university with a teaching and pure research orientation. Although there are some common origins, sociological practice is entirely distinct from [[social work]].&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Roger A, ''Using Sociology: An Introduction From The Applied and Clinical Perspectives'' Third Edition. Rowman &amp; Littlefield (2002), {{ISBN|0-7425-1662-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of universities are attempting to gear curricula toward practical sociology in this way. Clinical sociology courses give students the skills to be able to work effectively with clients, teach basic [[counseling]] skills, give knowledge that is useful for careers such as victims assisting and drug rehabilitation, and teach the student how to integrate sociological knowledge with other fields they may go into such as marriage and family therapy, and clinical social work.

As defined by the Applied Social Sciences Forum (ASSF), applied Social Science (ASS) seeks to highlight the processes of social and political transformation taking place in a particular society. It is characterized by the operational aspect of the knowledge it produces. Unlike pure academic knowledge, applied social sciences try to steer the debate towards scientific priorities of social and political reform and accompanying social transformations. From this point of view, the applied social sciences can be seen as complementary knowledge that enrich both the action and the academic sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assforum.org The Applied Social Science Forum website - assforum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of ASS are to deepen reflection on practical issues related to their objective, to support the major decision making in society and enable researchers to support their knowledge and enrich the range of possible solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Abdelwahab Ben Hafaiedh: The Applied Social Science today - Tunisian Association of Sociology - Tunis 2001 p 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The "action research" is the framework of choice for applied social sciences. Action research can be defined here as a process that involves further intervention by the researcher beyond the return of a single diagnostic assay type, or inventory.

The researcher may, in this way, have several hats within the same search:
* A role of developer issues, logical actions and issues of different actors,
* An expert who accompanies the action from his methodology and science role
* A facilitator role pilot working groups and aims, as and when the progress of its work, its analyzes to confront the realities of stakeholders power feed, 
* A mediator who brings out back and speak different stakeholders of an action system
* A role of facilitator who can help build collective courses of action relevant while remaining outside issues discussed.

The methodological tools of the SSA are:
* Qualitative approaches (different types of interviews and / or collective)
* Quantitative methods using questionnaires and / or literature searches, data processing statistics
* The analysis of practices
* Action research
* Participatory methods

'''Reliability engineering''' is a sub-discipline of [[systems engineering]] that emphasizes [[dependability]] in the [[product lifecycle management|lifecycle management]] of a [[product (business)|product]]. Dependability, or reliability, describes the ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (1990) IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries. New York, NY {{ISBN|1-55937-079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliability is closely related to [[availability]], which is typically described as the ability of a component or system to function at a specified moment or interval of time.

'''Reliability''' is theoretically defined as the [[probability]] of success &lt;math&gt;(\text{Reliability} = 1 - \text{Probability of Failure});&lt;/math&gt; as the frequency of failures; or in terms of [[availability]], as a probability derived from reliability, testability and maintainability. [[Testability]], [[maintainability]] and [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] are often defined as a part of "reliability engineering" in Reliability Programs. Reliability plays a key role in the [[cost-effectiveness]] of systems.

Reliability engineering deals with the estimation, prevention and management of high levels of "lifetime" engineering [[uncertainty]] and [[risk]]s of failure. Although [[stochastic]] parameters define and affect reliability, reliability is not (solely) achieved by mathematics and statistics.&lt;ref&gt;RCM II, Reliability Centered Maintenance, Second edition 2008, page 250-260, the role of Actuarial analysis in Reliability&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.lambdaconsulting.co.za/2012ARS_EU_T1S5_Barnard.pdf|title=Why You Cannot Predict Electronic Product Reliability|conference=2012 ARS, Europe|location=Warsaw, Poland}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cannot really find a root cause (needed to effectively prevent failures) by only looking at statistics. "Nearly all teaching and literature on the subject emphasize these aspects, and ignore the reality that the ranges of uncertainty involved largely invalidate quantitative methods for prediction and measurement."&lt;ref name="O'Connor_2002"&gt;O'Connor, Patrick D. T. (2002), ''Practical Reliability Engineering'' (Fourth Ed.), John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-4708-4462-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is easy to represent "probability of failure" as a symbol or value in an equation, but it is almost impossible to predict its true magnitude in practice, which is massively multivariate, so having the equation for reliability does not begin to equal having an accurate predictive measurement of reliability. 

Reliability engineering relates closely to [[safety engineering]] and to [[system safety]], in that they use common methods for their analysis and may require input from each other. Reliability engineering focuses on costs of failure caused by system downtime, cost of spares, repair equipment, personnel, and cost of warranty claims. Safety engineering normally focuses more on preserving life and nature than on cost, and therefore deals only with particularly dangerous system-failure modes. High reliability ([[safety factor]]) levels also result from good engineering and from attention to detail, and almost never from only reactive failure management (using reliability accounting and statistics).&lt;ref name="lambda"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lambdaconsulting.co.za/rwa%20barnard%20incose%202008.pdf

&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The word ''reliability'' can be traced back to 1816, and is first attested to the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, J.H. and Marais, Ken, "Highlights from the Early (and pre-) History of Reliability Engineering", Reliability Engineering and System Safety, Volume 91, Issue 2, February 2006, Pages 249–256&lt;/ref&gt; Before World War II the term was linked mostly to [[repeatability]]; a test (in any type of science) was considered "reliable" if the same results would be obtained repeatedly. In the 1920s product improvement through the use of [[statistical process control]] was promoted by Dr. [[Walter A. Shewhart]] at [[Bell Labs]],&lt;ref&gt;Juran, Joseph and Gryna, Frank, Quality Control Handbook, Fourth Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1988, p.24.3&lt;/ref&gt; around the time that [[Waloddi Weibull]] was working on statistical models for fatigue. The development of reliability engineering was here on a parallel path with quality. The modern use of the word reliability was defined by the U.S. military in the 1940s, characterizing a product that would operate when expected and for a specified period of time.

In World War II, many reliability issues were due to the inherent unreliability of electronic equipment available at the time, and to fatigue issues. In 1945, M.A. Miner published the seminal paper titled "Cumulative Damage in Fatigue" in an ASME journal. A main application for reliability engineering in the military was for the vacuum tube as used in radar systems and other electronics, for which reliability proved to be very problematic and costly. The IEEE formed the Reliability Society in 1948. In 1950, the [[United States Department of Defense]] formed group called the "Advisory Group on the Reliability of Electronic Equipment" (AGREE) to investigate reliability methods for military equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015013918332|title=Reliability of military electronic equipment;report.|last=|first=|date=4 June 1957|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|year=|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group recommended three main ways of working:

* Improve component reliability
* Establish quality and reliability requirements for suppliers
* Collect field data and find root causes of failures

In the 1960s more emphasis was given to reliability testing on component and system level. The famous military standard 781 was created at that time.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Around this period also the much-used (and also much-debated) military handbook 217 was published by RCA (Radio Corporation of America) and was used for the prediction of failure rates of components. The emphasis on component reliability and empirical research (e.g. Mil Std 217) alone slowly decreases. More pragmatic approaches, as used in the consumer industries, are being used. In the 1980s, televisions were increasingly made up of solid-state semiconductors. Automobiles rapidly increased their use of semiconductors with a variety of microcomputers under the hood and in the dash. Large air conditioning systems developed electronic controllers, as had microwave ovens and a variety of other appliances. Communications systems began to adopt
electronics to replace older mechanical switching systems. Bellcore issued the first consumer prediction methodology for telecommunications, and SAE developed a similar document SAE870050 for automotive applications. The nature of predictions evolved during the decade, and it became apparent that die complexity wasn't the only factor that determined failure rates for Integrated Circuits (ICs).
Kam Wong published a paper questioning the bathtub curve&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Kam, "Unified Field (Failure) Theory-Demise of the Bathtub Curve", Proceedings of Annual RAMS, 1981, pp402-408&lt;/ref&gt;—see also [[reliability-centered maintenance]]. During this decade, the failure rate of many components dropped by a factor of 10. Software became important to the reliability of systems. By the 1990s, the pace of IC development was picking up. Wider use of stand-alone microcomputers was common, and the PC market helped keep IC densities following Moore's law and doubling about every 18 months. Reliability engineering now was more changing towards understanding the [[physics of failure]]. Failure rates for components kept on dropping, but system-level issues became more prominent. [[Systems thinking]] became more and more important. For software, the CCM model (Capability Maturity Model) was developed, which gave a more qualitative approach to reliability. ISO 9000 added reliability measures as part of the design and development portion of Certification. The expansion of the World-Wide Web created new challenges of security and trust. The older problem of too little reliability information available had now been replaced by too much information of questionable value. Consumer reliability problems could now have data and be discussed online in real time. New technologies such as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), handheld GPS, and hand-held devices that combined cell phones and computers all represent challenges to maintain reliability. Product development time continued to shorten through this
decade and what had been done in three years was being done in 18 months. This meant that reliability tools and tasks must be more closely tied to the development process itself. In many ways, reliability became part of everyday life and consumer expectations.

== Overview ==
=== Objective  ===
The objectives of reliability engineering, in decreasing order of priority, are:&lt;ref&gt;Practical Reliability Engineering, P. O'Conner – 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

# To apply engineering knowledge and specialist techniques to prevent or to reduce the likelihood or frequency of failures.
# To identify and correct the causes of failures that do occur despite the efforts to prevent them.
# To determine ways of coping with failures that do occur, if their causes have not been corrected.
# To apply methods for estimating the likely reliability of new designs, and for analysing reliability data.

The reason for the priority emphasis is that it is by far the most effective way of working, in terms of minimizing costs and generating reliable products. The primary skills that are required, therefore, are the ability to understand and anticipate the possible causes of failures, and knowledge of how to prevent them. It is also necessary to have knowledge of the methods that can be used for analysing designs and data.

=== Scope and techniques ===
Reliability engineering for "[[complex systems]]" requires a different, more elaborate systems approach than for non-complex systems. Reliability engineering may in that case involve:

* System availability and mission readiness analysis and related reliability and maintenance requirement allocation
* Functional system failure analysis and derived requirements specification
* Inherent (system) design reliability analysis and derived requirements specification for both hardware and software design
* System diagnostics design
* Fault tolerant systems (e.g. by redundancy)
* Predictive and preventive maintenance (e.g. reliability-centered maintenance)
* Human factors / human interaction / human errors 
* Manufacturing- and assembly-induced failures (effect on the detected "0-hour quality" and reliability)
* Maintenance-induced failures
* Transport-induced failures
* Storage-induced failures
* Use (load) studies, component stress analysis, and derived requirements specification
* Software (systematic) failures
* Failure / reliability testing (and derived requirements)
* Field failure monitoring and corrective actions
* Spare parts stocking (availability control)
* Technical documentation, caution and warning analysis 
* Data and information acquisition/organisation (creation of a general reliability development hazard log and [[Failure reporting, analysis, and corrective action system|FRACAS]] system)
* Chaos Engineering

Effective reliability engineering requires understanding of the basics of [[failure cause|failure mechanisms]] for which experience, broad engineering skills and good knowledge from many different special fields of engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliabilityweb.com/index.php/articles/where_do_reliability_engineers_come_from/|title=Articles  –  Where Do Reliability Engineers Come From?  –  ReliabilityWeb.com: A Culture of Reliability|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example:

* [[Tribology]] 
* [[Stress (mechanics)]] 
* [[Fracture mechanics]] / [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] 
* [[Thermal engineering]]
* [[Fluid mechanics]] / shock-loading engineering
* [[Electrical engineering]]
* [[Chemical engineering]] (e.g. [[corrosion]])
* [[Material science]]

=== Definitions ===
Reliability may be defined in the following ways:
* The idea that an item is fit for a purpose with respect to time
* The capacity of a designed, produced, or maintained item to perform as required over time
* The capacity of a population of designed, produced or maintained items to perform as required over specified time
* The resistance to failure of an item over time
* The probability of an item to perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified period of time
* The durability of an object

=== Basics of a reliability assessment ===
Many engineering techniques are used in reliability [[risk assessment]]s, such as reliability [[hazard analysis]], [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA),&lt;ref&gt;Using Failure Modes, Mechanisms, and Effects Analysis in Medical Device Adverse Event Investigations, S. Cheng, D. Das, and M. Pecht, ICBO: International Conference on Biomedical Ontology, Buffalo, NY, July 26–30, 2011, pp. 340–345&lt;/ref&gt; [[fault tree analysis]] (FTA), [[Reliability Centered Maintenance]], (probabilistic) load and material stress and wear calculations, (probabilistic) fatigue and creep analysis, human error analysis, manufacturing defect analysis, reliability testing, etc. It is crucial that these analysis are done properly and with much attention to detail to be effective. Because of the large number of reliability techniques, their expense, and the varying degrees of reliability required for different situations, most projects develop a reliability program plan to specify the reliability tasks ([[statement of work]] (SoW) requirements) that will be performed for that specific system.

Consistent with the creation of a [[safety case]]s, for example [[ARP4761]], the goal of reliability assessments is to provide a robust set of qualitative and quantitative evidence that use of a component or system will not be associated with unacceptable risk. The basic steps to take&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=System Safety Handbook|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/risk_management/ss_handbook/|author=Federal Aviation Administration|accessdate=2 June 2013|format=PDF|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; are to:
 
* First thoroughly identify relevant unreliability "hazards", e.g. potential conditions, events, human errors, failure modes, interactions, failure mechanisms and root causes, by specific analysis or tests.
* Assess the associated system risk, by specific analysis or testing.
* Propose mitigation, e.g. [[requirement]]s, design changes, detection logic, maintenance, training, by which the risks may be lowered and controlled for at an acceptable level.
* Determine the best mitigation and get agreement on final, acceptable risk levels, possibly based on cost/benefit analysis.

[[Risk]] here is the combination of probability and severity of the failure incident (scenario) occurring.

In a ''de minimis'' definition, severity of failures includes the cost of spare parts, man-hours, logistics, damage (secondary failures), and downtime of machines which may cause production loss. A more complete definition of failure also can mean injury, dismemberment, and death of people within the system (witness mine accidents, industrial accidents, space shuttle failures) and the same to innocent bystanders (witness the citizenry of cities like Bhopal, Love Canal, Chernobyl, or Sendai, and other victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami)—in this case, reliability engineering becomes system safety.  What is acceptable is determined by the managing authority or customers or the affected communities. Residual risk is the risk that is left over after all reliability activities have finished, and includes the un-identified risk—and is therefore not completely quantifiable.

[[File:Risk Cost Analysis.jpg|thumb|Risk vs cost/complexity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Structural Integrity Analysis|author=Kokcharov I.|contribution= Structural Safety|url=http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t6/SIA_6_Structural_Safety.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The complexity of the technical systems such as Improvements of Design and Materials, Planned Inspections, Fool-proof design, and Backup Redundancy decreases risk and increases the cost. The risk can be decreased to ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) or ALAPA (as low as practically achievable) levels.

== Reliability and availability program plan ==
Implementing a reliability program is not simply a software purchase; it's not just a checklist of items that must be completed that will ensure one has reliable products and processes. A reliability program is a complex learning and knowledge-based system unique to one's products and processes. It is supported by leadership, built on the skills that one develops within a team, integrated into business processes and executed by following proven standard work practices.&lt;ref&gt;Reliability Hotwire – July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A reliability program plan is used to document exactly what "best practices" (tasks, methods, tools, analysis, and tests) are required for a particular (sub)system, as well as clarify customer requirements for reliability assessment. For large-scale complex systems, the reliability program plan should be a separate [[document]]. Resource determination for manpower and budgets for testing and other tasks is critical for a successful program. In general, the amount of work required for an effective program for complex systems is large.

A reliability program plan is essential for achieving high levels of reliability, testability, [[maintainability]], and the resulting system [[Availability]], and is developed early during system development and refined over the system's life-cycle. It specifies not only what the reliability engineer does, but also the tasks performed by other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. A reliability program plan is approved by top program Management, which is responsible for allocation of sufficient resources for its implementation.

A reliability program plan may also be used to evaluate and improve the availability of a system by the strategy of focusing on increasing testability &amp; maintainability and not on reliability. Improving maintainability is generally easier than improving reliability. Maintainability estimates (repair rates) are also generally more accurate. However, because the uncertainties in the reliability estimates are in most cases very large, they are likely to dominate the availability calculation (prediction uncertainty problem), even when maintainability levels are very high. When reliability is not under control, more complicated issues may arise, like manpower (maintainers / customer service capability) shortages, spare part availability, logistic delays, lack of repair facilities, extensive retro-fit and complex configuration management costs, and others. The problem of unreliability may be increased also due to the "domino effect" of maintenance-induced failures after repairs. Focusing only on maintainability is therefore not enough. If failures are prevented, none of the other issues are of any importance, and therefore reliability is generally regarded as the most important part of availability. Reliability needs to be evaluated and improved related to both availability and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) due to cost of spare parts, maintenance man-hours, transport costs, storage cost, part obsolete risks, etc.  But, as GM and Toyota have belatedly discovered, TCO also includes the downstream liability costs when reliability calculations have not sufficiently or accurately addressed customers' personal bodily risks.  Often a trade-off is needed between the two.  There might be a maximum ratio between availability and cost of ownership.  Testability of a system should also be addressed in the plan, as this is the link between reliability and maintainability.  The maintenance strategy can influence the reliability of a system (e.g., by preventive and/or predictive maintenance), although it can never bring it above the inherent reliability.

The reliability plan should clearly provide a strategy for availability control. Whether only availability or also cost of ownership is more important depends on the use of the system. For example, a system that is a critical link in a production system—e.g., a big oil platform—is normally allowed to have a very high cost of ownership if that cost translates to even a minor increase in availability, as the unavailability of the platform results in a massive loss of revenue which can easily exceed the high cost of ownership. A proper reliability plan should always address RAMT analysis in its total context. RAMT stands for reliability, availability, maintainability/maintenance, and testability in the context of the customer's needs.

== Reliability requirements ==
For any system, one of the first tasks of reliability engineering is to adequately specify the reliability and maintainability requirements allocated from the overall [[availability]] needs and, more importantly, derived from proper design failure analysis or preliminary prototype test results. Clear requirements (able to designed to) should constrain the designers from designing particular unreliable items / constructions / interfaces / systems. Setting only availability, reliability, testability, or maintainability targets (e.g., max. failure rates) is not appropriate.  This is a broad misunderstanding about Reliability Requirements Engineering.  Reliability requirements address the system itself, including test and assessment requirements, and associated tasks and documentation.  Reliability requirements are included in the appropriate system or subsystem requirements specifications, test plans, and contract statements.  Creation of proper lower-level requirements is critical.&lt;ref&gt;Reliability Maintainability and Risk Practical Methods for Engineers Including Reliability Centred Maintenance and Safety
– David J. Smith (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;references group="27. Todinov M.T., Reliability and Risk Models: setting reliability requirements, Wiley, 2016." /&gt;Provision of only quantitative minimum targets (e.g., MTBF values or failure rates) is not sufficient for different reasons. One reason is that a full validation (related to correctness and verifiability in time) of a quantitative reliability allocation (requirement spec) on lower levels for complex systems can (often) not be made as a consequence of (1) the fact that the requirements are probabilistic, (2) the extremely high level of uncertainties involved for showing compliance with all these probabilistic requirements, and because (3) reliability is a function of time, and accurate estimates of a (probabilistic) reliability number per item are available only very late in the project, sometimes even after many years of in-service use. Compare this problem with the continuous (re-)balancing of, for example, lower-level-system mass requirements in the development of an aircraft, which is already often a big undertaking. Notice that in this case, masses do only differ in terms of only some %, are not a function of time, the data is non-probabilistic and available already in CAD models. In case of reliability, the levels of unreliability (failure rates) may change with factors of decades (multiples of 10) as result of very minor deviations in design, process, or anything else.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Practical Reliability Engineering, O'Conner, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The information is often not available without huge uncertainties within the development phase. This makes this allocation problem almost impossible to do in a useful, practical, valid manner that does not result in massive over- or under-specification. A pragmatic approach is therefore needed—for example:  the use of general levels / classes of quantitative requirements depending only on severity of failure effects. Also, the validation of results is a far more subjective task than for any other type of requirement. (Quantitative) reliability parameters—in terms of MTBF—are by far the most uncertain design parameters in any design.

Furthermore, reliability design requirements should drive a (system or part) design to incorporate features that prevent failures from occurring, or limit consequences from failure in the first place. Not only would it aid in some predictions, this effort would keep from distracting the engineering effort into a kind of accounting work. A design requirement should be precise enough so that a designer can "design to" it and can also prove—through analysis or testing—that the requirement has been achieved, and, if possible, within some a stated confidence.  Any type of reliability requirement should be detailed and could be derived from failure analysis (Finite-Element Stress and Fatigue analysis, Reliability Hazard Analysis, FTA, FMEA, Human Factor Analysis, Functional Hazard Analysis, etc.) or any type of reliability testing. Also, requirements are needed for verification tests (e.g., required overload stresses) and test time needed. To derive these requirements in an effective manner, a [[systems engineering]]-based risk assessment and mitigation logic should be used.  Robust hazard log systems must be created that contain detailed information on why and how systems could or have failed.  Requirements are to be derived and tracked in this way.  These practical design requirements shall drive the design and not be used only for verification purposes.  These requirements (often design constraints) are in this way derived from failure analysis or preliminary tests.  Understanding of this difference compared to only purely quantitative (logistic) requirement specification (e.g., Failure Rate / MTBF target) is paramount in the development of successful (complex) systems.&lt;ref&gt;System Reliability Theory, second edition, Rausand and Hoyland – 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The maintainability requirements address the costs of repairs as well as repair time.  Testability (not to be confused with test requirements) requirements provide the link between reliability and maintainability and should address detectability of failure modes (on a particular system level), isolation levels, and the creation of diagnostics (procedures).
&lt;references group="27. Todinov M.T., Reliability and Risk Models: setting reliability requirements, Wiley, 2016" /&gt;As indicated above, reliability engineers should also address requirements for various reliability tasks and documentation during system development, testing, production, and operation.  These requirements are generally specified in the contract statement of work and depend on how much leeway the customer wishes to provide to the contractor. Reliability tasks include various analyses, planning, and failure reporting.  Task selection depends on the criticality of the system as well as cost.  A safety-critical system may require a formal failure reporting and review process throughout development, whereas a non-critical system may rely on final test reports.  The most common reliability program tasks are documented in reliability program standards, such as MIL-STD-785 and IEEE 1332. Failure reporting analysis and corrective action systems are a common approach for product/process reliability monitoring.

== Reliability culture / human errors / human factors ==
In practice, most failures can be traced back to some type of [[human error]], for example in:

* Management decisions (e.g. in budgeting, timing, and required tasks)
* Systems Engineering: Use studies (load cases)
* Systems Engineering: Requirement analysis / setting
* Systems Engineering: Configuration control 
* Assumptions
* Calculations / simulations / FEM analysis
* Design
* Design drawings
* Testing (e.g. incorrect load settings or failure measurement)
* Statistical analysis
* Manufacturing
* Quality control
* Maintenance
* Maintenance manuals
* Training
* Classifying and ordering of information
* Feedback of field information (e.g. incorrect or too vague)
* etc.

However, humans are also very good at detecting such failures, correcting for them, and improvising when abnormal situations occur. Therefore, policies that completely rule out human actions in design and production processes to improve reliability may not be effective. Some tasks are better performed by humans and some are better performed by machines.&lt;ref&gt;The Blame Machine, Why Human Error Causes Accidents – Whittingham, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, human errors in management; the organization of data and information; or the misuse or abuse of items, may also contribute to unreliability. This is the core reason why high levels of reliability for complex systems can only be achieved by following a robust [[systems engineering]] process with proper planning and execution of the validation and verification tasks. This also includes careful organization of data and information sharing and creating a "reliability culture", in the same way that having a "safety culture" is paramount in the development of safety critical systems.

== Reliability prediction and improvement ==
{{See also|Risk Assessment#Quantitative risk assessment}}
Reliability prediction combines:

* creation of a proper reliability model (see further on this page)
* estimation (and justification) of input parameters for this model (e.g. failure rates for a particular failure mode or event and the mean time to repair the system for a particular failure)
* estimation of output reliability parameters at system or part level (i.e. system availability or frequency of a particular functional failure)

Some recognized reliability engineering specialists (e.g. Patrick O'Connor, R. Barnard) have argued that too much emphasis is often given to the prediction of reliability parameters, instead more effort should be devoted to the prevention of failure (reliability improvement).&lt;ref name="O'Connor_2002" /&gt; Failures can and should be prevented in the first place for most cases. The emphasis on quantification and target setting (e.g. MTBF) might imply there is a limit to achievable reliability, however, there is no inherent limit and development of higher reliability does not need to be more costly. In addition, they argue that prediction of reliability from historic data can be very misleading, with comparisons only valid for identical designs, products, manufacturing processes, and maintenance with identical operating loads and usage environments. Even minor changes in any of these could have major effects on reliability. Furthermore, the most unreliable and important items (i.e. the most interesting candidates for a reliability investigation) are most likely to be modified and re-engineered since historical data was gathered, making the standard (re-active or pro-active) statistical methods and processes used in e.g. medical or insurance industries less effective. Another surprising — but logical — argument is that to be able to accurately predict reliability by testing, the exact mechanisms of failure must be known and therefore — in most cases — could be prevented! Following the incorrect route of trying to quantify and solve a complex reliability engineering problem in terms of MTBF or probability using an-incorrect – for example, the re-active – approach is referred to by Barnard as "Playing the Numbers Game" and is regarded as bad practice.&lt;ref name=lambda/&gt;

For existing systems, it is arguable that any attempt by a responsible program to correct the root cause of discovered failures may render the initial MTBF estimate invalid, as new assumptions (themselves subject to high error levels) of the effect of this correction must be made. Another practical issue is the general unavailability of detailed failure data, with those available often featuring inconsistent filtering of failure (feedback) data, and ignoring statistical errors (which are very high for rare events like reliability related failures). Very clear guidelines must be present to count and compare failures related to different type of root-causes (e.g. manufacturing-, maintenance-, transport-, system-induced or inherent design failures). Comparing different types of causes may lead to incorrect estimations and incorrect business decisions about the focus of improvement.

To perform a proper quantitative reliability prediction for systems may be difficult and very expensive if done by testing. At the individual part-level, reliability results can often be obtained with comparatively high confidence, as testing of many sample parts might be possible using the available testing budget. However, unfortunately these tests may lack validity at a system-level due to assumptions made at part-level testing. These authors emphasized the importance of initial part- or system-level testing until failure, and to learn from such failures to improve the system or part. The general conclusion is drawn that an accurate and absolute prediction — by either field-data comparison or testing — of reliability is in most cases not possible. An exception might be failures due to wear-out problems such as fatigue failures. In the introduction of MIL-STD-785 it is written that reliability prediction should be used with great caution, if not used solely for comparison in trade-off studies.

=== Design for reliability ===
Design for Reliability (DfR) is a process that encompasses tools and procedures to ensure that a product meets its reliability requirements, under its use environment, for the duration of its lifetime. DfR is implemented in the design stage of a product to proactively improve product reliability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/DfR_Solutions_Website/Resources-Archived/Presentations/2016/Design-for-Reliability-Best-Practices.pdf?t=1505335343846&lt;/ref&gt; DfR is often used as part of an overall [[Design for X|Design for Excellence (DfX)]] strategy. 

====Statistics-based approach (i.e. MTBF)====
Reliability design begins with the development of a (system) [[mathematical model|model]]. Reliability and availability models use [[block diagram]]s and [[Fault Tree Analysis]] to provide a graphical means of evaluating the relationships between different parts of the system. These models may incorporate predictions based on failure rates taken from historical data. While the (input data) predictions are often not accurate in an absolute sense, they are valuable to assess relative differences in design alternatives. Maintainability parameters, for example [[Mean time to repair]] (MTTR), can also be used as inputs for such models.

The most important fundamental initiating causes and failure mechanisms are to be identified and analyzed with engineering tools. A diverse set of practical guidance as to performance and reliability should be provided to designers so that they can generate low-stressed designs and products that protect, or are protected against, damage and excessive wear. Proper validation of input loads (requirements) may be needed, in addition to verification for reliability "performance" by testing.
[[File:Fault tree.svg|thumb|280px|A fault tree diagram]]

One of the most important design techniques is [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]]. This means that if one part of the system fails, there is an alternate success path, such as a backup system. The reason why this is the ultimate design choice is related to the fact that high-confidence reliability evidence for new parts or systems is often not available, or is extremely expensive to obtain. By combining redundancy, together with a high level of failure monitoring, and the avoidance of common cause failures; even a system with relatively poor single-channel (part) reliability, can be made highly reliable at a system level (up to mission critical reliability). No testing of reliability has to be required for this. In conjunction with redundancy, the use of dissimilar designs or manufacturing processes (e.g. via different suppliers of similar parts) for single independent channels, can provide less sensitivity to quality issues (e.g. early childhood failures at a single supplier), allowing very-high levels of reliability to be achieved at all moments of the development cycle (from early life to long-term). Redundancy can also be applied in systems engineering by double checking requirements, data, designs, calculations, software, and tests to overcome systematic failures.

Another effective way to deal with reliability issues is to perform analysis that predicts degradation, enabling the prevention of unscheduled downtime events / failures. [[Reliability centered maintenance|RCM]] (Reliability Centered Maintenance) programs can be used for this.

====Physics-of-failure-based approach====
For electronic assemblies, there has been an increasing shift towards a different approach called [[physics of failure]]. This technique relies on understanding the physical static and dynamic failure mechanisms. It accounts for variation in load, strength, and stress that lead to failure with a high level of detail, made possible with the use of modern [[finite element method]] (FEM) software programs that can handle complex geometries and mechanisms such as creep, stress relaxation, fatigue, and probabilistic design ([[Monte Carlo Methods]]/DOE). The material or component can be re-designed to reduce the probability of failure and to make it more robust against such variations. Another common design technique is component [[derating]]: i.e. selecting components whose specifications significantly exceed the expected stress levels, such as using heavier gauge electrical wire than might normally be specified for the expected [[electric current]].

====Common tools and techniques====
Many of the tasks, techniques, and analyses used in Reliability Engineering are specific to particular industries and applications, but can commonly include:

:* [[Physics of failure]] (PoF)
:* [[Built-in test|Built-in self-test]] (BIT) (testability analysis)
:* [[Failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA)
:* Reliability [[hazard analysis]]
:* Reliability block-diagram analysis
:* Dynamic reliability block-diagram analysis&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore Distefano, Antonio Puliafito: Dependability Evaluation with Dynamic Reliability Block Diagrams and Dynamic Fault Trees. IEEE Trans. Dependable Sec. Comput. 6(1): 4–17 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Fault tree analysis]]
:* [[Root cause analysis]]
:* Statistical engineering, [[design of experiments]] – e.g. on simulations / FEM models or with testing
:* Sneak circuit analysis
:* Accelerated testing
:* Reliability growth analysis (re-active reliability)
:* [[Weibull distribution|Weibull]] analysis (for testing or mainly "re-active" reliability)
:* [[Thermal analysis]] by finite element analysis (FEA) and / or measurement
:* Thermal induced, shock and [[vibration fatigue]] analysis by FEA and / or measurement
:* Electromagnetic analysis
:* Avoidance of [[single point of failure]] (SPOF)
:* Functional analysis and functional failure analysis (e.g., function FMEA, FHA or FFA)
:* Predictive and preventive maintenance: reliability centered maintenance (RCM) analysis
:* Testability analysis
:* Failure diagnostics analysis (normally also incorporated in FMEA)
:* Human error analysis
:* Operational hazard analysis 
:* Preventative/Planned Maintenance Optimization (PMO)
:* Manual screening
:* [[Integrated logistics support]]

Results from these methods are presented during reviews of part or system design, and logistics. Reliability is just one requirement among many for a complex part or system. Engineering trade-off studies are used to determine the [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimum]] balance between reliability requirements and other constraints.

=== The importance of language ===

Reliability engineers, whether using quantitative or qualitative methods to describe a failure or hazard, rely on language to pinpoint the risks and enable issues to be solved. The language used must help create an orderly description of the function/item/system and its complex surrounding as it relates to the failure of these functions/items/systems. Systems engineering is very much about finding the correct words to describe the problem (and related risks), so that they can be readily solved via engineering solutions. Jack Ring said that a systems engineer's job is to "language the project." (Ring et al. 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incose.org/wma/library/docs/seven_samurai-martin-paper-v040316a.pdf The Seven Samurais of Systems Engineering], James Martin (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; For part/system failures, reliability engineers should concentrate more on the "why and how", rather that predicting "when". Understanding "why" a failure has occurred (e.g. due to over-stressed components or manufacturing issues) is far more likely to lead to improvement in the designs and processes used &lt;ref name="O'Connor_2002" /&gt; than quantifying "when" a failure is likely to occur (e.g. via determining MTBF). To do this, first the reliability hazards relating to the part/system need to be classified and ordered (based on some form of qualitative and quantitative logic if possible) to allow for more efficient assessment and eventual improvement. This is partly done in pure language and [[proposition]] logic, but also based on experience with similar items. This can for example be seen in descriptions of events in [[fault tree analysis]], [[Failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]] analysis, and hazard (tracking) logs. In this sense language and proper grammar (part of qualitative analysis) plays an important role in reliability engineering, just like it does in [[safety engineering]] or in-general within [[systems engineering]].

Correct use of language can also be key to identifying or reducing the risks of [[human error]], which are often the root cause of many failures. This can include proper instructions in maintenance manuals, operation manuals, emergency procedures, and others to prevent systematic human errors that may result in system failures. These should be written by trained or experienced technical authors using so-called simplified English or [[Simplified Technical English]], where words and structure are specifically chosen and created so as to reduce ambiguity or risk of confusion (e.g. an "replace the old part" could ambiguously refer to a swapping a worn-out part with a non worn-out part, or replacing a part with one using a more recent and hopefully improved design).

==Reliability modeling==
Reliability modeling is the process of predicting or understanding the reliability of a component or system prior to its implementation. Two types of analysis that are often used to model a complete system's availability behavior (including effects from logistics issues like spare part provisioning, transport and manpower) are Fault Tree Analysis and reliability block diagrams. At a component level, the same types of analyses can be used together with others. The input for the models can come from many sources including testing; prior operational experience; field data; as well as data handbooks from similar or related industries. Regardless of source, all model input data must be used with great caution, as predictions are only valid in cases where the same product was used in the same context. As such, predictions are often only used to help compare alternatives.

[[File:Reliability block diagram.png|300px|thumb|right|A reliability block diagram showing a "1oo3" (1 out of 3) redundant designed subsystem]]

For part level predictions, two separate fields of investigation are common:
* The [[physics of failure]] approach uses an understanding of physical failure mechanisms involved, such as mechanical [[crack propagation]] or chemical [[corrosion]] degradation or failure;
* The [[parts stress modeling]] approach is an empirical method for prediction based on counting the number and type of components of the system, and the stress they undergo during operation.
[[Software reliability]] is a more challenging area that must be considered when computer code provides a considerable component of a system's functionality.

=== Reliability theory ===
{{main article|Reliability theory|Failure rate|Survival analysis}}

Reliability is defined as the [[probability]] that a device will perform its intended function during a specified period of time under stated conditions. Mathematically, this may be expressed as,

:&lt;math&gt;R(t)=Pr\{T&gt;t\}=\int_{t}^{\infty} f(x)\, dx \ \!&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;f(x) \!&lt;/math&gt; is the failure [[probability density function]] and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the period of time (which is assumed to start from time zero).

There are a few key elements of this definition:

# Reliability is predicated on "intended function:" Generally, this is taken to mean operation without failure. However, even if no individual part of the system fails, but the system as a whole does not do what was intended, then it is still charged against the system reliability. The system requirements specification is the criterion against which reliability is measured.
# Reliability applies to a specified period of time. In practical terms, this means that a system has a specified chance that it will operate without failure before time &lt;math&gt;t \!&lt;/math&gt;. Reliability engineering ensures that components and materials will meet the requirements during the specified time.  Note that units other than time may sometimes be used (e.g. "a mission", "operation cycles"). 
# Reliability is restricted to operation under stated (or explicitly defined) conditions. This constraint is necessary because it is impossible to design a system for unlimited conditions. A [[Mars Rover]] will have different specified conditions than a family car. The operating environment must be addressed during design and testing. That same rover may be required to operate in varying conditions requiring additional scrutiny.
# Two notable references on reliability theory and its mathematical and statistical foundations are Barlow, R. E. and Proschan, F. (1982) and Samaniego, F. J. (2007).

=== Quantitative system reliability parameters—theory ===
Quantitative requirements are specified using reliability [[parameter]]s. The most common reliability parameter is the [[mean time to failure]] (MTTF), which can also be specified as the [[failure rate]] (this is expressed as a frequency or conditional probability density function (PDF)) or the number of failures during a given period. These parameters may be useful for higher system levels and systems that are operated frequently (i.e. vehicles, machinery, and electronic equipment). Reliability increases as the MTTF increases. The MTTF is usually specified in hours, but can also be used with other units of measurement, such as miles or cycles. Using MTTF values on lower system levels can be very misleading, especially if they do not specify the associated Failures Modes and Mechanisms (The F in MTTF).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In other cases, reliability is specified as the probability of mission success. For example, reliability of a scheduled aircraft flight can be specified as a dimensionless probability or a percentage, as often used in [[system safety]] engineering.

A special case of mission success is the single-shot device or system. These are devices or systems that remain relatively dormant and only operate once. Examples include automobile [[airbags]], thermal [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[missiles]]. Single-shot reliability is specified as a probability of one-time success or is subsumed into a related parameter. Single-shot missile reliability may be specified as a requirement for the probability of a hit. For such systems, the [[safety integrity level|probability of failure on demand]] (PFD) is the reliability measure — this is actually an "unavailability" number. The PFD is derived from failure rate (a frequency of occurrence) and mission time for non-repairable systems.

For repairable systems, it is obtained from failure rate, mean-time-to-repair (MTTR), and test interval. This measure may not be unique for a given system as this measure depends on the kind of demand. In addition to system level requirements, reliability requirements may be specified for critical subsystems. In most cases, reliability parameters are specified with appropriate statistical [[confidence interval]]s.

== Reliability testing ==
The purpose of reliability testing is to discover potential problems with the design as early as possible and, ultimately, provide confidence that the system meets its reliability requirements.

Reliability testing may be performed at several levels and there are different types of testing. Complex systems may be tested at component, circuit board, unit, assembly, subsystem and system levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|url= http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/SCI_paper.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(The test level nomenclature varies among applications.) For example, performing environmental stress screening tests at lower levels, such as piece parts or small assemblies, catches problems before they cause failures at higher levels. Testing proceeds during each level of integration through full-up system testing, developmental testing, and operational testing, thereby reducing program risk. However, testing does not mitigate unreliability risk.

With each test both a statistical type 1 and type 2 error could be made and depends on sample size, test time, assumptions and the needed discrimination ratio. There is risk of incorrectly accepting a bad design (type 1 error) and the risk of incorrectly rejecting a good design (type 2 error).

It is not always feasible to test all system requirements. Some systems are prohibitively expensive to test; some [[failure mode]]s may take years to observe; some complex interactions result in a huge number of possible test cases; and some tests require the use of limited test ranges or other resources. In such cases, different approaches to testing can be used, such as (highly) accelerated life testing, [[design of experiments]], and [[simulation]]s.

The desired level of statistical confidence also plays a role in reliability testing. Statistical confidence is increased by increasing either the test time or the number of items tested. Reliability test plans are designed to achieve the specified reliability at the specified [[confidence interval|confidence level]] with the minimum number of test units and test time. Different test plans result in different levels of risk to the producer and consumer. The desired reliability, statistical confidence, and risk levels for each side influence the ultimate test plan. The customer and developer should agree in advance on how reliability requirements will be tested.

A key aspect of reliability testing is to define "failure". Although this may seem obvious, there are many situations where it is not clear whether a failure is really the fault of the system. Variations in test conditions, operator differences, weather and unexpected situations create differences between the customer and the system developer. One strategy to address this issue is to use a scoring conference process. A scoring conference includes representatives from the customer, the developer, the test organization, the reliability organization, and sometimes independent observers. The scoring conference process is defined in the statement of work. Each test case is considered by the group and "scored" as a success or failure. This scoring is the official result used by the reliability engineer.

As part of the requirements phase, the reliability engineer develops a test strategy with the customer. The test strategy makes trade-offs between the needs of the reliability organization, which wants as much data as possible, and constraints such as cost, schedule and available resources. Test plans and procedures are developed for each reliability test, and results are documented.

Reliability testing is common in the Photonics industry. Examples of reliability tests of lasers are life test and [[burn-in]]. These tests consist of the highly accelerated aging, under controlled conditions, of a group of lasers. The data collected from these life tests are used to predict laser life expectancy under the intended operating characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yelo Reliability Testing |url=http://www.yelo.co.uk/laser-diode-life-test/laser-diode-life-test.html|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reliability test requirements ===
Reliability test requirements can follow from any analysis for which the first estimate of failure probability, failure mode or effect needs to be justified. Evidence can be generated with some level of confidence by testing. With software-based systems, the probability is a mix of software and hardware-based failures. Testing reliability requirements is problematic for several reasons. A single test is in most cases insufficient to generate enough statistical data. Multiple tests or long-duration tests are usually very expensive. Some tests are simply impractical, and environmental conditions can be hard to predict over a systems life-cycle.

Reliability engineering is used to design a realistic and affordable test program that provides empirical evidence that the system meets its reliability requirements. Statistical [[confidence interval|confidence levels]] are used to address some of these concerns. A certain parameter is expressed along with a corresponding confidence level: for example, an [[MTBF]] of 1000 hours at 90% confidence level. From this specification, the reliability engineer can, for example, design a test with explicit criteria for the number of hours and number of failures until the requirement is met or failed. Different sorts of tests are possible.

The combination of required reliability level and required confidence level greatly affects the development cost and the risk to both the customer and producer. Care is needed to select the best combination of requirements—e.g. cost-effectiveness. Reliability testing may be performed at various levels, such as component, [[subsystem]] and [[system]]. Also, many factors must be addressed during testing and operation, such as extreme temperature and humidity, shock, vibration, or other environmental factors (like loss of signal, cooling or power; or other catastrophes such as fire, floods, excessive heat, physical or security violations or other myriad forms of damage or degradation).  For systems that must last many years,  accelerated life tests may be needed.

=== Accelerated testing ===
The purpose of [[accelerated life testing|accelerated life testing (ALT test)]] is to induce field failure in the laboratory at a much faster rate by providing a harsher, but nonetheless representative, environment. In such a test, the product is expected to fail in the lab just as it would have failed in the field—but in much less time.
The main objective of an accelerated test is either of the following:
:* To discover failure modes
:* To predict the normal field life from the high [[stress testing|stress]] lab life
An Accelerated testing program can be broken down into the following steps:
:* Define objective and scope of the test
:* Collect required information about the product
:* Identify the stress(es)
:* Determine level of stress(es)
:* Conduct the accelerated test and analyze the collected data.

Common ways to determine a life stress relationship are:
:* Arrhenius model
:* Eyring model
:* Inverse power law model
:* Temperature–humidity model
:* Temperature non-thermal model

== Software reliability ==
{{further information|Software reliability|Site reliability engineering}}
Software reliability is a special aspect of reliability engineering. System reliability, by definition, includes all parts of the system, including hardware, software, supporting infrastructure (including critical external interfaces), operators and procedures. Traditionally, reliability engineering focuses on critical hardware parts of the system. Since the widespread use of digital [[integrated circuit]] technology, software has become an increasingly critical part of most electronics and, hence, nearly all present day systems.

There are significant differences, however, in how software and hardware behave. 
Most hardware unreliability is the result of a component or material failure that results in the system not performing its intended function. Repairing or replacing the hardware component restores the system to its original operating state. 
However, software does not fail in the same sense that hardware fails. Instead, software unreliability is the result of unanticipated results of software operations. Even relatively small software programs can have astronomically large [[combinations]] of inputs and states that are infeasible to exhaustively test. Restoring software to its original state only works until the same combination of inputs and states results in the same unintended result. Software reliability engineering must take this into account.

Despite this difference in the source of failure between software and hardware, several [[List of software reliability models|software reliability models]] based on statistics have been proposed to quantify what we experience with software: the longer software is run, the higher the probability that it will eventually be used in an untested manner and exhibit a latent defect that results in a failure ([[Shooman]] 1987), (Musa 2005), (Denney 2005).

As with hardware, software reliability depends on good requirements, design and implementation. Software reliability engineering relies heavily on a disciplined [[software engineering]] process to anticipate and design against [[unintended consequence]]s. There is more overlap between software [[quality assurance|quality engineering]] and software reliability engineering than between hardware quality and reliability. A good software development plan is a key aspect of the software reliability program. The software development plan describes the design and coding standards, [[software peer review|peer reviews]], [[unit test]]s, [[configuration management]], [[software metrics]] and software models to be used during software development.

A common reliability metric is the number of software faults, usually expressed as faults per thousand lines of code. This metric, along with software execution time, is key to most software reliability models and estimates. The theory is that the software reliability increases as the number of faults (or fault density) decreases or goes down. Establishing a direct connection between fault density and mean-time-between-failure is difficult, however, because of the way software faults are distributed in the code, their severity, and the probability of the combination of inputs necessary to encounter the fault. Nevertheless, fault density serves as a useful indicator for the reliability engineer. Other software metrics, such as complexity, are also used.  This metric remains controversial, since changes in software development and verification practices can have dramatic impact on overall defect rates.

Testing is even more important for software than hardware. Even the best software development process results in some software faults that are nearly undetectable until tested. As with hardware, software is tested at several levels, starting with individual units, through integration and full-up system testing. Unlike hardware, it is inadvisable to skip levels of software testing. During all phases of testing, software faults are discovered, corrected, and re-tested. Reliability estimates are updated based on the fault density and other metrics. At a system level, mean-time-between-failure data can be collected and used to estimate reliability. Unlike hardware, performing exactly the same test on exactly the same software configuration does not provide increased statistical confidence. Instead, software reliability uses different metrics, such as [[code coverage]].

Eventually, the software is integrated with the hardware in the top-level system, and software reliability is subsumed by system reliability. The Software Engineering Institute's [[capability maturity model]] is a common means of assessing the overall software development process for reliability and quality purposes.

== Comparison to safety engineering ==
Reliability engineering is concerned with overall minimisation of failures that could lead to financial losses for the responsible entity, whereas [[safety engineering]] focuses on minimising a specific set of failure types that in general could lead to large scale, widespread issues beyond the responsible entity.

Reliability hazards could transform into incidents leading to a loss of revenue for the company or the customer, for example due to direct and indirect costs associated with: loss of production due to system unavailability; unexpected high or low demands for spares; repair costs; man-hours; (multiple) re-designs; interruptions to normal production etc.&lt;ref name="Verma, Ajit Kumar 2010"&gt;Reliability and Safety Engineering – Verma, Ajit Kumar, Ajit, Srividya, Karanki, Durga Rao (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety engineering is often highly specific, relating only to certain tightly regulated industries, applications, or areas. It primarily focuses on system safety hazards that could lead to severe accidents including: loss of life; destruction of equipment; or environmental damage. As such, the related system functional reliability requirements are often extremely high. Although it deals with unwanted failures in the same sense as reliability engineering, it, however, has less of a focus on direct costs, and is not concerned with post-failure repair actions. Another difference is the level of impact of failures on society, leading to a tendency for strict control by governments or regulatory bodies (e.g. nuclear, aerospace, defense, rail and oil industries).&lt;ref name="Verma, Ajit Kumar 2010"/&gt;

This can occasionally lead to safety engineering and reliability engineering having contradictory requirements or conflicting choices at a system architecture level.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} For example, in train signal control systems it is common practice to use a "fail-safe" system design concept. In this example, a [[wrong-side failure]] needs an extremely low failure rate as such failures can lead to such severe effects, like frontal collisions of two trains where a signalling failure leads to two oncoming trains on the same track being given GREEN lights. Such systems should be (and thankfully are) designed in a way that the vast majority of failures (e.g. temporary or total loss of signals or open contacts of relays) will generate RED lights for all trains. This is the safe state. This means in the event of a failure, all trains are stopped immediately. This fail-safe logic might, unfortunately, lower the reliability of the system. The reason for this is the higher risk of false tripping, as any failure whether temporary or not may be trigger such a safe – but costly – shut-down state. Different solutions can be applied for similar issues. See the section on fault tolerance below.

=== Fault tolerance ===
{{main article | Fault tolerance}}
Reliability can be increased by using "1oo2" (1 out of 2) redundancy at a part or system level. However, if both redundant elements disagree it can be difficult to know which is to be relied upon. In the previous train signalling example this could lead to lower safety levels as there are more possibilities for allowing "wrong side" or other undetected dangerous failures. Fault-tolerant systems often rely on additional redundancy (e.g. [[triple modular redundancy|2oo3 voting logic]]) where multiple redundant elements must agree on a potentially unsage action before it is performed. This increases both reliability and safety at a system level and is often used for so-called "operational" or "mission" systems. This is common practice in Aerospace systems that need continued availability and do not have a [[fail-safe]] mode. For example, aircraft may use triple modular redundancy for [[flight computer]]s and control surfaces (including occasionally different modes of operation e.g. electrical/mechanical/hydraulic) as these need to always be operational, due to the fact that there are no "safe" default positions for control surfaces such as rudders or ailerons when the aircraft is flying.

=== Basic reliability and mission (operational) reliability ===
The above example of a 2oo3 fault tolerant system increases both mission reliability as well as safety. However, the "basic" reliability of the system will in this case still be lower than a non-redundant (1oo1) or 2oo2 system. Basic reliability engineering covers all failures, including those that might not result in system failure, but do result in additional cost due to: maintenance repair actions; logistics; spare parts etc. For example, replacement or repair of 1 faulty channel in a 2oo3 voting system, (the system is still operating, although with one failed channel it has actually become a 2oo2 system) is contributing to basic unreliability but not mission unreliability. As an example, the failure of the tail-light of an aircraft will not prevent the plane from flying (and so is not considered a mission failure), but it does need to be remedied (with a related cost, and so does contribute to the basic unreliability levels).

=== Detectability and common cause failures ===
When using fault tolerant (redundant architectures) systems or systems that are equipped with protection functions, detectability of failures and avoidance of common cause failures becomes paramount for safe functioning and/or mission reliability.

== Reliability versus quality (Six Sigma) ==
[[Six Sigma]] has its roots in manufacturing. Reliability engineering is a specialty engineering part of systems engineering. The systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time. The systems engineering process must begin by discovering a real (potential) problem that needs to be solved; the biggest failure that can be made in systems engineering is finding an elegant solution to the wrong problem&lt;ref&gt;[http://g2sebok.incose.org/app/mss/asset.cfm?ID=INCOSE%20G2SEBOK%202.14&amp;ST=F INCOSE SE Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;  (or in terms of reliability: "providing elegant solutions to the wrong root causes of system failures").

The everyday usage term "quality of a product" is loosely taken to mean its inherent degree of excellence. In industry, a more precise definition of quality as "conformance to requirements or specifications at the start of use" is used. Assuming the final product specification adequately captures the original requirements and customer/system needs, the quality level can be measured as the fraction of product units shipped that meet specifications.&lt;ref name="itl.nist.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/apr/section1/apr111.htm|title=8.1.1.1. Quality versus reliability|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variation of this static output may affect quality and reliability, but this is not the total picture. More inherent aspects may play a role, and in some cases, these may not be readily measured or controlled by any means. At a part level microscopic material variations such as unavoidable micro-cracks and chemical impurities may over time (due to physical or chemical "loading") become macroscopic defects. At a system level, systematic failures may play a dominant role (e.g. requirement errors or software or software compiler or design flaws).

Furthermore, for more complex systems it should be questioned if derived or lower-level requirements and related product specifications are truly valid and correct? Will these result in premature failure due to excessive wear, fatigue, corrosion, and debris accumulation, or other issues such as maintenance induced failures? Are there any interactions at a system level (as investigated by for example Fault Tree Analysis)? How many of these systems still meet function and fulfill the needs after a week of operation? What performance losses occurred? Did full system failure occur? What happens after the end of a one-year warranty period? And what happens after 50 years (a common lifetime for aircraft, trains, nuclear systems, etc.)? That is where "reliability" comes in. These issues are far more complex and can not be controlled only by a standard "quality" (six sigma) way of working. They need a [[systems engineering]] approach.[Statement of creed, not fact.]

Quality is a snapshot at the start of life and mainly related to control of lower-level product specifications. This includes time-zero defects i.e. where manufacturing mistakes escaped final Quality Control. In theory the quality level might be described by a single fraction of defective products. Reliability (as a part of systems engineering) acts as more of an ongoing account of operational capabilities, often over many years. Theoretically, all items will fail over an infinite period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/thermo/probability.html|title=The Second Law of Thermodynamics, Evolution, and Probability|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defects that appear over time are referred to as reliability fallout. To describe reliability fallout a probability model that describes the fraction fallout over time is needed. This is known as the life distribution model.&lt;ref name="itl.nist.gov"/&gt; Some of these reliability issues may be due to inherent design issues, which may exist even though the product conforms to specifications. Even items that are produced perfectly may fail over time due to one or more failure mechanisms (e.g. due to human error or mechanical, electrical, and chemical factors). These reliability issues can also be influenced by acceptable levels of variation during initial production.

Quality is therefore related to manufacturing, and reliability is more related to the validation of sub-system or lower item requirements, (system or part) inherent design and life cycle solutions. Items that do not conform to (any) product specification will generally do worse in terms of reliability (having a lower MTTF), but this does not always have to be the case. The full mathematical quantification (in statistical models) of this combined relation is in general very difficult or even practically impossible. In cases where manufacturing variances can be effectively reduced, six sigma tools may be useful to find optimal process solutions which can increase reliability. Six Sigma may also help to design products that are more robust to manufacturing induced failures.

In contrast with Six Sigma, reliability engineering solutions are generally found by focusing on a (system) design and not on the manufacturing process. Solutions are found in different ways, such as by simplifying a system to allow more of the mechanisms of failure involved to be understood; performing detailed calculations of material stress levels allowing suitable safety factors to be determined; finding possible abnormal system load conditions and using this to increase robustness of a design to manufacturing variance related failure mechanisms. Furthermore, reliability engineering uses system-level solutions, like designing redundant and fault-tolerant systems for situations with high availability needs (see [[#Vs Safety engineering|Reliability engineering vs Safety engineering]] above).

Six-Sigma is also more quantified (measurement-based). The core of Six-Sigma is built on empirical research and statistical analysis (e.g. to find transfer functions) of directly measurable parameters. This can not be translated practically to most reliability issues, as reliability is not (easily) measurable due to being very much a function of time (large times may be involved), especially during the requirements-specification and design phases, where reliability engineering is the most efficient. Full quantification of reliability is in this phase extremely difficult or costly (due to the amount of testing required). It also may foster re-active management (waiting for system failures to be measured before a decision can be taken). Furthermore, as explained on this page, Reliability problems are likely to come from many different causes (e.g. inherent failures, human error, systematic failures) besides manufacturing induced defects.

Note: A "defect" in six-sigma/quality literature is not the same as a "failure" (Field failure | e.g. fractured item) in reliability. A six-sigma/quality defect refers generally to non-conformance with a requirement (e.g. basic functionality or a key dimension). Items can, however, fail over time, even if these requirements are all fulfilled. Quality is generally not concerned with asking the crucial question "are the requirements actually correct?", whereas reliability is.

Within an entity, departments related to Quality (i.e. concerning manufacturing), Six Sigma (i.e. concerning process control), and Reliability (product design) should provide input to each other to cover the complete risks more efficiently.

== Reliability operational assessment ==
Once systems or parts are being produced, reliability engineering attempts to monitor, assess, and correct deficiencies. Monitoring includes electronic and visual surveillance of critical parameters identified during the fault tree analysis design stage. Data collection is highly dependent on the nature of the system. Most large organizations have [[quality control]] groups that collect failure data on vehicles, equipment and machinery. Consumer product failures are often tracked by the number of returns. For systems in dormant storage or on standby, it is necessary to establish a formal surveillance program to inspect and test random samples. Any changes to the system, such as field upgrades or recall repairs, require additional reliability testing to ensure the reliability of the modification. Since it is not possible to anticipate all the failure modes of a given system, especially ones with a human element, failures will occur. The reliability program also includes a systematic [[root cause analysis]] that identifies the causal relationships involved in the failure such that effective corrective actions may be implemented. When possible, system failures and corrective actions are reported to the reliability engineering organization.

Some of the most common methods to apply to a reliability operational assessment are [[failure reporting, analysis, and corrective action system]]s (FRACAS). This systematic approach develops a reliability, safety, and logistics assessment based on failure/incident reporting, management, analysis, and corrective/preventive actions. Organizations today are adopting this method and utilizing commercial systems (such as Web-based FRACAS applications) that enable them to create a failure/incident data repository from which statistics can be derived to view accurate and genuine reliability, safety, and quality metrics.

It is extremely important for an organization to adopt a common FRACAS system for all end items. Also, it should allow test results to be captured in a practical way. Failure to adopt one easy-to-use (in terms of ease of data-entry for field engineers and repair shop engineers) and easy-to-maintain integrated system is likely to result in a failure of the FRACAS program itself.

Some of the common outputs from a FRACAS system include Field MTBF, MTTR, spares consumption, reliability growth, failure/incidents distribution by type, location, part no., serial no., and symptom.

The use of past data to predict the reliability of new comparable systems/items can be misleading as reliability is a function of the context of use and can be affected by small changes in design/manufacturing.

== Reliability organizations ==
Systems of any significant complexity are developed by organizations of people, such as a commercial [[company (law)|company]] or a [[government]] agency. The reliability engineering organization must be consistent with the company's [[organizational structure]]. For small, non-critical systems, reliability engineering may be informal. As complexity grows, the need arises for a formal reliability function. Because reliability is important to the customer, the customer may even specify certain aspects of the reliability organization.

There are several common types of reliability organizations. The project manager or chief engineer may employ one or more reliability engineers directly. In larger organizations, there is usually a product assurance or [[specialty engineering]] organization, which may include reliability, [[maintainability]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], safety, [[human factors]], [[logistics]], etc. In such case, the reliability engineer reports to the product assurance manager or specialty engineering manager.

In some cases, a company may wish to establish an independent reliability organization. This is desirable to ensure that the system reliability, which is often expensive and time-consuming, is not unduly slighted due to budget and schedule pressures. In such cases, the reliability engineer works for the project day-to-day, but is actually employed and paid by a separate organization within the company.

Because reliability engineering is critical to early system design, it has become common for reliability engineers, however, the organization is structured, to work as part of an [[integrated product team]].

== Education ==
Some universities offer graduate degrees in reliability engineering. Other reliability engineers typically have an engineering degree, which can be in any field of engineering, from an accredited university or college program. Many engineering programs offer reliability courses, and some universities have entire reliability engineering programs. A reliability engineer may be registered as a [[professional engineer]] by the state, but this is not required by most employers. There are many professional conferences and industry training programs available for reliability engineers. Several professional organizations exist for reliability engineers, including the American Society for Quality Reliability Division (ASQ-RD),&lt;ref&gt;[http://asqrd.org American Society for Quality Reliability Division (ASQ-RD)]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[IEEE Reliability Society]], the [[American Society for Quality]] (ASQ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/cert/reliability-engineer American Society for Quality (ASQ)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Society of Reliability Engineers (SRE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sre.org Society of Reliability Engineers (SRE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of engineers have provided a list of useful tools for reliability engineering. These include: RelCalc software, Military Handbook 217 (Mil-HDBK-217), and the NAVMAT P-4855-1A manual. Analyzing failures and successes coupled with a quality standards process also provides systemized information to making informed engineering designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Top Tools for a Reliability Engineer's Toolbox: 7 Reliability Engineering Experts Reveal Their Favorite Tools, Tips and Resources|url = http://www.camcode.com/asset-tags/top-tools-in-a-reliability-engineers-toolbox/#badge|website = Asset Tag &amp; UID Label Blog|access-date = 2016-01-18|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7231">The '''strong programme''' or '''strong sociology''' is a variety of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] (SSK) particularly associated with [[David Bloor]],&lt;ref&gt;David Bloor,  "The strengths of the strong programme." ''Scientific rationality: The sociological turn'' (Springer Netherlands, 1984) pp. 75-94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald A. MacKenzie]],&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacKenzie, "Notes on the science and social relations debate." ''Capital &amp; Class'' 5.2 (1981): 47-60.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Henry (historian)|John Henry]]. The strong programme's influence on [[Science and Technology Studies]] is credited as being unparalleled ([[Bruno Latour|Latour]] 1999). The largely [[Edinburgh]]-based school of thought has illustrated how the existence of a [[scientific community]], bound together by allegiance to a shared [[paradigm]], is a prerequisite for normal scientific activity.

The strong programme is a reaction against "weak" sociologies of science, which restricted the application of sociology to "failed" or "false" theories, such as [[phrenology]]. Failed theories would be explained by citing the researchers' biases, such as covert political or economic interests. Sociology would be only marginally relevant to successful theories, which succeeded because they had revealed a true fact of nature. The strong programme proposed that both "true" and "false" scientific theories should be treated the same way. Both are caused by social factors or conditions, such as cultural context and self-interest. All human knowledge, as something that exists in the human cognition, must contain some social components in its formation process.

==Characteristics==
As formulated by David Bloor,&lt;ref&gt;David Bloor, ''Knowledge and Social Imagery'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; the strong programme has four indispensable components:
#''Causality'':  it examines the conditions (psychological, social, and cultural) that bring about claims to a certain kind of knowledge.
#''Impartiality'':  it examines successful as well as unsuccessful knowledge claims.
#''Symmetry'': the same types of explanations are used for successful and unsuccessful knowledge claims alike.
#''Reflexivity'': it must be applicable to sociology itself.

==History==
Because the strong programme originated at the 'Science Studies Unit,' [[University of Edinburgh]], it is sometimes termed the [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|Edinburgh School]]. However, there is also a Bath School associated with [[Harry Collins]] that makes similar proposals. In contrast to the Edinburgh School, which emphasizes historical approaches, the Bath School emphasizes microsocial studies of laboratories and experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Harry M. Collins, "Introduction: Stages in the empirical programme of relativism." ''Social studies of science'' (1981): 3-10. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/284733 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bath school, however, does depart from the strong programme on some fundamental issues. In the [[social construction of technology]] (SCOT) approach developed by Collins' student [[Trevor Pinch]], as well as by the Dutch sociologist [[Wiebe Bijker]], the strong programme was extended to technology. There are SSK-influenced scholars working in [[science and technology studies]] programs throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wiebe E. Bijker, et al. ''The social construction of technological systems: New directions in the sociology and history of technology'' (MIT press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In order to study scientific knowledge from a sociological point of view, the strong programme has adhered to a form of radical [[relativism]]. In other words, it argues that – in the social study of institutionalised beliefs about "truth" – it would be unwise to use "truth" as an explanatory resource. That would be to include the answer as part of the question (Barnes 1992), not to mention a thoroughly "[[Whig history|whiggish]]" approach towards the study of history – that is an approach seeing human history as an inevitable march towards truth and enlightenment.  [[Alan Sokal]] has criticised radical relativism as part of the [[science wars]], on the basis that such an understanding will lead inevitably towards [[solipsism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Markus Seidel attacks the main arguments – [[underdetermination]] and norm-circularity – provided by Strong Programme proponents for their relativism.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Seidel ''Epistemic Relativism. A Constructive Critique'', 2014, Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Strong programme scholars insist that their approach has been misunderstood by such a criticism and that its adherence to radical relativism is strictly methodological.

The '''All-Earth Ecobot Challenge''' (or Ecobots) is a competition that occurs yearly for students throughout [[Texas]] in grades 5-8 that started in 2009. It encourages students to be creative, learn more about [[robots]], learn about the [[Natural environment|environment]] and how to help protect it, and prepares them for future jobs. The Ecobot Challenge uses various [[Lego]] pieces, [[Lego NXT|Lego NXT sets]], and [[PowerPoint]].

The All Earth Ecobot Challenge happens once a year for students in Texas. It started in 2009 and is for grades 5-8 It helps students learn about the environment, robots, creativity, and preparation for their future careers.

==Preparation==
Usually, a teacher from each school helps coaches teams that come before and/or after school to prepare by programming their [[Lego NXT|NXT]] and sometimes creating their Marketing Presentation(which could also be done at home, but not the [[Lego NXT|NXT]] programming)  in that teacher's classroom. Usually, the team starts to program and make their presentation in early March of earlier.

==Competition==
The competition held yearly consists of two sections: the Robotics section and the Marketing section. They are two separate parts to the competition. The competition is usually help around mid-April. The robot in the competition is only allowed to be touched in "Home". Home is where the robot starts and ends when completing challenges.

===Robotics===
This section requires students to program a [[Lego NXT]] to complete various tasks that change each year. The more tasks students complete, the more points they get (for a maximum of 300 points). To complete the various tasks, students build [[Lego]] attachments usually attached to the motors included in the  Lego NXT kit.

===Marketing===
This section requires students to think of and to make a PowerPoint presentation about an imaginary [[robot]] that will help the Earth environmentally. They present their presentation to judges who score them.

===Sponsors===
The Lego NXT sets and the competition is costly. Ecobots rely on [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] to fund the competition. For a list of sponsors, go to their [http://www.ecobotchallenge.com/sponsors.shtml sponsor list page].

The '''Third-person effect''' &lt;ref name=Davison1983&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davison|first=W.|title=The third-person effect in communication|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1983|volume=47|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1086/268763}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hypothesis]]  predicts that people tend to perceive that [[Mass communication|mass media]] messages have a greater effect on others than on themselves, based on personal [[bias]]es. The Third-person effect manifests itself through an individual’s overestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message on the generalized other, or an underestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message on themselves.

These types of perceptions stem from a self-motivated social desirability (not feeling influenced by mass messages promotes [[self-esteem]]), a social-distance [[corollary]] (choosing to dissociate oneself from the others who may be influenced) and a perceived exposure to a message (others choose to be influenced by [[persuasive]] communication).&lt;ref name="Davison1983"/&gt; Other names for the effect are "Third-person perception" and "Web Third-person effect". From 2015 the effect named "Web Third-person effect" when it is verified in social media, media websites, blogs and in websites in general.&lt;ref name="Antonopoulos 48–58"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antonopoulos|first=Nikos|title=Web Third-person effect in structural aspects of the information on media websites|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=March 2015|volume=44|issue=3|pages=48–58|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.11.022|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundations and Articulation of the Hypothesis==

Sociologist W. Phillips Davison, who first articulated the third-person effect hypothesis in 1983, explains that the phenomenon first piqued his interest in 1949 or 1950 upon learning of a Japanese attempt during [[World War II]] to dissuade black U.S. soldiers from fighting at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] using propaganda.  As Davison recounts, the leaflets stressed that the Japanese did not have a quarrel with the black soldiers and that they should give up or desert.  Although there was no indication that the leaflets had any effect on the soldiers, the incident preceded a substantial reshuffle among the officers and the unit was withdrawn the next day.&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

Several years later while interviewing [[West Germany|West German]] journalists to determine the influence of the press on foreign policy, Davison asked the journalists to estimate the influence their editorials had on readers.  Although no evidence could be found to support their claims, Davison writes that a common response was, “The editorials have little effect on people like you and me, but the ordinary reader is likely to be influenced quite a lot.”&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

In both anecdotes, the parties that evaluated the impact of the communication estimated a larger media effect for others than on self.  These and other experiences led Davison to articulate what he called the third-person effect hypothesis, which predicts:

:“people will tend to overestimate the influence that mass communications have on the attitudes and behavior of others.  More specifically, individuals who are members of an audience that is exposed to a persuasive communication (whether or not this communication is intended to be persuasive) will expect the communication to have a greater effect on others than on themselves.  And whether or not these individuals are among the ostensible audience for the message, the impact that they expect this communication to have on others may lead them to take some action.  Any effect that the communication achieves may thus be due not to the reaction of the ostensible audience but rather to the behavior of those who anticipate, or think they perceive, some reaction on the part of others.” (p. 3).&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

In a case study conducted by Douglas McLeod et al. (1997),&lt;ref name=McLeodEvelandNathanson1997/&gt; the third-person effect was analyzed via participants’ perceptions of being influenced by violent or misogynistic lyrics from [[Hip hop music|rap music]]. The sample participants were divided up into three groups: one listened to violent rap music, another heard misogynistic rap music and the third group was the control. All lyrics heard were from actual, recorded songs. The study asked subjects to estimate the effects of listening to these types of lyrics on someone’s behaviors, knowledge and attitudes. They were also asked how these lyrics would affect themselves, students at their university, youth in New York or Los Angeles, and the average person. The study found that students found the rap lyrics to be least influential on themselves and more influential on youths in New York or Los Angeles. Simply put, people are more likely to assume everyone else is more easily influenced by messages than themselves. Furthermore, a recent study conducted by Nikos Antonopoulos et al. (2015),&lt;ref name="Antonopoulos 48–58"/&gt; found characteristics of what users observe when visiting a media [[website]] as well as a prediction model. The influence that this information has over their opinion verifies the existence of Web Third-person effect (WTPE). With the use of an online survey (N = 9150) in all media websites ([[radio station]], [[television station]], portal, [[newspaper]] and email-[[social media]]) it was proved that the variables that have a greater impact either on others or our friends than ourselves are: The number of users being concurrently online on the same media website, the exact number of users having read each article on a media website as well as the number of users having shared a news article on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], or other social networks. Moreover, age is a significant factor that explains the findings and is important to the effect. Additionally, factors that affect the influence of the user generated messages on others than on oneself were found. Furthermore, the more credible the news is perceived to be and when there is not a particular mediated message the WTPE is absent confirming the existing theory.

==Initial Support for the Third-Person Effect Hypothesis==

To support the third-person effect hypothesis, Davison (1983) conducted four minor and informal surveys.  Each survey asked between 25 and 35 participants to estimate the influence of persuasive communication on themselves and others.  Participants estimated self-other effects for (1) a campaign theme on gubernatorial vote choice, (2) television advertising on children, (3) the results of early presidential primaries on vote choice, and (4) campaign messages on presidential vote choice. On average they estimated (1) other New York voters were more influenced by campaign themes than they were personally, (2) other children were more influenced by television advertising than they had been personally, (3) others were more influenced by the results of early presidential primaries than they were personally, and (4) others were more influenced by campaign advertisements than they were personally. Although the surveys were informal, they support the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

===Is Third-Person Perception a Methodological Artifact?===

Price and Tewksbury tested whether the third-person effect was a methodological artifact as a result of asking participants self-other questions in close proximity.  Using a three-condition experiment in which they asked participants in the first condition self-only questions, participants in the second condition other-only questions, and participants in the third condition self and other questions, Price and Tewksbury’s results indicate consistent estimates of self and other estimates across conditions.  These results, then, indicate the effect is not the result of a methodological artifact.&lt;ref name=PriceTewksbury1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=V.|author2=Tewksbury, D. |title=Measuring the third-person effect of news: The impact of question order, contrast and knowledge|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1996|volume=8|issue=2|pages=120–141|doi=10.1093/ijpor/8.2.120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Factors Facilitate the Third-Person Effect==

According to Perloff (1999, 2009),&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perloff2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perloff|first1=R.M.|editor1-last=Bryant|editor1-first=Jennings|editor2-last=Oliver|editor2-first=Mary Beth|title=Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135591106|pages=252–268|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BeOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA252|language=en|chapter=Mass media, social perception, and the third-person effect}}&lt;/ref&gt; two major factors facilitate the third-person effect: judgments of message desirability and perceived social distance (social distance corollary). In their meta-analysis of studies of third-person perception Sun, Pan, and Shen (2008) found that message desirability is the most important moderator of third-person perception.&lt;ref name=SunPanShen2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Y.|author2=Pan, Z. |author3=Shen, L. |title=Understanding the third-person perception: Evidence from a meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2008|volume=58 | issue = 2|pages=280–300|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00385.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-person effects are particularly pronounced when the message is perceived as undesirable—that is, when people infer that “this message may not be so good for me” or “it’s not cool to admit you’re influenced by this media program.” In line with these predictions, people have been found to perceive content that is typically thought to be antisocial to have a larger impact on others than on themselves (e.g., [[Research on the effects of violence in mass media|television violence]], pornography, antisocial rap music).&lt;ref name=Perloff2009 /&gt; Indeed, many researchers have found evidence that undesirable messages, such as violent and hateful messages, yield a greater third-person effect.&lt;ref name=AndsagerWhite2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Andsager|first=J.L.|last2=White|first2=H.A. |title=Self Versus Others: Media, Messages, and the Third-person Effect|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=2007|ISBN=9780805857160 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWkWQzQppZIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DuckMullin1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duck|first=J.M.|author2=Mullin, B.-A. |title=The perceived impact of the mass media: Reconsidering the third person effect|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=25 | issue = 1|pages=77–93|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420250107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuntherHwa1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HoorensRuiter1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoornes|first=V.|author2=Ruiter, S. |title=The optimal impact phenomenon: Beyond the third person effect|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1996|volume=26|issue=4|pages=599–610|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199607)26:4&lt;599::aid-ejsp773&gt;3.0.co;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, when messages are perceived as desirable, people are not so likely to exhibit a third-person effect. According to Perloff (2009),&lt;ref name=Perloff2009 /&gt; the first-person effect, or reversed third-person effect, is more common for desirable messages&lt;ref name=CohenDavis1991 /&gt; and seems to emerge when agreement with the message reflects positively on the self and to some degree when the message touches on topics that are congruent with the orientation of groups with which individuals identify. According to the self-enhancement view, if the third-person effect is driven by a desire to preserve self-esteem, people should be willing to acknowledge effects for communications that are regarded as socially desirable, healthy, or otherwise good for the self.&lt;ref name=HoorensRuiter1996 /&gt; Undergraduates perceived that others will be more influenced than themselves by cigarette ads but they will be more affected by anti-tobacco and drunk-driving PSAs.&lt;ref name=Meirick2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meirick|first=P.C.|title=Rethinking the target corollary: The effects of social distance, perceived exposure, and perceived predispositions on first-person and third-person perceptions|journal=Communication Research|year=2005|volume=32|issue=6|pages=822–843|doi=10.1177/0093650205281059}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Another factor that influences the magnitude of the third-person effect is perceived social distance between self and comparison others. In the “[[social distance corollary]],” the disparity of self and other is increased as perceived distance between self and comparison others is increased.&lt;ref name=Meirick2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Meirick2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meirick|first=P.C.|title=Topic-relevant reference groups and dimensions of distance: Political advertising and first-and third-person effects|journal=Communication Research|year=2004|volume=31|issue=2|pages=234–255|doi=10.1177/0093650203261514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although social distance is not a necessary condition for the third-person effect to occur, increasing the social distance makes the third-person effect larger. In their meta-analysis, Andsager and White (2007) concluded that “Research consistently finds that others who are anchored to self as a point of reference are perceived to be less influenced by persuasive messages than are others who are not defined and, therefore, not anchored to any point of reference at all” (p.&amp;nbsp;92).&lt;ref name=AndsagerWhite2007 /&gt;

==Psychological Underpinnings of the Third-Person Effect Hypothesis==

Perloff notes that the majority of third-person effect studies attribute the psychological underpinnings of the effect to either attribution theory or biased optimism.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perloff|first=R.M.|title=The third-person effect: A critical review and synthesis|journal=Media Psychology|year=1999|volume=1|issue=4|pages=353–378|doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0104_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Attribution theory]] predicts that actors tend to attribute their actions to situational factors while observers tend to attribute the same actions to dispositional factors.  For example, attribution theory predicts that a student who turns in a late assignment may explain to the professor that the tardiness is uncharacteristic and due to a situational factor like an unusual computer problem while the professor might believe the tardiness was due instead to a dispositional factor like the student’s laziness.  In the context of the third-person effect hypothesis, then, attribution theory explains why a person may think that he or she understands the underlying persuasive aspects of the message while others’ dispositional flaws prevent them from perceiving those same aspects.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

Biased optimism predicts that people tend to judge themselves as less likely than others to experience negative consequences and, conversely, that people tend to judge themselves as more likely than others to experience positive events.  In the context of the third-person effect hypothesis, biased optimism explains why people judge themselves as being less likely than others to be affected by persuasion.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

==Meta-Analytic Support for the Perceptual Component==

In a critical review and synthesis of the third-person effect hypothesis, Perloff (1999) noted that of the 45 published articles that had tested the phenomenon by 1999, all had found support for the perceptual component of the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

One year later, Paul, Salwen, and Dupagne conducted a meta-analysis of 32 empirical analyses that tested the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis.  Their results indicate the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis received robust support (''r'' = .50), especially compared to meta-analyses of other media effects theories.&lt;ref name=PaulSalwenDupagne2000 /&gt;

Paul, Salwen, and Dupagne (2000) also found three significant moderators of the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis: (1) sampling – samples obtained from nonrandom samples yielded greater third-person effect differences than samples obtained from random samples; (2) respondent – samples obtained from student samples yielded greater third-person effect differences than samples obtained from non-student samples; and (3) message – different types of content (e.g., general media messages, pornography, television violence, commercial advertisements, political content, nonpolitical news, etc.) have differing effects on the size of the obtained third-person perceptions.&lt;ref name=PaulSalwenDupagne2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=B.|author2=Salwen, M.B. |author3=Dupagne, M. |title=The third-person effect: A meta-analysis of the perceptual hypothesis|journal=Mass Communication &amp; Society|year=2000|volume=3|issue=1|pages=57–85|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0301_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for the Behavioral Component==

Multiple studies have found support for the behavioral component of the third-person effect hypothesis.  Possibly because Davison noted that censors seldom admit to have been adversely affected by the information they proscribe,&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;  scholars who have found support for the behavioral component have generally operationalized behavior as a willingness to censor content to stop the content from having the perceived negative persuasive impact on others.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

Specifically, scholars have demonstrated that third-person perception predicts willingness to censor pornography,&lt;ref name=Gunther1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunther|first=A.C.|title=Overrating the X-rating: The third-person perception and support for censorship of pornography|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1995|volume=45|issue=1|pages=27–38|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1995.tb00712.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RojasShahFaber1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rojas|first=H.|author2=Shah, D.V. |author3=Faber, R.J. |title=For the good of others: Censorship and the third-person effect|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1996|volume=8|issue=2|pages=163–186|doi=10.1093/ijpor/8.2.163}}&lt;/ref&gt;   television violence,&lt;ref name=RojasShahFaber1996 /&gt;  sexual and violent television in Singapore,&lt;ref name=GuntherHwa1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunther|first=A.C.|author2=Hwa, A.P. |title=Public perceptions of television influence and opinions about censorship in Singapore|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1996|volume=8|issue=3|pages=248–265|doi=10.1093/ijpor/8.3.248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  cigarette, beer, liquor, and gambling advertising,&lt;ref name=ShahFaberYoun1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=D.V.|author2=Faber, R.J. |author3=Youn, S. |title=Susceptibility and severity: Perceptual dimensions underlying the third-person effect|journal=Communication Research|year=1999|volume=26|issue=2|pages=240–267|doi=10.1177/009365099026002006}}&lt;/ref&gt; rap music&lt;ref name=McLeodEvelandNathanson1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLeod|first=D.M.|author2=Eveland, W.P. |author3=Nathanson, A.I. |title=Support for censorship of violent and misogynic rap lyrics: An analysis of the third-person effect|journal=Communication Research|year=1997|volume=24|issue=2|pages=153–174|doi=10.1177/009365097024002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of users being concurrently online on the same media website, the exact number of users having read each article on a media website as well as the number of users having shared a news article on Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks.&lt;ref name="Antonopoulos 48–58"/&gt;

Scholars, however, have not found that third-person perception predicts willingness to censor news or political media content including censorship of press coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial,&lt;ref name=SalwenDriscoll1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salwen|first=M.B.|author2=Driscoll, P.D. |title=Consequences of third-person perception in support of press restrictions in the O.J. Simpson trial|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1997|volume=47|issue=2|pages=60–75|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1997.tb02706.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  support for an independent commission to regulate political communication,&lt;ref name=RucinskiSalmon1990&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rucinski|first=D.|author2=Salmon, C.T. |title=The "other" as the vulnerable voter: A study of the third-person effect in the 1988 U.S. presidential campaign|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1990|volume=2|issue=4|pages=345–368|doi=10.1093/ijpor/2.4.345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or censorship or a Holocaust-denial advertisement.&lt;ref name=PriceTewksburyHuang1998&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1998.tb02745.x|title=Third-person effects on publication of a holocaust-denial advertisement|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=48|issue=2|pages=3|year=1998|last1=Price|first1=V|last2=Tewksbury|first2=D|last3=Huang|first3=L-N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extending the Hypothesis==

Scholars have noted that in some situations, people don’t always estimate greater media effects for others than for themselves.  Indeed, in certain situations people tend to estimate greater media effects on themselves than on others, and in other situations people tend to estimate similar media effects on self and others.  These two phenomena are commonly known as first person and second person effects respectively.

===First Person Effects===

====First Person Perception====

First person effects – the estimation of greater media effects on self than others – tends to happen in situations in which people judge it desirable to be influenced by the media message.  Innes and Zeitz first documented this phenomenon in 1988 when they noticed that participants exposed to content with a violent message exhibited traditional third-person effects while those exposed to a public service announcement exhibited the reverse.  They described this reverse effect, however, only as “something akin to a third person effect” (p.&amp;nbsp;461).&lt;ref name=InnesZeitz1988&gt;{{cite journal|last=Innes|first=J.M.|author2=Zeitz, H. |title=The public's view of the impact of the mass media: A test of the "third-person" effect.|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1988|volume=18|issue=5|pages=457–463|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420180507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later, Cohen and Davis, who found that people tended to overestimate the effect of attack advertisements for disliked candidates on themselves than on others, coined the term “reverse third-person effect” (p.&amp;nbsp;687).&lt;ref name=CohenDavis1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=J.|author2=Davis, R.G. |title=Third-person effects and the differential impact in negative political advertising|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1991|volume=68|issue=4|pages=680–688|doi=10.1177/107769909106800409}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The same year, Tiedge, Silverblatt, Havice, and Rosenfeld coined the term “first-person effect” to refer to the perceived effects of media on self as being more than on others.&lt;ref name=TiedgeEtAl1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiedge|first=J.T.|author2=Silverbaltt, A. |author3=Havice, M.J. |author4=Rosenfeld, R. |title=Discrepancy between perceived first person and perceived third-person mass media effects|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1991|volume=68|issue=1/2|pages=141–154|doi=10.1177/107769909106800115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Gunther &amp; Thorson, in a study that paved the way for extension of the third-person effect hypothesis, demonstrated empirically that the social desirability of the message tended to affect whether participants were likely to exhibit third- or first- person effects.  Socially desirable messages, Gunther and Thorson argue, tend to produce first-person effects while messages that are not perceived as desirable to be influenced by tend to produce traditional third-person effects.&lt;ref name=GuntherThorson1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunther|first=A.C.|author2=Thorson, E. |title=Perceived persuasive effects of commercials and public service announcements: The third-person effect in new domains|journal=Communication Research|year=1992|volume=19|issue=5|pages=574–596|doi=10.1177/009365092019005002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Person Behavioral Effects====

Only a handful of studies have, intentionally or unintentionally, examined the behavioral component of the first-person effect.&lt;ref name=PriceTewksburyHuang1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuhDelormeReid2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huh|first=J.|author2=Delorme, D. |author3=Reid, L.N. |title=The third-person effect and its influence on behavioral outcomes in a product advertising context: The case of direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising|journal=Communication Research|year=2004|volume=31|issue=5|pages=568–599|doi=10.1177/0093650204267934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ParkSalmon2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=H.S.|author2=Salmon, C.T. |title=A test of the third-person effect in public relations: Application of social comparison theory|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=2005|volume=82|pages=25–43|doi=10.1177/107769900508200103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GolanBanning2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golan|first=G.J.|author2=Banning, S. |title=Exploring a link between the third-person effect and the theory of reasoned action: Beneficial ads and social expectations.|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2008|volume=52|issue=2|pages=208–224|doi=10.1177/0002764208321352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Day2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Day|first=A.|title=Out of the living room and into the voting booth: An analysis of corporate public affairs advertising under the third person effect|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2008|volume=52|issue=2|pages=243–260|doi=10.1177/0002764208321354}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Of these, only one has specifically examined a relationship between first-person perceptions and behavioral consequences.  Day examined the relationship between first-person effects from socially desirable issue advertisements and the likelihood of voting for legislation supporting the issue.  Day found a significant relationship between first-person perceptions of the advertisement and the reported likelihood of voting for the legislation.

'''Urban semiotics''' is the study of meaning in urban form as generated by signs, symbols, and their social connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller, Suzanne |title=Review |journal=Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 17, No. 3. (May, 1988), pp. 346-348 |jstor=2069642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most urban semiotic theory is based on [[social semiotics]], which considers social connotations, including meanings related to ideology and power structures, in addition to denotative meanings of signs.  As such, urban semiotics focuses on material objects of the built environment, such as streets, squares, parks, and buildings, but also unbuilt cultural products such as building codes, planning documents, unbuilt designs, real estate advertising, and popular discourse about the city,&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.5&lt;/ref&gt; such as architectural criticism and real estate blogs.

Theorists who take a social semiotic approach to urban semiotics define their discipline in opposition to the methods of [[behavioral geography]], beginning with the work of [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] in ''The Image of the City'', which they criticize for being limited by its exclusive focus on the denotative level of communication (recognition of spatial elements, such as paths, as conceptual objects), ignoring the connotative meanings associated with urban forms; instead, urban semioticians argue that urban structures often become recognizable because they have symbolic meaning beyond their functional meanings.  The social semiotic approach to urban semiotics also grew out of a critique of architectural semiotics, which was perceived to be overly attached to linguistic models of semiosis and thus unable to adequately consider the social connotations of signs.&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener and Lagopoulos, 1986. p.6-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theorists have used semiotic models in empirical studies of the construction of meaning in urban environments.  Raymond Ledrut has used questionnaires and interviews about viewers' responses to sets of photographs in order to examine the role of class in shaping mental models of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ledrut, Raymond.  “The Images of the City,” in ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', Gottdienier, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.219-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Martin Krampen]] conducted studies of photograph recognition in order to discover the level of facade detail required to identify building types, and to examine the role of socioeconomic status in shaping preference for building styles.&lt;ref&gt;Krampen, M.  ''Meaning in the Urban Environment''.  London: Pion, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CVRD6windrow.matureing.jpg|thumb|right|Maturing windrows at an [[in-vessel composting]] facility.]]
In [[agriculture]], '''windrow composting''' is the production of [[compost]] by piling [[organic matter]] or [[biodegradable waste]], such as animal manure and crop residues, in long rows (''[[windrow]]s''). This method is suited to producing large volumes of compost. These rows are generally turned to improve porosity and oxygen content, mix in or remove moisture, and redistribute cooler and hotter portions of the pile. Windrow composting is a commonly used farm scale [[composting]] method. Composting process control parameters include the initial ratios of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] rich materials, the amount of bulking agent added to assure air porosity, the pile size, moisture content, and turning frequency.

The temperature of the windrows must be measured and logged constantly to determine the optimum time to turn them for quicker compost production.

==Compost windrow turners==

Compost windrow turners were developed to produce [[compost]] on a large scale by Fletcher Sims Jr. of Canyon, Texas {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. They are traditionally a large machine that straddles a windrow of 4&amp;nbsp;feet (1.25&amp;nbsp;meters) or more high, by as much as 12&amp;nbsp;feet (3.5&amp;nbsp;meters) across. Although smaller machines exist for small windrows, most operations use large machines for volume production. Turners drive through the windrow at a slow rate of forward movement. They have a steel drum with paddles that are rapidly turning. As the turner moves through the windrow, fresh air ([[oxygen]]) is injected into the compost by the drum/paddle assembly, and waste gases produced by bacterial [[decomposition]] are vented. The oxygen feeds the aerobic bacteria and thus speeds the composting process.

;Utilization
To properly use a compost windrow turner, it is ideal to compost on a hard surfaced pad. Heavy-duty compost windrow turners allow the user to obtain optimum results with the aerobic hot composting process. By using [[four wheel drive]] or [[Caterpillar track|tracks]] the windrow turner is capable of turning compost in windrows located in remote locations. With a [[self-trailering]] option this allows the compost windrow turner to convert itself into a trailer to be pulled by a semi-truck [[tractor]]. These two options combined allow the compost windrow turner to be easily hauled anywhere and to work compost windrows in muddy and wet locations.

==Specific applications==
Molasses-based distilleries all over the world generate large amount of effluent termed as spent wash or [[vinasse]]. For each liter of alcohol produced, around 8&amp;nbsp;liters of effluent is generated. This effluent has [[Chemical_oxygen_demand|COD]] of 1,50,000 PPM and [[Biochemical_oxygen_demand|BOD]] of 60,000 PPM and even more. This effluent needs to be treated and the only effective method for conclusive disposal is by composting.

Sugar factories generate pressmud / cachaza during the process and the same has about 30% fibers as carbon and has large amounts of water. This pressmud is dumped on prepared land in the form of 100&amp;nbsp;meters long windrows of 3&amp;nbsp;meters x 1.5&amp;nbsp;meters and spent wash is sprayed on the windrow while the windrow is being turned. These machines help consume spent wash of about 2.5 times of the volume of the pressmud, which means that a 100&amp;nbsp;meters of windrow accommodates about 166 MT of pressmud and uses about 415&amp;nbsp;m³ of Spent wash in 50&amp;nbsp;days.

Microbial Culture (organic solution) TRIO COM-CULT is used about 1&amp;nbsp;kg per MT of pressmud for fast de-composing of the spent wash. Hundreds of thousands of square meters of spent wash is being composted all over the world in countries like India, Colombia, Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, South Africa etc.

The compost yard has to be prepared in such a way that the land is impervious and does not allow the liquid effluent to pass down into the earth. The compost thus generated is of excellent quality and is rich in nutrients.
