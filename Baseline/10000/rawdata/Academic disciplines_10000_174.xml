'''Advanced Placement Human Geography''' (also known as '''AP Human Geo''', '''AP Geography''', '''APHG''', '''AP HuGe''', '''HGAP''', '''AP HuGs''', '''APHUG''', '''AP HUMAN''', or '''High School Ap Human''') is an [[Advanced Placement]] [[social studies]] course that studies [[human geography]]. The test is administered by [[College Board]].

This college-level course introduces students to the systematic study of patterns and processes that have shaped human understanding, use, and alteration of [[Earth]]'s surface. Students employ spatial concepts and landscape analyses to analyze human social organization and its environmental consequences. They also learn about the methods and tools geographers use in their science and practice.

== Exam ==
The AP Human Geography Exam consists of two sections. The first section consists of 75 [[multiple choice]] questions and the second section consists of 3 free-response questions. The sections are 60 and 75 minutes long, respectively. It is not necessary to answer the free-response questions in essay form; instead, points are awarded on certain key words, examples, and other vital aspects.

The topics covered by the exam are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap-human-geography-course-description.pdf AP Human Geography:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Human Geography==
The curriculum consists of informational book-related homework, which often requires students to strive to learn information independently. The curriculum teaches about diffusion, human traits, religion, and population clusters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10289">In [[computer science]], an '''abstract state machine''' ('''ASM''') is a [[state machine]] operating on [[state (computer science)|states]] that are arbitrary data structures ([[mathematical structure|structure]] in the sense of [[mathematical logic]], that is a nonempty [[Set (mathematics)|set]] together with a number of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] ([[operation (mathematics)|operations]]) and [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] over the set).

The '''ASM Method''' is a practical and scientifically well-founded [[systems engineering]] method that bridges the gap between the two ends of system development:
* the human understanding and formulation of real-world problems ([[requirements analysis|requirements capture]] by accurate high-level modeling at the level of abstraction determined by the given application domain)
* the deployment of their algorithmic solutions by code-executing machines on changing platforms (definition of design decisions, system and implementation details).

The method builds upon three basic concepts: 
* ''ASM'': a precise form of pseudo-code, generalizing [[Finite State Machines]] to operate over arbitrary data structures
* ''ground model'': a rigorous form of blueprints, serving as authoritative reference model for the design
* ''refinement'': a most general scheme for stepwise instantiations of model abstractions to concrete system elements, providing controllable links between the more and more detailed descriptions at the successive stages of system development.

In the original conception of ASMs, a single [[software agent|agent]] executes a program in a sequence of steps, possibly interacting with its environment. This notion was extended to capture [[distributed computing|distributed computations]], in which multiple agents execute their programs concurrently.

Since ASMs model algorithms at arbitrary levels of abstraction, they can provide high-level, low-level and mid-level views of a hardware or software design. ASM specifications often consist of a series of ASM models, starting with an abstract ''ground model'' and proceeding to greater levels of detail in successive [[Program refinement|refinements]] or coarsenings.

Due to the algorithmic and mathematical nature of these three concepts, ASM models and their properties of interest can be analyzed using any rigorous form of [[Verification and Validation (software)|verification]] (by reasoning) or [[Verification and Validation (software)|validation]] (by experimentation, testing model executions).

==History==
The concept of ASMs is due to [[Yuri Gurevich]], who first proposed it in the mid-1980s as a way of improving on [[Church–Turing thesis|Turing's thesis]] that every [[algorithm]] is [[Simulation#Computer science|simulated]] by an appropriate [[Turing machine]]. He formulated the ''ASM Thesis'': every algorithm, no matter how [[abstraction|abstract]], is step-for-step [[emulated]] by an appropriate ASM. In 2000, Gurevich [[axiomatic system|axiomatized]] the notion of sequential algorithms, and proved the ASM thesis for them. Roughly stated, the axioms are as follows: states are structures, the [[state transition]] involves only a bounded part of the state, and everything is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[isomorphisms]] of structures. (Structures can be viewed as [[universal algebra|algebras]], which explains the original name ''evolving algebras'' for ASMs.) The axiomatization and characterization of sequential algorithms have been extended to [[parallel computing|parallel]] and interactive algorithms.

In the 1990s, by a community effort, the ASM method was developed, using ASMs for the [[formal specification]] and analysis ([[Verification and Validation (software)|verification and validation]]) of [[computer hardware]] and [[software]]. Comprehensive ASM specifications of [[programming languages]] (including [[Prolog]], [[C (programming language)|C]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]) and [[design language]]s ([[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] and [[Specification and Description Language|SDL]]) have been developed. 
A detailed historical account can be found in the [http://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/AsmBook/ AsmBook] (Chapter 9) or in
[http://www.jucs.org/jucs_8_1/the_origins_and_the this article].

A number of software tools for ASM execution and analysis are available.

'''Algorithmic logic''' is a calculus of programs which allows the expression of [[semantic property|semantic properties]] of programs by appropriate logical [[formula]]s. It provides a [[Software framework|framework]] that enables proving the formulas from the [[axiom]]s of program constructs such as assignment, iteration and composition instructions and from the axioms of the data structures in question see {{harvtxt|Mirkowska|Salwicki|1987}}, {{harvtxt|Banachowski|Kreczmar|Mirkowska|Rasiowa|1977}}.

The following diagram helps to locate algorithmic logic among other [[Mathematical logic|logics]].
&lt;math&gt;\qquad \left [\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{Propositional\ logic}\\or \\ \mathrm{Sentential\ calculus} \end{array}\right ]\subset  \left [\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{Predicate\ calculus} \\or \\ \mathrm{First\ order\ logic}\end{array}\right ]  \subset \left [\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{Calculus\ of\ programs}\\or \\ \mbox{Algorithmic logic} \end{array}\right ] &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The formalized language of algorithmic logic (and of algorithmic theories of various data structures) contains three types of well formed expressions: ''[[Term (logic)|Terms]]'' - i.e. expressions denoting operations on elements of data structures, 
''formulas'' - i.e. expressions denoting the relations among elements of data structures,  ''programs'' - i.e. [[algorithm]]s - these expressions describe the computations.
For semantics of terms and formulas consult pages on [[First-order logic|first order logic]] and Tarski's semantic. The meaning of a program &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the set of possible computations of the program.

Algorithmic logic is one of many logics of programs.
Another logic of programs is dynamic logic, see [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]], {{harvtxt|Harel|Kozen|Tiuryn|2000}}.

The [[Indiana University]] '''Archives of Traditional Music''' holds over 100,000 audio and video individual recordings across over 3500 collections of field, broadcast, and commercial recordings. Its holdings are primarily focused on audiovisual recordings relating to research in the academic disciplines of [[ethnomusicology]], [[folklore]], [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], and various area studies.

==History==
The archive was initiated by [[George Herzog]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1936.  It was modeled on the [[Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv]], where Herzog had worked as an assistant to [[Erich von Hornbostel|Erich M. von Hornbostel]] from 1921–1924. Herzog brought the nascent archive to [[Indiana University]] in 1948 when he was appointed as professor in the Department of Anthropology. The archive was formally established at Indiana University in 1954 under its second director, [[George List]], as the Archives of Folk and Primitive Music.  Its present name, the Archives of Traditional Music, was adopted in 1964 when it became a division of the Folklore Institute.&lt;ref name="ATM Booklet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Archives of Traditional Music Folklore Institute|date=1970|publisher=Indiana University Archives of Traditional Music Folklore Institute|location=Bloomington, IN|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Following insights gained through the Sound Directions Project about a looming crisis in time-based media preservation, staff at the ATM pursued a collaborative strategy for saving its media holdings. In 2008, they participated in a small coalition of archivists and librarians at Indiana University that began a survey of the audio-visual materials held on the Bloomington Campus. The survey was prompted by the recognition that the university held a large amount of time-based media in danger of deterioration and playback obsolescence. This survey revealed that the Bloomington campus held more than a half-million audiovisual recordings across eighty units and that large portions of the University's holdings were at risk for loss. Following the publication of a survey report in 2009, the Office of the Vice Provost for Research funded a preservation planning document under the aegis of what was known as the Media Preservation Initiative (MPI).&lt;ref name="Media Preservation Initiative"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~libarchm/index.php/projects/media-preservation-initiative.html|title=MPI|publisher=Indiana University Archive of Traditional Music|accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the recommendations of the planning document, Indiana University President Michael McRobbie announced a 15 million dollar commitment to the preservation of audio and video recordings on the Bloomington campus.  The resulting endeavor was renamed the Media Preservation and Digitization Initiative (MDPI) which formed a partnership with Memnon Archiving Services to digitally preserve 280,000 audio and video recordings by 2020.&lt;ref name="Media Digitization and Preservation Initiative"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mdpi.iu.edu/index.php |title=MDPI|publisher=Media and Digitization and Preservation Initiative |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, 12,000 films from Indiana University's Moving Image Archives and other campus collections, including the Archives of Traditional Music were added to the efforts of MDPI. As the largest holder of unique and rare audiovisual recordings at Indiana University, nearly all of the archives' 100,000 recordings will be digitized by 2020 through this initiative. MDPI was the first – and as of 2018 the only – university-based media preservation effort in the United States on this scale.

==Projects==

===Archive of Historical and Ethnographic Yiddish Memories===
The AHEYM Project has collected nearly 400 interviews related to Jewish life before, during, and after World War II. Conducted primarily in Yiddish, the interviewees come from small towns throughout Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. The current online exhibit cover daily life, foodways, Jewish life between the wars, religion, World War II and the Holocaust, and Jewish life after World War II. The archive can be explored by location, person, or subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iub.edu/~aheym/index.php|title=AHEYM - The Archives of Historical and Ethnographic Yiddish Memories - Home - Indiana University|website=www.iub.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preservation and cataloging of AHEYM Project recordings was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

===Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive===
The EVIA Digital Archive is a project created to host a digital archive of ethnographic videos for educational use. The projected originated from a collaboration between Indiana University and University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eviada.webhost.iu.edu/Scripts/default.cfm|title=EVIA Digital Archive Project|publisher=Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive|accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnomusicology Multimedia===
EM publishes books and supplemental audiovisual material on [[Ethnomusicology]] in order to aid scholars in research. EM offers access to Annotation Management System (AMS), which allows authors to upload audiovisual material and link it to content in their text. EM is a joint project between Indiana   and Temple Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ethnomultimedia.org/about.html|title=About Ethnomusicology Online|website=ethnomultimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoagy Carmichael Online===
The [[Hoagy Carmichael]] Project at [[Indiana University]] was a project funded by IMLS between 1999 and 2000 to digitize and preserve the extensive collection of items related to Hoagy Carmichael that are housed at Indiana University. This early digital collection website aimed to present in its entirety the complete Carmichael collection. The collection contains sound recordings, letters, photographs, lyric sheets, correspondence, as well as personal effects.  It offers a biography and a virtual tour of the Carmichael Room located at the Archives of Traditional Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/collections/hoagy/intro/collec_over/|title=Overview of the Hoagy Carmichael Collection|website=www.dlib.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberian Collections Project===
The Liberian Collection was established in 2002. The Archives of Traditional Music is home to the audiovisual part of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.libraries.indiana.edu/africanstudies/liberia|title=Library Research Guides: African Studies Research Guide: Liberian Collections|first=Mireille|last=Djenno|website=guides.libraries.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound Directions===
The Sound Directions Project was a joint project between Indiana University’s Archives of Traditional Music and Harvard University’s Archive of World Music  and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities between 2005 and 2011. Phase 1 consisted of testing and determining the best practices and workflows for digital audio preservation. The following two phases focused on the preservation of archive holdings and on the development of software tools for media assessment and technical metadata collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/projects/sounddirections/|title=Sound Directions: Digital Audio Preservation and Access for Global Audio Heritage|website=www.dlib.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asian American Studies''' is an academic discipline which critically examines the history, experiences, culture, and policies relevant to [[Asian Americans]]. It is closely related to other [[Ethnic Studies]] disciplines, such as [[African American Studies]], [[Latino/a Studies]], and [[Native American Studies]]. 

==History==
Asian American Studies appeared as a field of intellectual inquiry in the late 1960s&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Hune. "Expanding the International Dimension of Asian American Studies". Amerasia Journal, Vol. 15 No. 2 (1989), pp.xix&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of strikes by the Third World Liberation Front, a group of students of color at [[San Francisco State University]] and at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], which demanded that college classroom instruction include the histories of people of color in the United States told from their perspectives. The demand for Ethnic Studies was a critical response to the Eurocentric bias in university curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fiel |first=Crystal |date=March 8, 2009 |title=Celebration 40 Years: Third World Liberation Front |url=http://magandamagazine.wordpress.com/2009/03/08/celebrating-40-years-third-world-liberation-front/ |journal={m}aganda magazine |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a College of Ethnic Studies (the only such "college" at any American university at the time) became established at San Francisco State University with American Indian Studies, Asian American Studies, Africana Studies, and Latino/a Studies as its four units,&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco State University: Asian American Studies. &lt;http://www.sfsu.edu/~aas/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and four ethnic studies programs became established at the University of California, Berkeley. The [[Association for Asian American Studies]], a professional organization designed to promote teaching and research in the field, was established in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ABOUT {{!}} Association for Asian American Studies|url = http://aaastudies.org/about/|website = aaastudies.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics in Asian American Studies==
Drawing from numerous disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[political science]], and [[gender studies]], Asian American Studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work. Unlike "Asian" Studies which focuses on the history, culture, religion, etc. of Asian people living in Asia, Asian American Studies is interested in the history, culture, experiences, of Asians living in the United States.

Academic programs in Asian American Studies provide students with the opportunity to examine the history of Asian-Americans, which includes topics such as immigration and race-based exclusion policies.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt; 

Asian American Studies provides an academic avenue for addressing issues of racial oppression, capitalism at home, and imperialism abroad.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt; 

The discourse also includes studies on how [[Immigrant generation|first- and second-generation]] Asian Americans deal with adjustment and assimilation, especially on their Americanization and aggressive pursuit of higher education and prestigious occupations in a society that still discriminates against them.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian American Studies focuses on the identities, historical and contemporary experiences of individuals and groups in the United States. Concepts and issues that are crucial to this interdisciplinary curriculum include: [[Orientalism]], diaspora, Asian American masculinity, Asian American femininity, cultural politics, and media representation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Major Programs and Departments==
Major Asian American Studies programs in California include those at [[UC Berkeley]], [[UC San Diego]], [[UC Santa Barbara]], [[UC Irvine]],  [[UC Davis]], [[San Francisco State University]] (SFSU), [[California State University, Long Beach]], [[California State University, Northridge]], [[California State University, Fullerton]], [[City College of San Francisco]], [[University of Southern California]], [[The Claremont Colleges]], and at [[UCLA]].

Outside of California, major programs include [[University of Washington]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], University of Maryland, College Park, [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], [http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/aasp/welcome-page Hunter College], [[Cornell University]], [[Binghamton University]], Duke University and [[Columbia University]]. Other rising programs include [[Arizona State University]], [[New York University]], [[Northwestern University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[University of Minnesota]]. Currently, several universities, including [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], [[University of Virginia]], [[Syracuse University]], and many others are in the process of developing Asian American Studies departments. 

Master of Arts in Asian American Studies programs are available at UCLA and SFSU.

At the time of its founding in 1987, the Asian American Studies Program at [[Cornell University]] was the first such program in the Ivy League and on the east coast. Today it has four core faculty members in the humanities and social sciences in a variety of departments and colleges. This cross-college, university-wide position accommodates the extensive teaching and research interests of the Program's faculty and reflects the breadth of the vibrant field of Asian American Studies in general. In the classroom, in scholarship, and through campus and community advocacy, the Program is committed to examining the histories and experiences; identities, social and community formations; politics; and contemporary concerns of people of Asian ancestry in the United States and other parts of the Americas.

On the East Coast, the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] created an Asian &amp; Asian American Studies Department after a 52 million dollar donation by Charles B. Wang (the founder of Computer Associates). The Charles B. Wang Center is designed as a vital space for multi-disciplinary and multicultural dialogues. The {{convert|120000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building was officially presented to Stony Brook University by Charles B. Wang on October 22, 2002. It was the largest single private gift ever received by the State University of New York 64-campus system. The Wang Center is used for conferences, art exhibits, film festivals, lectures, seminars, and performances. It is open to all Stony Brook students, faculty, and staff as well as the surrounding community.

[[Hunter College, City University of New York]], located in the [[Upper East Side]] in [[Manhattan]] is home to the only Asian American Studies Program in the [[CUNY]] system. The program was established in 1993 through student and faculty activism, with Peter Kwong as the inaugural director. Despite offering the largest number of Asian American Studies courses in [[New York City]], [[Hunter College]] does not have an Asian American Studies department nor does it offer an Asian American Studies major. In 2006, when the program was under threat of being cut, student activists formed [[The Coalition for the Revitalization of Asian American Studies at Hunter]] to fight to keep Asian American Studies. The students succeeded in saving the minor program, and they continue to fight for an Asian American Studies major and department. 

[[Queens College, City University of New York]], located in the neighborhood of [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in [[New York City]], is home to the [https://www.qc.cuny.edu/academics/centers/asian/Pages/homepage.aspx Asian/American Center]. It was established to conduct research with community needs in mind. It serves as a hub for research into Asian American issues, particularly focusing on the Asian diaspora in the New York area, and offers a minor in Asian American Community Studies (AACS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1661">'''Bacterivores''' are free-living, generally [[heterotrophic]] organisms, exclusively [[microscopic]], which obtain energy and nutrients primarily or entirely from the consumption of [[bacteria]]. Many species of [[amoeba]] are bacterivores, as well as other types of [[protozoans]]. Commonly, all species of bacteria will be prey, but spores of some species, such as ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'', will never be prey, because of their cellular attributes.

==In Microbiology==
Bacterivores can sometimes be a problem in [[microbiology]] studies. For instance, when scientists seek to assess microorganisms in samples from the environment (such as freshwater), the samples will often be contaminated with bacterivores, which will interfere with the growing of bacteria for study. By adding [[cycloheximide]], the bacterivores will be inhibited and the bacteria will grow normally. For bacteria adsorbed into sediment, 2g of cycloheximide per 100g of sediment needs to be added. For experiments with spores (for example spores of ''[[Clostridium perfringens|C. perfringens]]''), it is not necessary to add cycloheximide to the samples.

==Examples==
* ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''
*''Ceriodaphnia quadrangula''
*''Diaphanosoma brachyura''
*''[[Vorticella]]''
*''[[Paramecium]]''
* Many species of [[Protozoan|Protozoa]]

'''Bioanalysis''' is a sub-discipline of [[analytical chemistry]] covering the [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative]] measurement of [[xenobiotics]] (drugs and their [[metabolite]]s, and [[Biomolecule|biological molecules]] in unnatural locations or concentrations) and biotics ([[macromolecule]]s, [[protein]]s, [[DNA]], large molecule drugs, metabolites) in [[biological systems]].

==Modern bioanalytical chemistry==
Many scientific endeavors are dependent upon accurate quantification of drugs and endogenous substances in biological samples; the focus of bioanalysis in the [[pharmaceutical]] industry is to provide a quantitative measure of the active drug and/or its metabolite(s) for the purpose of [[pharmacokinetics]], [[toxicokinetics]], [[bioequivalence]] and exposure–response (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies). Bioanalysis also applies to drugs used for illicit purposes, [[Forensic science|forensic]] investigations, anti-[[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] testing in sports, and environmental concerns.

Bioanalysis was traditionally thought of in terms of measuring small molecule drugs. However, the past twenty years has seen an increase in [[biopharmaceuticals]] (e.g. [[proteins]] and [[peptides]]), which have been developed to address many of the same diseases as small molecules. These larger biomolecules have presented their own unique challenges to quantification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Welcome to ''Bioanalysis'' | journal = Bioanalysis | date = 2009-04-03 | first = Brian P | last = Booth | coauthors = | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–2 | id = | url = http://www.future-science.com/doi/pdf/10.4155/bio.09.4 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-05-13 | doi=10.4155/bio.09.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first studies measuring drugs in biological fluids were carried out to determine possible overdosing as part of the new science of forensic medicine/[[toxicology]]. 

Initially, nonspecific assays were applied to measuring drugs in biological fluids. These were unable to discriminate between the drug and its metabolites; for example, [[aspirin]] (circa 1900) and [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]] (developed in the 1930s) were quantified by the use of [[Colorimetry (chemical method)|colorimetric]] assays. [[Antibiotic]]s were quantified by their ability to inhibit bacterial growth. The 1930s also saw the rise of pharmacokinetics, and as such the desire for more specific assays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Development of bioanalysis: a short history | journal = Bioanalysis | date = 2009-04-03 | first = Howard | last = Hill | coauthors = | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–7 | id = | url = http://www.future-science.com/doi/pdf/10.4155/bio.09.3 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-05-13 | doi=10.4155/bio.09.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern drugs are more potent, which has required more sensitive bioanalytical assays to accurately and reliably determine these drugs at lower concentrations. This has driven improvements in technology and analytical methods.

==Bioanalytical techniques==
Some techniques commonly used in bioanalytical studies include:

*''Hyphenated techniques''
**[[Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC–MS]] (liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry)
**[[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|GC–MS]] (gas chromatography–mass spectrometry)
**LC–DAD (liquid chromatography–diode array detection)
**[[Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry|CE–MS]] (capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry)
*''Chromatographic methods''
**[[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] (high performance liquid chromatography)
**[[Gas chromatography|GC]] (gas chromatography)
**UPLC (ultra performance liquid chromatography)
**Supercritical fluid chromatography
*''[[Electrophoresis]]''
*''Ligand binding assays''
**[[Dual polarisation interferometry]]
**[[ELISA]] (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
**[[Magnetic immunoassay|MIA]] (magnetic immunoassay)
**[[Radioimmunoassay|RIA]] (radioimmunoassay)
*''[[Mass spectrometry]]''
*''[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]]''

The most frequently used techniques are: liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ([[Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC–MS/MS]]) for 'small' molecules and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]) for macromolecules.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Sample preparation and extraction==
The bioanalyst deals with complex biological samples containing the analyte alongside a diverse range of chemicals that can have an adverse impact on the accurate and precise quantification of the analyte. As such, a wide range of techniques are applied to extract the analyte from its matrix. These include:

*[[Protein precipitation]]
*[[Liquid–liquid extraction]]
*[[Solid phase extraction]]

Bioanalytical laboratories often deal with large numbers of samples, for example resulting from clinical trials. As such, automated sample preparation methods and liquid-handling robots are commonly employed to increase efficiency and reduce costs.

==Bioanalytical organisations==
There are several national and international bioanalytical organisations active throughout the world. Often they are part of a bigger organisation, e.g. Bioanalytical Focus Group and Ligand Binding Assay Bioanalytical Focus Group, which are both within the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) and FABIAN, a working group of the Analytical Chemistry Section of the [[KNCV|Royal Netherlands Chemical Society]]. The [[European Bioanalysis Forum]] (EBF), on the other hand, is independent of any larger society or association. Hanover Search Partners based in San Diego, California is the leading recruitment firm in the Bioanalytical space and contracts with many of the world's leading Bioanalytical companies in recruiting the top executive and scientific talent worldwide.

{{Renewable energy sources}}
{{Sustainable energy}}

A '''biofuel''' is a [[fuel]] that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and [[anaerobic digestion]], rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of [[fossil fuel]]s, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter.

Biofuels can be derived directly from plants (i.e. [[energy crop]]s), or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biofuel.html|title=What is biofuel? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary [[carbon fixation]], such as those that occur in [[plants]] or [[microalgae]] through the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of [[biomass]]  (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to [[plants]] or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]] form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels.

Biofuels are in theory [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] because the carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants is equal to the carbon dioxide that is released when the fuel is burned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/print.php?page=biomass_environment Biomass and the Environment – Basics]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, whether or not a biofuel is carbon-neutral also depends greatly on whether the land which is used to grow the biofuel (with 1st and 2nd generation biofuel) [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry|needed to be cleared of carbon-holding vegetation]] or not.

[[Ethanol#Fuel|Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[Cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] can be used as a [[fuel]] for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

In 2010, worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009,&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/biofuels-make-comeback-despite-tough-economy|title=Biofuels Make a Comeback Despite Tough Economy|publisher=[[Worldwatch Institute]]|date=2011-08-31|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport. Global [[ethanol fuel]] production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for about 90% of global production. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the [[European Union]], accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010/&gt; {{as of|2011}}, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states or provinces.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905003859/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-05 |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 |access-date=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Energy Agency]] has a goal for biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 to reduce dependence on petroleum and coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/biofuels_roadmap.pdf |year= 2011 |title=Technology Roadmap, Biofuels for Transport }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of biofuels also led into a flourishing automotive industry, where by 2010, 79% of all cars produced in Brazil were made with a hybrid fuel system of bioethanol and gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = Jeremy | last2 = Matos | first2 = Stelvia | last3 = Silvestre | first3 = Bruno | last4 = Martin | first4 = Michael | year = 2011 | title = Managing Technological and Social Uncertainties of Innovation: The Evolution of Brazilian Energy and Agriculture | url = | journal = Technological Forecasting and Social Change | volume = 78 | issue = 7| pages = 1147–1157 | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2011.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various social, economic, environmental and technical [[issues relating to biofuels]] production and use, which have been debated in the popular media and scientific journals.

==Generations==
===First-generation biofuels===
"First-generation" or conventional biofuels are biofuels made from food crops grown on arable land. With this biofuel production generation, food crops are thus [[Food vs fuel|explicitly grown for fuel production]], and not anything else. The sugar, starch, or vegetable oil obtained from the crops is converted into biodiesel or ethanol, using [[transesterification]], or yeast fermentation.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100521143237/http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/05/18/3g-4g-a-taxonomy-for-far-out-%E2%80%94-but-not-far-away-%E2%80%94-biofuels/ First, second, third and fourth generation biofuels explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Second-generation biofuels}}
Second generation biofuels are fuels manufactured from various types of [[biomass]].  Biomass is a wide-ranging term meaning any source of organic carbon that is renewed rapidly as part of the [[carbon cycle]]. Biomass is derived from plant materials, but can also include animal materials.

Whereas first generation biofuels are made from the [[sugar]]s and [[vegetable oil]]s found in arable crops, second generation biofuels are made from [[lignocellulosic biomass]] or woody crops, agricultural residues or waste plant material (from food crops that have already fulfilled their food purpose).&lt;ref&gt;An example here is [[rapeseed]], of which the oil is used as waste fuel, and of which the actual produce (for which the crop is grown) is [[fodder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Coconut oil]] is another example, if it is extracted in such a way that the meat and milk can still be used for human and/or animal consumption.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/12/24/barley-grain-can-be-used-to-produce-ethanol-says-scientists-with-usda/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.315.5818.1488 |pmid=17363642 |title=CELLULOSIC ETHANOL: Biofuel Researchers Prepare to Reap a New Harvest |journal=Science |volume=315 |issue=5818 |pages=1488–1491 |year=2007 |last1=Service |first1=R. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jksus.2017.07.005 |title=Bioconversion of corn straw to ethanol by cellulolytic yeasts immobilized in Mucuna urens matrix |journal=Journal of King Saud University - Science |year=2017 |last1=Adelabu |first1=Blessing Adebola |last2=Kareem |first2=Sarafadeen Olateju |last3=Oluwafemi |first3=Flora |last4=Abideen Adeogun |first4=Idowu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feedstock used to generate second-generation biofuels thus either grows on [[arable land]]s, but are just byproducts of the actual harvest (main crop) or they are grown on lands which cannot be used to effectively grow food crops&lt;ref&gt;i.e. arid lands in case of jatropha, or hilly terrain not accessible by tractor, ... in case of grasses, woody crops ...&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases neither extra water or fertilizer is applied to them. Non-human food second generation feedstock sources include grasses, jatropha and other seed crops, waste vegetable oil, municipal solid waste and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biofuel.org.uk/second-generation-biofuels.html|title=Biofuels - Second Generation Biofuels|website=biofuel.org.uk|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that, unlike with regular food crops, no arable land is used solely for the production of fuel. The disadvantage is that unlike with regular food crops, it may be rather difficult to extract the fuel. For instance, a series of physical and chemical treatments might be required to convert lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels suitable for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/en8076765 |title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels |journal=Energies |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=6765–6794 |year=2015 |last1=Ramirez |first1=Jerome |last2=Brown |first2=Richard |last3=Rainey |first3=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The potential and challenges of drop-in fuels (members only) {{!}} IEA Bioenergy Task 39 – Commercializing Liquid Biofuels|url = http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/?p=932|website = task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Algaculture|Algae fuel}}
From 1978 to 1996, the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|US NREL]] experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the "[[Aquatic Species Program]]".&lt;ref name = "NREL biofuels algae"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheehan|first=John|title=A Look Back at the U. S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program: Biofuels from Algae|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=16 June 2012|date=July 1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-published article by Michael Briggs, at the [[University of New Hampshire|UNH]] Biofuels Group, offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all [[motor vehicle|vehicular]] fuel with biofuels by using algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50%, which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plants.&lt;ref name="Briggs2004"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html| title = Widescale Biodiesel Production from Algae| first = Michael |last=Briggs|date=August 2004| accessdate = 2007-01-02

The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but [[feasibility study|feasibility studies]] have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture&amp;nbsp;– unlike [[agriculture|crop-based]] biofuels&amp;nbsp;– does not entail a decrease in [[food production]], since it requires neither [[farmland (farming)|farmland]] nor [[fresh water]]. Many companies are pursuing algae bioreactors for various purposes, including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcent.net/t/news_detailf62c.html?id=36 |title=Valcent Products Inc.

E. Teixeira | doi = 10.1039/C2GC16225C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth-generation biofuels===
Similarly to third-generation biofuels, fourth-generation biofuels are made using non-arable land. However, unlike third-generation biofuels, they do not require the destruction of biomass. This class of biofuels includes [[electrofuel]]s&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; and [[Solar fuel|photobiological solar fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4678123 | pmid=26667057 | doi=10.1007/s13280-015-0730-0 | volume=45 Suppl 1 | title=From first generation biofuels to advanced solar biofuels | journal=Ambio | pages=S24–31 | last1 = Aro | first1 = EM| year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fuels are [[Carbon-neutral fuel#Production|carbon-neutral]].

The following fuels can be produced using first, second, third or fourth-generation biofuel production procedures. Most of these can even be produced using two or three of the different biofuel generation procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Ethanol for instance can be produced using 1G, 2G and 3G procedures&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogas===

[[File:Biogas pipes.JPG|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Pipes carrying biogas]]
{{Main|Biogas}}
Biogas is [[methane]] produced by the process of [[anaerobic digestion]] of [[organic material]] by [[anaerobe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Redman, G., The Andersons Centre. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081004232058/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/metadot/index.pl?id=7198%3Bisa%3DDBRow%3Bop%3Dshow%3Bdbview_id%3D2457 "Assessment of on-farm AD in the UK"], ''[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]'', 2008-06-09. Retrieved on 2009-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be produced either from [[biodegradable waste]] materials or by the use of [[energy crop]]s fed into [[anaerobic digester]]s to supplement gas yields. The solid byproduct, [[digestate]], can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer.

Biogas can be recovered from [[mechanical biological treatment]] waste processing systems. [[Landfill gas]], a less clean form of biogas, is produced in [[landfill]]s through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere, it is a potential [[greenhouse gas]].

Farmers can produce biogas from [[manure]] from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters.&lt;ref&gt;"BIOGAS: No bull, manure can power your farm." Farmers Guardian (25 September 2009): 12. General OneFile. Gale.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syngas===

{{Main|Gasification}}
[[Syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]] and other hydrocarbons, is produced by partial combustion of biomass, that is, combustion with an amount of [[oxygen]] that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; Before partial combustion, the biomass is dried, and sometimes [[pyrolysis|pyrolysed]]. The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.

Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, [[turbines]] or high-temperature fuel cells.&lt;ref name="e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch"&gt;[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wood gas generator]], a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.

Syngas can be used to produce [[methanol]], [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] and [[hydrogen]], or converted via the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700&amp;nbsp;°C.

Lower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing [[biochar]], but results in syngas polluted with [[tar]].

===Ethanol===

{{Main|Ethanol fuel}}
[[File:Sao Paulo ethanol pump 04 2008 74 zoom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|Neat ethanol]] on the left&amp;nbsp;(A), [[gasoline]] on the right (G) at a [[filling station]] in [[Brazil]]]]
Biologically produced [[alcohols]], most commonly [[ethanol]], and less commonly [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]] and [[butanol fuel|butanol]], are produced by the action of [[microorganism]]s and [[enzyme]]s through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). [[Biobutanol]] (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.

[[File:Bushlulacana09032007.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] looks at sugar cane, a source of biofuel, with Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] during a tour on biofuel technology at [[Petrobras]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, 9 March 2007.]]
[[Ethanol fuel]] is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|in Brazil]]. [[Alcohol fuel]]s are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[molasses]] and any sugar or starch from which [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as [[whiskey]], can be made (such as [[potato]] and [[fruit]] waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are [[digestive enzyme|enzyme digestion]] (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, [[distillation]] and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable [[natural gas]] fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as [[bagasse]], the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also [[waste heat]] are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eon.se/om-eon/Om-energi/Produktion-av-el-gas-varme-och-kyla/Kraftvarme/Vara-kraftvarmeverk/Handeloverket/Handeloverket-Panna-15/Energikombinatet_bild/ Energikunskap | Lär dig mer om energi - E.ON&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; – where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.

Ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller [[energy density]] than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol ({{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}}) is that it has a higher [[octane rating]] than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations, which allows an increase of an engine's [[compression ratio]] for increased [[thermal efficiency]]. In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter [[oxidizer]] to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.

Ethanol is also used to fuel bioethanol [[fireplaces]]. As they do not require a chimney and are "flueless", bioethanol fires&lt;ref&gt;Bio ethanol fires information [http://www.prestigiousfires.co.uk/ bio ethanol fireplace]. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue.
The downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.

Corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of [[cellulosic ethanol]]. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy,&lt;ref&gt;see "Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol"&lt;/ref&gt; the fossil energy ratios ([[Fossil Energy Ratio|FER]]) for cellulosic ethanol, corn ethanol, and gasoline are 10.3, 1.36, and 0.81, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkman, N. et al., "Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced/Vehicle Systems", 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farrell | first1 = A.E. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5760| pages = 506–8 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 | pmid=16439656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hammerschlag | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol's Energy Return on Investment: A Survey of the Literature 1999-Present | url = | journal = Environ.

Ethanol has roughly one-third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline. This is partly counteracted by the better efficiency when using ethanol (in a long-term test of more than 2.1 million km, the BEST project found FFV vehicles to be 1–26% more energy efficient than petrol cars, but the volumetric consumption increases by approximately 30%, so more fuel stops are required).

With current subsidies, ethanol fuel is slightly cheaper per distance traveled in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Other bioalcohols===

[[Methanol]] is currently produced from [[natural gas]], a [[non-renewable]] fossil fuel. In the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as [[biomethanol]]. This is technically feasible, but the production is currently being postponed for concerns of [[Jacob S. Gibbs]] and [[Brinsley Coleberd]] that the economic viability is still pending.&lt;ref&gt;Börjesson.P. et al. 2013, REPORT f3 2013:13, p 170&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[methanol economy]] is an alternative to the [[hydrogen economy]], compared to today's [[hydrogen]] production from natural gas.

[[Butanol fuel|Butanol]] ({{chem|C|4|H|9|OH}}) is formed by [[Clostridium acetobutylicum|ABE fermentation]] (acetone, butanol, ethanol) and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high [[net energy gain]]s with butanol as the only liquid product. Butanol will produce more energy and allegedly can be burned "straight" in existing gasoline engines (without modification to the engine or car),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.butanol.com/ |title=ButylFuel, LLC Main Page |publisher=Butanol.com |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is less corrosive and less water-soluble than ethanol, and could be distributed via existing infrastructures. [[DuPont]] and [[BP]] are working together to help develop butanol. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strains have also been successfully engineered to produce butanol by modifying their [[protein metabolism|amino acid metabolism]].&lt;ref name="butanol"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biofpr.com/details/feature/102347/Biofuels_aim_higher.html|title=Biofuels aim higher|last=Evans|first=Jon|date=14 January 2008 |work=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining (BioFPR)|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback to butanol production in E. coli remains the high cost of nutrient rich media, however, recent work has demonstrated E. coli can produce butanol with minimal nutritional supplementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2018.08.004 |pmid=30107263 |title=Directed strain evolution restructures metabolism for 1-butanol production in minimal media |journal=Metabolic Engineering |volume=49 |pages=153–163 |year=2018 |last1=Pontrelli |first1=Sammy |last2=Fricke |first2=Riley C.B. |last3=Sakurai |first3=Sana Subhan Memon |last4=Putri |first4=Sastia Prama |last5=Fitz-Gibbon |first5=Sorel |last6=Chung |first6=Matthew |last7=Wu |first7=Hsin-Yi |last8=Chen |first8=Yu-Ju |last9=Pellegrini |first9=Matteo |last10=Fukusaki |first10=Eiichiro |last11=Liao |first11=James C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biodiesel ===

{{Main|Biodiesel}}
{{Further|Biodiesel around the world}}
[[Biodiesel]] is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters ([[Fatty acid methyl ester|FAMEs]]). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, [[soy]], [[rapeseed]], [[Jatropha curcas|jatropha]], [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[flax]], [[sunflower]], [[palm oil]], [[hemp]], [[thlaspi arvense|field pennycress]], ''[[Pongamia pinnata]]'' and [[algae fuel|algae]]. Pure biodiesel (B100, also known as "neat" biodiesel) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel Second generation B100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perstorp.com/en/Media/Pressreleases/2013/20130701_Verdis_Polaris_Aura_second_generation_B100/ Perstop Press release: Verdis Polaris Aura – second generation B100 – The advanced green one]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Targray Biodiesel Railcar.png|thumb|Targray Biofuels Division railcar transporting Biodiesel.]]Biodiesel can be used in any [[diesel engine]] when mixed with mineral diesel. It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more [[viscosity|viscous]] at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm BIODIESEL]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although [[Volkswagen]] of [[Germany]], for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100&lt;!-- (see [[Biodiesel#Use|biodiesel use]]) --&gt;. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '[[Viton]]' (by [[DuPont]]) [[synthetic rubber]] in their mechanical [[fuel injection]] systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.

Electronically controlled '[[common rail]]' and '[[Unit Injector|unit injector]]' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the [[fuel rail]] design.
Since biodiesel is an effective [[solvent]] and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, [[oil filter|engine filters]] may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine [[combustion chamber]] of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.de/ |title=ADM Biodiesel: Hamburg, Leer, Mainz |publisher=Biodiesel.de |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RRI Limited for Biodiesel Filling Stations |url=http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |title=Welcome to Biodiesel Filling Stations |publisher=Biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiesel is also an [[oxygenated diesel|oxygenated fuel]], meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the [[combustion]] of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using pure biodiesel may increase NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/technology/2012/T46.pdf Nylund.N-O &amp; Koponen.K. 2013. Fuel and Technology Alternatives for Buses. Overall Energy Efficiency and Emission Performance. IEA Bioenergy Task 46]. Possibly the new emission standards Euro VI/EPA 10 will lead to reduced NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-levels also when using B100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and [[biodegradable]], and has a high [[flash point]] of about 300&amp;nbsp;°F (148&amp;nbsp;°C) compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125&amp;nbsp;°F (52&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |title=Biofuels Facts |publisher=Hempcar.org |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520231032/http://hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, more than 80% of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel. The emerging US biodiesel market is estimated to have grown 200% from 2004 to 2005. "By the end of 2006 biodiesel production was estimated to increase fourfold [from 2004] to more than" {{convert|1|e9USgal|m3}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070606084122/http://www.wfs.org/futcontja07.htm THE FUTURIST], [http://www.prleap.com/pr/80099/ Will Thurmond]. July–August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of 8% in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles.&lt;ref name=RA29&gt;{{Harvsp|Avril Group : Activity Report|2014|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avril Group]] produces under the brand [[Diester]], a fifth of 11 million tons of biodiesel consumed annually by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="EurObserv’ER"&gt;{{Harvsp|EurObserv’ER|2014|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the leading European producer of biodiesel.&lt;ref name=RA29/&gt;

===Straight vegetable oil===

[[File:Used vegetable cooking oil.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Filtered waste vegetable oil]]
[[File:Walmart’s Grease Fuel Truck (2).jpg|thumb|right|This truck is one of 15 based at Walmart's [[Buckeye, Arizona]] distribution center that was converted to run on a biofuel made from reclaimed cooking grease produced during food preparation at Walmart stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Wal-Mart To Test Hybrid Trucks | publisher = Sustainable Business | date = February 3, 2009 | url = https://www.sustainablebusiness.com/index.cfm/go/news.display/id/17599}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Vegetable oil fuel}}
Straight unmodified [[Eating|edible]] vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel, but lower-quality oil has been used for this purpose. Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel.

As with 100% biodiesel (B100), to ensure the [[fuel injector]]s atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, [[vegetable oil fuel]] must be heated to reduce its [[viscosity]] to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. [[MAN B&amp;W Diesel]], [[Wärtsilä]], and [[Deutz AG]], as well as a number of smaller companies, such as [[Elsbett]], offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.

Vegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use [[common rail]] or [[Unit Injector|unit injection]] electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in [[indirect injection]] engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion, a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-"Pumpe Duse" [[VW TDI]] engines and other similar engines with [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Several companies, such as [[Elsbett]] or Wolf, have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades.

Oils and fats can be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to give a diesel substitute. The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high [[cetane number]], low in [[aromatics]] and [[sulfur]] and does not contain oxygen. [[Hydrogenated oil]]s can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Evans, G.

===Solid biomass fuels ===

Examples include [[wood]], [[sawdust]], [[grass]] trimmings, [[domestic waste|domestic refuse]], [[charcoal]], [[agricultural waste]], nonfood [[energy crop]]s, and [[Dry animal dung fuel|dried manure]].

When solid biomass is already in a suitable form (such as [[firewood]]), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from {{convert|1|to|3|cm|1|abbr=on}}, which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce [[wood pellet]]s, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with a broad range of input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.

Sawdust, bark and chips are already used for decades for fuel in industrial processes; examples include the pulp and paper industry and the sugar cane industry. Boilers in the range of 500,000&amp;nbsp;lb/hr of steam, and larger, are in routine operation, using grate, spreader stoker, suspension burning and fluid bed combustion. Utilities generate power, typically in the range of 5 to 50 MW, using locally available fuel. Other industries have also installed wood waste fueled boilers and dryers in areas with low-cost fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. McGowan, Michael L. Brown, William S. Bulpitt, James L. Walsh, Jr. (Editors) 2009. Biomass and Alternate Fuel Systems: An Engineering and Economic Guide. {{ISBN|978-0-470-41028-8}} Wiley, 280 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the advantages of solid biomass fuel is that it is often a byproduct, residue or waste-product of other processes, such as farming, animal husbandry and forestry.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=20 September 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, this means fuel and food production do not compete for resources, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

A problem with the combustion of solid biomass fuels is that it emits considerable amounts of [[pollutant]]s, such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]]. Even modern pellet boilers generate much more pollutants than oil or natural gas boilers. Pellets made from agricultural residues are usually worse than wood pellets, producing much larger emissions of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and [[chlorophenol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Briens | first1 = Cedric | last2 = Piskorz | first2 = Jan | last3 = Berruti | first3 = Franco | year = 2008 | title = Biomass Valorization for Fuel and Chemicals Production -- A Review | url = | journal = International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering | volume = 6 | issue = | page = R2 | doi=10.2202/1542-6580.1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A derived fuel is [[biochar]], which is produced by biomass [[pyrolysis]]. Biochar made from agricultural waste can substitute for wood charcoal. As wood stock becomes scarce, this alternative is gaining ground. In eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], for example, [[biomass briquettes]] are being marketed as an alternative to charcoal to protect [[Virunga National Park]] from [[deforestation]] associated with [[charcoal]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |title=Threat to Great Apes Highlighted at Virunga Meeting |publisher=America.gov |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828133830/http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |archivedate=28 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air pollution==
{{main|Biomass#Environmental damage|Ethanol_fuel#Air_pollution}}

Biofuels are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to [[air pollution]]. Burning produces [[carbon dioxide]], airborne carbon [[particulate]]s, [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/indoorair/interventions/antiguamod21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO estimates 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 due to air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ WHO | Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas [[chromatograph]] studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240399720_Atmospheric_alcohols_and_aldehydes_concentrations_measured_in_Osaka_Japan_and_in_Sao_Paulo_Brazil Atmospheric alcohols and aldehydes concentrations measured in Osaka, Japan and in São Paulo, Brazil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged in April 2007 that the increased use of bio-ethanol will lead to worse air quality. The total emissions of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides will rise due the growing use of bio-ethanol. There is an increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels to produce the biofuels as well as nitrous oxide from the soil, which has most likely been treated with nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrous oxide is known to have a greater impact on the atmosphere in relation to global warming, as it is also an ozone destroyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haerens|first1=Margaret|title=Biofuels|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-7377-5553-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates regarding the production and use of biofuel==
{{Main|Issues relating to biofuels}}
There are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues with biofuel production and use, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating [[Price of petroleum|oil prices]], the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, [[food prices]], [[poverty reduction]] potential, [[energy ratio]], [[energy requirements]],  [[carbon emissions]] levels, [[sustainable biofuel]] production, [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]], loss of [[biodiversity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fletcher Jr.|first=Robert J.|author2=Bruce A Robertson |author3=Jason Evans |author4=Patrick J Doran |author5=Janaki RR Alavalapati |author6=Douglas W Schemske |title=Biodiversity conservation in the era of biofuels: risks and opportunities|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|year=2011|volume=9|issue=3|pages=161–168|url=http://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/24366|accessdate=10 December 2013 |doi=10.1890/090091|hdl=10919/24366}}&lt;/ref&gt; impact on [[water resources]], the possible modifications necessary to run the engine on biofuel, as well as [[Energy returned on energy invested|energy balance]] and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cotton |first=Charles A.

It concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their impact on climate, energy security and ecosystems, and suggested that environmental and social impacts need to be assessed throughout the entire life-cycle.

Another issue with biofuel use and production is the US has changed mandates many times because the production has been taking longer than expected. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) set by congress for 2010 was pushed back to at best 2012 to produce 100 million gallons of pure ethanol (not blended with a fossil fuel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bracmort|first=Kelsi|title=Meeting the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Mandate for Cellulosic Biofuels:Questions and Answers|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41106.pdf|publisher=Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banning of first-generation biofuels===
In the EU, the revised renewable energy directive calls for a complete ban on first-generation biofuels by 2030. Particularly fuels made from such oils such as palm oil and soy oil are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/04/palm-oil-biofuels-meps-eu-transport-deforestation-zsl-greenpeace-golden-agri-resources-oxfam MEPs vote to ban the use of palm oil in biofuels ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/eu-heading-for-zero-palm-oil-in-transport-by-2021/ EU heading for ‘zero palm oil’ in transport by 2021]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-climatechange-palmoil/eu-to-phase-out-palm-oil-from-transport-fuel-by-2030-idUSKBN1JA21F EU to phase out palm oil from transport fuel by 2030]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable biofuels===

Some scientists have expressed concerns about land-use change in response to greater demand for crops to use for biofuel and the subsequent carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1238 |title=Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases Through Emissions from Land-Use Change |last = Searchinger |first = Timothy |author2=Ralph Heimlich |author3=R.A.

However, no-till practices combined with cover-crop practices can reduce the payback period to three years for grassland conversion and 14 years for forest conversion.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;T"&gt;{{Cite journal |title =Biofuels, Land Use Change, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Some Unexplored Variables|last = Kim |first = Hyungtae|author2=Seungdo Kim|author3=Bruce E.

A study conducted in the Tocantis State, in northern Brazil, found that many families were cutting down forests in order to produce two conglomerates of oilseed plants, the J. curcas (JC group) and the R. communis (RC group). This region is composed of 15% Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity, and 80% Cerrado forest with lower biodiversity. During the study, the farmers that planted the JC group released over 2193 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 53-105 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration from deforestation; and the RC group farmers released 562 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 48-90 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be sequestered from forest depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alves Finco | first1 = Marcus V. | last2 = Doppler | first2 = Werner | year = 2010 | title = Bioenergy and Sustainable Development: The Dilemma of Food Security and Climate Change in the Brazilian Savannah | url = | journal = Energy for Sustainable Development | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 194–199 | doi = 10.1016/j.esd.2010.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide, but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting. This has to do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves. In addition, the intensive use of monocropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation, as well as of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. This does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff, but also to the emission of nitrous oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a fertilizer byproduct, which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Runge | first1 = Ford | last2 = Senauer | first2 = Benjamin | year = 2007 | title = How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 41–53 | jstor=20032348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop–based biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a “biofuel carbon debt” by releasing 17 to 420 times more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. Biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on abandoned agricultural lands incur little to no carbon debt.&lt;ref name="Science2"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1235.short |title =Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt|last = fargione| first = Joseph|author2=Jason Hill |author3=David Tilman |author4=Stephen Polasky |author5=Peter Hawthorne |doi = 10.1126/science.1152747 |pmid =18258862|year=2008|accessdate = 12 November 2011 |journal=Science |volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1235–1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water Use===
In addition to crop growth requiring water, biofuel facilities require significant process water.&lt;ref name="WaterI"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12039&amp;page=45 |title =Water Issues of Biofuel Production Plants |author=The National Academies Press |year=2008|accessdate = 18 June 2015 |journal=The National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forests and Carbon Sequestration===
Scientific research (20th century) shows that carbon dioxide emissions from all forms of surface transport are converted in a few weeks by forests, farms and oceans into biomass. This implies that a greater emphasis on sustainable forestry is very relevant for climate protection and sustainable, energy-efficient transport.

==Current research==
Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops. Using the current yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage. It would require twice the land area of the US to be devoted to soybean production, or two-thirds to be devoted to rapeseed production, to meet current US heating and transportation needs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Coalition for Ethanol |url=http://www.ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |title=Responses to Questions from Senator Bingaman |publisher=American Coalition for Ethanol |date=2008-06-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004113944/http://ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A division of the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), has also conducted various ethanol research projects, mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |url=http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf |title=Research Advantages: Cellulosic Ethanol |publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |date=2007-03-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125101249/http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] is the process of building an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel. Companies, such as [[Iogen Corp.|Iogen]], [[POET]], and [[Abengoa]], are building refineries that can process [[biomass]] and turn it into [[bioethanol]]. Companies, such as [[Diversa]], [[Novozymes]], and [[Dyadic International|Dyadic]], are producing enzymes that could enable a [[cellulosic ethanol]] future. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.&lt;ref&gt;Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007). ''[[The Clean Tech Revolution]]'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the first commercial-scale plants to produce cellulosic biofuels have begun operating. Multiple pathways for the conversion of different biofuel feedstocks are being used. In the next few years, the cost data of these technologies operating at commercial scale, and their relative performance, will become available. Lessons learnt will lower the costs of the industrial processes involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/hlpe/hlpe_documents/HLPE_Reports/HLPE-Report-5_Biofuels_and_food_security.pdf |title=Biofuels and food security |author=HLPE |year=2013 |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Asia and Africa where drylands prevail, [[sweet sorghum]] is being investigated as a potential source of food, feed and fuel combined. The crop is particularly suitable for growing in arid conditions, as it only extracts one seventh of the water used by sugarcane. In [[India]], and other places, sweet sorghum stalks are used to produce biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into [[ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |title=Sweet Sorghum : A New "Smart Biofuel Crop" |date=30 June 2008 |publisher=Agriculture Business Week |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004827/http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |archivedate=27 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers at the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide fuel in addition to food and animal feed. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150904014010/http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/8/4/0_6c06c9b61b19c20/840_be710da94740b90.pdf ''Sweet sorghum for food, feed and fuel''] New Agriculturalist, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jatropha===
{{Main|Jatropha biofuel}}
Several groups in various sectors are conducting research on ''[[Jatropha curcas]]'', a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biology and genetic improvement of Jatropha curcas L.: A review| journal = [[Applied Energy]] | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | year = 2010| pages = 732–742 |author1=B.N.

Laxmipathi Gowda | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.07.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this research focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of Jatropha through advancements in genetics, soil science, and horticultural practices.

[[SG Biofuels]], a San Diego-based jatropha developer, has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds that show significant yield improvements over first-generation varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Biofuels Digest |url=http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2011/05/16/jatropha-blooms-again-sg-biofuels-secures-250k-acres-for-hybrids|title=Jatropha blooms again: SG Biofuels secures 250K acres for hybrids |publisher=Biofuels Digest |date=2011-05-16 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; SG Biofuels also claims additional benefits have arisen from such strains, including improved flowering synchronicity, higher resistance to pests and diseases, and increased cold-weather tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SG Biofuels|url=http://www.sgfuel.com/pages/hybrid-seeds-and-services/jMax-hybrid-seeds.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226073111/http://www.sgfuel.com/pages/hybrid-seeds-and-services/jMax-hybrid-seeds.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 February 2011|title=Jmax Hybrid Seeds|publisher=SG Biofuels|date=2012-03-08|accessdate=2012-03-08|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant Research International, a department of the [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]] in the Netherlands, maintains an ongoing Jatropha Evaluation Project that examines the feasibility of large-scale jatropha cultivation through field and laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plant Research International |url=http://www.pri.wur.nl/UK/research/plant-based_raw_materials/jatropha/JATROPT |title=JATROPT (Jatropha curcas): Applied and technical research into plant properties |publisher=Plant Research International |date=2012-03-08 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Center for Sustainable Energy Farming (CfSEF) is a Los Angeles-based nonprofit research organization dedicated to jatropha research in the areas of plant science, agronomy, and horticulture. Successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase jatropha farm production yields by 200-300% in the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Biofuels Magazine |url=http://www.biofuelsmagazine.com/articles/7743/energy-farming-methods-mature-improve|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727140520/http://www.biofuelsmagazine.com/articles/7743/energy-farming-methods-mature-improve|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-07-27|title=Energy Farming Methods Mature, Improve |publisher=Biofuels Magazine |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
A group at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Moscow]], in a 2008 paper, stated they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single-celled fungi and turned it into biofuels in an economically efficient manner. More research on this fungal species, ''[[Cunninghamella]]'' ''[[Cunninghamella japonica|japonica]]'', and others, is likely to appear in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Sergeeva | first1 = Y. E.| last2 = Galanina | first2 = L. A.| last3 = Andrianova | first3 = D. A.| last4 = Feofilova | first4 = E.

The recent discovery of a variant of the fungus ''[[Gliocladium roseum]]'' (later renamed Ascocoryne sarcoides) points toward the production of so-called [[myco-diesel]] from cellulose. This organism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern [[Patagonia]], and has the unique capability of converting cellulose into medium-length hydrocarbons typically found in diesel fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Strobel | first1 = G.| last2 = Knighton | first2 = B.| last3 = Kluck | first3 = K.| last4 = Ren | first4 = Y.| last5 = Livinghouse | first5 = T.| last6 = Griffin | first6 = M.| last7 = Spakowicz | first7 = D.| last8 = Sears | first8 = J.| title = The production of myco-diesel hydrocarbons and their derivatives by the endophytic fungus Gliocladium roseum (NRRL 50072)| journal = Microbiology| volume = 154| issue = Pt 11| pages = 3319–3328| year = 2008| pmid = 18957585| doi = 10.1099/mic.0.2008/022186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other fungi that can degrade cellulose and other polymers have been observed to produce molecules that are currently being engineered using organisms from other kingdoms, suggesting that fungi may play a large role in the bio-production of fuels in the future (reviewed in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 99| issue = 12| pages = 4943–4951| last1 = Spakowicz| first1 = Daniel J.| last2 = Strobel| first2 = Scott A.| title = Biosynthesis of hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds by fungi: bioengineering potential| journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology| date = 2015| doi=10.1007/s00253-015-6641-y| pmid = 25957494| pmc = 4677055}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Animal gut bacteria===
Microbial [[Gut flora|gastrointestinal flora]] in a variety of animals have shown potential for the production of biofuels. Recent research has shown that TU-103, a strain of ''[[Clostridium]]'' bacteria found in Zebra feces, can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tulane.edu/news/releases/pr_082511.cfm |title=Cars Could Run on Recycled Newspaper, Tulane Scientists Say |author=Kathryn Hobgood Ray |date=August 25, 2011 |work=Tulane University news webpage |publisher=Tulane University |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating [[biofuels]] from bamboo and other plant materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/09/130910-panda-poop-might-help-turn-plants-into-fuel |title=Panda Poop Might Help Turn Plants Into Fuel |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been substantial research into the technology of using the gut microbiomes of wood-feeding insects for the conversion of lignocellulotic material into biofuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sun|first1=Jian-Zhong|last2=Scharf|first2=Michael E.|title=Exploring and integrating cellulolytic systems of insects to advance biofuel technology|journal=Insect Science|date=2010|volume=17|issue=3|pages=163–165|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01348.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''order''' in architecture is a certain assemblage of parts subject to uniform established proportions, regulated by the office that each part has to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=6-1LAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=%22An%20order%20in%20architecture%20is%20a%20certain%20assemblage%20of%20parts%20subject%20to%20uniform%20established%20proportions,%20regulated%20by%20the%20office%20that%20each%20part%20has%20to%20perform%22&amp;f=false|title=An Encyclopædia of Architecture: Historical, Theoretical, and Practical|last=Gwilt|first=Joseph|date=1842|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|year=|isbn=|location=London|pages=680|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coming down to the present from [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman]] civilization, the '''architectural orders''' are the styles of [[classical architecture]], each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details, and most readily recognizable by the type of [[column]] employed. The three orders of architecture—the [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]—originated in Greece. To these the Romans added, in practice if not in name, the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], which they made simpler than Doric, and the [[Composite order|Composite]], which was more ornamental than the Corinthian.  The architectural order of a classical building is akin to the [[Musical mode|mode]] or [[Key (music)|key]] of [[classical music]], the [[grammar]] or [[rhetoric]] of a written composition.  It is established by certain ''modules'' like the [[Interval (music)|intervals]] of music, and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 7-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the orders were essentially structural in [[Ancient Greek architecture]], which made little use of the arch until its late period, in [[Roman architecture]] where the arch was often dominant, the orders became increasingly decorative elements except in [[portico]]s and similar uses.  Columns shrank into half-columns emerging from walls or turned into [[pilaster]]s.  This treatment continued after the conscious and "correct" use of the orders, initially following exclusively Roman models, returned in the [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Greek Revival architecture]], inspired by increasing knowledge of Greek originals, returned to more authentic models, including ones from relatively early periods.

== Elements ==
[[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]

Each style has distinctive [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s at the top of columns and horizontal [[entablature]]s which it supports, while the rest of the building does not in itself vary between the orders.  The column shaft and base also varies with the order, and is sometimes articulated with vertical hollow grooves known as [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]].  The shaft is wider at the bottom than at the top, because its [[entasis]], beginning a third of the way up, imperceptibly makes the column slightly more slender at the top, although some Doric columns, especially early Greek ones, are visibly "flared", with straight profiles that narrow going up the shaft.

The capital rests on the shaft. It has a load-bearing function, which concentrates the weight of the entablature on the supportive column, but it primarily serves an aesthetic purpose.  The necking is the continuation of the shaft, but is visually separated by one or many grooves. The [[Molding (decorative)|echinus]] lies atop the necking.  It is a circular block that bulges outwards towards the top to support the [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]], which is a square or shaped block that in turn supports the entablature.  The entablature consists of three horizontal layers, all of which are visually separated from each other using moldings or bands.  In Roman and post-Renaissance work, the entablature may be carried from column to column in the form of an [[arch]] that springs from the column that bears its weight, retaining its divisions and sculptural enrichment, if any.  There are names for all the many parts of the orders.

== Measurement ==
[[File:Schema Saeulenordnungen.jpg|thumb|left|Greek orders with full height]] 
The height of columns are calculated in terms of a ratio between the diameter of the shaft at its base and the height of the column. A Doric column can be described as seven diameters high, an Ionic column as eight diameters high and a Corinthian column nine diameters high, although the actual ratios used vary considerably in both ancient and revived examples, but keeping to the trend of increasing slimness between the orders. Sometimes this is phrased as "lower diameters high", to establish which part of the shaft has been measured.

== Greek orders ==
There are three distinct orders in Ancient Greek architecture: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. These three were adopted by the Romans, who modified their capitals. The Roman adoption of the Greek orders took place in the 1st century BC. The three Ancient Greek orders have since been consistently used in neo-classical European architecture.

Sometimes the Doric order is considered the earliest order, but there is no evidence to support this.  Rather, the Doric and Ionic orders seem to have appeared at around the same time, the Ionic in eastern Greece and the Doric in the west and mainland.

Both the Doric and the Ionic order appear to have originated in wood. The [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Temple of Hera]] in Olympia is the oldest well-preserved temple of Doric architecture. It was built just after 600 BC. The Doric order later spread across Greece and into [[Sicily]] where it was the chief order for [[monumental architecture]] for 800 years.  Early Greeks were no doubt aware of the use of stone columns with bases and capitals in [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]], and that of other Near Eastern cultures, although there they were mostly used in interiors, rather than as a dominant feature of all or part of exteriors, in the Greek style.  
[[File:DoricParthenon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Doric order of the [[Parthenon]]]]

=== Doric order===
{{Main|Doric order}}
The Doric order originated on the mainland and western [[Greece]]. It is the simplest of the orders, characterized by short, organized, heavy columns with plain, round [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s (tops) and no base. With a height that is only four to eight times its diameter, the columns are the most squat of all orders. The shaft of the Doric order is channeled with 16 flutes. The capital consists of a necking or Annulet which is a simple ring. The echinus is convex, or circular cushion like stone, and the abacus is square slab of stone.

Above the capital is a square [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]] connecting the capital to the entablature.  The Entablature is divided into three horizontal registers, the lower part of which is either smooth or divided by horizontal lines.  The upper half is distinctive for the Doric order. The frieze of the Doric entablature is divided into [[triglyph]]s and [[metope (architecture)|metopes]]. A triglyph is a unit consisting of three vertical bands which are separated by grooves. Metopes are the plain or carved reliefs between two triglyphs.

The Greek forms of the Doric order come without an individual base. They instead are placed directly on the [[stylobate]]. Later forms, however, came with the conventional base consisting of a plinth and a torus. The Roman versions of the Doric order have smaller proportions. As a result, they appear lighter than the Greek orders.

[[File:IonicCapitalPriene.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Ionic order]]

=== Ionic order ===
{{Main|Ionic order}}
The Ionic order came from eastern Greece, where its origins are entwined with the similar but little known [[Aeolic order]]. It is distinguished by slender, fluted [[column|pillar]]s with a large base and two opposed ''volutes'' (also called ''scrolls'') in the echinus of the capital. The echinus itself is decorated with an [[egg-and-dart]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]. The Ionic shaft comes with four more flutes than the Doric counterpart (totalling 24). The Ionic base has two convex moldings called ''tori'' which are separated by a scotia.

The Ionic order is also marked by an [[entasis]], a curved tapering in the column shaft. A column of the ionic order is nine times its lower diameter. The shaft itself is eight diameters high. The architrave of the entablature commonly consists of three stepped bands (''fasciae''). The frieze comes without the Doric ''triglyph'' and ''metope''. The frieze sometimes comes with a continuous ornament such as carved figures instead.

[[File:CorinthianOrderPantheon.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Corinthian order]]

=== Corinthian order ===
{{Main|Corinthian order}}
The Corinthian order is the most ornate of the Greek orders, characterized by a slender fluted column having an ornate capital decorated with two rows of acanthus leaves and four scrolls. It is commonly regarded as the most elegant of the three orders.  The shaft of the Corinthian order has 24 flutes. The column is commonly ten diameters high.

The Roman writer [[Vitruvius]] [[Callimachus (sculptor)#Architecture|credited]] the invention of the Corinthian order to [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]], a Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] of the 5th century BC. The oldest known building built according to this order is the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] in Athens, constructed from 335 to 334 BC. The Corinthian order was raised to rank by the writings of Vitruvius in the 1st century BC.

== Roman orders ==
The Romans adapted all the Greek orders and also developed two orders of their own, basically modifications of Greek orders. However, it was not until the Renaissance that these were named and formalized as the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] and [[Composite order|Composite]], respectively the plainest and most ornate of the orders.  The Romans also invented the [[superposed order]]. A superposed order is when successive stories of a building have different orders. The heaviest orders were at the bottom, whilst the lightest came at the top. This means that the Doric order was the order of the ground floor, the Ionic order was used for the middle story, while the Corinthian or the Composite order was used for the top story.

The [[Colossal order]] was invented by [[Renaissance architecture|architects in the Renaissance]]. The Colossal order is characterized by columns that extend the height of two or more stories.

=== Tuscan order ===
{{Main|Tuscan order}}
The Tuscan order has a very plain design, with a plain shaft, and a simple capital, base, and frieze. It is a simplified adaptation of the Doric order by the Greeks. The Tuscan order is characterized by an unfluted shaft and a capital that only consists of an echinus and an abacus. In proportions it is similar to the Doric order, but overall it is significantly plainer. The column is normally seven diameters high. Compared to the other orders, the Tuscan order looks the most solid.

[[File:Komposita1.png|right|thumb|150px|Composite order]]

=== Composite order ===
{{Main|Composite order}}
The Composite order is a mixed order, combining the volutes of the Ionic with the leaves of the Corinthian order. Until the [[Renaissance]] it was not ranked as a separate order. Instead it was considered as a late Roman form of the Corinthian order. The column of the Composite order is typically ten diameters high.

== Historical development of the orders ==
[[File:StGervais Fassade.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church]] in Paris presents columns of the three orders : Doric at the ground floor, Ionic at the second floor, Corinthian at the third floor]]
[[File:Bodleian Library 2 (5650412310).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Tower of The Five Orders at the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]], completed in 1619, includes Tuscan through Composite orders.]]
The [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] period saw renewed interest in the literary sources of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, and the fertile development of a new architecture based on classical principles. The treatise ''[[De architectura]]'' by Roman theoretician, architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]], is the only architectural writing that survived from Antiquity. Rediscovered in the 15th century, Vitruvius was instantly hailed as the authority on architecture. However, in his text the word ''order'' is not to be found. To describe the four species of columns (he only mentions: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic and Corinthian) he uses, in fact, various words such as: ''genus'' (gender), ''mos'' (habit, fashion, manner), ''opera'' (work).

The term ''order'', as well as the idea of redefining the ''canon'' started circulating in Rome, at the beginning of the 16th century, probably during the studies of Vitruvius' text conducted and shared by Peruzzi, Raphael and Sangallo.&lt;ref&gt;H. Burns and H. Gunthers, ''24éme Colloque International d'Etude Humanistes'', Tours 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
Ever since, the definition of the ''canon'' has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects, from Renaissance and Baroque periods, basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius' writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence, 1821–23). What was added were rules for the use of the Architectural Orders, and the exact proportions of them down to the most minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists, with Doric characterized as bold and manly, Ionic as matronly, and Corinthian as maidenly.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Small, [http://sites.scran.ac.uk/ada/documents/general/orders/classical_orders.htm "The five orders of classical architecture"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vignola defining the concept of "order" ==
{{Main|The Five Orders of Architecture}}
 
Following the examples of Vitruvius and the five books of the ''Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici'' by [[Sebastiano Serlio]], published from 1537 onwards, [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] produced an architecture rule book that was not only more practical than the previous two treatises, but also was systematically and consistently adopting, for the first time,  the term '''order''' to define each of the five different species of columns inherited from Antiquity. A first publication of the various plates, as separate sheets, appeared in Rome in 1562, with the title: ''Regola delli Cinque Ordini di Architettura'' (''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture ''&lt;ref&gt;The most recent English translation is the one, with an introduction and commentary by Branko Mitrovic, N.Y. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;). As David Watkin has pointed out, Vignola's book "was to have an astonishing publishing history of over 500 editions in 400 years in ten languages, Italian, Dutch, English, Flemish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, during which it became perhaps the most influential book of all times".&lt;ref&gt;David Watkin, Introduction to the ''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture'', translated by John Leeke, reprint of the 1699 edition, N.Y., 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
The book consisted simply of an introduction followed by 32 annotated plates, highlighting the proportional system with all the minute details of the Five Architectural Orders. According to Christof Thoenes, the main expert of Renaissance architectural treatises,  "in accordance with Vitruvius’s example, Vignola chose a “module” equal to a half-diameter which is the base of the system. All the other measurements are expressed in fractions or in multiples of this module. The result is an arithmetical model, and with its help each order, harmoniously proportioned, can easily be adapted to any given height, of a façade or an interior. From this point of view, Vignola's Regola is a remarkable intellectual achievement".[http://architectura.cesr.univ-tours.fr/traite/Notice/ENSBA_LES64.asp?param=en]

In America, ''The American Builder's Companion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Benjamin| first = Asher| title = The American Builder's Companion: Or, a System of Architecture Particularly Adapted to the Present Style of Building| year = 1827| publisher = Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-22236-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; written in the early 19th century by the architect [[Asher Benjamin]], influenced many builders in the eastern states, particularly those who developed what became known as the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. The last American re-interpretation of Vignola's ''Regola'', was edited in 1904 by William Robert Ware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ware| first = William R.| title = The American Vignola: a guide to the making of classical architecture| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nV3eiQFnwyAC| year = 1994| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-28310-4| pages = 160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break from the classical mode came first with the [[Gothic revival]], then the development of modernism during the 19th century. The [[Bauhaus]] promoted pure functionalism, stripped of superfluous ornament, and that has become one of the defining characteristics of modern architecture. There are some exceptions. [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]] introduced an ironic use of the orders as a cultural reference, divorced from the strict rules of composition. On the other hand, a few practitioners e.g. [[Quinlan Terry]] and Stuart Martin still work in a traditional classical idiom.

== Nonce orders ==
Several orders, usually based upon the composite order and only varying in the design of the capitals, have been invented under the inspiration of specific occasions, but have not been used again. They are termed "''nonce orders''" by analogy to ''[[nonce word]]s''; several examples follow below. 
These nonce orders all express the “speaking architecture” (''[[architecture parlante]]'') that was taught in the Paris courses, most explicitly by [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]], in which sculptural details of classical architecture could be enlisted to speak symbolically, the better to express the purpose of the structure and enrich its visual meaning with specific appropriateness. This idea was taken up strongly in the training of [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], ca 1875–1915. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

;British Order
[[Robert Adam]]'s brother [[James Adam (architect)|James]] was in Rome in 1762, drawing antiquities under the direction of [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau|Clérisseau]]; he invented a '''British Order''' and published an engraving of it. Its capital the heraldic lion and unicorn take the place of the Composite's volutes, a Byzantine or Romanesque conception, but expressed in terms of neoclassical realism. Adam's ink-and-wash rendering with red highlighting is at the [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library|Avery Library]], [[Columbia University]].

;Ammonite order and Agricultural order
In 1789 [[George Dance the Elder|George Dance]] invented an '''[[Ammonite Order]]''', a variant of Ionic substituting volutes in the form of [[fossil]] [[ammonite]]s for [[John Boydell]]'s [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|Shakespeare Gallery]] in [[Pall Mall, London]].&lt;ref name="oxford22"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Curl |first1=James Stevens |last2=Wilson |first2=Susan |title=Oxford Dictionary of Architecture |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-967499-2 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptation of the Corinthian order by [[William Donthorne]] that used turnip leaves and [[mangelwurzel]] is termed the '''Agricultural order'''.&lt;ref&gt;Curl, p.&amp;nbsp;238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curl, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corn-capital-litchfield.jpg|thumb|upright|Corn capital at the [[Litchfield Villa]] [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)]] ([[Alexander Jackson Davis|A.J. Davis]], architect)]]
;American orders
In the United States [[Benjamin Latrobe]], the architect of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in Washington&amp;nbsp;DC, designed a series of botanically '''American orders'''. Most famous is the order substituting corncobs and their husks, which was executed by [[Giuseppe Franzoni]] and employed in the small domed Vestibule of the Supreme Court. Only the Supreme Court survived the fire of 24&amp;nbsp;August 1814, nearly intact. With peace restored, Latrobe designed an American order that substituted for the acanthus tobacco leaves, of which he sent a sketch to [[Thomas Jefferson]] in a letter, 5&amp;nbsp;November 1816. He was encouraged to send a model of it, which remains at [[Monticello]]. In the 1830s [[Alexander Jackson Davis]] admired it enough to make a drawing of it. In 1809 Latrobe invented a second American order, employing [[magnolia]] flowers constrained within the profile of classical mouldings, as his drawing demonstrates. It was intended for "the Upper Columns in the Gallery of the Entrance of the Chamber of the Senate" ({{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/us.capitol/s4.html |title=United States Capitol exhibit}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18125">[[Honeypot (computing)|Honeypots]] are security devices whose value lie in being probed and compromised. Traditional honeypots are servers (or devices that expose server services) that wait passively to be attacked. '''Client Honeypots''' are active security devices in search of malicious servers that attack clients. The client honeypot poses as a client and interacts with the server to examine whether an attack has occurred. Often the focus of client honeypots is on web browsers, but any client that interacts with servers can be part of a client honeypot (for example [[FTP|ftp]], ssh, email, etc.).

There are several terms that are used to describe client honeypots. Besides client honeypot, which is the generic classification, honeyclient is the other term that is generally used and accepted. However, there is a subtlety here, as "honeyclient" is actually a [[homograph]] that could also refer to the first known open source client honeypot implementation (see below), although this should be clear from the context.

== Architecture ==
A client honeypot is composed of three components. The first component, a queuer, is responsible for creating a list of servers for the client to visit. This list can be created, for example, through crawling. The second component is the client itself, which is able to make a requests to servers identified by the queuer. After the interaction with the server has taken place, the third component, an analysis engine, is responsible for determining whether an attack has taken place on the client honeypot.

In addition to these components, client honeypots are usually equipped with some sort of containment strategy to prevent successful attacks from spreading beyond the client honeypot. This is usually achieved through the use of firewalls and virtual machine sandboxes.

Analogous to traditional server honeypots, client honeypots are mainly classified by their interaction level: high or low; which denotes the level of functional interaction the server can utilize on the client honeypot. In addition to this there are also newly hybrid approaches which denotes the usage of both high and low interaction detection techniques.

== High interaction ==
High interaction client honeypots are fully functional systems comparable to real systems with real clients. As such, no functional limitations (besides the containment strategy) exist on high interaction client honeypots. Attacks on high interaction client honeypots are detected via inspection of the state of the system after a server has been interacted with. The detection of changes to the client honeypot may indicate the occurrence of an attack against that has exploited a vulnerability of the client. An example of such a change is the presence of a new or altered file.

High interaction client honeypots are very effective at detecting unknown attacks on clients. However, the tradeoff for this accuracy is a performance hit from the amount of system state that has to be monitored to make an attack assessment. Also, this detection mechanism is prone to various forms of evasion by the exploit. For example, an attack could delay the exploit from immediately triggering (time bombs) or could trigger upon a particular set of conditions or actions ([[Logic Bomb|logic bombs]]). Since no immediate, detectable state change occurred, the client honeypot is likely to incorrectly classify the server as safe even though it did successfully perform its attack on the client. Finally, if the client honeypots are running in virtual machines, then an exploit may try to detect the presence of the virtual environment and cease from triggering or behave differently.

=== Capture-HPC  ===
Capture {{ref|capture}} is a high interaction client honeypot developed by researchers at Victoria University of Wellington, NZ. Capture differs from existing client honeypots in various ways. First, it is designed to be fast. State changes are being detected using an event based model allowing to react to state changes as they occur. Second, Capture is designed to be scalable. A central Capture server is able to control numerous clients across a network. Third, Capture is supposed to be a framework that allows to utilize different clients. The initial version of Capture supports Internet Explorer, but the current version supports all major browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari) as well as other HTTP aware client applications, such as office applications and media players.

=== HoneyClient ===
HoneyClient {{ref|honeyclient}} is a web browser based (IE/FireFox) high interaction client honeypot designed by Kathy Wang in 2004 and subsequently developed at [[MITRE]]. It was the first open source client honeypot and is a mix of Perl, C++, and Ruby. HoneyClient is state-based and detects attacks on Windows clients by monitoring files, process events, and registry entries. It has integrated the Capture-HPC real-time integrity checker to perform this detection. HoneyClient also contains a crawler, so it can be seeded with a list of initial URLs from which to start and can then continue to traverse web sites in search of client-side malware.

=== HoneyMonkey (dead since 2010) ===
{{Main|HoneyMonkey}}
HoneyMonkey {{ref|honeymonkey}} is a web browser based (IE) high interaction client honeypot implemented by Microsoft in 2005. It is not available for download. HoneyMonkey is state based and detects attacks on clients by monitoring files, registry, and processes. A unique characteristic of HoneyMonkey is its layered approach to interacting with servers in order to identify zero-day exploits. HoneyMonkey initially crawls the web with a vulnerable configuration. Once an attack has been identified, the server is reexamined with a fully patched configuration. If the attack is still detected, one can conclude that the attack utilizes an exploit for which no patch has been publicly released yet and therefore is quite dangerous.

=== SHELIA (dead since 2009) ===
Shelia {{ref|shelia}} is a high interaction client honeypot developed by Joan Robert Rocaspana at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. It integrates with an email reader and processes each email it receives (URLs &amp; attachments). Depending on the type of URL or attachment received, it opens a different client application (e.g. browser, office application, etc.) It monitors whether executable instructions are executed in data area of memory (which would indicate a buffer overflow exploit has been triggered). With such an approach, SHELIA is not only able to detect exploits, but is able to actually ward off exploits from triggering.

=== UW Spycrawler ===
The Spycrawler {{ref|spycrawler}} developed at the University of Washington is yet another browser based (Mozilla) high interaction client honeypot developed by Moshchuk et al. in 2005. This client honeypot is not available for download. The Spycrawler is state based and detects attacks on clients by monitoring files, processes, registry, and browser crashes. Spycrawlers detection mechanism is event based. Further, it increases the passage of time of the virtual machine the Spycrawler is operating in to overcome (or rather reduce the impact of) time bombs.

=== Web Exploit Finder ===
WEF {{ref|stuttgart}} is an implementation of an automatic drive-by-download – detection in a virtualized environment, developed by Thomas Müller, Benjamin Mack and Mehmet Arziman, three students from the Hochschule der Medien (HdM), Stuttgart during the summer term in 2006. WEF can be used as an active HoneyNet with a complete virtualization architecture underneath for rollbacks of compromised virtualized machines.

== Low interaction ==
Low interaction client honeypots differ from high interaction client honeypots in that they do not utilize an entire real system, but rather use lightweight or simulated clients to interact with the server. (in the browser world, they are similar to web crawlers). Responses from servers are examined directly to assess whether an attack has taken place. This could be done, for example, by examining the response for the presence of malicious strings.

Low interaction client honeypots are easier to deploy and operate than high interaction client honeypots and also perform better. However, they are likely to have a lower detection rate since attacks have to be known to the client honeypot in order for it to detect them; new attacks are likely to go unnoticed. They also suffer from the problem of evasion by exploits, which may be exacerbated due to their simplicity, thus making it easier for an exploit to detect the presence of the client honeypot.

=== HoneyC ===
HoneyC {{ref|honeyc}} is a low interaction client honeypot developed at Victoria University of Wellington by Christian Seifert in 2006. HoneyC is a platform independent open source framework written in Ruby. It currently concentrates driving a web browser simulator to interact with servers. Malicious servers are detected by statically examining the web server’s response for malicious strings through the usage of Snort signatures.

=== Monkey-Spider (dead since 2008) ===
Monkey-Spider {{ref|monkeyspider}} is a low-interaction client honeypot initially developed at the University of Mannheim by Ali Ikinci. Monkey-Spider is a crawler based client honeypot initially utilizing anti-virus solutions to detect malware. It is claimed to be fast and expandable with other detection mechanisms. The work has started as a diploma thesis and is continued and released as Free Software under the [[GPL]].

=== PhoneyC (dead since 2015) ===
PhoneyC {{ref|phoneyc}} is a low-interaction client developed by Jose Nazario. PhoneyC mimics legitimate web browsers and can understand dynamic content by de-obfuscating malicious content for detection. Furthermore, PhoneyC emulates specific vulnerabilities to pinpoint the attack vector. PhoneyC is a modular framework that enables the study of malicious HTTP pages and understands modern vulnerabilities and attacker techniques.

=== SpyBye  ===
SpyBye {{ref|spybye}} is a low interaction client honeypot developed by [[Niels Provos]]. SpyBye allows a web master to determine whether a web site is malicious by a set of heuristics and scanning of content against the ClamAV engine.

=== Thug ===
Thug {{ref|thug}} is a low-interaction client honeypot developed by Angelo Dell'Aera. Thug emulates the behaviour of a web browser and is focused on detection of malicious web pages. The tool uses Google V8 Javascript engine and implements its own Document Object Model (DOM). The most important and unique features of Thug are: the ActiveX controls handling module (vulnerability module), and static + dynamic
analysis capabilities (using Abstract Syntax Tree and Libemu shellcode analyser). Thug is written in Python under GNU General Public License.

=== YALIH ===
YALIH (Yet Another Low Interaction Honeyclient) {{ref|YALIH}} is a low Interaction Client honeypot developed by Masood Mansoori from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand and designed to detect malicious websites through signature, anomaly and pattern matching techniques. YALIH has the capability to collect suspicious URLs from malicious website databases, Bing API, inbox and SPAM folder through POP3 and IMAP protocol. It can perform Javascript extraction, de-obfuscation and de-minification of scripts embedded within a website and can emulate Referrer, browser agents and handle redirection, cookies and sessions. Its visitor agent is capable of fetching a website from multiple locations to bypass geo-location and IP cloaking attacks. YALIH's detection is based on a combination of signature based ClamAV and AVG databases and pattern matching and anomaly detection of suspicious characteristics of a website. YALIH can also generate automated signatures to detect variations of an attack. YALIH is available as an open source project.

== Hybrid Client Honeypots ==
Hybrid client honeypots combine both low and high interaction client honeypots to gain from the advantages of both approaches.

=== HoneySpider (dead since 2013) ===
The HoneySpider {{ref|honeyspider}} network is a hybrid client honeypot developed as a joint venture between [[CERT Polska|NASK/CERT Polska]], [http://www.govcert.nl/ GOVCERT.NL] and [http://www.surfnet.nl/ SURFnet]. The projects goal is to develop a complete client honeypot system, based on existing client honeypot solutions and a crawler specially for the bulk processing of URLs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3121">The '''Dakeyne hydraulic disc engine''' was a high pressure [[hydraulic engine]] built in the 19th century to power a [[flax]] [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] in Ladygrove, [[Derbyshire]], [[England]].

==History==
In the 1820s mill owners Edward &amp; James Dakeyne designed and constructed a [[nutating disc engine|disc engine]] known locally as "The Romping Lion" to make use of the high-pressure water available near their mill.

The Dakeyne brothers had previously invented  "The Equalinium", a machine for the preparation of flax for spinning, and their father Daniel Dakeyne (1733-1819)&lt;ref name=glover&gt;{{cite book | last = Glover | first = Stephen  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = The History of the County of Derby | publisher = Henry Mozley and Son | date = 1829 | location =  | nopp =  | page = 363 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQVAAAAQAAJ | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; was granted a patent for this device in 1794. It is often said that Edward and James did not take out the patent themselves because they were minors at the time, but in fact they were 23 and 21 respectively.

Little is known of their engine other than from the somewhat unclear description accompanying the patent, which was granted in 1830. Its main castings were made at the Morley Park foundry near [[Heage]], and it weighed 7 tons and generated 35 horsepower at a head of 96 feet of water. 

Stephen Glover, in his gazetteer of Derbyshire, was enthusiastic about the prospects for the disc engine, foreseeing its use in all manner of applications, domestic as well as industrial, not only as a prime mover but also as a pump. He stated that John Dakeyne had also commissioned a disc engine to drive the bellows of an organ in the family's residence, Knabb House.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
  | last =Glover
  | first =Stephen
  | title =History &amp; Gazetteer Of Derbyshire
  | pages =354
  |date=1833}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A larger model was constructed to drain lead mines at [[Alport]] near [[Youlgreave]] and many steam versions were subsequently built by other people.

The machine itself is difficult to describe. Frank Nixon, in his book "The Industrial Archaeology of Derbyshire" (1969), commented that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The most striking characteristic of this ingenious machine is perhaps the difficulty experienced by those trying to describe it; the patentees &amp; Stephen Glover only succeeded in producing descriptions of monumental incomprehensibility.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1719">'''Discrete optimization''' is a branch of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] in [[applied mathematics]] and [[computer science]].

==Scope==
As opposed to [[continuous optimization]], some or all of the [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] used in a discrete [[optimization (mathematics)|mathematical program]] are restricted to be [[discrete variable]]s&amp;mdash;that is, to assume only a [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] set of values, such as the integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A First Course in Combinatorial Optimization|volume=36|series=Cambridge Texts in Applied Mathematics|first=Jon|last=Lee|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780521010122|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3pL1B7WVYnAC&amp;pg=PA1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branches==
Two notable branches of discrete optimization are:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

* [[combinatorial optimization]], which refers to problems on [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, [[matroid]]s and other discrete structures
* [[integer programming]] 
These branches are closely intertwined however since many combinatorial optimization problems can be modeled as integer programs (e.g. [[Shortest path#Linear programming formulation|shortest path]]) and conversely, integer programs can often be given a combinatorial interpretation.

{{refimprove|date=July 2013}}

'''Duophonic''' sound was a trade name for a type of [[audio signal processing]] used by [[Capitol Records]] on certain releases and re-releases of mono recordings issued during the 1960s and 1970s. In this process [[monaural]] recordings were reprocessed into a type of artificial [[stereo]]. Generically, the sound is commonly known as '''fake stereo''' or '''mock stereo'''.

This was done by splitting the mono signal into two channels, then delaying the left and the right signals by means of [[delay (audio effect)|delay lines]] and other circuits, i.e. desynchronizing the two channels by fractions of a second, and cutting the bass frequencies in one channel with a [[high-pass filter]], then cutting the treble frequencies in the other channel with a [[low-pass filter]]. The result was an artificial stereo effect, without giving the listener the true directional sound characteristics of real stereo. In some cases, the effect was enhanced with [[reverberation]] and other technical tricks, sometimes adding stereo echo to mono tracks in an attempt to fool the listener.

Capitol employed this technique in order to increase their inventory of stereo LPs, to satisfy retailer demand for more stereo content (and help promote the sale of stereo receivers and turntables). For nearly ten years, Capitol used the banner "DUOPHONIC – For Stereo Phonographs Only" to differentiate their true stereo LPs from the Duophonic LPs.

Capitol began using the process in June 1961 and continued its practice into the 1970s.  It was used for some of the biggest Capitol releases, including albums by [[The Beach Boys]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. Over the years however, some Duophonic tapes were confused with true stereo recordings in Capitol Records' vaults, and were reissued on CD throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Capitol intentionally reissued some of [[The Beatles]]' Duophonic mixes on ''[[The Capitol Albums, Volume 1]]'' and ''[[The Capitol Albums, Volume 2]]'', in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

On rare occasions some artists deliberately used fake stereo to achieve an intended artistic effect. In such situations artificial stereo was used when certain elements of a mono mix could not be reproduced for a stereo remix, for instance in the case of the Beatles' stereo mix of the song "[[I Am the Walrus]]" where the first portion of the piece is true stereo but switches to artificial stereo at approximately the two-minute mark for the remainder of the song, because the live radio feeds from a BBC broadcast of King Lear were mixed directly into the mono mix of the song and could not (with the pre-digital technology of that time) be extricated and discreetly superimposed onto the stereo mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brennan|first=Joseph|title=The Usenet Guide to Beatles Recording Variations|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beatles/var-1967.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later remixes of the song, such as that included in the ''[[Love (The Beatles album)|Love]]'' soundtrack album, are in true stereo for the complete song. Similarly, the mono mix of the song "[[Only a Northern Song]]" featured sound effects which were made during the mixing process and were difficult to be remade for a stereo remix, so the song was released in fake stereo in the 1969 album ''[[Yellow Submarine (album)|Yellow Submarine]]''. However, the 1999 album ''[[Yellow Submarine Songtrack]]'' features a full stereo remix of the song and the 2009 remaster of the original 1969 album restores the song to its original mono mix because enhanced stereo has fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Yellow Submarine 2009 Remaster Booklet&lt;/ref&gt;

Other record companies used similar processing of monophonic material to create a stereo effect, but referred to the process by other names. For example, Columbia Records used the logo, "Electronically Re-channeled for Stereo" on records issued with their particular process.  As with Capitol, Columbia's artficial stereo issues included albums by major artists, such as [[Miles Davis]] (''[['Round About Midnight]]'', CL 949 mono, reissued in stereo as PC 8649).

[[File:Image-DiscDiffuser.JPG|thumb|right|A Fine Bubble Diffuser in a Tank]]
'''Fine bubble diffusers''' are a [[pollution control]] technology used to aerate wastewater for [[sewage treatment]].

==Description==
Fine bubble diffusers produce a plethora of very small air bubbles which rise slowly from the floor of a wastewater treatment plant or sewage treatment plant aeration tank and provide substantial and efficient mass transfer of oxygen to the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr. B.C. Punmia|author2=Ashok Kr. Jain|author3=Arun Kr. Jain|title=Waste Water Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmsvcHoq2cgC|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Firewall Media|isbn=978-81-7008-091-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen, combined with the food source, [[sewage]], allows the bacteria to produce enzymes which help break down the waste so that it can settle in the secondary clarifiers or be filtered by membranes. A fine bubble diffuser is commonly manufactured in various forms: tube, disc, plate, and dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1999 |title=Fine Bubble Aeration |series=Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/fine.pdf |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 832-F-99-065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bubble size==
The subject of bubble size is important because the aeration system in a wastewater or sewage treatment plant consumes an average of 50 to 70 percent of the energy of the entire plant.&lt;ref name="Spellman2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank R. Spellman|title=Water &amp; Wastewater Infrastructure: Energy Efficiency and Sustainability|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bgg-8vIdpIC&amp;pg=PA300|date=2013-03-12|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-1785-1|pages=300–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the oxygen transfer efficiency decreases the power the plant requires to provide the same quality of [[effluent]] water.  Furthermore, fine bubble diffusers evenly spread out (often referred to as a 'grid arrangement') on the floor of a tank, provide the operator of the plant a great deal of operational flexibility.  This can be used to create zones with high oxygen concentrations (oxic or [[Wikt:aerobic|aerobic]]), zones with minimal oxygen concentration ([[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]]) and zones with no oxygen (anaerobic). This allows for more precise targeting and removal of specific contaminants.

The importance of achieving ever smaller bubble sizes has been a hotly debated subject in the industry as ultra fine bubbles (micrometre size) are generally perceived to rise too slowly and provide too little "pumpage" to provide adequate mixing of sewage in an aeration tank. On the other hand, the industry standard "fine bubble" with a typical discharge diameter of 2&amp;nbsp;mm is probably larger than it needs to be for many plants.  Average bubble diameters of 0.9&amp;nbsp;mm are possible nowadays, using special polyurethane (PUR) or special recently developed EPDM membranes.&lt;ref name="Spellman2013"/&gt;

Fine bubble diffusers have largely replaced [[coarse bubble diffusers]] and mechanical aerators in most of the developed world and in much of the developing world. The exception would be in secondary treatment phases, such as activated sludge processing tanks, where 85 to 90 percent of any remaining solid materials (floating on the surface) are removed through settling or biological processes. The biological process uses air to encourage bacterial growth that would consume many of these waste materials, such as phosphorus and nitrogen that are dissolved in the wastewater. The larger air release openings of a coarse bubble diffuser helps to facilitate a higher oxygen transfer rate and bacterial growth. One disadvantage of using fine bubble diffusers in activated sludge tanks is the tendency of floc (particle) clogging the small air release holes.&lt;ref name="woodard2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Woodard|title=Industrial Waste Treatment Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G4tT0ESKVpUC&amp;pg=PA286|date=2001-09-11|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-08-049539-2|pages=286–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[molecular biology]] and [[biotechnology]], a '''fluorescent tag''', also known as a '''fluorescent  label''' or '''fluorescent probe''', is a [[molecule]] that is attached chemically to aid in the detection of a [[biomolecule]] such as a protein, antibody, or amino acid. Generally, [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] tagging, or labeling, uses a reactive derivative of a fluorescent molecule known as a [[fluorophore]].  The fluorophore selectively binds to a specific region or functional group on the target molecule and can be attached chemically or biologically.&lt;ref name="Sahoo"/&gt;  Various labeling techniques such as enzymatic labeling, [[protein tag|protein labeling]], and genetic labeling are widely utilized. [[ethidium bromide]], [[fluorescein]] and [[green fluorescent protein]] are common tags. The most commonly labelled molecules are antibodies, proteins, amino acids and peptides which are then used as specific probes for detection of a particular target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/01/fluorescent-labeling-of-biomolecules-with-organic-probes/|title=Fluorescent labeling of biomolecules with organic probes - Presentations - PharmaXChange.info|date=29 January 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of methods to detect and identify biomolecules has been motivated by the ability to improve the study of molecular structure and interactions.  Before the technology of [[fluorescent labeling]], [[radioisotopes]] were used to detect and identify molecular compounds.  Since then, safer methods have been developed that involve the use of fluorescent dyes or fluorescent proteins as tags or probes as a means to label and identify biomolecules.&lt;ref name="Gwynne and Page"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gwynne and Page|first=Peter and Guy|title=Laboratory Technology Trends: Fluorescence + Labeling|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/products/labtech.xhtml|publisher=Science|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although fluorescent tagging in this regard has only been recently utilized, the discovery of fluorescence has been around for a much longer time.

[[Sir George Stokes]] developed the Stokes Law of Fluorescence in 1852 which states that the wavelength of fluorescence emission is greater than that of the exciting radiation.  Richard Meyer then termed [[fluorophore]] in 1897 to describe a chemical group associated with fluorescence.  Since then, [[Fluorescein]] was created as a fluorescent dye by Adolph von Baeyer in 1871 and the method of staining was developed and utilized with the development of [[fluorescence microscopy]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="pmid19233914"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kricka LJ, Fortina P |title=Analytical ancestry: "firsts" in fluorescent labeling of nucleosides, nucleotides, and nucleic acids |journal=Clin.

Ethidium bromide and variants were developed in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="pmid19233914"/&gt; and in 1994, fluorescent proteins or FPs were introduced.&lt;ref name="urlChemical Tags for Labeling Proteins Inside Living Cells"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=3232020 |title=Chemical Tags for Labeling Proteins Inside Living Cells | pmid=21879706 |doi=10.1021/ar200099f |volume=44 |issue=9 |year=2011 |journal=Acc. Chem. Res. |pages=784–92 | last1 = Jing | first1 = C | last2 = Cornish | first2 = VW}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green fluorescent protein]] or GFP was discovered by [[Osamu Shimomura]] in the 1960s and was developed as a tracer molecule by Douglas Prasher in 1987.&lt;ref name="urlGreen Fluorescent Protein - GFP History - Osamu Shimomura"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conncoll.edu/ccacad/zimmer/GFP-ww/shimomura.html |title=Green Fluorescent Protein - GFP History - Osamu Shimomura |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FPs led to a breakthrough of live [[Microscopy|cell imaging]] with the ability to selectively tag genetic protein regions and observe protein functions and mechanisms.&lt;ref name="urlChemical Tags for Labeling Proteins Inside Living Cells"/&gt; For this breakthrough, Shimomura was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2008.&lt;ref name=NobelPrize&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimomura|first=Osamu|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2008/press.html|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New methods for tracking biomolecules have been developed including the use of colorimetric biosensors, photochromic compounds, [[biomaterials]], and electrochemical sensors.  [[Fluorescent labeling]] is also a common method in which applications have expanded to enzymatic labeling, chemical labeling, [[protein tag|protein labeling]], and genetic labeling.&lt;ref name=Sahoo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahoo|first=Harekrushna|title=Fluorescent labeling techniques in biomolecules: a flashback|journal=[[RSC Advances]]|date=1 January 2012|volume=2|issue=18|pages=7017–7029|doi=10.1039/C2RA20389H|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/pdf/article/2012/ra/c2ra20389h|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods for tracking biomolecules==
There are currently several labeling methods for tracking biomolecules.  Some of the methods include the following.

===Isotope markers===
Common species that isotope markers are used for include proteins. In this case, amino acids with stable isotopes of either carbon, nitrogen, or hydrogen are incorporated into polypeptide sequences.&lt;ref name="Mass Tagging Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xian|author2=Smith, Lloyd M. |author3=Bradbury, E. Morton |title=Site-Specific Mass Tagging with Stable Isotopes in Proteins for Accurate and Efficient Protein Identification|journal=Analytical Chemistry|date=1 March 2000|volume=72|issue=6|pages=1134–1143|doi=10.1021/ac9911600|pmid=10740850}}&lt;/ref&gt; These polypeptides are then put through [[mass spectrometry]]. Because of the exact defined change that these isotopes incur on the peptides, it is possible to tell through the spectrometry graph which peptides contained the isotopes. By doing so, one can extract the protein of interest from several others in a group. Isotopic compounds play an important role as photochromes, described below.

===Colorimetric biosensors===
Biosensors are attached to a substance of interest. Normally, this substance would not be able to absorb light, but with the attached biosensor, light can be absorbed and emitted on a [[spectrophotometer]].&lt;ref name=colorassay&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorimetric Assays|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bioslabs/methods/protein/protcurve.html|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, biosensors that are fluorescent can be viewed with the naked eye. Some fluorescent biosensors also have the ability to change color in changing environments (ex: from blue to red). A researcher would be able to inspect and get data about the surrounding environment based on what color he or she could see visibly from the biosensor-molecule hybrid species.&lt;ref name="Biosensor Vesicles Revital"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halevy, Revital|author2=Sofiya Kolusheval |author3=Robert E.W. Hancock |author4=Raz Jelinek |title=Colorimetric Biosensor Vesicles for Biotechnological Applications|journal=Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings.| volume = 724. Biological and Biomimetic Materials - Properties to Function|year=2002|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/p014413.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorimetric assays are normally used to determine how much concentration of one species there is relative to another.&lt;ref name=colorassay /&gt;

===Photochromic compounds===
[[Photochromic]] compounds have the ability to switch between a range or variety of colors. Their ability to display different colors lies in how they absorb light. Different isomeric manifestations of the molecule absorbs different wavelengths of light, so that each isomeric species can display a different color based on its absorption. These include photoswitchable compounds, which are proteins that can switch from a non-fluorescent state to that of a fluorescent one given a certain environment.&lt;ref name="Lummer Photoswitchable"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lummer|first=M|author2=Humpert, F |author3=Wiedenlüebbert, M |author4=Sauer, M |author5=Schüettpelz, M |author6= Staiger, D |title=A new set of reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins for use in transgenic plants|journal=Molecular Plant|date=Feb 23, 2013|pmid=23434876|doi=10.1093/mp/sst040|volume=6|issue=5|pages=1518–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common organic molecule to be used as a photochrome is [[diarylethene]].&lt;ref name="Perrier photochrome"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perrier|first=Aurélie|author2=Maurel, François |author3=Jacquemin, Denis |title=Single Molecule Multiphotochromism with Diarylethenes|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=21 August 2012|volume=45|issue=8|pages=1173–1182|doi=10.1021/ar200214k|pmid=22668009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of photoswitchable proteins include PADRON-C, rs-FastLIME-s and bs-DRONPA-s, which can be used in plant and mammalian cells alike to watch cells move into different environments.&lt;ref name="Lummer Photoswitchable" /&gt;

===Biomaterials===
Fluorescent biomaterials are a possible way of using external factors to observe a pathway more visibly. The method involves fluorescently labeling peptide molecules that would alter an organism's natural pathway. When this peptide is inserted into the organism's cell, it can induce a different reaction. This method can be used, for example to treat a patient and then visibly see the treatment's outcome.&lt;ref name="Zhang Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Yi|author2=Yang, Jian|title=Design strategies for fluorescent biodegradable polymeric biomaterials|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry B|date=1 January 2013|volume=1|issue=2|pages=132–148|doi=10.1039/C2TB00071G|pmid=23710326|pmc=3660738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrochemical sensors===
Electrochemical sensors can used for label-free sensing of biomolecules.  They detect changes and measure current between a probed metal electrode and an electrolyte containing the target analyte.  A known potential to the electrode is then applied from a feedback current and the resulting current can be measured.  For example, one technique using electrochemical sensing includes slowly raising the voltage causing chemical species at the electrode to be oxidized or reduced.  Cell current vs voltage is plotted which can ultimately identify the quantity of chemical species consumed or produced at the electrode.&lt;ref name="urlbioee.ee.columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioee.ee.columbia.edu/downloads/2007/7.pdf |title=bioee.ee.columbia.edu |format= |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorescent tags can be used in conjunction with electrochemical sensors for ease of detection in a biological system.

===Fluorescent labels===
[[File:Aequorea victoria.jpg|thumb|200px|''Aequorea victoria'']]
[[File:GFP structure.png|thumb|200px|GFP structure]]

Of the various methods of labeling biomolecules, fluorescent labels are advantageous in that they are highly sensitive even at low concentration and non-destructive to the target molecule folding and function.&lt;ref name="Sahoo"/&gt;

[[Green fluorescent protein]] is a naturally occurring fluorescent protein from the jellyfish ''Aequorea victoria'' that is widely 
used to tag proteins of interest.  GFP emits a photon in the green region of the light spectrum when excited by the absorption of light.  The [[chromophore]] consists of an oxidized tripeptide -Ser^65-Tyr^66-Gly^67 located within a β barrel.  GFP catalyzes the oxidation and
only requires molecular oxygen.  GFP has been modified by changing the wavelength of light absorbed to include other colors of fluorescence.  YFP or [[yellow fluorescent protein]], BFP or [[blue fluorescent protein]], and CFP or [[cyan fluorescent protein]] are examples of GFP variants.  These variants are produced by the genetic engineering of the GFP gene.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-7108-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cox, Michael |author2=Nelson, David R. |author3=Lehninger, Albert L |title=Lehninger principles of biochemistry |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7167-7108-1 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic fluorescent probes can also be used as fluorescent labels.  Advantages of these labels include a smaller size with more variety in color.  They can be used to tag proteins of interest more selectively by various methods including chemical recognition-based labeling, such as utilizing metal-chelating peptide tags, and biological recognition-based labeling utilizing enzymatic reactions.&lt;ref name="pmid23318293"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jung D, Min K, Jung J, Jang W, Kwon Y |title=Chemical biology-based approaches on fluorescent labeling of proteins in live cells |journal=Mol Biosyst |volume= 9|issue= 5|pages= 862–72|date=January 2013 |pmid=23318293 |doi=10.1039/c2mb25422k }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, despite their wide array of excitation and emission wavelengths as well as better stability, synthetic probes tend to be toxic to the cell and so are not generally used in cell imaging studies.&lt;ref name="Sahoo"/&gt;

Fluorescent labels can be hybridized to mRNA to help visualize interaction and activity, such as mRNA localization. An antisense strand labeled with the fluorescent probe is attached to a single mRNA strand, and can then be viewed during cell development to see the movement of mRNA within the cell.&lt;ref name="Weil mRNA visualization"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weil|first=Timothy T.|author2=Parton, Richard M. |author3=Davis, Ilan |title=Making the message clear: visualizing mRNA localization|journal=Trends in Cell Biology|date=1 July 2010|volume=20|issue=7|pages=380–390|doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2010.03.006|pmid=20444605|pmc=2902723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluorogen labels ===
A fluorogen is ligand (fluorogenic ligand) which is not itself fluorescent, but when it is bound by a specific protein or RNA structure becomes fluorescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=April 2008|title=Fluorogen-activating single-chain antibodies for imaging cell surface proteins|url=|journal=[[Nat. Biotechnol.|Nature Biotechnology]]|type=Abstract|volume=26|issue=2|pages=235–40|doi=10.1038/nbt1368|pmid=18157118|subscription=|quote=We report here the development of protein reporters that generate fluorescence from otherwise dark molecules (fluorogens).|via=|vauthors=Szent-Gyorgyi C, Schmidt BF, Creeger Y, et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, Y-FAST is an variant of [[Halorhodospira halophila#Applications|photoactive yellow protein]] which was engineered to bind chemical mimics of the GFP tripeptide chromophore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=19 January 2016|title=Small fluorescence-activating and absorption-shifting tag for tunable protein imaging in vivo|journal=[[Proc.

==Use of tags in fluorescent labeling==

Fluorescent labeling is known for its non-destructive nature and high sensitivity.  This has made it one of the most widely used methods for labeling and tracking biomolecules.&lt;ref name="Sahoo"/&gt;  Several techniques of fluorescent labeling can be utilized depending on the nature of the target.

===Enzymatic labeling===
In enzymatic labeling, a DNA construct is first formed, using a gene and the DNA of a fluorescent protein.&lt;ref name=Biotechniques&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Richter |author2=C. Schwager |author3=S. Hentze |author4=W. Ansorge |author5=M.W. Hentze |author6=M. Muckenthaler |title=Comparison of Fluorescent Tag DNA  Labeling Methods Used for Expression  Analysis by DNA Microarrays|journal=BioTechniques |volume=33 |pages=620–630|year=2002|url=http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00011/02333rr05_11834a.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After transcription, a hybrid RNA + fluorescent is formed. The object of interest is attached to an enzyme that can recognize this hybrid DNA. Usually fluorescein or biotin is used as the fluorophore.

===Chemical labeling===
Chemical labeling or the use of chemical tags utilizes the interaction between a small molecule and a specific genetic amino acid sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid21567974"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wombacher R, Cornish VW |title=Chemical tags: applications in live cell fluorescence imaging |journal=J Biophotonics |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=391–402 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21567974 |doi=10.1002/jbio.201100018 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical labeling is sometimes used as an alternative for GFP. Synthetic proteins that function as fluorescent probes are smaller than GFP's, and therefore can function as probes in a wider variety of situations. Moreover, they offer a wider range of colors and photochemical properties.&lt;ref name="chemical labelling Jung"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jung|first=Deokho|author2=Min, Kyoungmi |author3=Jung, Juyeon |author4=Jang, Wonhee |author5= Kwon, Youngeun |title=Chemical biology-based approaches on fluorescent labeling of proteins in live cells|journal=Molecular BioSystems|date=1 January 2013|volume=9|issue=5|pages=862–72|doi=10.1039/C2MB25422K|pmid=23318293}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  With recent advancements in chemical labeling, Chemical tags are preferred over fluorescent proteins due to the architectural and size limitations of the fluorescent protein's characteristic β-barrel.  Alterations of fluorescent proteins would lead to loss of fluorescent properties.&lt;ref name="pmid21567974"/&gt;

===Protein labeling===
Protein labeling uses a short tag to minimize disruption of protein folding and function.  Transition metals are used to link specific residues in the tags to site-specific targets such as the N-termini, C-termini, or internal sites within the protein. Examples of tags used for protein labeling include biarsenical tags, Histidine tags, and FLAG tags.&lt;ref name="Sahoo"/&gt;

===Genetic labeling===
[[Fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH), is an example of a genetic labeling technique that utilizes probes that are specific for chromosomal sites along the length of a chromosome, also known as [[chromosome painting]].  Multiple fluorescent dyes that each have a distinct excitation and emission wavelength are bound to a probe which is then hybridized to chromosomes.  A fluorescence microscope can detect the dyes present and send it to a computer that can reveal the karyotype of a cell.  This technique allows abnormalities such as deletions and duplications to be revealed.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4292-3413-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Matthew P Scott |author2=Lodish, Harvey F. |author3=Arnold Berk |author4=Kaiser, Chris |author5=Monty Krieger |author6=Anthony Bretscher |author7=Hidde Ploegh |author8=Angelika Amon |title=Molecular Cell Biology |publisher=W. H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2012 |pages= |isbn=978-1-4292-3413-9 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell imaging==
Chemical tags have been tailored for imaging technologies more so than fluorescent proteins because chemical tags can localize photosensitizers closer to the target proteins.{{cn|date=September 2018}}  Proteins can then be labeled and detected with imaging such as [[super-resolution microscopy]], [[Calcium imaging|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-imaging]], pH sensing, hydrogen peroxide detection, chromophore assisted light inactivation, and multi-photon light microscopy.  [[In vivo]] imaging studies in live animals have been performed for the first time with the use of a [[monomeric]] protein derived from the bacterial haloalkane dehalogenase known as the Halo-tag.&lt;ref name="pmid21567974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23115610"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=N Peterson S, Kwon K |title=The HaloTag: Improving Soluble Expression and Applications in Protein Functional Analysis |journal=Curr Chem Genomics |volume=6 |issue= 1|pages=8–17 |year=2012 |pmid=23115610 |pmc=3480702 |doi=10.2174/1875397301206010008 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Halo-tag [[covalently]] links to its [[ligand]] and allows for better expression of soluble proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid23115610"/&gt;

==Advantages==
Although fluorescent dyes may not have the same sensitivity as radioactive probes, they are able to show real-time activity of molecules in action.&lt;ref name=FlourescentAdvantages&gt;{{cite journal|last=Proudnikov|first=Dmitri|author2=Andrei Mirzabekov|title=Chemical methods of DNA and RNA fluorescent labeling|journal=Oxford University Press|year=1996|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC146275/pdf/244535.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2013|pmc=146275|pmid=8948646|volume=24|issue=22|pages=4535–42|doi=10.1093/nar/24.22.4535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, radiation and appropriate handling is no longer a concern.

With the development of fluorescent tagging, [[fluorescent microscopy]] has allowed the visualization of specific proteins in both fixed and live cell images. Localization of specific proteins has led to important concepts in cellular biology such as the functions of distinct groups of proteins in cellular membranes and organelles.  In live cell imaging, fluorescent tags enable movements of proteins and their interactions to be monitored.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4292-3413-X"/&gt;

Latest advances in methods involving fluorescent tags have led to the visualization of [[mRNA]] and its localization within various organisms.  Live cell imaging of RNA can be achieved by introducing synthesized RNA that is chemically coupled with a fluorescent tag into living cells by microinjection.  This technique was used to show how the ''oskar'' mRNA in the ''[[Drosophila]]'' embryo localizes to the [[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] region of the [[oocyte]].&lt;ref name="urlMaking the message clear: visualizing mRNA localization"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2902723 |title=Making the message clear: visualizing mRNA localization | pmid=20444605 |doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2010.03.006 |volume=20 |issue=7 |date=Jul 2010 |journal=Trends Cell Biol |pages=380–90 | last1 = Weil | first1 = TT | last2 = Parton | first2 = RM | last3 = Davis | first3 = I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2387">'''Forensic metrology''' is [[metrology]], the science of measurement, as it applies to [[forensic science]]s. Forensic [[Laboratory|laboratories]] and [[Criminalistics|criminalistic]] laboratories perform numerous measurements and tests to support both [[Criminal prosecution|criminal]] and [[Civil lawsuit|civil legal actions]].  Examples of forensic metrology include the measurement of blood or breath [[alcohol content]], the quantification of [[controlled substance]]s (both net weights and purity), and length measurements of [[Gun barrel|firearm barrels]].  The results of forensic measurements are used to determine if a person is charged with a crime or may be used to determine a statutory sentencing enhancement.  Other examples of forensic metrology includes tests that measure if there is a presence of a substance (e.g., cocaine), latent print examination, [[questioned document examination|questioned documents examination]], and [[DNA analysis]].

Forensic measurements are all supported by reference standards which are traceable to the [[International System of Units]] (SI) maintained by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]], to natural constants, or to reference materials such as those provided by the United States' national metrology institute known as the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]].

Examples of instruments and equipment used in forensic metrology include [[breathalyzer]]s, balances &amp; [[Weighing scale|scales]], [[ruler]]s, [[caliper]]s, [[Gas chromotographer]]s, and [[centrifuge]]s.

Recent attention has been given to forensic metrology and metrological traceability as a result of an international effort to accredit forensic laboratories and criminalistic laboratories to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] [[ISO 17025|17025]] requirements.

The '''freezing level''', or '''0&amp;nbsp;°C (zero-degree) [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]]''', represents the [[altitude]] in which the temperature is at 0&amp;nbsp;°C (the freezing point of [[water]]) in a free atmosphere (i.e. allowing reflection of the sun by snow, etc.). Any given measure is valid for only a short period of time, often less than a day.

Above the freezing altitude, the temperature of the air is below freezing. Below it, the temperature is above freezing. The profile of this frontier, and its variations, are studied in [[meteorology]], and are used for a variety of forecasts and predictions. Whilst not given on general [[weather forecasts]], it is used on bulletins giving forecasts for mountainous areas.

==Measuring==
[[File:Dual-polarization radar image of an easily identifiable freezing layer, denoted by the yellow ring around the radar.png|thumb|Dual-polarization radar image of an easily identifiable freezing layer, denoted by the yellow ring around the radar.]]
There are several different methods to examine the structure of the [[temperature]] of the [[atmosphere]]:
*A [[radiosonde]] attached to a [[weather balloon]] is the oldest and most common method used. Each area releases two balloons a day in locations hundreds of kilometres apart.
*Measuring devices attached to commercial [[airliners]] permit reporting the isotherm, and its height, to aerial traffic.
*[[Weather satellites]] are equipped with sensors which scan the atmosphere and measure the [[infrared radiation]] it emits.
*[[Weather radar]] detects [[Weather radar#Bright band|bright bands]], which are radar echoes produced just underneath the isotherm caused by the melting of snow in the layer above 0&amp;nbsp;°C.
*A [[wind profiler]], an upward pointing radar, can detect the speed of precipitation, which is different for rain, snow, and melting snow.

Depending on the [[frequency]] and [[Sensor resolution|resolution]] at which these readings are taken, these methods can report the isotherm with greater or lesser precision.  Radiosondes, for example, only report a reading twice daily and provide very rough information.  Weather radar can detect a variation every five to ten minutes if there is precipitation, and can scan a radius of up to two kilometres.

==Variations in the isotherm==

The isotherm can be very stable over a large area.  It varies under two conditions:
#A change in the density of air due to [[weather fronts]]. This changes the isotherm gradually, over tens of kilometres for a [[cold front]], and hundreds for a [[warm front]].
#Local levels can be changed by [[wind]], reflection of the [[sun]], [[snow]], and [[humidity]] level. These factors can cause the isotherm to change rapidly over several kilometres, in both winter and summer. Also, [[Subsidence#Atmosphere|atmospheric subsidence]] and ascendence can contribute to variations in the isotherm.
These conditions imply that the 0&amp;nbsp;°C isotherm varies globally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2834">'''Galactic Bridges and Tails''' is a computer animation film created in 1972 by astrophysicists [[Alar Toomre]] and [http://lcd-www.colorado.edu/jtoomre/ Juri Toomre]. The brothers created the film as a teaching aid to accompany their 1972 landmark research paper of the same name, published in ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]'', which described [[interacting galaxy|galaxy collisions]] and [[galaxy merger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Galactic Bridges and Tails |last1=Toomre |first1=Alar |last2=Toomre |first2=Juri |publisher=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |date=December 1972 |doi=10.1086/151823 |access-date=13 July 2016 |bibcode=1972ApJ...178..623T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology of the original animated film ==
The Toomre film contains both [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics]] simulations of colliding galaxies. The animations are [[time-lapse]]s that compress billions of years into just a few minutes. Written in the [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] programming language, the simulations sent character and vector information to a CRT-based [[ASCII]] character film recorder. The film recorder exposed multiple frames of [[16mm]] film to create the final animated film.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kinotonik.net/mindcine/toomre/ |title=Galactic Bridges and Tails (Film Restoration) |last=Lauter |first=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital film restoration ==
In 2007, filmmaker [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0491592/ Michael Lauter] worked with the Toomre brothers to digitally restore the 16mm original film and create a new [[High-definition video|HD video]] (1080p24) digital master.&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt;

== Derivative simulations ==
Massachusetts-based [[MathWorks]] created a [[Simulink]] model titled ''Spiral Galaxy Formation Simulation'' for use within their [[MATLAB]] programming environment. The company states that their computer animation model was inspired by the original ''Galactic Bridges and Tails'' paper and film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spiral Galaxy Formation Simulation Using Embedded MATLAB Functions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225035938/http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/demos.html?file=%2Fproducts%2Fdemos%2Fshipping%2Fsimulink%2Fsldemo_eml_galaxy_script.html |access-date=13 July 2016 |archive-date=25 February 2008 |url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/demos.html?file=/products/demos/shipping/simulink/sldemo_eml_galaxy_script.html |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gifted art''' (or '''free art''') is any form or piece of art that is given freely, whether to a city, a group of people, a community or an individual. It refers to any [[art]] that is distributed at no direct cost. It is a form of [[conceptual art]]. It comes from a belief that art should be available for all people to enjoy, whether rich or poor, university graduate or junior high dropout. Since Gifted Art is an expressive form of art - an idea, it encompasses virtually all forms of art: [[movie]]s, [[literature]], [[music record]]ings, [[sculpture]],&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DF103AF935A25751C1A96F948260&lt;/ref&gt; [[painting]],&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/7730285.stm&lt;/ref&gt; [[graffiti]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/france24Public/en/archives/news/culture/20070512-swoon-street-art-moma-urban-new-york-paris-l-j-beaubourg.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital art]], [[street performance]]s, [[performance art]], [[sticker art]], [[comic]]s, coffeehouse poetry and [[Internet art|Internet]]-distributed art etc.

== Short History ==
Gifted Art has a long history in the arts. Many artists have been known to give art freely to each other, in an effort to pass along ideas, etc. [[Picasso]] and many of his contemporaries were fond of this.
[[Duchamp]] was one of the first modern day artists to Gift to the public with his piece, ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', for an art show in 1917. He gave the piece under the name of "R. Mutt," presumably to hide his identity as the artist. He actually had to pay $7 to have the piece exhibited in the show, and never intended on making any money from it. He gave it freely for all to see and to push forward the [[Dada]] movement.
In the 50's, [[Ray Johnson]] started doing [[Mail art]]. He spread the idea to many other artists&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegalleriesatmoore.org/publications/johnsoncp.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and it still occurs today. In 2002, a 6&amp;nbsp;ft X 53&amp;nbsp;ft mural by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] was installed in the Times Square Subway Station in New York City. It was gifted by the artist to all New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/exhibitionInfo/exhibition/36702/lang/1&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, Gifted Art has primarily been embraced by graffiti and urban artists. Many graffiti artists consider the work they do to be art for the public. Banksy writes in his books that he believes art is more important and more enjoyable when it is out on the street where people can view it in their everyday lives than when it hangs in a museum.

In [[mathematics]], two quantities are in the '''golden ratio''' if their [[ratio]] is the same as the ratio of their [[summation|sum]] to the larger of the two quantities. The figure on the right illustrates the geometric relationship. The golden ratio is also called the '''golden mean''' or '''golden section''' (Latin: ''sectio aurea'').{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=3, 81}}&lt;ref name="Sadowski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dunlap"&gt;Richard A Dunlap, ''The Golden Ratio and Fibonacci Numbers'', World Scientific Publishing, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Other names include '''extreme and mean ratio''',&lt;ref name="Elements 6.3"&gt;Euclid, ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', [https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVI/defVI3.html Book 6, Definition 3].&lt;/ref&gt; '''medial section''', '''divine proportion''', '''divine section''' (Latin: ''sectio divina''), '''golden proportion''', '''golden cut''',&lt;ref&gt;Summerson John, ''Heavenly Mansions: And Other Essays on Architecture'' (New York: W.W.

The sole value of these ratios is that they are intellectually fruitful and suggest the rhythms of modular design."&lt;/ref&gt; and '''golden number'''.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Hambidge, ''Dynamic Symmetry: The Greek Vase'', New Haven CT: Yale University Press, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Lidwell, Kritina Holden, Jill Butler, ''Universal Principles of Design: A Cross-Disciplinary Reference'', Gloucester MA: Rockport Publishers, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pacioli"&gt;Pacioli, Luca.

[[Mathematician]]s since [[Euclid]] have studied the properties of the golden ratio, including its appearance in the dimensions of a [[regular pentagon]] and in a golden rectangle, which may be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same [[aspect ratio]]. The golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects as well as man-made systems such as [[financial market]]s, in some cases based on dubious fits to data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Steven|last=Strogatz|authorlink=Steven Strogatz|title=Me, Myself, and Math: Proportion Control|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 2012|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/proportion-control/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden ratio appears in some [[patterns in nature]], including the [[phyllotaxis|spiral arrangement of leaves]] and other plant parts.

Some twentieth-century [[artist]]s and [[architect]]s, including [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Salvador Dalí]], have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially in the form of the [[golden rectangle]], in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be [[aesthetics|aesthetically]] pleasing.

==History==
{{further|Fibonacci number#Origins}}

The golden ratio has a wide range of demonstrations throughout history. According to [[Mario Livio]]:
{{quote|Some of the greatest mathematical minds of all ages, from [[Pythagoras]] and [[Euclid]] in [[ancient Greece]], through the medieval Italian mathematician &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Fibonacci]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the Renaissance astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]], to present-day scientific figures such as Oxford physicist [[Roger Penrose]], have spent endless hours over this simple ratio and its properties. ... it is probably fair to say that the Golden Ratio has inspired thinkers of all disciplines like no other number in the history of mathematics.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=6}}}}

[[File:Pentagram-phi.svg|right|thumb|A pentagram colored to distinguish its line segments of different lengths. The four
lengths are in golden ratio to one another.]]
Ancient Greek mathematicians first studied what we now call the golden ratio because of its fundamentality to the [[geometry]] of regular [[Pentagram#Geometry|pentagram]]s and [[pentagon]]s.{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=7–8}} According to one story, 5th-century mathematician [[Hippasus]] discovered that the golden ratio was not a [[simple fraction]] (an [[irrational number]]), surprising [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]].{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=4–5}} Hippasus was also the first to write of the golden ratio-related{{efn|The surface area of a dodecahedron with edge lengths of one unit is &lt;math&gt;\frac{15\varphi}{\sqrt{3-\varphi}}&lt;/math&gt;, and its volume is &lt;math&gt;\frac{5\varphi^3}{6-2\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;. {{harv|Livio|2003|pp=70–1}}.}} [[dodecahedron]], though its discovery is attributed to Pythagoras ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;570 BC–c.&amp;nbsp;495&amp;nbsp;BC);{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=36}} [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] (c.&amp;nbsp;417–c.&amp;nbsp;369&amp;nbsp;BC) was the first to describe all [[Platonic solid|five possible regular solids]].{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=67}} In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;380&amp;nbsp;BC), [[Plato]] expressed the concept of {{nowrap|[[self-similarity]]}} in his [[Analogy of the Divided Line]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', Book 6, translated by [[Benjamin Jowett]], [http://www.filepedia.org/files/Plato%20-%20The%20Republic.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418215659/http://www.filepedia.org/files/Plato%20-%20The%20Republic.pdf|date=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid in his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;BC) provides several [[Theorem|propositions]] and their proofs employing the golden ratio,&lt;ref&gt;Euclid, ''[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/toc.html Elements]'', Book II, Proposition 11; Book IV, Propositions 10–11; Book VI, Proposition 30; Book XIII, Propositions 1–6, 8–11, 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the first known definition:&lt;ref name=Hemenway&gt;{{cite book|last=Hemenway|first=Priya|title=Divine Proportion: Phi In Art, Nature, and Science|year=2005|publisher=Sterling|location=New York|isbn=1-4027-3522-7|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=3}}

==Applications and observations==

===Aesthetics===
{{See also|History of aesthetics (pre-20th-century)|Mathematics and art}}

''De Divina Proportione'', a three-volume work by [[Luca Pacioli]], was published in 1509. Pacioli, a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]], was known mostly as a mathematician, but he was also trained and keenly interested in art. ''De Divina Proportione'' explored the mathematics of the golden ratio. Though it is often said that Pacioli advocated the golden ratio's application to yield pleasing, harmonious proportions, Livio points out that the interpretation has been traced to an error in 1799, and that Pacioli actually advocated the [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] system of rational proportions.{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=134-35}} Pacioli also saw Catholic religious significance in the ratio, which led to his work's title. ''De Divina Proportione'' contains illustrations of regular solids by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], Pacioli's longtime friend and collaborator; these are not directly linked to the golden ratio.

[[File:7234014 Parthenonas (cropped).jpg|thumb|x150px|right|Many of the proportions of the [[Parthenon]] are alleged to exhibit the golden ratio.]]

The [[Parthenon]]'s façade as well as elements of its façade are said by some to be circumscribed by golden rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., "Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis with a Philosophical Polemic", ''Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46 No. 2, 1998, pp 194–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with the golden ratio. For example, Midhat J. Gazalé says, "It was not until Euclid, however, that the golden ratio's mathematical properties were studied. In the ''Elements'' (308&amp;nbsp;BC) the Greek mathematician merely regarded that number as an interesting irrational number, in connection with the middle and extreme ratios. Its occurrence in regular pentagons and [[decagon]]s was duly observed, as well as in the [[dodecahedron]]".&lt;ref&gt;Midhat J. Gazalé , ''Gnomon'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{isbn|0-691-00514-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Keith Devlin]] says, "Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation. The one thing we know for sure is that Euclid, in his famous textbook ''Elements'', written around 300&amp;nbsp;BC, showed how to calculate its value."&lt;ref&gt;Keith J. Devlin ''The Math Instinct: Why You're A Mathematical Genius (Along With Lobsters, Birds, Cats, And Dogs)'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=eRD9gYk2r6oC&amp;pg=PA108 p.&amp;nbsp;108]. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 2005, {{isbn|1-56025-672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later sources like [[Vitruvius]] exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions. One researcher concluded that the golden ratio was totally absent from Greek architecture of the classical fifth century&amp;nbsp;BC, and almost absent during the following six centuries, based on measurements of 15 temples, 18 monumental tombs, 8 sarcophagi, and 58 grave stelae.&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Foutakis, "Did the Greeks Build According to the Golden Ratio?", ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal'', vol. 24, n° 1, February 2014, pp.&amp;nbsp;71–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent book, author Jason Elliot speculated that the golden ratio was used by the designers of the [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]] and the adjacent Lotfollah mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Jason Elliot | title = Mirrors of the Unseen: Journeys in Iran | year = 2006 | pages = 277, 284 | publisher = Macmillan | isbn = 978-0-312-30191-0 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gcs4IjUx3-4C&amp;pg=PA284}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 geometrical analysis of earlier research into the [[Mosque of Oqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] reveals a consistent application of the golden ratio throughout the design, according to Boussora and Mazouz.&lt;ref&gt;Boussora, Kenza and Mazouz, Said, ''The Use of the Golden Section in the Great Mosque of Kairouan'', Nexus Network Journal, vol. 6 no. 1 (Spring 2004), [http://www.emis.de/journals/NNJ/BouMaz.html]&lt;/ref&gt; They found ratios close to the golden ratio in the overall proportion of the plan and in the dimensioning of the prayer space, the court, and the [[minaret]]. The authors note, however, that the areas where ratios close to the golden ratio were found are not part of the original construction, and theorize that these elements were added in a reconstruction.

The Swiss [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]], famous for his contributions to the [[modernism|modern]] [[International Style (architecture)|international style]], centered his design philosophy on systems of harmony and proportion. Le Corbusier's faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden ratio and the Fibonacci series, which he described as "rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages and the learned."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p.&amp;nbsp;25, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;316, Taylor and Francis, {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Frings: The Golden Section in Architectural Theory, Nexus Network Journal vol. 4 no. 1 (Winter 2002), available online [http://belveduto.de/text-nnj.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|Leonardo da Vinci's ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'']]
Le Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[Proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of Vitruvius, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of [[architecture]]. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci number]]s, and the double unit. He took suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system. Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in [[Garches]] exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'', p.&amp;nbsp;35, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;320. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}: "Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Swiss architect, [[Mario Botta]], bases many of his designs on geometric figures. Several private houses he designed in Switzerland are composed of squares and circles, cubes and cylinders. In a house he designed in [[Origlio]], the golden ratio is the proportion between the central section and the side sections of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Simon.

[[Mario Livio]], for example, claims that they did not,{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=169}} and [[Marcel Duchamp]] said as much in an interview with art historian [[William A.

The golden ratio is also apparent in the organization of the sections in the music of [[Debussy]]'s ''[[Reflets dans l'eau]] (Reflections in Water)'', from ''Images'' (1st series, 1905), in which "the sequence of keys is marked out by the intervals 34, 21, 13 and 8, and the main climax sits at the phi position".&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Peter F.

[[Adolf Zeising]], whose main interests were mathematics and philosophy, found the golden ratio expressed in the [[phyllotaxis|arrangement of parts]] such as leaves and branches along the stems of plants and of [[Leaf#Veins|veins]] in leaves. He extended his research to the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branchings of their veins and nerves, to the proportions of chemical compounds and the geometry of [[crystal]]s, even to the use of proportion in artistic endeavors.

Marks, and [[Erica Flapan|Erica L. Flapan]], eds. 2010. "Number Theory: A Lively Introduction with Proofs, Applications, and Stories". John Wiley and Sons: 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptual studies===
Studies by psychologists, starting with [[Gustav Fechner]], have been devised to test the idea that the golden ratio plays a role in human perception of [[beauty]]. While Fechner found a preference for rectangle ratios centered on the golden ratio, later attempts to test such a hypothesis have been inconclusive.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=7}}&lt;ref name=livio/&gt;

===Disputed observations===
Examples of disputed observations of the golden ratio include the following:
*Historian [[John Man (author)|John Man]] states that the pages of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] were "based on the golden section shape".

*In investing, some practitioners of [[technical analysis]] use the golden ratio to indicate support of a price level, or resistance to price increases, of a stock or commodity; after significant price changes up or down, new support and resistance levels are supposedly found at or near prices related to the starting price via the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Osler writes that "38.2 percent and 61.8 percent retracements of recent rises or declines are common," in {{Cite journal|author=Osler, Carol|title=Support for Resistance: Technical Analysis and Intraday Exchange Rates|journal=Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review|year=2000|volume=6|issue=2|pages= 53–68| url=http://ftp.ny.frb.org/research/epr/00v06n2/0007osle.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the golden ratio in investing is also related to more complicated patterns described by [[Fibonacci numbers]] (e.g. [[Elliott wave principle]] and [[Fibonacci retracement]]).  However, other market analysts have published analyses suggesting that these percentages and patterns are not supported by the data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Batchelor]] and Richard Ramyar, "[https://www.webcitation.org/5reh6NujR?url=http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/media/stories/resources/Magic_Numbers_in_the_Dow.pdf Magic numbers in the Dow]," 25th International Symposium on Forecasting, 2005, p.  13, 31.

====Pyramids====
[[File:Mathematical Pyramid.svg|right|thumb|250px|A regular square pyramid is determined by its medial right triangle, whose edges are the pyramid's apothem (a), semi-base (b), and height (h); the face inclination angle is also marked. Mathematical proportions b:h:a of &lt;math&gt;1:\sqrt{\varphi}:\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3:4:5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1:4/\pi:1.61899&lt;/math&gt; are of particular interest in relation to Egyptian pyramids.]]
Both Egyptian pyramids and the regular [[square pyramid]]s that resemble them can be analyzed with respect to the golden ratio and other ratios.

=====Mathematical pyramids and triangles=====
A pyramid in which the apothem (slant height along the bisector of a face) is equal to {{φ}} times the semi-base (half the base width) is sometimes called a ''golden pyramid''. The isosceles triangle that is the face of such a pyramid can be constructed from the two halves of a diagonally split golden rectangle (of size semi-base by apothem), joining the medium-length edges to make the apothem. The height of this pyramid is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; times the semi-base (that is, the slope of the face is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;); the square of the height is equal to the area of a face, {{φ}} times the square of the semi-base.

The medial [[right triangle]] of this "golden" pyramid (see diagram), with sides &lt;math&gt;1:\sqrt{\varphi}:\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is interesting in its own right, demonstrating via the [[Pythagorean theorem]] the relationship &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi} = \sqrt{\varphi^2 - 1}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \sqrt{1 + \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;. This [[Kepler triangle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Best of Astraea: 17 Articles on Science, History and Philosophy | url = https://books.google.com/?id=LDTPvbXLxgQC&amp;pg=PA93 | publisher = Astrea Web Radio | isbn = 1-4259-7040-0 | year = 2006 | author1 = Radio, Astraea Web }}&lt;/ref&gt;
is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in [[geometric progression]],&lt;ref name=herz&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Shape of the Great Pyramid | author = Roger Herz-Fischler | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-88920-324-5 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=066T3YLuhA0C&amp;pg=PA81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; just as the 3–4–5 triangle is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in [[arithmetic progression]]. The angle with tangent &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the angle that the side of the pyramid makes with respect to the ground, 51.827... degrees (51° 49' 38").&lt;ref&gt;Midhat Gazale, ''Gnomon: From Pharaohs to Fractals'', Princeton Univ. Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

A nearly similar pyramid shape, but with rational proportions, is described in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (the source of a large part of modern knowledge of ancient [[Egyptian mathematics]]), based on the 3:4:5 triangle;&lt;ref name = "maor"/&gt; the face slope corresponding to the angle with tangent 4/3 is 53.13 degrees (53 degrees and 8 minutes).&lt;ref name=Herkommer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petrospec-technologies.com/Herkommer/pyramid/pyramid.htm |title=The Great Pyramid, The Great Discovery, and The Great Coincidence |accessdate=2007-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194148/http://www.petrospec-technologies.com/Herkommer/pyramid/pyramid.htm |archivedate=2014-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The slant height or apothem is 5/3 or 1.666... times the semi-base. The Rhind papyrus has another pyramid problem as well, again with rational slope (expressed as run over rise). Egyptian mathematics did not include the notion of irrational numbers,&lt;ref&gt;Lancelot Hogben, ''Mathematics for the Million'', London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1942, p.&amp;nbsp;63., as cited by Dick Teresi, ''Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science—from the Babylonians to the Maya'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; and the rational inverse slope (run/rise, multiplied by a factor of 7 to convert to their conventional units of palms per cubit) was used in the building of pyramids.&lt;ref name = "maor"/&gt;

Another mathematical pyramid with proportions almost identical to the "golden" one is the one with perimeter equal to 2{{pi}} times the height, or h:b = 4:{{pi}}. This triangle has a face angle of 51.854° (51°51'), very close to the 51.827° of the Kepler triangle. This pyramid relationship corresponds to the [[mathematical coincidences|coincidental relationship]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi} \approx 4/\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Egyptian pyramids very close in proportion to these mathematical pyramids are known.&lt;ref name=Herkommer/&gt;

=====Egyptian pyramids=====
In the mid-nineteenth century, Röber studied various Egyptian pyramids including Khafre, Menkaure and some of the Giza, Sakkara, and Abusir groups, and was interpreted as saying that half the base of the side of the pyramid is the middle mean of the side, forming what other authors identified as the Kepler triangle; many other mathematical theories of the shape of the pyramids have also been explored.&lt;ref name=herz/&gt;

One Egyptian pyramid is remarkably close to a "golden pyramid"—the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu). Its slope of 51° 52' is extremely close to the "golden" pyramid inclination of 51° 50' and the {{pi}}-based pyramid inclination of 51° 51'; other pyramids at Giza (Chephren, 52° 20', and Mycerinus, 50° 47')&lt;ref name="maor"&gt;[[Eli Maor]], ''Trigonometric Delights'', Princeton Univ. Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; are also quite close. Whether the relationship to the golden ratio in these pyramids is by design or by accident remains open to speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Adding fuel to controversy over the architectural authorship of the Great Pyramid, [[Eric Temple Bell]], mathematician and historian, claimed in 1950 that Egyptian mathematics would not have supported the ability to calculate the slant height of the pyramids, or the ratio to the height, except in the case of the 3:4:5 pyramid, since the 3:4:5 triangle was the only right triangle known to the Egyptians and they did not know the Pythagorean theorem, nor any way to reason about irrationals such as {{pi}} or {{φ}}.{{Disputed inline|Egyptian Pyramids|date=November 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bell |first=Eric Temple |title=The Development of Mathematics |location=New York |publisher=Dover |year=1940 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5KAnw3QMC8C&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Rice&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Michael, ''Egypt's Legacy: The Archetypes of Western Civilisation, 3000 to 30 B.C'' pp. 24 Routledge, 2003, {{isbn|0-415-26876-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that principal authorities on the history of [[Egyptian architecture]] have argued that the Egyptians were well acquainted with the golden ratio and that it is part of mathematics of the Pyramids, citing Giedon (1957).&lt;ref&gt;S. Giedon, 1957, The Beginnings of Architecture, The A.W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, 457, as cited in Rice, Michael, ''Egypt's Legacy: The Archetypes of Western Civilisation, 3000 to 30 B.C'' pp.24 Routledge, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of science have always debated whether the Egyptians had any such knowledge or not, contending rather that its appearance in an Egyptian building is the result of chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Markowsky | first = George | date = January 1992 | title = Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio | journal = College Mathematics Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.2307/2686193 | url = http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = | jstor = 2686193 | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | pages = 2–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, the [[Pyramidology|pyramidologist]] [[John Taylor (1781–1864)|John Taylor]] claimed that, in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], the golden ratio is represented by the ratio of the length of the face (the slope height), inclined at an angle [[θ]] to the ground, to half the length of the side of the square base, equivalent to the [[Cosecant|secant]] of the angle θ.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''The Great Pyramid: Why Was It Built and Who Built It?'', 1859&lt;/ref&gt; The above two lengths were about 186.4 and 115.2 meters respectively. The ratio of these lengths is the golden ratio, accurate to more digits than either of the original measurements. Similarly, [[Richard William Howard Vyse|Howard Vyse]], according to Matila Ghyka,&lt;ref&gt;Matila Ghyka ''The Geometry of Art and Life'', New York: Dover, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; reported the great pyramid height 148.2 m, and half-base 116.4 m, yielding 1.6189 for the ratio of slant height to half-base, again more accurate than the data variability.

==Mathematics==
Usually, the lowercase form of phi (φ or {{math|''φ''}}) is used to symbolize the golden ratio. Sometimes the uppercase form (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;) is used for the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the golden ratio, 1/{{math|''φ''}}.&lt;ref name="MathWorld GR Conjugate"/&gt;

Two quantities ''a'' and ''b'' are said to be in the ''golden ratio'' {{math|''φ''}} if

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{b} = \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

One method for finding the value of {{math|''φ''}} is to start with the left fraction. Through simplifying the fraction and substituting in b/a = 1/{{math|''φ''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{a}+\frac{b}{a} = 1 + \frac{b}{a} = 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi} = \varphi. &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by {{math|''φ''}} gives

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi + 1 = \varphi^2&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rearranged to

:&lt;math&gt;{\varphi}^2 - \varphi - 1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[quadratic formula]], two solutions are obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.61803\,39887\dots&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.6180\,339887\dots&lt;/math&gt;

Because {{math|''φ''}} is the ratio between positive quantities {{math|''φ''}} is necessarily positive:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.61803\,39887\dots&lt;/math&gt; .

===Irrationality ===
The golden ratio is an [[irrational number]]. Below are two short proofs of irrationality:

====Contradiction from an expression in lowest terms====
[[File:Whirling squares.svg|thumb|right|If &amp;phi; were [[Rational number|rational]], then it would be the ratio of sides of a rectangle with integer sides (the rectangle comprising the entire diagram). But it would also be a ratio of integer sides of the smaller rectangle (the rightmost portion of the diagram) obtained by deleting a square. The sequence of decreasing integer side lengths formed by deleting squares cannot be continued indefinitely because the integers have a lower bound, so &amp;phi; cannot be rational.]]

Recall that:

: the whole is the longer part plus the shorter part;
: the whole is to the longer part as the longer part is to the shorter part.

If we call the whole ''n'' and the longer part ''m'', then the second statement above becomes

: ''n'' is to ''m'' as ''m'' is to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'',

or, algebraically

: &lt;math&gt; \frac nm = \frac{m}{n-m}.\qquad (*) &lt;/math&gt;

To say that the golden ratio {{math|''φ''}} is rational means that {{math|''φ''}} is a fraction ''n''/''m'' where ''n'' and ''m'' are integers.  We may take ''n''/''m'' to be in [[lowest terms]] and ''n'' and ''m'' to be positive. But if ''n''/''m'' is in lowest terms, then the identity labeled (*) above says ''m''/(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'') is in still lower terms. That is a contradiction that follows from the assumption that {{math|''φ''}} is rational.

====By irrationality of {{radic|5}}====
Another short proof—perhaps more commonly known—of the irrationality of the golden ratio makes use of the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of rational numbers under addition and multiplication. If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is rational, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle2\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) - 1= \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt; is also rational, which is a contradiction if it is already known that the square root of a non-[[square number|square]] [[natural number]] is irrational.

===Minimal polynomial===
The golden ratio is also an [[algebraic number]] and even an [[algebraic integer]]. It has [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - x - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Having degree 2, this polynomial actually has two roots, the other being the golden ratio conjugate.

===Golden ratio conjugate===
The conjugate root to the minimal polynomial x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − x − 1 is

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{\varphi}=1-\varphi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.61803\,39887\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value of this quantity (≈ 0.618) corresponds to the length ratio taken in reverse order (shorter segment length over longer segment length, ''b/a''), and is sometimes referred to as the ''golden ratio conjugate''.&lt;ref name="MathWorld GR Conjugate"&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Golden Ratio Conjugate|urlname=GoldenRatioConjugate}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted here by the capital Phi ('''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;'''):

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = {1 \over \varphi} = \varphi^{-1} = 0.61803\,39887\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, '''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;''' can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \varphi -1 = 1.61803\,39887\ldots -1 = 0.61803\,39887\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

This illustrates the unique property of the golden ratio among positive numbers, that

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \varphi} = \varphi - 1,&lt;/math&gt;

or its inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \Phi} = \Phi + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This means 0.61803...:1 = 1:1.61803....

===Alternative forms===

The formula {{math|''φ''}} = 1 + 1/{{math|''φ''}} can be expanded recursively to obtain a [[continued fraction]] for the golden ratio:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Concrete Abstractions: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Scheme

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = [1; 1, 1, 1, \dots] = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \ddots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and its reciprocal:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1} = [0; 1, 1, 1, \dots] = 0 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \ddots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Convergent (continued fraction)|convergent]]s of these continued fractions (1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, 13/8, ..., or 1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, ...) are ratios of successive [[Fibonacci numbers]].

The equation {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 + {{math|''φ''}} likewise produces the [[Nested radical|continued square root]], or infinite surd, form:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \cdots}}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

An infinite series can be derived to express phi:&lt;ref&gt;Brian Roselle, [http://sites.google.com/site/goldenmeanseries/ "Golden Mean Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\frac{13}{8}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{(n+1)}(2n+1)!}{(n+2)!n!4^{(2n+3)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 1+2\sin(\pi/10) = 1 + 2\sin 18^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = {1 \over 2}\csc(\pi/10) = {1 \over 2}\csc 18^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 2\cos(\pi/5)=2\cos 36^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi = 2\sin(3\pi/10)=2\sin 54^\circ. &lt;/math&gt;

These correspond to the fact that the length of the diagonal of a regular pentagon is {{math|''φ''}} times the length of its side, and similar relations in a [[pentagram]].

There is no known general [[algorithm]] to arrange a given number of nodes evenly on a sphere, for any of several definitions of even distribution (see, for example, ''[[Thomson problem]]''). However, a useful approximation results from dividing the sphere into parallel bands of equal [[surface area]] and placing one node in each band at longitudes spaced by a golden section of the circle, i.e. 360°/{{math|''φ''}} ≅ 222.5°. This method was used to arrange the 1500 mirrors of the student-participatory [[artificial satellite|satellite]] [[STARSHINE|Starshine-3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast09oct_1/ |title=A Disco Ball in Space |publisher=NASA |date=2001-10-09 |accessdate=2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Golden triangle=====
The [[Golden triangle (mathematics)|golden triangle]] can be characterized as an [[isosceles triangle]] ABC with the property that [[bisection|bisecting]] the angle C produces a new [[triangle]] CXB which is a [[similar triangle]] to the original.

If angle BCX = α, then XCA = α because of the bisection, and CAB = α because of the similar triangles; ABC = 2α from the original isosceles symmetry, and BXC = 2α by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so 5α = 180, giving α = 36°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36°-72°-72°. The angles of the remaining obtuse isosceles triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36°-36°-108°.

Suppose XB has length 1, and we call BC length {{math|''φ''}}. Because of the isosceles triangles XC=XA and BC=XC, so these are also length&amp;nbsp;φ. Length AC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;AB, therefore equals {{math|''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. But triangle ABC is similar to triangle CXB, so AC/BC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;BC/BX, AC/{{math|''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;φ/1, and so AC also equals {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, confirming that {{math|''φ''}} is indeed the golden ratio.

Similarly, the ratio of the area of the larger triangle AXC to the smaller CXB is equal to {{math|''φ''}}, while the [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] ratio is&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

=====Pentagon=====
In a [[pentagon#Regular pentagons|regular pentagon]] the ratio of a diagonal to a side is the golden ratio, while intersecting diagonals section each other in the golden ratio.&lt;ref name = "Pacioli"/&gt;

=====Odom's construction=====
[[File:Odom.svg|thumb|218 px|Let A and B be midpoints of the sides EF and ED of an equilateral triangle DEF. Extend AB to meet the circumcircle of DEF at C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{|AB|}{|BC|}=\tfrac{|AC|}{|AB|}=\phi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[George Phillips Odom, Jr|George Odom]] has given a remarkably simple construction for {{φ}} involving an equilateral triangle: if an equilateral triangle is inscribed in a circle and the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides is produced to intersect the circle in either of two points, then these three points are in golden proportion. This result is a straightforward consequence of the [[intersecting chords theorem]] and can be used to construct a regular pentagon, a construction that attracted the attention of the noted Canadian geometer [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]] who published it in Odom's name as a diagram in the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' accompanied by the single word "Behold!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quandaries and Queries|url=http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/qq/database/QQ.09.02/mary1.html|publisher=Math Central|accessdate=23 October 2011|author=Chris and Penny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pentagram=====
The golden ratio plays an important role in the geometry of [[pentagram]]s. Each intersection of edges sections other edges in the golden ratio. Also, the ratio of the length of the shorter segment to the segment bounded by the two intersecting edges (a side of the pentagon in the pentagram's center) is {{φ}}, as the four-color illustration shows.

The pentagram includes ten [[isosceles triangle]]s: five [[acute triangle|acute]] and five [[obtuse triangle|obtuse]] isosceles triangles. In all of them, the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is {{φ}}. The acute triangles are golden triangles. The obtuse isosceles triangles are golden gnomons.

=====Ptolemy's theorem=====
[[File:Ptolemy Pentagon.svg|thumb|The golden ratio in a regular pentagon can be computed using [[Ptolemy's theorem]].]]

The golden ratio properties of a regular pentagon can be confirmed by applying [[Ptolemy's theorem]] to the quadrilateral formed by removing one of its vertices. If the quadrilateral's long edge and diagonals are ''b'', and short edges are ''a'', then Ptolemy's theorem gives ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ab'' which yields

:&lt;math&gt;{b \over a}={{1+\sqrt{5}}\over 2}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Scalenity of triangles====
Consider a [[triangle]] with sides of lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in decreasing order. Define the "scalenity" of the triangle to be the smaller of the two ratios ''a''/''b'' and ''b''/''c''. The scalenity is always less than {{φ}} and can be made as close as desired to {{φ}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;49–50, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Triangle whose sides form a geometric progression====
If the side lengths of a triangle form a [[geometric progression]] and are in the ratio 1 : ''r'' : ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''r'' is the common ratio, then ''r'' must lie in the range {{φ}}−1 &lt; ''r'' &lt; {{φ}}, which is a consequence of the [[triangle inequality]] (the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be strictly bigger than the length of the third side). If ''r'' = {{φ}} then the shorter two sides are 1 and {{φ}} but their sum is {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, thus ''r'' &lt; {{φ}}. A similar calculation shows that ''r'' &gt; {{φ}}−1. A triangle whose sides are in the ratio 1 : {{radic|{{φ}}}} : {{φ}} is a right triangle (because 1 + {{φ}} = {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) known as a [[Kepler triangle]].&lt;ref name=herz/&gt;

====Golden triangle, rhombus, and rhombic triacontahedron====
[[File:GoldenRhombus.svg|thumb|One of the rhombic triacontahedron's rhombi]]

[[File:Rhombictriacontahedron.svg|thumb|All of the faces of the rhombic triacontahedron are golden rhombi]]

A [[golden rhombus]] is a [[rhombus]] whose diagonals are in the golden ratio. The [[rhombic triacontahedron]] is a [[convex polytope]] that has a very special property: all of its faces are golden rhombi.  In the [[rhombic triacontahedron]] the [[dihedral angle]] between any two adjacent rhombi is 144°, which is twice the isosceles angle of a golden triangle and four times its most acute angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Catalan solids derived from three-dimensional-root systems and quaternions|first1=Mehmet|last1=Koca|first2=Nazife Ozdes|last2=Koca|first3=Ramazan|last3=Koç|journal=	Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=51|year=2010|page=043501|doi=10.1063/1.3356985|arxiv=0908.3272|bibcode=2010JMP....51d3501K}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to Fibonacci sequence===
The mathematics of the golden ratio and of the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]] are intimately interconnected. The Fibonacci sequence is:

:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, ...

A [[closed-form expression]] for the Fibonacci sequence involves the golden ratio:

:&lt;math&gt;F\left(n\right)
 = {{\varphi^n-(1-\varphi)^n} \over {\sqrt 5}}
 = {{\varphi^n-(-\varphi)^{-n}} \over {\sqrt 5}}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Golden Square fractal with T-branching 8.svg|thumb|Golden squares with [[T-square (fractal)|T-branching]]]]
[[File:Golden Square fractal 6.svg|thumb|Golden square fractal]]

The golden ratio is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the ratios of successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence (or any Fibonacci-like sequence), as originally shown by [[Kepler]]:&lt;ref name="tatt"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}=\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if a Fibonacci number is divided by its immediate predecessor in the sequence, the quotient approximates {{φ}}; e.g., 987/610&amp;nbsp;{{math|≈}}&amp;nbsp;1.6180327868852. These approximations are alternately lower and higher than {{φ}}, and converge to {{φ}} as the Fibonacci numbers increase, and:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|F_n\varphi-F_{n+1}|

= \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+a}}{F_n} = \varphi^a,&lt;/math&gt;

where above, the ratios of consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence, is a case when &lt;math&gt;a = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the successive powers of {{φ}} obey the Fibonacci [[recurrence relation|recurrence]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^{n+1} = \varphi^n + \varphi^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This identity allows any polynomial in {{φ}} to be reduced to a linear expression. For example:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
3\varphi^3 - 5\varphi^2 + 4 &amp; = 3(\varphi^2 + \varphi) - 5\varphi^2 + 4 \\
&amp; = 3[(\varphi + 1) + \varphi] - 5(\varphi + 1) + 4 \\
&amp; = \varphi + 2 \approx 3.618.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reduction to a linear expression can be accomplished in one step by using the relationship
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^k=F_k \varphi +F_{k-1},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''th Fibonacci number.

However, this is no special property of {{φ}}, because polynomials in any solution ''x'' to a [[quadratic equation]] can be reduced in an analogous manner, by applying:
:&lt;math&gt;x^2=ax+b&lt;/math&gt;
for given coefficients ''a'', ''b'' such that ''x'' satisfies the equation. Even more generally, any [[rational function]] (with rational coefficients) of the root of an irreducible ''n''th-degree polynomial over the rationals can be reduced to a polynomial of degree {{nowrap|''n'' ‒ 1.}}  Phrased in terms of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], if α is a root of an irreducible ''n''th-degree polynomial, then &lt;math&gt;\Q(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; has degree ''n'' over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;, with basis &lt;math&gt;\{1, \alpha, \dots, \alpha^{n-1}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetries===
The golden ratio and inverse golden ratio &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\pm = (1\pm \sqrt{5})/2&lt;/math&gt; have a set of symmetries that preserve and interrelate them. They are both preserved by the [[fractional linear transformation]]s &lt;math&gt;x, 1/(1-x), (x-1)/x,&lt;/math&gt; – this fact corresponds to the identity and the definition quadratic equation.
Further, they are interchanged by the three maps &lt;math&gt;1/x, 1-x, x/(x-1)&lt;/math&gt; – they are reciprocals, symmetric about &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;, and (projectively) symmetric about 2.

More deeply, these maps form a subgroup of the [[modular group]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}(2,\mathbf{Z})&lt;/math&gt; isomorphic to the [[symmetric group]] on 3 letters, &lt;math&gt;S_3,&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the [[stabilizer subgroup|stabilizer]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; of 3 standard points on the [[projective line]], and the symmetries correspond to the quotient map &lt;math&gt;S_3 \to S_2&lt;/math&gt; – the subgroup &lt;math&gt;C_3 &lt; S_3&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the 3-cycles and the identity &lt;math&gt;() (0 1 \infty) (0 \infty 1)&lt;/math&gt; fixes the two numbers, while the 2-cycles interchange these, thus realizing the map.

===Other properties===
The golden ratio has the simplest expression (and slowest convergence) as a continued fraction expansion of any irrational number (see ''Alternate forms'' above). It is, for that reason, one of the [[continued fraction#A property of the golden ratio φ|worst cases]] of [[Lagrange's approximation theorem]] and it is an extremal case of the [[Hurwitz's theorem (number theory)|Hurwitz inequality]] for [[Diophantine approximation]]s. This may be why angles close to the golden ratio often show up in [[phyllotaxis]] (the growth of plants).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat2.html Fibonacci Numbers and Nature – Part 2 : Why is the Golden section the "best" arrangement?], from [http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/ Dr. Ron Knott's] [http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/ Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Section], retrieved 2012-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining quadratic polynomial and the conjugate relationship lead to decimal values that have their fractional part in common with {{φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^2 = \varphi + 1 = 2.618\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \varphi} = \varphi - 1 = 0.618\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence of powers of {{φ}} contains these values 0.618..., 1.0, 1.618..., 2.618...; more generally,
any power of {{φ}} is equal to the sum of the two immediately preceding powers:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n = \varphi^{n-1} + \varphi^{n-2} = \varphi \cdot \operatorname{F}_n + \operatorname{F}_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a result, one can easily decompose any power of {{φ}} into a multiple of {{φ}} and a constant. The multiple and the constant are always adjacent Fibonacci numbers. This leads to another property of the positive powers of {{φ}}:

If &lt;math&gt; \lfloor n/2 - 1 \rfloor = m &lt;/math&gt;, then:

:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \varphi^n = \varphi^{n-1} + \varphi^{n-3} + \cdots + \varphi^{n-1-2m} + \varphi^{n-2-2m} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \varphi^n - \varphi^{n-1} = \varphi^{n-2} . &lt;/math&gt;

When the golden ratio is used as the base of a [[numeral system]] (see [[Golden ratio base]], sometimes dubbed ''phinary'' or {{φ}}''-nary''), every integer has a terminating representation, despite {{φ}} being irrational, but every fraction has a non-terminating representation.

The golden ratio is a [[Fundamental unit (number theory)|fundamental unit]] of the [[algebraic number field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; and is a [[Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=PisotNumber |title=Pisot Number}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n = {{L_n + F_n \sqrt{5}} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Lucas number]].

The golden ratio also appears in [[hyperbolic geometry]], as the maximum distance from a point on one side of an [[ideal triangle]] to the closer of the other two sides: this distance, the side length of the [[equilateral triangle]] formed by the points of tangency of a circle inscribed within the ideal triangle, is &lt;math&gt;4\log(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabri.net/abracadabri/GeoNonE/GeoHyper/KBModele/Biss3KB.html Horocycles exinscrits : une propriété hyperbolique remarquable], cabri.net, retrieved 2009-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decimal expansion===
The golden ratio's decimal expansion can be calculated directly from the expression
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = {1+\sqrt{5} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{radic|5}} ≈ 2.2360679774997896964 {{OEIS2C|id=A002163}}. The [[square root of 5]] can be calculated with the [[Babylonian method]], starting with an initial estimate such as ''x''{{φ}} = 2 and [[iterative method|iterating]]

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{(x_n + 5/x_n)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ..., until the difference between ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; becomes zero, to the desired number of digits.

The Babylonian algorithm for {{radic|5}} is equivalent to [[Newton's method]] for solving the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;5 = 0. In its more general form, Newton's method can be applied directly to any [[algebraic equation]], including the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 = 0 that defines the golden ratio. This gives an iteration that converges to the golden ratio itself,

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 1}{2x_n - 1},&lt;/math&gt;

for an appropriate initial estimate ''x''{{φ}} such as ''x''{{φ}} = 1. A slightly faster method is to rewrite the equation as ''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1/''x'' = 0, in which case the Newton iteration becomes

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 2x_n}{x_n^2 + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

These iterations all [[quadratic convergence|converge quadratically]]; that is, each step roughly doubles the number of correct digits. The golden ratio is therefore relatively easy to compute with [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary precision]]. The time needed to compute ''n'' digits of the golden ratio is proportional to the time needed to divide two ''n''-digit numbers. This is considerably faster than known algorithms for the [[transcendental number]]s '''[[pi|{{pi}}]]''' and [[e (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|'''e'''}}]].

An easily programmed alternative using only integer arithmetic is to calculate two large consecutive Fibonacci numbers and divide them. The ratio of Fibonacci numbers ''F'' &lt;sub&gt;25001&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F'' &lt;sub&gt;25000&lt;/sub&gt;, each over 5000 digits, yields over 10,000 significant digits of the golden ratio.

The decimal expansion of the golden ratio {{φ}}&lt;ref name="a001622"/&gt; has been calculated to an accuracy of two trillion ({{val|2|e=12}} = 2,000,000,000,000) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.numberworld.org/digits/GoldenRatio/ |title=Golden Ratio |first= Alexander J. |last=Yee |date=17 August 2015 |website=numberword.org}}  Independent computations done by Ron Watkins and Dustin Kirkland.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;|width=110|caption=[[Acciaccatura]] notation}}A '''grace note''' is a kind of [[music notation]] denoting several kinds of musical [[ornament (music)|ornaments]]. It is usually printed smaller to indicate that it is melodically and harmonically nonessential. When occurring by itself, a single grace note normally indicates the intention of an [[ornament (music)#Acciaccatura|acciaccatura]]. When they occur in groups, grace notes can be interpreted to indicate any of several different classes of ornamentation, depending on interpretation.

==Notation==
In notation, a grace [[Musical note|note]] is distinguished from a regular note by print size.  A grace note is indicated by printing a note much smaller than a regular note, sometimes with a slash through the note stem (if two or more grace notes, there might be a slash through the note stem of the first note but not the subsequent grace note). The presence or absence of a slash through a note stem is often interpreted to indicate the intention of an acciaccatura or an appoggiatura, respectively.

The works of some composers, especially [[Frédéric Chopin]], may contain long series of notes printed in the small type reserved for grace notes simply to show that the amount of time to be taken up by those notes as a whole unit is a subjective matter to be decided by the performer. Such a group of small printed notes may or may not have an accompanying principal note, and so may or may not be considered as grace notes in analysis.

==Function==
A grace note represents an [[ornament (music)|ornament]], and distinguishing whether a given singular grace note is to be played as an appoggiatura or acciaccatura in the [[performance practice]] of a given historical period (or in the practice of a given [[composer]]) is usually the subject of lively debate. This is because we must rely on literary, interpretative accounts of performance practice in those days before such time as [[audio recording]] was implemented, and even then, only a composer's personal or sanctioned recording could directly document usage.

As either an [[ornament (music)#Appoggiatura|appoggiatura]] or an [[ornament (music)#Acciaccatura|acciaccatura]], grace notes occur as notes of short duration before the sounding of the relatively longer-lasting note which immediately follows them. This longer note, to which any grace notes can be considered harmonically and melodically subservient (except in the cases of certain appoggiaturas, in which the ornament may be held for a longer duration than the note it ornaments), is called the ''principal'' in relation to the grace notes.

A Grace note or notes is always noted in terms of exactly half of its principal note, but may be double or more. Where they are multiple, their proper notation must always equal exactly half of the principal note. (i.e. If the principal note is a quarter-note the grace note must be notated as an eighth- note, two sixteenth notes, four thirty-second notes, or eight sixty-fourth notes, if we are to set aside the concept of unnatural subdivisions of the beat such as the triplet, etc.) Grace notes, unlike what are referred to as [[cue-note]]s, never affect the rhythmic subdivision, or musical "count" of the bar in which they are contained - and therefore, do not require other notes to be dropped from the bar to keep the time signature intact.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dummies.com/art-center/music/piano/playing-grace-notes-trills-and-glissandos-on-the-piano/ , et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in music==
In [[bagpipe]] music there is extensive use of grace notes. Indeed, because the [[chanter]] is not tongued but supplied by a continuous air source from the bag, grace notes are sometimes the only way to differentiate between notes. For example, inserting a grace note between two [[Quarter note|crotchet]]s (quarter notes) played at the same pitch is the only way to indicate them as opposed to them sounding like a single [[Half note|minim]] (half note). Various multiple grace note ornaments are formalised into distinct types, such as ''doublings'', ''throws'', and ''birls''. A single grace note is played on the beat as is the first grace note of a complex ornament such as a doubling. Some complex ornaments, such as ''taorluath'' can be played starting or ending on the beat. Grace notes are typically played as short as possible by lifting the fingers quickly and a short distance off the [[chanter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aVehSJE4P4 BagpipeLessons.com Secrets of Top Pipers: Gracenotes by Jori Chisholm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern editions of [[European classical music|Western classical]] works, editors often seek to eliminate the potential for different interpretations of ornamental symbology, of which grace notes are a prime example, by converting a composer's original ornamental notation into literal notation, the interpretation of which is far less subject to variation. Most modern composers, although by no means all of them, have followed this trend in the ''prima facie'' notation of their works.

In the context of [[Indian classical music]] ([[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] (North Indian), [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] (South Indian)) some specific forms of notes ([[Swara|swara-s]]) fulfill the technique of playing a note ([[swara]]). Such [[Ornament (music)|ornamentic]]  in Indian Classical Music is important for the proper rendition and essential to create the beauty of a [[raga]]. Some notes are linked with its preceding and succeeding note; these linked notes are called '''Kan-swars''' (= ''grace notes'').{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Kan-swars deal with so called ''touch notes''. ''sparsh'' means "touch" in [[Hindi]] ([[Devanagari]]). These ''grace notes'' ([[Ornament (music)#Acciaccatura|acciaccatura]]) are often referred to as '''sparsh-swars'''. ''Kan-swars'' or ''sparsh-swars'' can be executed vocally and on instruments in three ways: 
# using a swift short ''glide'' ([[meend]] or [[ghaseet]]),
# as a ''Sparsh'' (technique of playing a note on a plucked stringed instrument, the movement of notes is ascending) and
# as a ''Krintan'' (the opposite of a Sparsh, movement of notes is descending).
In a book on Sitar compositions, Kan has been defined as 'fast deflection which can be approached while descending or ascending'. The act of Kaṇ being repeated twice, thrice or four times in a single stroke of mizrāb is called Krintan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omenad.net/articles/omeswarlipi.htm Sitar Compositions in Ome Swarlipi.

'''Henry C. Groseclose''' was born on May 17, 1892.&lt;ref name="The HMDB"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prats|first=J.J|title=Henry C. Groseclose|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=44219|publisher=The Historical Marker Database|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Ceres, Virginia for most of his life.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; Mr. Groseclose completed his junior college degree from [[Washington and Lee University]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=agedteachers&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillson|first=John|title=The Role of Agricultural Education Teacher Educator Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow|url=http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol39/39-01-01.pdf|publisher=pubs.aged.tamu.edu|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, he also received his [[bachelor’s degree]], as well as his [[master’s degree]], in [[agricultural education]] from [[Virginia Tech]].&lt;ref name="agedteachers"/&gt; While Mr. Groseclose was an agriculture teacher at the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]], he, along with three other agriculture teachers, [[Walter Stephenson Newman|Walter Newman]], [[Edmund Magill]] and [[Harry Sanders]], decided to establish a club for the farm boys in the school. The organization was formed in 1925.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; Groseclose named the organization the [[Future Farmers of Virginia]], or FFV for short.&lt;ref name=VirginiaRole&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillson|first=John|title=The Role of Virginia in the Development of the FFA|url=http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol34/34-02-37.pdf|publisher=pubs.aged.tamu.edu|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


The original meaning for the abbreviation FFV stood for the [[First Families of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; The “first families” referred to the families of both [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; Referring to Washington and Jefferson, Groseclose once stated that, “The Future Farmers of America should follow the example of these great sons of early Virginia by using scientific knowledge, intelligence, and enthusiasm to the end that agriculture may again be known as the profession of the real aristocrat.”&lt;ref name=AgriculturalSocieties&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hillson |first1=John |title=Agricultural Societies as Antecedents of the FFA |url=http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jsaer/pdf/Vol51/51-00-102.pdf |publisher=pubs.aged.tamu.edu |accessdate=4 June 2013|author2=Bryant, Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groseclose wrote the by-laws, as well as the constitution that the FFV would be based on.&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; 


In 1926, he also wrote, and brought into play, the formal ceremony that would take place as an organizational pattern to structure each meeting.&lt;ref name="AgriculturalSocieties"/&gt; Two years later, in 1928, the FFV became a nationwide organization. This developed the organization that is known today as the Future Farmers of America, or The [[National FFA Organization]], or just FFA for short. The by-laws drawn up by Henry Groseclose became the foundation of the newly national organization.&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; Also, the formal ceremony that Groseclose developed was taken on by the FFA as a national ritual that is still used today.&lt;ref name="AgriculturalSocieties"/&gt; Groseclose was a seventh degree [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] member,&lt;ref name="AgriculturalSocieties"/&gt; and he was also involved with the [[Free mason|Masons]], so it was no surprise when he developed levels of memberships for the FFV, which transferred through to the FFA, that were similar to the three leveled membership structure that the Masons uses. These three levels included the Greenhand, the Virginia Farmer and the Virginia Planter.&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; 


While the official emblem of the National FFA Organization was being drawn, Groseclose’s original emblem, which he hand drew himself, was highly considered and ended up playing a part in the emblem that is still the emblem of the National FFA Organization today.&lt;ref name=VirginiaFFA&gt;{{cite web|last=Virginia Association of Agricultural Educators and FFA Alumni|title=Virginia's Role in the Development of the FFA|url=http://www.vaffa.org/History/VirginiaFFA.html|publisher=Virginia FFA|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The part of the emblem that was from Mr. Groseclose’s original drawing included a background setting of a half [[plow]]ed wheat field with an [[owl]] perched upon a spade of wheat in front of the field.&lt;ref name="VirginiaFFA"/&gt; 


Henry Groseclose served as the Executive Secretary of the National FFA Organization for two years between 1928 and 1930.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; During his office of Executive Secretary, he announced at the national convention of 1930 that he had written, and would be releasing, an official FFA manual, which outlined the organization, procedures and structures of the National FFA Organization.&lt;ref name="Historical Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoover|first1=Tracy|title=A Historical Review of Leadership Development in the FFA and 4-H|url=http://www.jae-online.org/attachments/article/167/Hoover_etal_48_3_100-110.pdf|publisher=jae-online|accessdate=4 June 2013|author2=Scholl, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Groseclose also served as the Treasurer of the National FFA Organization for 11 years, between 1930 and 1941.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; 


In September 1925, Henry Groseclose set his expectations for the members of the FFV, and the purpose of the establishment of the Future Farmers of Virginia was by saying, "In my opinion the farm boys of Virginia who are enrolled in vocational agriculture are equal to any other group of boys in the state. But somehow the boys themselves seem to have a feeling of inferiority. Especially is this true when the farm boy goes to the city and has to compete with his city cousin. This condition should not exist. I believe that a strong organization of our boys in agriculture would help them to overcome this handicap. Let's form an organization that will give them a greater opportunity for self-expression and for the development of leadership. In this way they will develop confidence in their own ability and pride in the fact that they are farm boys."&lt;ref name=HistoryofFFA&gt;{{cite web|last=Virginia Association of Agricultural Educators and FFA Alumni|title=History of the FFA|url=http://www.vaffa.org/History/History.html|publisher=Virginia FFA|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Henry C. Groseclose died on June 4, 1950.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; In 2002, the [[Department of Historic Resources]] established a marker in Mr. Groseclose’s honor. It is Marker number KC-5 and it is displayed in [[Bland County, Virginia|Bland County]] of [[Ceres, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt;

'''Heterothallic''' [[species]] have [[sex]]es that reside in different individuals. The term is applied particularly to distinguish heterothallic [[fungi]], which require two compatible partners to produce sexual spores, from [[homothallic]] ones, which are capable of [[sexual reproduction]] from a single organism.

In heterothallic fungi, two different individuals contribute nuclei to form a zygote.  Examples of heterothallism are included for ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]], [[Aspergillus fumigatus]], [[Aspergillus flavus]]'', ''[[Penicillium marneffei]]'' and ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''.  The heterothallic life cycle of ''N. crassa'' is given in some detail, since similar life cycles are present in other heterothallic fungi.

==Life cycle of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''==
[[File:YeastTetrad2.png|frame|''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' tetrad]]
The yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is heterothallic.  This means that each yeast cell is of a certain mating type and can only mate with a cell of the other mating type.  During vegetative growth that ordinarily occurs when nutrients are abundant, ''S. cerevisiae'' reproduces by mitosis as either haploid or diploid cells. However, when starved, diploid cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores.&lt;ref name="pmid3070323"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Herskowitz I |title=Life cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Microbiol. Rev. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=536–53 |date=December 1988  |pmid=3070323 |pmc=373162 |doi= |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3070323}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mating occurs when haploid cells of opposite mating type, MATa and MATα, come into contact.  Ruderfer et al.&lt;ref name=Ruderfer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruderfer DM, Pratt SC, Seidel HS, Kruglyak L |title=Population genomic analysis of outcrossing and recombination in yeast |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=38 |issue=9 |pages=1077–81 |date=September 2006  |pmid=16892060 |doi=10.1038/ng1859 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that such contacts are frequent between closely related yeast cells for two reasons. The first is that cells of opposite mating type are present together in the same [[ascus]], the sac that contains the [[Tetrad (genetics)|tetrad]] of cells directly produced by a single [[meiosis]], and these cells can mate with each other. The second reason is that haploid cells of one mating type, upon cell division, often produce cells of the opposite mating type with which they may mate.

Katz Ezov et al.&lt;ref name="pmid20002587"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katz Ezov T, Chang SL, Frenkel Z, Segrè AV, Bahalul M, Murray AW, Leu JY, Korol A, Kashi Y |title=Heterothallism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates from nature: effect of HO locus on the mode of reproduction |journal=Mol.

Ruderfer et al.&lt;ref name=Ruderfer /&gt; analyzed the ancestry of natural ''S. cerevisiae'' strains and concluded that outcrossing occurs only about once every 50,000 cell divisions. Thus, although ''S. cerevisiae'' is heterothallic, it appears that, in nature, mating is most often between closely related yeast cells.  The relative rarity in nature of meiotic events that result from outcrossing suggests that the possible long-term benefits of outcrossing (e.g. generation of [[genetic diversity]]) are unlikely to be sufficient for generally maintaining sex from one generation to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H and Bernstein C (2013).

==Life cycle of ''Aspergillus fumigatus''==
''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'', is a heterothallic fungus.&lt;ref name="pmid22108383"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sugui JA, Losada L, Wang W, Varga J, Ngamskulrungroj P, Abu-Asab M, Chang YC, O'Gorman CM, Wickes BL, Nierman WC, Dyer PS, Kwon-Chung KJ |title=Identification and characterization of an Aspergillus fumigatus "supermater" pair |journal=MBio |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages= e00234–11|year=2011 |pmid=22108383 |pmc=3225970 |doi=10.1128/mBio.00234-11 |url=http://mbio.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=22108383 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140227004425/http://mbio.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=22108383 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the most common ''Aspergillus'' species to cause disease in humans with an [[immunodeficiency]].  ''A. fumigatus'', is widespread in nature, and is typically found in soil and decaying organic matter, such as compost heaps, where it plays an essential role in [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] recycling. Colonies of the fungus produce from [[Conidium|conidiophores]] thousands of minute grey-green [[Conidium|conidia]] (2–3 μm) that readily become airborne. A. fumigatus possesses a fully functional sexual reproductive cycle that leads to the production of [[Ascocarp|cleistothecia]] and [[ascospores]].&lt;ref name="pmid19043401"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Gorman CM, Fuller H, Dyer PS |title=Discovery of a sexual cycle in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7228 |pages=471–4 |date=January 2009  |pmid=19043401 |doi=10.1038/nature07528 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature07528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''A. fumigatus'' occurs in areas with widely different climates and environments, it displays low genetic variation and lack of population genetic differentiation on a global scale.&lt;ref name="pmid16607012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rydholm C, Szakacs G, Lutzoni F |title=Low genetic variation and no detectable population structure in aspergillus fumigatus compared to closely related Neosartorya species |journal=Eukaryotic Cell |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=650–7 |date=April 2006  |pmid=16607012 |pmc=1459663 |doi=10.1128/EC.5.4.650-657.2006 |url=http://ec.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16607012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the capability for heterothallic sex is maintained even though little genetic diversity is produced.  As in the case of ''S. cereviae'', above, a short-term benefit of meiosis may be the key to the adaptive maintenance of sex in this species.

==Life cycle of ''Aspergillus flavus''==
''A. flavus'' is the major producer of [[carcinogenesis|carcinogenic]] [[aflatoxin]]s in crops worldwide.  It is also an opportunistic human and animal [[pathogen]], causing aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals.  In 2009, a sexual state of this heterothallic fungus was found to arise when strains of opposite mating type were cultured together under appropriate conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid19537215"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horn BW, Moore GG, Carbone I |title=Sexual reproduction in Aspergillus flavus |journal=Mycologia |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=423–9 |year=2009 |pmid=19537215 |doi= 10.3852/09-011|url=http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=19537215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexuality generates diversity in the aflatoxin gene cluster in ''A. flavus'',&lt;ref name="pmid24009506"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moore GG, Elliott JL, Singh R, Horn BW, Dorner JW, Stone EA, Chulze SN, Barros GG, Naik MK, Wright GC, Hell K, Carbone I |title=Sexuality generates diversity in the aflatoxin gene cluster: evidence on a global scale |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=e1003574 |year=2013 |pmid=24009506 |pmc=3757046 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003574 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003574}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that production of genetic variation may contribute to the maintenance of heterothallism in this species.

==Life cycle of ''Penicillium marneffei''==
Henk et al.&lt;ref name=Henk&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Henk DA, Shahar-Golan R, Devi KR, Boyce KJ, Zhan N, Fedorova ND, Nierman WC, Hsueh PR, Yuen KY, Sieu TP, Kinh NV, Wertheim H, Baker SG, Day JN, Vanittanakom N, Bignell EM, Andrianopoulos A, Fisher MC |title=Clonality despite sex: the evolution of host-associated sexual neighborhoods in the pathogenic fungus Penicillium marneffei |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=e1002851 |year=2012 |pmid=23055919 |pmc=3464222 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002851 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002851}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the genes required for meiosis are present in P. marneffei, and that mating and genetic recombination occur in this species.

Henk et al.&lt;ref name=Henk /&gt; concluded that ''P. marneffei'' is sexually reproducing, but recombination in natural populations is most likely to occur across spatially and genetically limited distances resulting in a highly clonal population structure.  Sex is maintained in this species even though very little [[genetic variability]] is produced.  [[Sex]] may be maintained in ''P. marneffei'' by a short-term benefit of meiosis, as in ''S. cerevisiae'' and ''A. fumigatus'', discussed above.

==Life cycle of ''Neurospora crassa''==
[[File:Neurospora crassa life cycle.jpg|thumb|600px|Neurospora crassa life cycle. The haploid mycelium reproduces asexually by two processes: (1) simple proliferation of existing mycelium, and (2) formation of conidia (macro- and micro-) which can be dispersed and then germinate to produce new mycelium.  In the sexual cycle, mating can only occur between individual strains of different mating type, A and a.  Fertilization occurs by the passage of nuclei of conidia or mycelium of one mating type into the protoperithecia of the opposite mating type through the trichogyne.  Fusion of the nuclei of opposite mating types occurs within the protoperithecium to form a zygote (2N) nucleus.]]
The sexual cycle of ''[[Neurospora crassa|N. crassa]]'' is heterothallic.  Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can only be formed when two mycelia of different mating type come together. Like other [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]], ''N. crassa'' has two mating types that, in this case, are symbolized by A and a. There is no evident morphological difference between the A and a mating type strains. Both can form abundant protoperithecia, the female reproductive structure (see Figure). Protoperithecia are formed most readily in the laboratory when growth occurs on solid (agar) synthetic medium with a relatively low source of nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Westergaard M, Mitchell HK (1947) Neurospora. V. A synthetic medium favoring sexual reproduction. Amer J Bot 34, 573-577.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nitrogen starvation appears to be necessary for expression of genes involved in sexual development.&lt;ref name="pmid1356883"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson MA, Metzenberg RL |title=Sexual development genes of Neurospora crassa |journal=Genetics |volume=132 |issue=1 |pages=149–62 |date=September 1992  |pmid=1356883 |pmc=1205113 |doi= |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1356883}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The protoperithecium consists of an ascogonium, a coiled multicellular hypha that is enclosed in a knot-like aggregation of hyphae. A branched system of slender hyphae, called the trichogyne, extends from the tip of the ascogonium projecting beyond the sheathing hyphae into the air. The sexual cycle is initiated (i.e. fertilization occurs) when a cell (usually a conidium) of opposite mating type contacts a part of the trichogyne (see Figure). Such contact can be followed by cell fusion leading to one or more nuclei from the fertilizing cell migrating down the trichogyne into the ascogonium. Since both A and a strains have the same sexual structures, neither strain can be regarded as exclusively male or female. However, as a recipient, the protoperithecium of both the A and a strains can be thought of as the female structure, and the fertilizing conidium can be thought of as the male participant.

The subsequent steps following fusion of A and a haploid cells, have been outlined by Fincham and Day&lt;ref&gt;Fincham J RS, Day PR (1963). Fungal Genetics. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK. ASIN: B000W851KO&lt;/ref&gt; and Wagner and Mitchell.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner RP, Mitchell HK. (1964). Genetics and Metabolism. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York ASIN: B00BXTC5BO&lt;/ref&gt;  After fusion of the cells, the further fusion of their nuclei is delayed. Instead, a nucleus from the fertilizing cell and a nucleus from the ascogonium become associated and begin to divide synchronously. The products of these nuclear divisions (still in pairs of unlike mating type, i.e. A/a) migrate into numerous ascogenous hyphae, which then begin to grow out of the ascogonium. Each of these ascogenous hypha bends to form a hook (or crozier) at its tip and the A and a pair of haploid nuclei within the crozier divide synchronously. Next, septa form to divide the crozier into three cells. The central cell in the curve of the hook contains one A and one a nucleus (see Figure). This binuclear cell initiates ascus formation and is called an “ascus-initial” cell. Next the two [[uninucleate]] cells on either side of the first ascus-forming cell fuse with each other to form a [[binucleated cells|binucleate cell]] that can grow to form a further crozier that can then form its own ascus-initial cell. This process can then be repeated multiple times.

After formation of the ascus-initial cell, the A and a nucleus fuse with each other to form a diploid nucleus (see Figure). This nucleus is the only diploid nucleus in the entire life cycle of ''N. crassa''. The diploid nucleus has 14 chromosomes formed from the two fused haploid nuclei that had 7 chromosomes each. Formation of the diploid nucleus is immediately followed by [[meiosis]].  The two sequential divisions of meiosis lead to four haploid nuclei, two of the A mating type and two of the a mating type. One further mitotic division leads to four A and four nuclei in each [[ascus]]. [[Meiosis]] is an essential part of the life cycle of all sexually reproducing organisms, and in its main features, meiosis in ''N. crassa'' seems typical of meiosis generally.

As the above events are occurring, the mycelial sheath that had enveloped the ascogonium develops as the wall of the perithecium, becomes impregnated with melanin, and blackens. The mature perithecium has a flask-shaped structure.

A mature perithecium may contain as many as 300 asci, each derived from identical fusion diploid nuclei. Ordinarily, in nature, when the perithecia mature the ascospores are ejected rather violently into the air. These ascospores are heat resistant and, in the lab, require heating at 60&amp;nbsp;°C for 30 minutes to induce germination. For normal strains, the entire sexual cycle takes 10 to 15 days. In a mature ascus containing eight ascospores, pairs of adjacent spores are identical in genetic constitution, since the last division is mitotic, and since the ascospores are contained in the ascus sac that holds them in a definite order determined by the direction of nuclear segregations during meiosis. Since the four primary products are also arranged in sequence, a first division segregation pattern of genetic markers can be distinguished from a second division segregation pattern.

'''Homeric scholarship''' is the study of any [[Homer]]ic topic, especially the two large surviving [[Epic poetry|epic]]s, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. It is currently part of the academic discipline of [[classical studies]]. The subject is one of the oldest in scholarship. For the purpose of the present article, Homeric scholarship is divided into three main phases: antiquity; the 18th and 19th centuries; and the 20th century and later.

==Ancient scholarship==

===Scholia===
[[File:Venice, Libreria Marciana.jpg|thumb|left|Library of St. Mark's, Venice, home of Venetus A.]]
[[Scholia]] are ancient commentaries, initially written in the margins of manuscripts, not necessarily at the bottom, as are their modern equivalents, the notes. The term [[marginalia]] includes them. Some are [[Interlinear gloss|interlinear]], written in very small characters. Over time the scholia were copied along with the work. When the copyist ran out of free text space, he listed them on separate pages or in separate works. Today’s equivalents are the chapter notes or the notes section at the end of the book. Notes are merely a continuation of the practice of creating or copying scholia in printed works, although the [[incunabula]], the first printed works, duplicated some scholia. The works of Homer have been heavily annotated from their written beginnings{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}. The total number of notes on manuscripts and printed editions of the Iliad and Odyssey are for practical purposes innumerable.

The number of manuscripts of the Iliad is currently (2014) approximately 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Limbaugh | title=Jesus on Trial: A Lawyer Affirms the Truth of the Gospel | location=New York | publisher=Regnery Publishing | year=2014 | page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papyri of the Odyssey are less in number but are still in the order of dozens{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}. The inventory is incomplete, and new finds continue to be made{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}, but not all these texts contain scholia. No [[compendium]] has collated all of the Homeric scholia.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Following the [[Principle of Economy]]: the allocation of scarce publication space to overwhelming numbers of scholia, the [[Anthology|compilers]] have had to make decisions about what is important enough to compile. Certain types, or lines, have been distinguished; scholia have lines of descent of their own. [[Eleanor Dickey]] summarizes the most important three, identified by letter as A, bT, and D.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickey|2007|pp=18–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A, "the Venetian scholia",  are most of the scholia of [[Venetus A]], a major manuscript of the Iliad, dated to the 10th century, and located in the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] (Library of St. Mark’s) of [[Venice]]. The sources of the scholia are noted at the end of each book. There are basically four. The hypothetical original text of the scholia, a manuscript of the 4th century CE, is therefore called, in German, the ''Viermännerkommentar'' (VMK), "four-man commentary", where the men are [[Aristonicus of Alexandria|Aristonicus]], [[Didymus Chalcenterus|Didymus]],  [[Aelius Herodianus|Herodian]], and [[Nicanor Stigmatias|Nicanor]]. Their comments, and these scholia, are termed [[Critical thinking|"critical"]]. A-scholia are found in other manuscripts as well. Venetus A contains some bT scholia.

bT scholia came from two sources: the 11th century T, the "Townleian" scholia, so designated because the manuscript, Townleyanus, was once in the collection of [[Charles Townley|Lord Townley]], and a lost manuscript, b, of the 6th century, which has descendants, including Venetus B. The bT manuscripts descend from an earlier c. bT scholia are termed [[Exegesis|exegetical]], as opposed to critical. They are from [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Heraclitus (commentator)|Heraclitus]], with some from Didymus.

The D scholia, or scholia Didymi, named erroneously for Didymus, are the earliest and largest group. They occur primarily in the 9th century Z (Rome, [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma|Biblioteca Nazionale]]), and the 11th century Q, but also in some others, such as A and T. The D scholia were once thought to be the work of the 1st century BCE scholar Didymus; they are now known to go back to 5th and 4th century BC school manuscripts, pre-dating the Alexandrine tradition, and representing “the oldest surviving stratum of Homeric scholarship.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickey|2007|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are also called the scholia minora and the scholia vulgata, the former name referring to the short length of many. These are glossaries. Among the non-minor scholia are mythological (allegorical) [[Etiology|aetia]], plots, and paraphrases, explaining the meanings of obscure words.

The order of precedence and chronological order of these Iliad scholia is D, A, bT, and other. Material in them probably ranges from the 5th century BCE (the D scholia) to as late as the 7th or 8th century CE (the latest bT scholia). The same scheme applies to the Odyssey, except that A scholia, mainly of the Iliad, are in deficit. There are no printed works publishing all the scholia on the Iliad and Odyssey. Only partial publications according to various principles have been possible.

The first was that of [[Janus Lascaris]] in 1517.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Joannes Andreas |  last=Lascaris | year=1517 | title=Scholia palaia ton pany dokimoneis ten Homerou Iliada  | language=Greek | location=Roma | publisher=in domo [[Angelo Colocci|Angeli Colotii]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqVCDGO4ljwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=Vale&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contained D-scholia of Porphyry. Some subsequent works concentrate on manuscripts or parts of them, others on type of scholia, and still others on books of the Iliad, or source. Larger compendia are relatively recent. One that has already become a standard is the 7-volume compendium of A- and bT-scholia by [[Hartmut Erbse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Hartmut | last=Erbse | authorlink=Hartmut Erbse | title=Scholia Graeca in Homeri Iliadem | series=Scholia Vetera | location=Berlin | publisher=de Gruyter | year=1969{{ndash}}1988 | language=Greek, Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volumes 1{{ndash}}5 are reserved for a number of books of the Iliad each, amounting to some 3000 pages, approximately. The last two volumes are indices. And yet, Dickey says of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickey|2007|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “The seven volumes of Erbse’s edition thus represent only a small fraction of all the preserved scholia …,” from which it can be seen that the opinions, elucidations and emendations to the Iliad and Odyssey in manuscript texts far outweigh those texts in numbers of pages.

===Classical scholarship===
By the [[Classical Greece|Classical Period]] the [[Homeric Question]] had advanced to the point of trying to determine what works were attributable to [[Homer]]. The [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]] were beyond question. They were considered to have been written by [[Homer]]. The D-scholia suggest that they were taught in the schools; however, the language was no longer self-evident. The extensive glossaries of the D-scholia were intended to bridge the gap between the spoken language and [[Homeric Greek]].

The poems themselves contradicted the general belief in the existence and authorship of Homer. There were many variants, which there should not have been according to the single-author conviction. The simplest answer was to decide which of the variants was most likely to represent a presumed authentic original composition and to discount the others as spurious, devised by someone else.

====Peisistratean edition====
[[File:Fragment of freize sic of the Parthenon in Acropolis museum.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the [[Parthenon Frieze]], depicting the [[Panathenaic Games|Panathenaic Festival]]. [[Elgin Marbles|Elgin marble]], located in the [[British Museum]].]]
[[Strabo]] reports an account by Hereas accusing [[Peisistratos]], tyrant of Athens, r. 561-527 BCE, or [[Solon]] (638-558 BCE), sometime eponymous archon and lawgiver, starting 594 BCE, of altering the Iliad’s [[Catalogue of Ships]] to place the 12 ships from [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in the Athenian camp, proving that Athens owned Salamis in the Trojan War.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo IX.394.10 concerning B558, mentioned in {{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others denied the theory, Strabo said. The story implies that Peisistratos or Solon had some authority over a presumed master text of the Iliad, and yet Athens at the time had little political power over the Aegean region. Strabo was not the only accuser. [[Plutarch]] also accuses him of moving a line from [[Hesiod]] to λ630 (Odyssey Book 11).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diogenes Laertius]] relates that in the time of Solon the Iliad was being “rhapsodized” (''rhapsodeisthai'') in public recitations. One of Solon’s laws mandates that, in such performances, one rhapsode was to pick up where the previous left off.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, Book I, Paragraph 57 (Life of Solon). D.L. gives the source as Dieuchidas. Mentioned in {{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The involvement of a state official in these rhapsodizations can be explained by their being performances at state-sponsored sacred festivals.

[[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;’’De Oratore’’ III.137&lt;/ref&gt; says that previously the books of Homer were “confused” (''confusos''), but that Peisistratos  “disposed” (''disposuisse'') them as they were then. A scholion on Iliad, Book K, in manuscript T, says that they were “arranged” (''tetachthai'') by Peisistratos into one poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently the impromptu composition of shorter poems on a known theme was forced into a continuous presentation by Solon, and edited by Peisistratos.

A number of other fragments testify to a written edition by Peisistratos, some credible, some not. A few mention the establishment of a Peisistratean school. In others, [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)]] published the edition and passed a law that it must be read at the [[Panathenaic Games]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p-505}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began in 566 BCE, before the tyranny of his father, from 561 BCE. Peisistratos was succeeded by his sons in 527 BCE.

====Ionicization of the text====
The linguist, [[August Fick]], hypothesized a “metamorphosis of the originally Achaean Iliad into its present Ionic form.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jevons|1886|p=295}} He refers to Fick, ‘’Homerische Ilias’’, Göttingen, 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; By Achaean he meant [[Aeolic Greek]], and by Ionic form, [[Ionic Greek]]. He based his theory on the partial substitution of Ionic words for Aeolic ones; i.e., where the Ionic forms fit the meter, which was [[Dactylic hexameter]], they replaced the Aeolic, but where they did not, the Aeolic was left intact. For example, Atreidēs, “sons of Atreus,” the [[nominative case]], is Ionic, but the [[Genitive case|genitive plural]] is Atreidaōn, an Aeolic form, instead of the Ionic Atreideōn, which does not fit the meter.

Fick uses the device to date the transformation.  Old Ionic lēos, “people,”  is used in post-Homeric lyric poetry, but the Iliad uses lāos,  an Aeolic form. Lēos was displaced by Ionic leōs after [[Hipponax]], c. 540 BCE. Lēos and lāos have the same meter, long and short (or two longs before a word beginning with a consonant), but leōs is short, long. In Fick’s view, lāos was left to prevent change to leōs. The opposition, therefore, dates to after 540 BCE, corresponding to the period of the Peisistratean edition. This coincidence suggests that the modern Iliad, which descends from a text the Alexandrian scholars called “the Vulgate,” is linked to the Peisistratean edition. Proving it, however, is another issue.

====Search for the classical vulgate====
Between the hypothetical Peisistratean edition and the Vulgate [[recension]] of the Alexandrines is a historical gap. Fick’s work indicates a connection, which also is suggested by the peripatetic associations of the Library of Alexandria (below). Moreover, some of the D-scholia redated to the 5th century BCE indicate that some sort of standard Iliad existed then, to be taught in the schools. These broad events are circumstantial evidence only. Nagy says,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|1997|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; “As of this writing, Homeric scholarship has not yet succeeded in achieving a definitive edition of either the Iliad or the Odyssey.”

He quotes the view given by [[Jean-Baptiste-Gaspard d'Ansse de Villoison|Villoison]], first publisher (1788) of the scholia on [[Venetus A]], that Peisistratus, in the absence of a written copy, had given a reward for verses of Homer, inviting spurious verses. There had been, in other words, a master copy, but  it had been lost. Not having a theory of oral transmission, Villoison regarded the poems as “extinct.” The problem then became to distinguish which of the purchased verses were spurious.

The opposite view, expressed by [[Friedrich August Wolf]] in ‘’Prolegomena ad Homerum’’, 1795, is that Homer never wrote the Iliad. The variant manuscripts seen by the Alexandrines were not corruptions, but rhapsodic variants, as is attested by [[Flavius Josephus]] in ''[[Against Apion]]''. He said that the poetry of Homer was “preserved by memory … and assembled … later from the songs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|1997|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link missing from the evidence, apart from the circumstantial, is the connection between the texts produced by Peisistratus and the Alexandrine Vulgate. What is lacking is either an “Athenian prototype,”,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|1997|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a conjectural “Wolfian vulgate,” or multi-text assembled from oral variants wrongly marked as spurious by the Alexandrines.

The Homeric classicists of the 19th century believed they had inferred a ''Voralexandrinsche Vulgata'', “Pre-Alexandrine Vulgate,” to use the expression of Arthur Ludwich. This was a hypothetical 4th- and 5th-century BCE version of the Alexandrine Vulgate. The latter had to have had precedents. The problem was to prove it.

Ludwich assembled a list of all the lines put forward as quotations from Homer in pre-Alexandrine authors: some 29 authors plus some unknown fragments, amounting to about 480 ''verse'', or “lines.”&lt;ref name=ludwich138-140&gt;{{cite book | title=Die Homervulgata als voralexandrinisch erwiesen | first=Arthur | last=Ludwich | location=Leipzig | publisher=B.G. Teubner | year=1898 | pages=138–140 | language=German | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAkLAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Homervulgata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZpyDVL_vMuK0sATp9YHIDA&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=209&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; D.B. Monro used this database to compare the percentage of non-Vulgate lines in the quotes with a control group, the  non-Vulgate lines in the fragments of the papyri known to him then.&lt;ref name=monro426-430&gt;{{cite book | title=Homer's Odyssey, Books 13-24 | first=David Binning | last=Monro | location=Oxford | publisher=Clarendon Press | year=1901 | pages=426–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging from the fragments, 60 of the 480 lines ought to be missing from the Vulgate. The number is only 12, from which Monro concludes: “The quotations, in short, prove that there was a pre-Alexandrian vulgate agreeing much more closely with the modern vulgate than with any text of which the papyrus fragments can be specimens.”

====Academic connection====
[[File:Athens Plato Academy Archaeological Site 5.jpg|thumb|left|Site of the Academy in Athens.]]
According to Monro,&lt;ref name=monro426-430/&gt; based on Ludwich,&lt;ref name=ludwich138-140/&gt; [[Plato]] is the most prolific quoter of Homer, with 209 lines. Next most is Aristotle, with 93 lines. Of the 209, only two differ from the Vulgate, in Iliad Book IV, which Ludwich termed ''Kontaminiert'', “corrupted.” Several were marked as spurious (Ludwich’s ''aufser'') by the Alexandrians. There was only one instance of four lines not in the Vulgate (Ludwich’s ''Zusatzversen''), From Iliad IV. Monro asserts “… whatever interpolated texts of Homer were then current, the copy from which Plato quoted was not one of them.” Aristotle’s quotations do not have the same purity, which is surprising. For about 20 years they were at the same school, the [[Platonic Academy]].

The Platonic view of Homer is exceptional for the times. Homer and Hesiod were considered to have written myths as allegory. According to J.A. Stewart, "… Homer is an [[Inspired Teacher]], and must not be banished from the curriculum. If we get beneath the literal meaning, we find him teaching the highest truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=J.A. | last=Stewart | authorlink=John Alexander Stewart (philosopher) | title=The Myths of Plato | year=1905 | location=London; New York | publisher=Macmillan | page=231 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4e89AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=Homer+Plato&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zKGFVILpJYmVNsrDg4AH&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Homer%20Plato&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', however, Plato denies that children can distinguish literal and allegorical truth and advocates censoring the myth-makers, including Homer. The ''Republic'' expresses a concept of a society established according to the Platonic ideal, in which every aspect is monitored and controlled under the guidance of a philosopher-king drafted from ascetic poverty for the purpose. It was not a popular view.

====Peripatetic connection====
[[File:Athens Lyceum Archaeological Site 2.jpg|thumb|left|Site of the Lyceum in Athens.]]
The archetype of Hellenistic libraries was that of the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] in classical Athens. Its founder, [[Aristotle]], had been a student, and then an associate, at [[Plato]]’s [[Platonic Academy|Academy]]. He was Plato’s star student, but as a [[metic]], or resident foreigner (he was still Greek), he could not own property or sponsor the other metics. Consequently, after the death of Plato, not having been appointed director, he departed Athens for an educational opportunity in [[Mysia]], which fell through when Mysia was captured by the Persians. He was subsequently hired by his boyhood companion, now [[Philip II of Macedon]], to tutor the latter’s teen-age son, the future [[Alexander the Great]], on whose behalf he built a school, the Nymphaeum, at [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]].

Alexander became an enthusiastic member of Aristotle’s inner circle. Immediate association was terminated within a few years when Alexander assumed the duties of monarch after the assassination of his father in 336/335. His main duty was to lead a planned invasion of the east to settle the rivalry with Persia. During it he kept by his bedside a manuscript of Homer personally emended by Aristotle, a gift of the latter. He later placed it in an expensive casket captured from the Persian king, Darius, from which it was called "the Casket Homer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=E. Cobham | last=Brewer | title=Dictionary of Phrase and Fable | year=1898 | website=Bartleby.com | url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/3118.html}}. The story comes from Plutarch’s ''Life of Alexander''.&lt;/ref&gt; The anecdote, if true, reveals a belief by Aristotle’s circle in an authentic text, as well as editorial activity to recapture it. Alexander was a Homer enthusiast.

Aristotle’s approach to Homer and statesmanship was different from Plato's. Politics and Poetry were two of his research topics. His theoretical treatise, ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' is not a presentation, like Plato’s, of an ideal state according to some philosophy, but is a presentation and classification of real states as they were then, discovered by research. Similarly, Homer does not play a role in any censorial evaluation of Aristotle as a critic, but appears in a professional study of poetry, the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Paragraphs 461a, b, Chapter 25.&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the difficulty with some of his language. Aristotle’s main study of Homer did not survive. It is listed in [[Diogenes Laertius]]' ''Life of Aristotle'' as "Six books of Homeric problems".

Of the 93 quotations, Mitchell Carroll says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mitchell | last=Carroll | title= Aristotle's Poetics, C. XXV: In the Light of the Homeric Scholia | year=1896 | publisher=John Murphy and Company | location=Baltimore | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Aristotle’s hearty veneration for Homer is shown by the numerous citations of the Iliad and the Odyssey in his works, and by the frequent expressions of admiration occurring in the ''Poetics''; ….” , Despite this enthusiasm, Monro notes that the “poetical quotations are especially incorrect,”&lt;ref name=monro426-430/&gt; with regard to the errors and additional lines. This is not the expected result if Aristotle had received the pure edition from which Plato had quoted. Monro’s solution is to adopt the view of Adolph Römer, that the errors can be attributed to Aristotle personally, and not to variant manuscripts. This was obviously not history’s final verdict.

===Hellenistic scholars and their aims===
Many ancient Greek writers discussed topics and problems in the Homeric epics, but the development of scholarship ''per se'' revolved around three goals:

# Analyzing internal inconsistencies within the epics;
# Producing editions of the epics' authentic text, free of interpolations and errors;
# Interpretation: both explaining archaic words, and exegetical interpretation of the epics as literature.

The first philosopher to focus intensively on the intellectual problems surrounding the Homeric epics was [[Zoilus]] of Amphipolis in the early 4th century BCE. His work ''Homeric Questions'' does not survive, but it seems that Zoilus enumerated and discussed inconsistencies of plot in Homer. Examples of this are numerous: for example, in ''Iliad'' 5.576-9 [[Menelaus]] kills a minor character, Pylaemenes, in combat; but later, at 13.758-9, he is still alive to witness the death of his son Harpalion. These have been humorously described as points where Homer "nodded off," from which comes the [[proverbial phrase]] "[[Continuity (fiction)#Homeric Nod|Homeric Nod]]." [[Aristotle]]'s ''Homeric Problems'', which does not survive, was probably a response to Zoilus.

Critical editions of Homer discuss three special steps in this process. First is the hypothetical "Peisistratean recension". There is a long-standing, but somewhat old-fashioned, tradition in modern scholarship which holds that in the mid-6th century BCE the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[tyrant]] [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]] had the Homeric epics compiled in a definitive edition. It is known that under Peisistratus, and later, [[rhapsode]]s competed in performing Homer at the [[Panathenaia|Panathenaic festival]]; and a scholion on ''Iliad'' 10.1 accuses Peisistratus of inserting book 10 into the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;Schol. T on ''Il''. 10.1: "They say that this episode was composed by Homer privately, and not to be part of the ''Iliad''; but that it was inserted into the poem by Peisistratus." Book 10, often known as the ''Doloneia'', is still the most widely rejected part of the Homeric epics.&lt;/ref&gt; But there is little evidence for a Peisistratean recension, and most present-day scholars doubt its existence; at the very least it is disputed what is to be understood by the term "recension".&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. G. Nagy (1996), ''Poetry as Performance'' (Cambridge), pp. 115-27 on the meaning of the Greek words for "edition", {{lang|grc|ἔκδοσις}} and διόρθωσις.&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third key moments are the critical editions made by the 3rd and 2nd century BCE [[Alexandria]]n scholars [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace|Aristarchus]] respectively; both of these scholars also published numerous other works on Homer and other poets, none of which survive. Zenodotus' edition may well have been the first to divide the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' into 24 books.

Aristarchus' edition is probably the single most important moment in the whole history of Homeric scholarship. His text was more conservative than Zenodotus', but it became the standard edition of Homer for the ancient world, and almost everything in modern editions of Homer passed through Aristarchus' hands. Like Zenodotus, Aristarchus did not delete passages that he rejected, but (fortunately for us) preserved them with an annotation indicating his rejection. He developed Zenodotus' already sophisticated system of critical symbols to indicate specific kinds of issues with particular lines, and a significant proportion of the terminology is still in use today ([[obelus]], [[wikt:athetize|athetising]], etc.). From the scholia a great deal is known about his guiding principles, and those of other editors and commentators such as Zenodotus and [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]]. The chief preoccupations of the Alexandrian scholars may be summarised as follows:

# Consistency of content: the reasoning is that internal inconsistencies imply that the text has been ineptly changed. This principle apparently pursues the work of Zoilus.
# Consistency of style: anything that appears only once in Homer &amp;mdash; an unusual poetic image, an unusual word (a ''[[hapax legomenon]]''), or an unusual epithet (e.g. the epithet "Kyllenian Hermes" in ''Odyssey'' 24.1) &amp;mdash; tends to be rejected.
# No repetitions: if a line or passage is repeated word-for-word, one of the exemplars is often rejected. Zenodotus is known to have applied this principle rigidly, Aristarchus less so; it is in tension with the principle of "consistency of style" above.
# Quality: Homer was regarded as the greatest of poets, so anything perceived to be poor poetry was rejected.
# Logic: something that makes no sense (such as [[Achilleus]] nodding at his comrades as he goes running after Hektor) was not regarded as the product of the original artist.
# Morality: [[Plato]]'s insistence that a poet should be moral was taken to heart by Alexandrian scholars, and scholia accuse many passages and phrases of being "unsuitable" ({{lang|grc|οὐ πρέπον}} ''ou prepon''); the real Homer, goes the reasoning, being a paragon of perfection, would never have written anything immoral himself.
# Explaining Homer from Homer ({{lang|grc|Ὅμηρον ἐξ Ὁμήρου σαφηνίζειν}}): this motto is Aristarchus', and means simply that it is better to solve a problem in Homer using evidence from within Homer, rather than external evidence.

To a modern eye it is evident that these principles should be applied at most on an ''ad hoc'' basis. When they are applied across the board the results are frequently bizarre, especially as no account whatsoever is taken of [[poetic licence]]. However, it should be remembered that the reasoning seems persuasive when built up gradually, and then it is a very difficult mindset to escape: 19th century Analyst scholars (see below) adopted most of these criteria, and applied them even more stringently than the Alexandrians did.

It is also sometimes difficult to know what exactly the Alexandrians meant when they rejected a passage. The scholia on ''Odyssey'' 23.296 tell us that Aristarchus and Aristophanes regarded that line as the end of the epic (even though that is grammatically impossible); but we are also told that Aristarchus separately rejected several passages after that point.

===Allegorical readings===
Exegesis is also represented in the scholia. When the scholiasts turn to interpretation they tend to be most interested in explaining background material, e.g., reporting an obscure myth to which Homer alludes; but there was also a fashion for allegory, especially among the [[Stoics]]. The most notable passage is a scholion on ''Iliad'' 20.67, which gives an extended allegorical interpretation of the battle of the gods, explaining each god as symbolic of various elements and principles in conflict with one another, e.g., [[Apollo]] is opposed to [[Poseidon]] because fire is opposed to water.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Allegory is also represented in some surviving ancient monographs: the ''Homeric Allegories'' by an otherwise unknown 1st century BCE writer [[Heraclitus (commentator)|Heraclitus]], the 2nd century CE [[Plutarch]]'s ''On the Life and Poetry of Homer'', and the works of the 3rd century CE [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], particularly his ''On the Cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey'' and ''Homeric Questions''. Many extracts from Porphyry are preserved in the scholia, especially the D scholia (although the current standard edition, that of [[Hartmut Erbse|Erbse]], omits them).

Allegorical interpretation continued to be influential on [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] scholars such as [[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]] and [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]]. But allegorising non-allegorical literature has not been a fashionable activity since the [[Middle Ages]]; it is common to see modern scholars refer to such allegorising in the scholia as "inferior" or even "contemptible".&lt;ref&gt;E.g. W. McLeod 1971, review of Erbse, ''Scholia Graeca in Homeri Iliadem'' vol. 1, in ''Phoenix'' 25.4: 373.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, these texts are now rarely read.

==18th and 19th centuries==
{{main article|Homeric question}}

The 18th century saw major developments in Homeric scholarship, and also saw the opening phase of the discussion which was to dominate the 19th century (and, for some scholars, the 20th): the so-called "[[Homeric question]]". Homer was first seen as the product of his primitive time by the Scottish scholar [[Thomas Blackwell (scholar)|Thomas Blackwell]], in ''An Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer'' (1735).

Another major development was the enormous growth of linguistic study on Homer and the [[Homeric dialect]]. In 1732, [[Richard Bentley|Bentley]] published his discovery of the traces left in the text of Homer by the [[digamma]], an archaic Greek consonant that was omitted in later, classical, Greek [[orthography]]. Bentley showed conclusively that the vast majority of metrical anomalies in Homeric verse could be attributed to the presence of digamma (though the idea was not well received at the time: [[Alexander Pope]], for one, satirised Bentley). Important linguistic studies continued throughout the next two centuries alongside the endless arguments over the Homeric question, and the work by figures such as [[Philipp Karl Buttmann|Buttmann]] and [[David Binning Monro|Monro]] is still worth reading today; and it was the linguistic work of [[Milman Parry|Parry]] that set in motion a major paradigm shift in the mid-20th century. Another major 18th century development was [[Jean-Baptiste-Gaspard d'Ansse de Villoison|Villoison]]'s 1788 publication of the A and B scholia on the ''Iliad''.

The Homeric question is essentially the question of the identity of the poet(s) of the Homeric epics, and the nature of the relationship between "Homer" and the epics. In the 19th century it came to be the fulcrum between two opposed schools of thought, the ''Analysts'' and the ''Unitarians''. The issue came about in the context of 18th-century interest in popular lays and folktale, and the growing recognition that the Homeric epics must have been transmitted orally before being written down, possibly much later than "Homer" himself. The Italian philosopher [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]] argued that the epics were the products not of an individual genius poet but rather the cultural products of an entire people; and [[Robert Wood (engraver)|Wood]]’s 1769 ''Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer'' argued emphatically that Homer had been illiterate and the epics had been transmitted orally. (Less fortunately, Wood drew parallels between Homer and the poetry of the supposed [[Scotland|Scottish]] oral poet [[Ossian]], published by [[James Macpherson]] in 1765; Ossian turned out later to have been wholly invented by Macpherson.)

The scholar [[Friedrich August Wolf]] brought matters to a head. His review of Villoison's edition of the scholia acknowledged that they proved conclusively the oral transmission of the poems. In 1795, he published his ''[[Prolegomena ad Homerum]],'' in which he argued that the poems were composed in the mid-10th century BCE; that they were transmitted orally; that they changed considerably after that time in the hands of bards performing them orally and editors adapting written versions to contemporary tastes; and that the poems' apparent artistic unity came about after their transcription. Wolf posed the perplexing question of what it would mean to restore the poems to their original, pristine, form.

In the wake of Wolf, two schools of thought coalesced to oppose one another: Analysts and Unitarians.

===Analysts===
19th-century Analysts argued that the epics were composed by many hands, a hodge-podge of interpolations and incompetent editing that concealed the original genius of Homer, or at the very least that the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' were composed by different poets. In this they followed in the steps of ancient scholars like Zoilos and the so-called "separatists" (χωρίζοντες ''chōrizontes'', the best known of whom, Xenon and Hellanicus, are nonetheless very obscure figures).

Among Analysts, [[Gottfried Hermann|Hermann]]'s 1832 ''De interpolationibus Homeri'' ("On interpolations in Homer") and 1840 ''De iteratis apud Homerum'' ("On repetitions in Homer") argued that the epics, as they now stood, were encrustations of second-rate later material around a pristine kernel: a hypothetical "Ur-''Iliad''". Conversely, [[Karl Lachmann|Lachmann]]'s 1847 ''Betrachtungen über Homers Ilias'' ("Studies on Homer's Iliad") argued that the ''Iliad'' was a compilation of 18 independent folk-lays, rather as the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'' actually was, compiled in the 1820s and 1830s by [[Elias Lönnrot|Lönnrot]]: so, he argued, ''Iliad'' book 1 consists of a lay on Achilleus' anger (lines 1-347), and two continuations, the return of Chryseis (430–492) and the scenes in Olympus (348-429, 493-611); book 2 is a separate lay, but containing several interpolations such as Odysseus' speech (278–332); and so on. (Lachmann also tried to apply Analyst principles to the mediaeval German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''.) [[Johann Wilhelm Adolf Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]]'s 1859 edition of the ''Odyssey'' argued that the Ur-''Odyssey'' had comprised just books 1, 5-9, and parts of 10-12, that a later phase had added most of books 13-23, and a third phase had added the bits about Telemachos, and book 24.

The climax of Analysis came with [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|Wilamowitz]], who published ''Homerische Untersuchungen'' ("Homeric studies") in 1884 and ''Die Heimkehr des Odysseus'' ("The homecoming of Odysseus") in 1927. The ''Odyssey'', he argued, was compiled about 650 BCE or later from three separate poems by a ''Bearbeiter'' (editor). Subsequent Analysts often referred to the hypothesised ''Bearbeiter'' as the "B-poet" (and the original genius, Homer himself, was sometimes the "A-poet"). Wilamowitz' examination of the relationship between these three layers of the ''Odyssey'', further complicated by later, minor, interpolations, is enormously detailed and complex. One of the three poems, the "old ''Odyssey''" (most of books 5-14 and 17-19) had in turn been compiled by a ''Redaktor'' from three even earlier poems, two of which had originally been parts of longer poems. Like most other scholars caught up in the opposition between Analysis and Unitarianism, Wilamowitz equated poetry that he thought poor with late interpolations. But Wilamowitz set such a high standard in the sophistication of his analysis that 20th century Analysts seem to have found difficulty in moving forward from where Wilamowitz left off; and over the course of the following decades attention drifted away, particularly in the English-speaking world.

===Unitarians===
[[Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch|Nitzsch]] was the earliest scholar to oppose Wolf and argue that the two Homeric epics showed an artistic unity and intention that was the work of a single mind. Nitzsch's writings cover the years 1828 to 1862. In his ''Meletemata'' (1830) he took up the question of written versus unwritten literature, on which Wolf's whole argument had turned; and in his 1852 ''Die Sagenpoesie der Griechen'' ("The oral poetry of the Greeks") he investigated the structure of the Homeric poems and their relation to other, non-extant, epics which narrated the story of the [[Trojan War]], the so-called ''[[Epic Cycle]].''

However, most Unitarian scholarship tended to be driven by literary interpretation and was therefore often more ephemeral. Even so, many scholars who examined the archaeology and social history of Homeric Greece did so from a Unitarian perspective, perhaps out of a wish to avoid the complexities of Analysis and Analysts' tendency to re-write each other's work indefinitely. [[Benedictus Niese|Niese]]'s 1873 ''Der homerische Schiffskatalog als historische Quelle betrachtet'' ("The Homeric catalogue of ships studied as a historical source") stands out. [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]], who began excavating [[Hisarlik]] in the 1870s, treated Homer as a historical source from an essentially Unitarian viewpoint.

===Common ground between Analysts and Unitarians===
Broadly speaking, Analysts tended to study the epics philologically, bringing to bear criteria, linguistic and otherwise, that were little different from those of the ancient Alexandrians. Unitarians tended to be literary critics who were more interested in appreciating the artistry of the poems than in analysing them.

But artistic merit was the unspoken motivation behind both schools of thought. Homer must at all costs be hallowed as the great, original, genius; everything good in the epics is to be attributed to him. So Analysts hunted for errors (as Zoilus had done), and blamed them on incompetent editors; Unitarians tried to explain errors away, sometimes even claiming they were really the best bits.

In both cases, therefore, there came to be a very strong tendency to equate good with authentic, and shoddy with interpolated. This, too, was a mindset inherited from the Alexandrians.

==20th century==
20th century Homeric scholarship had the shadow of Analysis and Unitarianism hanging over it, and much important work was done by old-style Analysts and Unitarians even up to the end of the century. Perhaps the most important Unitarian in the first half of the century was [[Samuel E. Bassett]]; and, as in the 19th century, some interpretive work argued for Unitarianism (e.g. [[George E. Dimock]]'s 1989 ''The Unity of the Odyssey''), while other literary criticism merely took a Unitarian perspective for granted. Some of the most important work on textual criticism and [[papyrology]] was done by Analyst scholars such as [[Reinhold Merkelbach]] and [[Denys L. Page]] (whose 1955 ''The Homeric Odyssey'' is a merciless but sometimes hilariously witty polemic against Unitarians). The biggest commentary on the ''Odyssey'', published in the 1980s under the general editorship of [[Alfred Heubeck]], is largely Analyst in tone, especially the commentary on books 21-22 by [[Manuel Fernández-Galiano]]. Some monographs from a strongly Analyst perspective continue to come out, primarily from the German-speaking world.

However, the most important new work on Homer done in the 20th century was dominated by two new schools of thought, most frequently referred to as "Oral Theory" (the term is resisted by some Oralists, especially [[Gregory Nagy]]); and "Neoanalysis". Unlike in the 19th century, however, these schools of thought are not opposed to one another; and in the last few decades they have been drawing on each other more and more in very constructive ways.

===Oral Theory===
Oral Theory, or Oralism, is a loosely used term for the study of the mechanisms of how the Homeric epics were orally transmitted, in terms of linguistics, cultural conditions, and literary genre. It therefore embraces philological analysis and literary criticism simultaneously. It has its origins in linguistics, but it was foreshadowed in some respects by [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]] in the 18th century, and more immediately by [[Gilbert Murray]]. Murray was an Analyst, but his 1907 book ''The Rise of the Greek Epic'' contained some of the core ideas of Oralism: particularly the idea that the epics were the end result of a protracted process of evolution, and the idea that an individual poet named Homer had relatively little importance in their history.

The two figures at the head of Oralism are [[Milman Parry]] and his student [[Albert Lord]], who continued his work after Parry's premature death. Parry was a [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] linguist (he studied under [[Antoine Meillet]], who in turn studied under [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]) who set out to compare Homeric epic with a living oral tradition of epic poetry. In the 1930s and 1950s he and Lord recorded thousands of hours of oral performance of epic poetry in the former [[Yugoslavia]], primarily in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. Lord's later work (his 1960 book ''The Singer of Tales'' is the most pertinent to Homer) kick-started oral poetics as an entire new sub-discipline in anthropology. For Homeric scholarship the most important results of their work, and that of later Oralists, have been to demonstrate that:

# Homeric epic shares many stylistic characteristics with known oral traditions;
# thanks to the sophistication and mnemonic power of the [[Oral-Formulaic Composition|formulaic system in Homeric poetry]], it is entirely possible for epics as large as the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' to have been created in an oral tradition;&lt;ref&gt;Parry aimed to prove this by asking [[Avdo Međedović]], an illiterate singer who worked in the oral tradition, to create a poem of Iliadic length; the result was Avdo's three-day performance, recorded by phonograph, of a version of the well-known theme ''The Wedding of Smailagić Meho''.&lt;/ref&gt;
# many curious features that offended the ancient Alexandrians and the Analysts are most probably symptomatic of the poems' evolution through oral transmission and, within limits, poets re-inventing them in performance (some have compared this to improvisation, rather as jazz musicians improvise upon a theme).

The biggest complete commentary on the ''Iliad'', 1993's six volume ''The Iliad: A Commentary'' as edited by [[G.S. Kirk]], is Oralist in its approach and emphasizes issues related to live performance such as rhythm; and the pedagogical commentaries by [[Peter Jones (classicist)|Peter Jones]] are heavily Oralist.

Some Oralists do not go so far as to claim that the Homeric epics actually are products of an oral epic tradition: many limit themselves to claiming that the Homeric epics merely draw on earlier oral epic. For much of the mid-20th century much of the resistance to Oral Theory came from scholars who could not see how to preserve Homer as the great original poet: they could not see how there was any room for artistry and creativity in a formulaic system where set-piece episodes ([[Walter Arend]]'s "[[type scene]]s") were as formulaic as Parry's metrical epithet-noun combinations. Some scholars divided Oralists into "hard Parryists", who believed that all aspects of Homeric epic were predetermined by formulaic systems, and "soft Parryists", who believed that Homer had the system at his command rather than the other way round. More recently, books such as Nagy's influential 1979 book about epic heroes, ''The Best of the Achaeans'', and [[Egbert Bakker]]'s 1997 linguistic study ''Poetry as Speech'', work on the principle that the radical cross-fertilisation and resonances between different traditions, genres, plot lines, episodes, and type scenes, are actually the driving force behind much of the artistic innovation in Homeric epic.

Where the joke about 19th century Analysts had it that the epics "were not composed by Homer but by someone else of the same name", now the joke is that Oral Theorists claim the epics are poems without an author. Many Oralists would happily agree with this.

===Neoanalysis===
Neoanalysis is quite separate from 19th century Analysis. It is the study of the relationship between the two Homeric epics and the ''[[Epic Cycle]]'': the extent to which Homer made use of earlier poetic material about the Trojan War, and the extent to which other epic poets made use of Homer. The main obstacle to this line of research &amp;ndash; and, simultaneously, the main impetus for it &amp;ndash; is the fact that the Cyclic epics do not survive except in summaries and isolated fragments. [[Ioannis Kakridis]] is usually regarded as the founding figure of this school of thought, with his 1949 book ''Homeric Researches'', but [[Wolfgang Kullmann]]'s 1960 ''Die Quellen der Ilias'' ("The sources of the ''Iliad''") is even more influential. Neoanalytic topics have become much more prominent in English-language scholarship since 1990, notably in a series of articles by [[M. L. West]] in ''Classical Quarterly'' and in [[Jonathan Burgess]]' 2001 book ''The Tradition of the Trojan War in Homer and the Epic Cycle''. The recent upsurge is due in no small part to the publication of three new editions of the fragmentary Greek epics, including a translation by West for the [[Loeb Classical Library]] series.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bernabé 1987, ''Poeticae Epici Graeci Testimonia et Fragmenta'' (vol. 1) (Leipzig); M. Davies 1988, ''Epicorum Graecorum Fragmenta'' (Göttingen); M.L. West 2003, ''Greek Epic Fragments'' (Cambridge, MA).&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most frequently cited and characteristic topic raised in Neoanalysis is the so-called "Memnon theory" outlined by [[Wolfgang Schadewaldt]] in a 1951 paper. This is the hypothesis that one major plot-line in the ''Iliad'' is based on a similar one in one of the Cyclic epics, the [[Aithiopis]] of [[Arctinus]]. The parallels run as follows:

{| style="margin:auto;"  border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|-
! ''Aithiopis''
! ''Iliad''
|-
| [[Achilleus]]' comrade [[Antilochus]] excels in battle
| Achilleus' comrade [[Patroclus]] excels in battle
|-
| Antilochus is killed by [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]]
| Patroclus is killed by [[Hector]]
|-
| An enraged Achilleus pursues Memnon to the gates of Troy, where he kills him
| An enraged Achilleus pursues Hector to the gates of Troy, chases Hector around the city walls, and kills him
|-
| Achilleus is in turn killed there by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]
| (It has previously been foretold to Achilleus that his own death will follow upon Hector's)
|}

What is debated in the Memnon theory is the implications of these similarities. The most immediate implication is that the poet of the ''Iliad'' borrowed material from the ''Aethiopis''. The debatable points are the poet's reasons for doing so; the status and condition of the ''Aethiopis'' story when this borrowing took place, that is to say whether it was Arctinus' epic that Homer borrowed from, or something less concrete, like a traditional legend; and the extent to which the ''Aethiopis'' and ''Iliad'' played off one another in their subsequent development.

==Recent developments==
The dating of the Homeric epics continues to be a controversial topic. The most influential work in this area in the last few decades is that of [[Richard Janko]], whose 1982 study ''Homer, Hesiod and the Hymns'' uses statistics based on a range of dialectal pointers to argue that the text of both epics became fixed in the latter half of the 8th century, though he has since argued for an even earlier date.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.didaskalia.net/issues/vol3no3/janko.html R. Janko 1996, "The performance of Homeric epic", ''Didaskalia'' 3.3].&lt;/ref&gt; There is no shortage of alternative datings, however, based on other kinds of evidence (literary, philological, archaeological, and artistic), ranging from the 9th century to as late as 550 BCE (Nagy suggests in a 1992 paper that the text's "formative" period lasted until 550). At present most Homeric scholars opt for the late 8th or early 7th century, and a date of 730 BCE is often quoted for the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin L. West in his 2010 commentary on the ''Iliad'' (and in earlier scholarly writings) argues for a dating of the poem in the period 680-650 BC, based in part on apparent references to works of other poems, e.g. [[Hesiod]] and [[Tyrtaeus]], and in part on artistic and other comparative evidence.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, Homeric interpretation has been increasingly influenced by [[literary theory]], especially in literary readings of the ''Odyssey''. [[Post-structuralism|Post-structuralist]] [[Semiotics|semiotic]] approaches have been represented in the work of [[Pietro Pucci]] (''Odysseus Polytropos'', 1987) and [[Marylin Katz]] (''Penelope's Renown'', 1991), for example.

Perhaps the most significant developments have been in [[narratology]], the study of how storytelling works, since this combines empirical linguistic study with literary criticism. [[Irene de Jong]]'s 1987 ''Narrators and Focalizers: The Presentation of the Story in the Iliad'' draws on the work of the theorist [[Mieke Bal]], and de Jong followed this up in 2001 with her ''Narratological Commentary on the Odyssey''; Bakker has published several linguistic-narratological studies, especially his 1997 ''Poetry as Speech''; and [[Elizabeth Minchin]]'s 2001 ''Homer and the Resources of Memory'' draws on several forms of narratology and cognitive science, such as the [[script theory]] developed in the 1970s by [[Roger Schank]] and [[Robert Abelson]].

The '''Idiap Research Institute''' is a semi-private non-profit [[research institute]] at [[Martigny]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Valais]], in south-western Switzerland. It conducts research in the areas of [[speech processing]], [[computer vision]], [[information retrieval]], [[Biometrics|biometric authentication]], [[multimodal interaction]] and [[machine learning]]. The institute is affiliated with the [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]] (EPFL), and with the [[Université de Genève]].&lt;ref name=esv&gt;[http://esv2000.edi.admin.ch/f/entry.asp?Id=2048 Fondation de l'Institut de Recherche Idiap (Foundation of the Idiap Research Institute)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913145657/http://esv2000.edi.admin.ch/f/entry.asp?Id=2048 |date=13 September 2014 }} (in French).

==History==

The institute was founded as the Istituto Dalle Molle di Intelligenza Artificiale Percettiva ({{lang-fr|{{noitalic|Institut Dalle Molle d'intelligence artificielle perceptive}}}}) in 1991 by the Italian entrepreneur [[Angelo Dalle Molle]] through the [[Fondation Dalle Molle]], in collaboration with the [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]] and with local, cantonal and federal government bodies. Its purpose was to investigate the application of [[artificial intelligence]] to human perception in general, and to recognition and analysis of patterns in particular. In 1996, with the participation of the town of [[Martigny]], the [[canton of Valais]], the EPFL, the [[University of Geneva]] and [[Swisscom]], it became a research foundation independent of the Dalle Molle foundation, and shortly after changed its name to Idiap Research Institute.&lt;ref name=fond3&gt;[http://www.dallemolle.ch/en/the-institutes/idiap-research-institute Research Institute Idiap, Martigny]. Fondation Dalle Molle. Accessed September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Idiap is one of the four Swiss research organisations founded by the Dalle Molle foundation, of which three are in the field of artificial intelligence.

'''Ocean acidification''' threatens the [[Great Barrier Reef]] by reducing the viability and strength of [[coral reef]]s. The Great Barrier Reef, considered one of the [[Wonders of the World#Seven Natural Wonders of the World|seven natural wonders of the world]] and a [[biodiversity hotspot]], is located in Australia. Similar to other coral reefs, it is experiencing degradation due to ocean acidification. [[Ocean acidification]] results from a rise in [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric carbon dioxide]], which is taken up by the ocean. This process can increase [[sea surface temperature]], decrease [[aragonite]], and lower the [[pH]] of the ocean.

Calcifying organisms are under risk, due to the resulting lack of aragonite in the water and the decreasing pH. This decreased health of coral reefs, particularly the Great Barrier Reef, can result in reduced [[biodiversity]]. Organisms can become stressed due to ocean acidification and the disappearance of healthy coral reefs, such as the Great Barrier Reef, is a [[Habitat destruction|loss of habitat]] for several [[Taxon|taxa]].

== Background ==
Atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen from 280 to 380 ppm since the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Widdecombe|first=S|last2=Spicer|first2=J.

M.|date=2009|title=Declining coral calcification on the Great Barrier Reef|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/geo4xx/geos478/2009/Resources/DeAth09.pdf|journal=Science|volume=323|issue=5910|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aragonite is impacted by the process of ocean acidification, because it is a form of calcium carbonate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is essential in coral viability and health, because it is found in coral skeletons and is more readily soluble than calcite.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Increasing carbon dioxide levels can reduce coral growth rates from 9 to 56%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other calcifying organisms, such as bivalves and gastropods, experience negative effects due to ocean acidification as well.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ocean acidification: Background and history|last=Gattuso|first=Jean-Pierre|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a biodiversity hotspot, the many taxa of the Great Barrier Reef are threatened by ocean acidification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/great-barrier-reef/submissions/subdr077/subdr077attachment15a.pdf|title=Oceanographic Processes of Coral Reefs, Physical and Biological Links in the Great Barrier Reef|last=Fabricius|first=K.

== Coral health ==

=== Calcification and aragonite ===
Coral is a calcifying organism, putting it at high risk for decay and slow growth rates as ocean acidification increases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aragonite, which impacts the ability of coral to take up CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, decreases when pH decreases.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mongin|first=M|last2=Baird|first2=M. E.|date=2016|title=The exposure of the Great Barrier Reef to ocean acidification|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160223/ncomms10732/full/ncomms10732.html|journal=Nature Communications|volume=7|issue=|pages=10732|doi=10.1038/ncomms10732|pmid=26907171|pmc=4766391|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of aragonite have decreased by 16% since industrialization, and could be lower in some portions of the Great Barrier Reef because the current allows northern corals to take up more aragonite than the southern corals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Aragonite is predicted to reduce by 0.1 by 2100.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Since 1990, calcification rates of ''Porites'', a common large reef-building coral in the Great Barrier Reef, have decreased by 14.2% annually.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aragonite levels across the Great Barrier Reef itself are not equal; due to currents and circulation, some portions of the Great Barrier Reef can have half as much aragonite as others.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Levels of aragonite are also affected by calcification and production, which can vary from reef to reef.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches 560 ppm, most ocean surface waters will be adversely undersaturated with respect to aragonite and the pH will have reduced by about 0.24 units – from almost 8.2 today to just over 7.9. At this point (sometime in the third quarter of this century at current rates of increase) only a few parts of the Pacific will have levels of aragonite saturation adequate for coral growth. Additionally, if atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches 800 ppm, the ocean surface water pH decrease will be 0.4 units and total dissolved carbonate ion concentration will have decreased by at least 60%. At this point it is almost certain that all reefs of the world will be in erosional states.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Increasing the pH and replicating pre-industrialization ocean chemistry conditions in the Great Barrier Reef, however, led to an increase in coral growth rates by 7%.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/landmark-experiment-confirms-ocean-acidification-s-toll-on-great-barrier-reef-1.19410|title=Landmark experiment confirms ocean acidification's toll on Great Barrier Reef|last=Tollefson|first=J|date=February 2016|journal=Nature|access-date=|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperature ===
Ocean acidification can also lead to increased sea surface temperature. An increase of about 1 or 2&amp;nbsp;°C can cause the collapse of the relationship between coral and [[zooxanthellae]], possibly leading to [[Coral bleaching|bleaching]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Average sea surface temperature in the Great Barrier Reef is predicted to increase between 1 and 3&amp;nbsp;°C by 2100.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This breakdown of the relationship between the coral and the zooxanthellae occurs when [[Photosystem II]] is damaged, either due to a reaction with the D1 protein or a lack of carbon dioxide fixation; these result in a lack of photosynthesis and can lead to bleaching.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
Ocean acidification threatens coral reproduction throughout almost all aspects of the process.[[Gametogenesis]] may be indirectly affected by coral bleaching. Additionally, the stress that acidification puts on coral can potentially harm the viability of the sperm released. Larvae can also be affected by this process; metabolism and settlement cues could be altered, changing the size of population or viability of reproduction.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Other species of calcifying larvae have shown reduced growth rates under ocean acidification scenarios.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Biofilm]], a [[bioindicator]] for oceanic conditions, underwent reduced growth rate and altered composition in acidification, possibly affecting larval settlement on the biofilm itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witt|first=V|last2=Wild|first2=C|date=2011|title=Effects of ocean acidification on microbial community composition of, and oxygen fluxes through, biofilms from the Great Barrier Reef|url=|journal=Environmental Microbiology|volume=13|issue=11|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02571.x|pmid=21906222|access-date=|via=|pages=2976–2989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
The Great Barrier Reef is a biodiversity hotspot, but it is threatened by ocean acidification and its resulting increased temperature and reduced levels of aragonite. [[Elasmobranchii|Elasmobranchs]] in the Great Barrier Reef are vulnerable to ocean acidification primarily due to their reliance on the habitat and ocean acidification's destruction of coral reefs. Rare and [[Endemism|endemic]] species, such as the [[porcupine ray]], are at high risk as well.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oceanographic Processes of Coral Reefs, Physical and Biological Links in the Great Barrier Reef|last=Fabricius|first=K. E.|last2=De'ath|first2=G|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=127–144|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larval health and settlement of both calcifying and non-calcifying organisms can be harmed by ocean acidification. A predator to coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef, the [[Crown-of-thorns starfish|Crown of Thorns sea star]], has experienced a similar death rate to the coral on which it feeds. Any increase in nutrients, possibly from river run-off, can positively affect the Crown of Thorns and lead to further destruction of the coral.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Coralline algae]] holds together some coral reefs and is present in multiple ecosystems. As ocean acidification intensifies, however, it will not respond well and could damage the viability and structural integrity of coral reefs. Ocean acidification can also indirectly affect any organism; increased stress can reduce photosynthesis and reproduction, or make organisms more vulnerable to disease. Additionally, as coral reefs decay, their symbiotic relationships and residents will have to adapt or find new habitats on which to rely.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Organisms have been found to be more sensitive to the effects of ocean acidification in early, larval or planktonic stages. As ocean acidification does not exist in a vacuum, the multiple problems facing the Great Barrier Reef combine to further stress the organisms. Not only can ocean acidification affect habitat and development, but it can also affect how organisms view predators and [[conspecifics]]. Studies on the effects of ocean acidification have not been performed on long enough time scales to see if organisms can adapt to these conditions. However, ocean acidification is predicted to occur at a rate that evolution cannot match.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Increasing temperature is also affecting the behavior and fitness of the common coral trout, a very important fish in sustaining the health of coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johansen|first=J. L.|date=2014|title=Increasing ocean temperatures reduce activity patterns of a large commercially important coral reef fish|url=|journal=Global Change Biology|volume=20.4|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIKE 21''' is a [[computer program]] that simulates flows, waves, sediments and ecology in rivers, lakes, estuaries, bays, coastal areas and seas in two dimensions. It was developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]].

==Simulation engines==
MIKE 21 comprises three simulation engines: 

'''Single Grid''': the {{Not a typo|full time}}-dependent non-linear equations of continuity and conservation of momentum are solved by implicit finite difference techniques with the variables defined on a space-staggered rectangular grid.

'''Multiple Grids''': the Multiple Grids version uses the same simulation engine and numerical approach as the single grid version. However, it provides the possibility of refining areas of special interest within the model area (nesting). All domains within the model area are dynamically linked. 

'''Flexible Mesh''': is an unstructured mesh and uses a cell-centred finite volume solution technique. The mesh is based on linear triangular elements.

==Applications==
MIKE 21 can be used for design data assessment for coastal and offshore structures, optimization of port layout and coastal protection measures, cooling water, desalination and recirculation analysis, environmental impact assessment of marine infrastructures, water forecast for safe marine operations and navigation, coastal flooding and storm surge warnings, inland flooding and overland flow modeling.

Large-scale recording of neuronal ensembles. ''Nature Neuroscience 7'': 446-451.&lt;/ref&gt;|{{deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 7 May 2009}}]] --&gt;
'''Microelectrode arrays (MEAs)''' (also referred to as multielectrode arrays) are devices that contain multiple (tens to thousands) [[microelectrode]]s through which neural [[signal (electronics)|signals]] are obtained or delivered, essentially serving as neural interfaces that connect [[neuron]]s to [[electric circuit|electronic circuitry]].  There are two general classes of MEAs: implantable MEAs, used ''[[in vivo]]'', and non-implantable MEAs, used ''[[in vitro]]''.

==Theory==
Neurons and [[muscle]] cells create [[ion]] currents through their [[Cell membrane|membranes]] when excited, causing a change in [[voltage]] between the inside and the outside of the cell. When recording, the [[electrode]]s on an MEA [[Transducer|transduce]] the change in [[voltage]] from the environment carried by [[ions]] into currents carried by [[electrons]] (electronic currents). When stimulating, [[electrodes]] transduce electronic currents into ionic currents through the media. This triggers the [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s on the [[cell membrane|membranes]] of the excitable cells, causing the cell to [[depolarization|depolarize]] and trigger an [[action potential]] if it is a neuron or a twitch if it is a muscle cell.{{Citation needed|reason=It is highly unlikely that a low-voltage extracellular current directly affects voltage-gated channels that are known to respond to large changes in the 70,000 V/m electric field of the cell membrane|date=December 2008}}

The size and shape of a recorded signal depend upon several factors: the nature of the medium in which the cell or cells are located (e.g. the medium's [[electrical conductivity]], [[capacitance]], and [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneity]]); the nature of contact between the cells and the MEA electrode (e.g. area of contact and tightness); the nature of the MEA electrode itself (e.g. its geometry, [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], and noise); the [[analog signal processing]] (e.g. the system's [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and behavior outside of [[cutoff frequency|cutoff frequencies]]); and the data [[sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] properties (e.g. [[sampling rate]] and [[digital signal processing]]).&lt;ref name="Boven"&gt;Boven K-H, Fejtl M, Möller A, Nisch W, Stett A. On Micro-Electrode Array Revival. In: Baudry M, Taketani M, eds. ''Advances in Network Electrophysiology Using Multi-Electrode Arrays.'' New York: Springer Press; 2006: 24-37.&lt;/ref&gt; For the recording of a single cell that partially covers a planar electrode, the voltage at the [[contact pad]] is approximately equal to the voltage of the overlapping region of the cell and electrode multiplied by the ratio the [[surface area]] of the overlapping region to the area of the entire electrode, or:

&lt;math&gt;V_{pad}=V_{overlap}\times\frac{A_{overlap}}{A_{electrode}}&lt;/math&gt;

assuming the area around an electrode is [[insulator (electrical)|well-insulated]] and has a very small capacitance associated with it.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt; The equation above, however, relies on modeling the electrode, cells, and their surroundings as an equivalent [[circuit diagram]]. An alternative means of predicting cell-electrode behavior is by modeling the system using a geometry-based [[finite element analysis]] in an attempt to circumvent the limitations of oversimplifying the system in a lumped circuit element diagram.&lt;ref name="Buitenweg"&gt;Buitenweg JR, Rutten WL, and Marani E. 2003. Geometry-based finite element modeling of the electrical contact between a cultured neuron and a microelectrode. ''IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 50'': 501-509.&lt;/ref&gt;

An MEA can be used to perform [[electrophysiological]] experiments on tissue slices or [[dissociated cell cultures]]. With acute tissue slices, the connections between the cells within the tissue slices prior to extraction and plating are more or less preserved, while the intercellular connections in dissociated cultures are destroyed prior to plating. With dissociated neuronal cultures, the neurons spontaneously form [[biological neural network|networks]].&lt;ref name="Potter2001"&gt;Potter SM. 2001. Distributed processing in cultured neuronal networks. ''Prog Brain Res 130'': 49-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be seen that the voltage [[amplitude]] an electrode experiences is [[inversely related]] to the distance from which a cell depolarizes.&lt;ref name="PineBook"&gt;Pine J. A History of MEA Development. In: Baudry M, Taketani M, eds. ''Advances in Network Electrophysiology Using Multi-Electrode Arrays.'' New York: Springer Press; 2006:3-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it may be necessary for the cells to be cultured or otherwise placed as close to the electrodes as possible. With tissue slices, a layer of electrically passive dead cells form around the site of incision due to [[edema]].&lt;ref name="Heuschkel"&gt;Heuschkel MO, Wirth C, Steidl EM, Buisson B. Development of 3-D Multi-Electrode Arrays for Use with Acute Tissue Slices. In: Baudry M, Taketani M, eds. ''Advances in Network Electrophysiology Using Multi-Electrode Arrays.'' New York: Springer Press; 2006:69-111.&lt;/ref&gt; A way to deal with this is by fabricating an MEA with three-dimensional electrodes fabricated by [[photomask|masking]] and [[etching (microfabrication)|chemical etching]]. These 3-D electrodes penetrate the dead cell layer of the slice tissue, decreasing the distance between live cells and the electrodes.&lt;ref name="Thiebaud"&gt;Thiebaud P, deRooij NF, Koudelka-Hep M, Stoppini L. 1997. Microelectrode arrays for electrophysiological monitoring of hippocampal organotypic slice cultures. ''IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 44'': 1159-63.&lt;/ref&gt; In dissociated cultures, proper adherence of the cells to the MEA substrate is important for getting robust signals.

==History==
The first implantable arrays were microwire arrays developed in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Cheung" /&gt; The first experiment involving the use of an array of planar electrodes to record from cultured cells was conducted in 1972 by C.A. Thomas, Jr. and his colleagues.&lt;ref name="PineBook" /&gt; The experimental setup used a 2 x 15 array of [[gold]] electrodes plated with [[platinum black]], each spaced 100&amp;nbsp;µm apart from each other. [[Myocytes]] harvested from [[embryo]]nic chicks were dissociated and cultured onto the MEAs, and signals up to 1 mV high in amplitude were recorded.&lt;ref name = "Thomas"&gt;Thomas CA, Springer PA, Loeb GE, Berwald-Netter Y, Okun LM. 1972. A miniature microelectrode array to monitor the bioelectric activity of cultured cells. ''Exp Cell Res. 74'': 61-66.&lt;/ref&gt; MEAs were constructed and used to explore the electrophysiology of snail [[ganglia]] independently by [[Guenter Gross]] and his colleagues at the Center for Network Neuroscience in 1977 without prior knowledge of Thomas and his colleagues' work.&lt;ref name="PineBook" /&gt; In 1982, Gross observed spontaneous electrophysiological activity from dissociated [[spinal cord]] neurons, and found that activity was very dependent on temperature. Below about 30˚C signal amplitudes decrease rapidly to relatively small value at [[room temperature]].&lt;ref name="PineBook" /&gt;

Before the 1990s, significant [[entry barrier]]s existed for new laboratories that sought to conduct MEA research due to the custom MEA fabrication and software they had to develop.&lt;ref name="Potter2001" /&gt; However, with the advent of affordable computing power&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt; and commercial MEA hardware and software,&lt;ref name="Potter2001" /&gt; many other laboratories were able to undertake research using MEAs. This non-invasive [[electrophysiology]] [[laboratory technique]] can be more efficient than the [[patch clamp]] method.

==Types==
Microelectrode arrays can be divided up into subcategories based on their potential use: ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' arrays.

===''In vitro'' arrays===
[[Image:MEAinHand.jpg|thumb|An ''in vitro'' MEA |300px|right|An ''in vitro'' MEA]]
The standard type of ''in vitro'' MEA comes in a pattern of 8 x 8 or 6 x 10 electrodes.  Electrodes are typically composed of [[indium tin oxide]] or [[titanium]] and have diameters between 10 and 30 μm.  These arrays are normally used for single-cell cultures or acute brain slices.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt;

One challenge among ''in vitro'' MEAs has been imaging them with [[microscopes]] that use high power lenses, requiring low [[working distance]]s on the order of micrometers. In order to avoid this problem, "thin"-MEAs have been created using cover slip glass. These arrays are approximately 180 μm allowing them to be used with high-power lenses.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tenacity"&gt;Minerbi A, Kahana R, Goldfeld L, Kaufman M, Marom S, Ziv NE. 2009. Long-term relationships between synaptic tenacity, synaptic remodeling, and network activity. PLoS Biol. 7(6):e1000136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another special design, 60 electrodes are split into 6 x 5 arrays separated by 500 μm.  Electrodes within a group are separated by 30&amp;nbsp;um with diameters of 10 μm.  Arrays such as this are used to examine local responses of neurons while also studying functional connectivity of organotypic slices.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segev R, Berry II, MJ. 2003. Recording from all of the ganglion cells in the retina. ''Soc Neurosci Abstr. 264'': 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial resolution is one of the key advantages of MEAs and allows signals sent over a long distance to be taken with higher precision when a high-density MEA is used.  These arrays usually have a square grid pattern of 256 electrodes that cover an area of 2.8 by 2.8&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt;

Increased spatial resolution is provided by CMOS-based high-density microelectrode arrays featuring thousands of electrodes along with integrated readout and stimulation circuits on compact chips of the size of a thumbnail.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;A. Hierlemann, U. Frey, S. Hafizovic, F. Heer (2011). Growing Cells atop Microelectronic Chips: Interfacing Electrogenic Cells in Vitro with CMOS-based Microelectrode Arrays. Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 99, No. 2, pp. 252-284.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the resolution of signals propagating along  single axons has been demonstrated.&lt;ref name="A2"&gt;D. J. Bakkum, U. Frey, M. Radivojevic, T. L. Russell, J. Müller, M. Fiscella, H. Takahashi, A. Hierlemann (2013). Tracking axonal action potential propagation on a high-density microelectrode array across hundreds of sites. Nature Communications 2013, 4:2181.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to obtain quality signals electrodes and tissue must be in close contact with one another.  The perforated MEA design applies negative [[pressure]] to openings in the substrate so that tissue slices can be positioned on the electrodes to enhance contact and recorded signals.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt;

A different approach to lower the electrode impedance is by modification of the interface material, for example by using [[carbon nanotubes]],&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Z. et al. 2007. Vertically Aligned Carbon Nanofiber Arrays Record Electrophysiological Signals from Hippocampal Slices. ''Nano Lett. 7(8)'': 2188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabai, T. et al. 2007. Electro-chemical and biological properties of carbon nanotube based multi-electrode arrays  ''Nanotechnology. 18(3)'': 035201.&lt;/ref&gt; or by modification of the structure of the electrodes, with for example gold nanopillars&lt;ref&gt;Brüggemann, D. et al. 2011. Nanostructured gold microelectrodes for extracellular recording from electrogenic cells ''Nanotechnology 22(26)'': 265104.&lt;/ref&gt; or nanocavities.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, B. et al. 2011. Nanocavity electrode array for recording from electrogenic cells ''Lab Chip 11'': 1054.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''In vivo'' arrays===
[[Image:Utah array pat5215088.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Schematic of the "Utah" in vivo electrode array]]
The three major categories of implantable MEAs are microwire, [[silicon]]- based,&lt;ref&gt;R. Bhandari, S. Negi, F. Solzbacher, "Wafer Scale Fabrication of Penetrating Neural Electrode Arrays" Biomedical Microdevices, Vol. 12(5), pp. 797-807, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and flexible microelectrode arrays.  Microwire MEAs are largely made of stainless [[steel]] or [[tungsten]] and they can be used to estimate the position of individual recorded neurons by triangulation.  Silicon-based microelectrode arrays include two specific models: the Michigan and Utah arrays.  Michigan arrays allow a higher density of sensors for implantation as well as a higher spatial resolution than microwire MEAs.  They also allow signals to be obtained along the length of the shank, rather than just at the ends of the shanks.  In contrast to Michigan arrays, Utah arrays are 3-D, consisting of 100 conductive silicon needles.  However, in a Utah array signals are only received from the tips of each electrode, which limits the amount of information that can be obtained at one time.  Furthermore, Utah arrays are manufactured with set dimensions and parameters while the Michigan array allows for more design freedom. Flexible arrays, made with [[polyimide]], [[parylene]], or [[benzocyclobutene]], provide an advantage over rigid microelectrode arrays because they provide a closer mechanical match, as the [[Young's modulus]] of silicon is much larger than that of brain tissue, contributing to shear-induced [[inflammation]].&lt;ref name="Cheung"&gt;Cheung KC. 2007. Implantable microscale neural interfaces. ''Biomedical Microdevices 9'': 923-38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data processing methods==

The fundamental unit of communication of neurons is, electrically, at least, the action potential. This all-or-nothing phenomenon originates at the [[axon hillock]],&lt;ref name="Angelides"&gt;Angelides KJ, Elmer LW, Loftus D, Elson E. 1988. Distribution and lateral mobility of voltage-dependent sodium channels in neurons. ''J. Cell Biol. 106'': 1911-25.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a depolarization of the intracellular environment which propagates down the [[axon]]. This ion flux through the cellular membrane generates a sharp change in voltage in the extracellular environment, which is what the MEA electrodes ultimately detect. Thus, voltage spike counting and sorting is often used in research to characterize network activity.

==Capabilities==

===Advantages===
In general, the major strengths of ''in vitro'' arrays when compared to more traditional methods such as [[patch clamp]]ing include:&lt;ref&gt;Whitson J, Kubota D, Shimono K, Jia Y, Taketani M. Multi-Electrode Arrays: Enhancing Traditional Methods and Enabling Network Physiology. In: Baudry M, Taketani M, eds. ''Advances in Network Electrophysiology Using Multi-Electrode Arrays''. New York: Spring Press; 2006: 38-68&lt;/ref&gt;

*Allowing the placement of multiple electrodes at once rather than individually
*The ability to set up controls within the same experimental setup (by using one electrode as a control and others as experimental). This is of particular interest in stimulation experiments.
*The ability to select different recordings sites within the array
*The ability to simultaneously receive data from multiple sites
*Recordings from intact retinae are of great interest because of the possibility of delivering real-time optical stimulation and, for instance, the possibility of reconstructing receptive fields.

Furthermore, ''in vitro'' arrays are non-invasive when compared to patch clamping because they do not require breaching of the cell membrane.
 
With respect to ''in vivo'' arrays however, the major advantage over patch clamping is the high spatial resolution. Implantable arrays allow signals to be obtained from individual neurons enabling information such as position or [[velocity]] of motor movement that can be used to control a [[prosthetic]] device. Large-scale, parallel recordings with tens of implanted electrodes are possible, at least in rodents, during animal behavior. This makes such extracellular recordings the method of choice to identify of neural circuits and to study their functions. Unambiguous identification of the recorded neuron using multi-electrode extracellular arrays, however, remains a problem to date.

===Disadvantages===
''In vitro'' MEAs are less suited for recording and stimulating single cells due to their low spatial resolution compared to patch clamp and [[dynamic clamp]] systems.  The complexity of signals an MEA electrode could effectively transmit to other cells is limited compared to the capabilities of dynamic clamps.

There are also several biological responses to implantation of a microelectrode array, particularly in regards to chronic implantation.  Most notable among these effects are neuronal cell loss, [[glial scarring]], and a drop in the number of functioning electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;Biran R, Martin DC, Tresco PA. 2005. Neuronal cell loss accompanies the brain tissue response to chronically implanted silicon microelectrode arrays. ''Experimental Neurology 195'': 115-26&lt;/ref&gt; The tissue response to implantation is dependent among many factors including size of the MEA shanks, distance between the shanks, MEA material composition, and time period of insertion. The tissue response is typically divided into short term and long term response. The short term response occurs within hours of implantation and begins with an increased population of [[astrocytes]] and [[glial cells]] surrounding the device. The recruited [[microglia]] then initiate inflammation and a process of [[phagocytosis]] of the foreign material begins. Over time, the astrocytes and microglia recruited to the device begin to accumulate, forming a sheath surrounding the array that extends tens of micrometres around the device. This not only increases the space between electrode probes, but also insulates the electrodes and increases impedance measurements. Problems with chronic implantation of arrays have been a driving force in the research of these devices. One novel study examined the [[neurodegenerative]] effects of inflammation caused by chronic implantation.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell GC, Rees HD, Levey AI, Gross RG, Bellamkonda RV. 2008. Chronic electrodes induce a local, neurodegenerative state:  Implications for chronic recording reliability. ''Society for Neuroscience'', Washington, D.C&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immunohistochemical]] markers showed a surprising presence of hyperphosphorylated tau, an indicator of [[Alzheimer's disease]], near the electrode recording site. The phagocytosis of electrode material also brings to question the issue of a biocompatibility response, which research suggests has been minor and becomes almost nonexistent after 12 weeks ''in vivo''. Research to minimize the negative effects of device insertion includes surface coating of the devices with proteins that encourage neuron attachment, such as [[laminin]], or drug [[elution|eluting]] substances.&lt;ref&gt;He W, McConnell GC, Bellamkonda RV. 2006. Nanoscale laminin coating modulates cortical scarring response around implanted silicon microelectrode arrays. ''Journal of Neural Engineering 3'': 316-26&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Animat Drawing.jpg|thumb|Schematic for a neurally controlled animat|500px|right|Schematic for a neurally controlled animat]] --&gt;
The nature of dissociated [[neuronal network]]s does not seem to change or diminish the character of its [[pharmacological]] response when compared to ''in vivo'' models, suggesting that MEAs can be used to study pharmacological effects on dissociated neuronal cultures in a more simple, controlled environment.&lt;ref name="Gopal"&gt;Gopal KV, Gross GW. Emerging Histotypic Properties of Cultured Neuronal Networks. In: Baudry M, Taketani M, eds. ''Advances in Network Electrophysiology Using Multi-Electrode Arrays''.

Histotypic electrophysiological responses of cultured neuronal networks to ethanol. ''Alcohol 30'': 167-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a substantial body of work on various biophysical aspects of network function was carried out by reducing phenomena usually studied at the behavioral level to the dissociated cortical network level. For example, the capacity of such networks to extract spatial&lt;ref name="Order"&gt;Shahaf G, Eytan D, Gal A, Kermany E, Lyakhov V, Zrenner C, Marom S. 2008.

IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 56,1220-1227.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, combining MEA technology with [[confocal microscopy]] allows for studying relationships between network activity and synaptic remodeling.&lt;ref name="tenacity" /&gt;

MEAs have been used to interface neuronal networks with non-biological systems as a controller. For example, a neural-computer interface can be created using MEAs. Dissociated rat [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] neurons were integrated into a closed stimulus-response feedback loop to control an animat in a virtual environment.&lt;ref name="Animat"&gt;DeMarse TB, Wagenaar DA, Blau AW, Potter SM. 2001. The Neurally Controlled Animat: Biological Brains Acting with Simulated Bodies. ''Autonomous Robots 11'': 305-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Feedback|closed-loop]] stimulus-response system has also been constructed using an MEA by Dr. Potter, Dr. Mandhavan, and Dr. DeMarse,&lt;ref name="potterrobot"&gt;Potter, SM, Madhavan, R and DeMarse, TB. 2003. Long-term bidirectional neuron interfaces for robotic control, and in vitro learning studies. Proc. ''25th IEEE EMBS Annual Meeting''.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Mark Hammond, [[Kevin Warwick]], and Ben Whalley in the [[University of Reading]]. About 300,000 dissociated rat neurons were plated on an MEA, which was connected to motors and [[ultrasound]] sensors on a robot, and was conditioned to avoid obstacles when sensed.&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;Marks P. 2008. Rise of the rat-brained robots. ''New Scientist 2669''.&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, Shimon Marom and colleagues in the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]] hooked dissociated neuronal networks growing on MEAs to a  [[Lego Mindstorms]] robot; the visual field of the robot was classified by the network, and commands were delivered to the robot wheels such that it completely avoids bumping into obstacles .&lt;ref name="Order" /&gt; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2580731/bin/pcbi.1000228.s004.mov link to movie]. This [[Braitenberg vehicles|"Braitenberg Vehicle"]] was used to demonstrate the [[underdetermination|indeterminacy]] of reverse neuro-engineering &lt;ref&gt;Marom S, Meir R, Braun E, Gal A, Kermany E, Eytan D. 2009.

Front Comput Neurosci. ;3:5.&lt;/ref&gt; showing that even in a simple setup with practically unlimited access to every piece of relevant information, it was impossible to deduce with certainty the specific [[neural coding]] scheme that was used to drive the robots behavior.

MEAs have been used to observe network firing in [[hippocampal]] slices.&lt;ref name="Colgin"&gt;Colgin, L.L., Kramar, E.A., Gall, C.M., and Lynch, G. (2003). Septal modulation of excitatory transmission in hippocampus. ''J Neurophysiol. 90:'' 2358-2366.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''In vivo''===
There are several implantable interfaces that are currently available for consumer use including [[deep brain stimulation|deep brain stimulators]], [[cochlear implants]], and [[artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]]s. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been effective at treating movement disorders such as [[Parkinson's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;Breit S, Schulz JB, Benabid AL. 2004. Deep Brain Stimulation. ''Cell Tissue Research 318'': 275-288.&lt;/ref&gt; and cochlear implants have helped many to improve their hearing by assisting stimulation of the [[auditory nerve]]. Because of their remarkable potential, MEAs are a prominent area of neuroscience research. Research suggests that MEAs may provide insight into processes such as memory formation and perception and may also hold therapeutic value for conditions such as [[epilepsy]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. Clinical trials using interface devices for restoring motor control after spinal cord injury or as treatment for [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] have been initiated in a project entitled BrainGate (see video demo: [http://www.cyberkineticsinc.com/video.htm BrainGate]). MEAs provide the high resolution necessary to record time varying signals, giving them the ability to be used to both control and obtain feedback from prosthetic devices, as was shown by [[Kevin Warwick]], [[Mark Gasson]] and [[Peter Kyberd]].&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Andrews, B, Teddy, P and Shad, A:"The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems", ''Archives of Neurology'', 60(10), pp1369-1373, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz AB. 2004.

''Annual Review of Neuroscience 27'': 487-507.&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that MEA use may be able to assist in the restoration of vision by stimulating the [[optic nerve|optic pathway]].&lt;ref name="Cheung" /&gt;

==MEA user meetings==
A biannual scientific user meeting is held in Reutlingen, organized by the [http://www.nmi.de Natural and Medical Sciences Institute] (NMI) at the University of Tuebingen. The meetings offer a comprehensive overview of all aspects related to new developments and current applications of Microelectrode Arrays in basic and applied neuroscience as well as in industrial drug discovery, safety pharmacology and neurotechnology. The biannual conference has developed into an international venue for scientists developing and using MEAs from both industry and academia, and is recognized as an information-packed scientific forum of high quality. The meeting contributions are available as open access proceeding books.

==Use in art==

In addition to being used for scientific purposes, MEAs have been used in [[contemporary art]] to investigate philosophical questions about the relationship between technology and biology. Traditionally within Western thought, biology and technology have been separated into two distinct categories: ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/βίος#Ancient_Greek bios]'' and ''[[Techne|technê.]]''&lt;ref&gt;Thacker, Eugene (2010) "What is Biomedia?" in "Critical Terms for Media Studies" University of Chicago Press. Chicago and London, pp118-30&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, ''MEART: The Semi-living Artist'' was created as a collaborative art and science project between [[Symbiotica|SymbioticA]] at the [[University of Western Australia]] in [[Perth]], and the Potter Lab at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in [[Atlanta]], to question the relationship between biology and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bakkum DJ, Gamblen PM, Ben-Ary G, Chao ZC, Potter SM |title=MEART: The Semi-Living Artist |journal=Frontiers in Neurorobotics |volume=1 |issue= |pages=5 |year=2007 |pmid=18958276 |pmc=2533587 |doi=10.3389/neuro.12.005.2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bakkum |first1=Douglas J. |last2=Shkolnik |first2=Alexander C. |last3=Ben-Ary |first3=Guy |last4=Gamblen |first4=Phil |last5=DeMarse |first5=Thomas B. |last6=Potter |first6=Steve M. |title=Removing Some 'A' from AI: Embodied Cultured Networks |volume=3139 |year=2004 |pages=130–45 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-27833-7_10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Group 2002 pp.60-68"&gt;SymbioticA research Group (2002) MEART – the semi living artist (AKA Fish &amp; Chips) Stage 2 pp.60-68. in BEAP, Biennale of Electronic Art, 2002: The Exhibitions .

Researchers have utilized [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans to study patients via scanning their brains while the patients are being presented with the auditory stimulus of musical sounds. Patients were given other psychological and emotional perception-oriented tests that were related to the notion of money during the MRI procedure to effectively control the experiment for music or to isolate the effect or effects of the independent variable of music (i.e., in other words, to make sure they only showed no emotion while listening to music). The studies revealed that, relative to the average person, individuals whom are shown to exhibit this condition tend to have a significantly lesser degree of a connection in their brain between their [[auditory processing]] and [[reward center]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mas-Herrero|first=Ernest|last2=Zatorre|first2=Robert J.|last3=Rodriguez-Fornells|first3=Antoni|last4=Marco-Pallarés|first4=Josep|date=2014-03-17|title=Dissociation between Musical and Monetary Reward Responses in Specific Musical Anhedonia|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(14)00133-X|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=24|issue=6|pages=699–704|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.01.068|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt; MRI scans also showed that people with this condition have relatively little connection between the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[auditory processing]] compared to the average person. In fact, it was also empirically deduced that individuals who are shown to enjoy listening to music have a higher connection in this area of the brain than those who are found to have the condition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Social stigma==
The majority of the world's population enjoys listening to music.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} According to some, for this reason, music can be considered to be a universal language. Individuals who suffer from musical anhedonia tend to find it challenging for themselves to understand why it is that they do not gain pleasure from listening to music. The core societal benefits that have emerged out of the new empirical research on the phenomenon are two-fold: it has helped people with this condition to better understand why they have it and it has served to educate the rest of the population that it is a real and legitimate condition that significantly impacts the lives of many around the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

NK-92®️, a proprietary immortal cell line owned and controlled by [https://NantKwest.com NantKwest, Inc]., is a continuously growing cell line that has features and characteristics of natural killer (NK) cells that every person has circulating in the blood.  Blood NK cells and NK-92®️ cells recognize "invaders" such as viruses and fungus. Most importantly, NK-92®️ cells, like blood NK cells, can attack cancer cells as long as the tumor has not grown out of control. NK-92®️ cells were isolated and characterized by the laboratory of Dr. H. Klingemann - at that time at the British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver, Canada.[1] The cells came from a patient who had a NK cell lymphoma, a rare lymphoma type. Although several other NK cell lines have been cloned, only NK-92®️ cells can be expanded to larger numbers and consistently kill tumor cells vigorously.[2] When NK-92®️ cells bind to a cancer or infected cell, they secrete perforinwhich punches holes in target cells followed by release of granzymes which induce apoptosis in the target cells. NK-92®️ cells also attack cancer cells through the Fas-Fas Ligand system and are capable of producing cytokines that by themselves can kill cancer cells (such as TNF-alpha) or stimulate and expand other immune cells such as interferon.[3] 

== NK-92®️ Cell Line Licensing and Rights ==

The cell line has been licensed to [https://nantKwest.com/ NantKwest], Inc. and is currently being developed in the clinic: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For intravenous therapy in hematological malignancies and solid tumors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For local intra-tumor injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As effector cells for antibody-mediated killing via CD16 modified cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As effector cells for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific killing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
NK-92®️ cells is a registered trademark of [https://nantkwest.com/ NantKwest, Inc.] in the United States and is pending in Europe.

The cell line has been licensed for non-clinical applications to [http://brinkbiologics.com/ Brink Biologics Inc.] and has been licensing for veterinary applications to Coneksis, Inc.

NantKwest's only authorized distributor for all requestors is [https://brinkbiologics.com Brink Biologics Inc.], which makes NK-92®️ cells and certain genetically-modified variants available for a wide-range of laboratory assays and in vivo research, including ADCC assays that quantify the contribution of ADCC in the therapeutic effect of monoclonal antibodies (Brink Biologics’ Neukopanel) and for other non-clinical assay applications.
==NK-92&lt;sup&gt;®️&lt;/sup&gt; Cells in Clinical Trials==
Three phase I clinical trials, led by experts in adoptive immunotherapy of cancer, have so far yielded excellent results.  Hans Klingemann, MD, PhD and Sally Arai, MD completed the US trial at [[Rush University Medical Center]] ([[Chicago]]) in renal cell and melanoma patients,&lt;ref&gt;Arai S, Meagher R, Swearingen M, et al. Infusion of the allogeneic cell line NK-92®️ in patients with advanced [[renal cell]] cancer or [[melanoma]]: a phase I trial. Cytotherapy 2008;10:625-32&lt;/ref&gt; and Torsten Tonn, MD and Oliver Ottmann, MD completed the European trial at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] in patients with various solid and hematological malignancies.&lt;ref&gt;Tonn T, Becker S, Esser R, Schwabe D, Seifried E. Cellular immunotherapy of malignancies using the clonal natural killer cell line NK-92®️. J Hematother Stem Cell Res 2001;10:535-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Armand Keating, MD is completing the last cohort of patients in the Canadian trial at [[Princess Margaret Cancer Centre|Princess Margaret Hospital]] in [[Toronto]] in [[lymphoma]] patients after autologous bone marrow transplants. In all three programs, NK-92®️ cells were administered as a simple intravenous infusion, dosed two or three times per treatment course and given in the outpatient setting.

Most importantly, there were no grade ≥ 2 side-effects during or after the short infusion of NK-92®️ cells. The maximum dose given in the Frankfurt trial was 10e10 cells/me2 x 2 infusions, each 48 hours apart. The Chicago study infused NK-92®️ cells at a maximum of 5 x 10e cells/me2 x 3 infusions, each 48 hours apart. This was not the MTD but rather the number of cells that could be expanded in culture bags over a three-week culture period. Alternative cell expansion technologies (bioreactors) will make it possible to further expand the numbers of NK-92®️ cells on a smaller 'footprint'.   Anecdotal reports of antitumor activity in the two completed phase I studies have been observed in 6/11 patients with renal cancer, 3/4 patients with lung cancer, and 1/1 patient with melanoma, all with very advanced disease. In addition to disease stabilization and regression of metastases in lung and [[lymph node]]s, the severe pain associated with tumor metastases in several patients, which had been refractory to standard chemotherapy, was remarkably lessened.  The ongoing trial in Toronto treats patients with lymphoma who have relapsed after an autologous stem cell transplant. Preliminary results suggest a significant benefit in several patients.

== Genetic Engineering of NK-92&lt;sup&gt;®️&lt;/sup&gt; Cells ==
NK-92®️ cells  can be genetically engineered to recognize and kill human cancer cells. 
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) engineered [[T-lymphocyte]]s are currently the buzz in Immuno-Oncology, having shown that infusion of those engineered cells can achieve remissions in some patients with [[acute leukemia|acute]] and [[chronic leukemia]].&lt;ref name="pmid21830940"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Porter DL, Levine BL, Kalos M, Bagg A, June CH |title=Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells in chronic lymphoid leukemia |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=365 |issue=8 |pages=725–33 | date=August  2011 |pmid=21830940 |pmc=3387277 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1103849 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, NK cells (either from peripheral blood or cord blood) have not generated sufficient interest as CAR{{nbhyph}}engineered cytotoxic effector cells, largely for two reasons: the extent of NK cell expansion can be  dependent on the donor; secondly, transfection efficiency, even with lentiviral or retroviral vectors is only moderately efficient. NK-92®️ cells on the other hand, have predictable expansion kinetics and can be grown in bioreactors to billions of cells within a couple of weeks. They can easily be transfected either with viral supernatant or physical methods. Even [[mRNA]] can be shuttled into the cells with high efficiency. Since no integration of mRNA into the genome occurs, this transfection is less risky and  the regulatory burden is equally reduced.

NK-92®️ cells have also been transfected with a high affinity Fc Receptor (NK-92Fc) which is the main receptor for monoclonal antibodies to execute antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicty (ADCC) - examples: rituximab, ofatumumab. Based on this variant, an assay has been developed to quantify the ADCC of monoclonal antibodies (Neukopanel),&lt;ref name="pmid19562616"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weitzman J, Betancur M, Boissel L, Rabinowitz AP, Klein A, Klingemann H |title=Variable contribution of monoclonal antibodies to ADCC in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia |journal=Leuk.

The term '''Nonprofits Research''' is used to describe the academic enterprise devoted to teaching and research on [[nonprofit organization]]s and [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), voluntary associations, voluntarism and voluntary action, [[philanthropy]], [[civil society]], and related activities. It is a loosely bounded,  multidisciplinary, practice-oriented community.

The field has its origins in the 1940s, when [[F. Emerson Andrews]], a staffer at the [[Russell Sage Foundation]], initiated a series of studies of foundations and philanthropy. Institutionally, Sage had a long-term interest in philanthropy as part of the larger problem of social welfare policy. In the 1940s and 1950s, Andrews and his associates produced a series of pioneering volumes on philanthropic giving (1950), corporation giving (1952), attitudes towards giving (1953), philanthropic foundations (1956), and government policies towards philanthropy (1968). Andrews also edited the first Foundation Directory (1967), founding editor of Foundation News, and was the first director of the [[Foundation Center]] (formerly the "Foundation Library Center"). 

Following a series of congressional investigations of foundations and "other tax-exempt entities," Andrews persuaded the Sage Foundation to sponsor a conference intended to encourage major scholars to study philanthropy. The conference, which convened in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] in 1956, became the basis for funding work by a number of influential historians, most notably the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]'s [[Merle Curti]]. One of the leaders of the new interdisciplinary field, [[American Studies]], Curti was well positioned to identify likely candidates for support in their studies of philanthropy. Curti and his students produced a number of pioneering studies, including books on international philanthropy (1963), philanthropy and higher education (1965), and the history of charities law (1961).

The enormous proliferation of foundations and other tax-exempt entities in the decades after the second World War helped to fuel new congressional concern about their power, wealth, and impact on national tax policy. Congressional concern pressured the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to review their policies towards these organizations. These concerns came to a head in debates over tax reform in 1969.

In the face of shocking abuses, leaders of organized philanthropy proved to be scandalously ineffective in defending themselves. In particular, they appeared to be completely unable to grasp the extent to which policy discourse had come to be framed by the language of law and economics. In the wake of the draconian provisions of the [[1969 Tax Reform Act]], a handful of philanthropy's leaders initiated efforts to produce a body of academic research with which the nation's tax-exempt industries could more effectively defend themselves against outburst of regulatory enthusiasm.

Three groups took the lead in endeavoring to develop serious research on philanthropy, voluntary organizations, and related entities and activities.  One, the 501(c)3 group, was a loose network of members of the tax-exempt bar, government officials, and foundation executives who regularly circulated among themselves information on  policy and legislation relating to nonprofits. A second was a cluster of consultants and experts attached to [[John D. Rockefeller 3rd]], the Rockefeller brother who had embraced philanthropy and its future as his calling. A third was an association of scholars and practitioners, the Association of Voluntary Action Scholars, organized by sociologist David Horton Smith, which evolved into the [[Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action|Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action (ARNOVA)]].

'''Nutrition and pregnancy''' refers to the nutrient intake, and dietary planning that is undertaken before, during and after pregnancy. Nutrition of the fetus begins at conception. For this reason, the nutrition of the mother is important from before conception (probably several months before) as well as throughout pregnancy and breast feeding. An ever-increasing number of studies have shown that the nutrition of the mother will have an effect on the child, up to and including the risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes throughout life.

An inadequate or excessive amount of some nutrients may cause malformations or medical problems in the fetus, and neurological disorders and handicaps are a risk that is run by mothers who are malnourished.&lt;ref name="mary_e_barasi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barasi EM |year=2003 |title=Human Nutrition - A Health Perspective |location=London |publisher=Arnold |isbn=0-340-81025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 24% of babies worldwide are born with lower than optimal weights at birth due to lack of proper nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/nutrition/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; 10 facts on nutrition |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2011-03-15 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal habits such as consumption of alcohol or large amounts of caffeine can negatively and irreversibly affect the development of the baby, which happens in the early stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Riley&gt;{{cite book|title=Pregnancy: The Ultimate Week-by-Week Pregnancy Guide|publisher=Meredith Books|isbn=0-696-22221-3|pages=21–22| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7BKtTKqAQcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pregnancy+books&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_B58Tv6iCYO3rAeuvbT0Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pregnancy%20books&amp;f=false|author=Riley L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caffeine]] consumption during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss.&lt;ref name=Chen2016/&gt; The available research favors the notion that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweigh the risks; however, the type of fish is important.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Folic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin folate, is critical both in pre-and peri-conception.&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt; 

==Nutrition before pregnancy==

As with most diets, there are chances of over-supplementing, however, as general advice, both state and medical recommendations are that mothers follow instructions listed on particular vitamin packaging as to the correct or recommended daily allowance (RDA). Daily prenatal use of iron substantially improves birth weight, potentially reducing the risk of [[Low birth weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Haider, BA, Olofin, I, Wang, M|title= Anaemia, prenatal iron use, and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=21| year=2013|doi=10.1136/bmj.f3443|display-authors=etal| pages=f3443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Folic acid]] supplementation is recommended prior to conception, to prevent development of [[spina bifida]] and other [[neural tube defect]]s.

* [[Vitamin D]] levels vary with exposure to sunlight. While it was assumed that supplementation was necessary only in areas of high latitudes, recent studies of Vitamin D levels throughout the United States and many other countries have shown a large number of women with low levels.

* [[Iron]] is needed for the healthy growth of the fetus and placenta, especially during the second and third trimesters.  It is also essential before pregnancy for the production of hemoglobin.There is no evidence that a hemoglobin level of 7 grams/100 ml or higher is detrimental to pregnancy, but it must be acknowledged that maternal hemorrhage is a major source of maternal mortality worldwide, and a reserve capacity to carry oxygen is desirable. According to the Cochrane review conclusions iron supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anaemia and iron deficiency in pregnancy but the positive effect on other maternal and infant outcomes is less clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peña-Rosas|first=Juan Pablo|last2=De-Regil|first2=Luz Maria|last3=Garcia-Casal|first3=Maria N.|last4=Dowswell|first4=Therese|date=2015-07-22|title=Daily oral iron supplementation during pregnancy|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=7|pages=CD004736|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004736.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26198451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition during pregnancy==
The United States and the European Union have established vitamin and mineral recommendations for during pregnancy and lactation. The amounts in the table below are the higher of the two. The citations separately list recommendations for pregnancy and lactation. Recommendations (RDAs = Recommended Dietary Allowances and PRIs = Population Reference Intakes) are set higher than what has been determined to be average requirements so as to address women who have above average needs. For some nutrients there is not enough information to set a recommendation, so the term Adequate Intake (AI) is used based on what appears to be sufficient.&lt;ref name=DRITable /&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA-Recommended /&gt;

The American Academy of Pediatrics established a conservative set of recommendations in 2015: "During pregnancy:no amount of alcohol intake should be considered safe; there is no safe trimester to drink alcohol; all forms of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and liquor, pose similar risk; and binge drinking poses dose-related risk to the developing fetus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams JF, Smith VC |title=Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders |journal=Pediatrics |volume=136 |issue=5 |pages=e1395–e1406 |year=2015 |pmid=26482673 |doi=10.1542/peds.2015-3113 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that alcohol should be avoided entirely during pregnancy, given the relatively unknown effects of even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e88335.pdf |publisher=World Health Organisation |title=Framework for alcohol policy in the WHO European Region }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish and omega-3 fatty acids===
Fish consumption during pregnancy is encouraged by European,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=EFSA Dietetic Products|first=Nutrition, and Allergies (NDA)|date=2014-07-01|title=Scientific Opinion on health benefits of seafood (fish and shellfish) consumption in relation to health risks associated with exposure to methylmercury |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2014.3761/abstract|journal=EFSA Journal|language=en|volume=12|issue=7|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2014.3761|issn=1831-4732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55|title=Australian Dietary Guidelines (2013) {{!}} National Health and Medical Research Council|last=Council|first=National Health and Medical Research|date=2013-02-07|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/|title=2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines - health.gov|website=health.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason given is that fat-containing fish such as salmon and tuna contain [[eicosapentaenoic acid|eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]]. These are termed long chain, [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]], [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]], and are considered as important for fetal neurodevelopment.&lt;ref name=Starling2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Starling|first=Phoebe|last2=Charlton|first2=Karen|last3=McMahon|first3=Anne T.|last4=Lucas|first4=Catherine|date=2015-03-18|title=Fish Intake during Pregnancy and Foetal Neurodevelopment—A Systematic Review of the Evidence|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/7/3/2001|journal=Nutrients|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=2001–2014|doi=10.3390/nu7032001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, fish are good sources of vitamins A, D, and B12, as well as the mineral iodine.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt;

Due to risks of heavy-metal toxicity on fetal neurodevelopment, many mothers are concerned about eating fish during pregnancy. Overall, current research favors the notion that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweigh the risks; however, the type of fish is important.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Current research suggests that 2-3 servings of low-methylmercury containing fish per week in pregnancy is both safe and beneficial.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Mercury accumulates in fish through their own diet ([[bioaccumulation]]). A general rule of thumb is that fish higher up on the food chain, and with longer life spans will contain higher levels of mercury. Fish lower on the food chain and with shorter life spans will have lower metal content. However, it is important to note that the bioaccumulation of metals in fish is also dependent on geographical location, so it is hard to make global recommendations on specific fish species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosch|first=Adina C|last2=O'Neill|first2=Bernadette|last3=Sigge|first3=Gunnar O|last4=Kerwath|first4=Sven E|last5=Hoffman|first5=Louwrens C|date=2016-01-15|title=Heavy metals in marine fish meat and consumer health: a review|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.7360/abstract|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|language=en|volume=96|issue=1|pages=32–48|doi=10.1002/jsfa.7360|issn=1097-0010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative to consuming fish is to use fish oil dietary supplements containing both EPA and DHA, or algae-derived DHA-only oils. The New York Times reported on a laboratory evaluation of 30 popular fish oil supplements. Some of those had less than the label claimed amounts of DHA. As for safety, "All of the products tested contained only very low levels of mercury, ranging from one to six parts per billion per serving. That range is far below the upper safety limit of 100 parts per billion set by the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s, an industry trade group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/whats-in-your-fish-oil-supplements/ |title=What’s in Your Fish Oil Supplements? |last=Conner |first=Anahad |date=22 January 2014 |website=The New York Times |access-date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folic acid ===
Folic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin [[folate]], is critical both in pre-and peri-conception.&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt; Deficiencies in folic acid may cause [[neural tube defects]] (NTDs). Women who had 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg of folic acid in their systems due to supplementing 3 months before childbirth significantly reduced the risk of NTDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recommendations {{!}} Folic Acid {{!}} NCBDDD {{!}} CDC|url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/recommendations.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80 countries use [[Food fortification|fortification of certain foods]] with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wald NJ, Morris JK, Blakemore C |title=Public health failure in the prevention of neural tube defects: time to abandon the tolerable upper intake level of folate |journal=Public Health Rev |volume=39 |issue= |pages=2 |date=2018 |pmid=29450103 |pmc=5809909 |doi=10.1186/s40985-018-0079-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamins C and E===
The combination of vitamin E and vitamin C supplemented to pregnant women does not appear to be efficacious for reducing risk of [[stillbirth]], [[neonatal death]], [[preterm birth]], [[preeclampsia]] or any other maternal or infant outcomes, either in healthy women or those considered at risk for pregnancy complications.&lt;ref name="Rumbold2015" /&gt; Antioxidant vitamins as dietary supplements had been proposed as having benefits if consumed during pregnancy.

==Nutrition after pregnancy==
Proper nutrition is important after delivery to help the mother recover, and to provide enough food energy and nutrients for a woman to [[Breastfeeding|breastfeed]] her child. Women having serum [[ferritin]] less than 70&amp;nbsp;µg/L may need [[iron]] supplements to prevent [[iron deficiency anaemia]] during pregnancy and postpartum.&lt;ref name="pmid16733739"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milman N, Byg KE, Bergholt T, Eriksen L, Hvas AM |title=Body iron and individual iron prophylaxis in pregnancy--should the iron dose be adjusted according to serum ferritin? |journal=Ann.

During lactation, water intake may need to be increased. Human milk is made of 88% water, and the IOM recommends that breastfeeding women increase their water intake by about 300 mL/day to a total volume of 3000 mL/day (from food and drink);  approximately 2,400 mL/day from fluids.&lt;ref name="IOM"/&gt;

'''Operations security''' ('''OPSEC''') is a process that identifies critical information to determine if friendly actions can be observed by enemy intelligence, determines if information obtained by adversaries could be interpreted to be useful to them, and then executes selected measures that eliminate or reduce adversary exploitation of friendly critical information.

[[File:"WAAC - SILENCE MEANS SECURITY" - NARA - 515987.tif|thumb|[[Women's Army Corps]] anti-rumor propaganda (1941–1945)]]
In a more general sense, OPSEC is the process of protecting individual pieces of data that could be grouped together to give the bigger picture (called aggregation). OPSEC is the protection of critical information deemed mission essential from military commanders, senior leaders, management or other decision-making bodies. The process results in the development of [[countermeasures]], which include technical and non-technical measures such as the use of [[email encryption]] software, taking precautions against eavesdropping, paying close attention to a picture you have taken (such as items in the background), or not talking openly on [[social media]] sites about information on the unit, activity or organization's Critical Information List.

The term "operations security" was coined by the [[United States military]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

[[File:OPSEC alert -- What is social engineering....jpg|thumb|[[Social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] is the art of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information, rather than by breaking in or using technical cracking techniques]]

==Process ==
OPSEC is a five-step iterative process that assists an organization in identifying specific pieces of information requiring protection and employing measures to protect them. 
# Identification of Critical information: Critical information is information about friendly intentions, capabilities and activities that allow an adversary to plan effectively to disrupt their operations. U.S. Army Regulation 530-1 has redefined Critical Information into four broad categories, using the acronym CALI – Capabilities, Activities, Limitations (including vulnerabilities), and Intentions.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/ar530-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This step results in the creation of a Critical Information List (CIL). This allows the organization to focus resources on vital information, rather than attempting to protect all classified or sensitive unclassified information. Critical information may include, but is not limited to, military deployment schedules, internal organizational information, details of security measures, etc.
# Analysis of Threats: A Threat comes from an adversary – any individual or group that may attempt to disrupt or compromise a friendly activity. Threat is further divided into adversaries with intent and capability. The greater the combined intent and capability of the adversary, the greater the threat. This step uses multiple sources, such as intelligence activities, law enforcement, and [[Open source intelligence|open source information]] to identify likely adversaries to a planned operation and prioritize their degree of threat.
# Analysis of Vulnerabilities: Examining each aspect of the planned operation to identify OPSEC indicators that could reveal critical information and then comparing those indicators with the adversary's intelligence collection capabilities identified in the previous action. Threat can be thought of as the strength of the adversaries, while vulnerability can be thought of as the weakness of friendly organizations. 
# Assessment of Risk: First, planners analyze the vulnerabilities identified in the previous action and identify possible OPSEC measures for each vulnerability. Second, specific OPSEC measures are selected for execution based upon a risk assessment done by the commander and staff. Risk is calculated based on the probability of Critical Information release and the impact if such as release occurs. Probability is further subdivided into the level of threat and the level of vulnerability. The core premise of the subdivision is that the probability of compromise is greatest when the threat is very capable and dedicated, while friendly organizations are simultaneously exposed. 
# Application of Appropriate OPSEC Measures:  The command implements the OPSEC measures selected in the assessment of risk action or, in the case of planned future operations and activities, includes the measures in specific OPSEC plans. Countermeasures must be continually monitored to ensure that they continue to protect current information against relevant threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Operations Security Professional's Association |title=The OPSEC Process |url=http://www.opsecprofessionals.org/process.html |accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Army Regulation 530-1&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/ar530-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; refers to "Measures" as the overarching term, with categories of "Action Control" (controlling one's own actions); "Countermeasures" (countering adversary intelligence collection); and "Counteranalysis" (creating difficulty for adversary analysts seeking to predict friendly intent) as tools to help an OPSEC professional protect Critical Information. 
&lt;br&gt;
An OPSEC Assessment is the formal application of this process to an existing operation or activity by a multidisciplinary team of experts. These assessments identify the requirements for additional OPSEC measures and required changes to existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iad.gov/ioss/department/opsec-glossary-of-terms-10026.cfm#o|title=OPSEC Glossary of Terms|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Interagency OPSEC Support Staff|access-date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, OPSEC planners, working closely with Public Affairs personnel, must develop the Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFI) used to preclude inadvertent public disclosure of critical or sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_61.pdf|title=Joint Operation Planning Process and Public Affairs Actions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)|access-date=June 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808143224/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_61.pdf|archive-date=2016-08-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "EEFI" is being phased out in favor of "Critical Information", so all affected agencies use the same term, minimizing confusion.

==History==

=== Vietnam ===
In 1966, United States [[U. S. Grant Sharp Jr.|Admiral Ulysses Sharp]] established a multidisciplinary security team to investigate the failure of certain combat operations at the [[Vietnam War]]. This operation was dubbed Operation Purple Dragon, and included personnel from the [[National Security Agency]] and the Department of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iad.gov/iad/news/purple-dragon-the-formations-of-opsec.cfm|title=PURPLE DRAGON: The Formations of OPSEC|last=|first=|date=|website=Information Assurance Directorate|publisher=National Security Agency|access-date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the operation concluded, the Purple Dragon team codified their recommendations. They called the process "Operations Security" in order to distinguish the process from existing processes and ensure continued inter-agency support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opsecprofessionals.org/origin.html|title=The Origin of OPSEC- from the dragon's mouth|website=www.opsecprofessionals.org|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NSDD 298 ===
In 1988, President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 298. This document established the National Operations Security Program and named the Director of the National Security Agency as the executive agent for inter-agency OPSEC support. This document also established the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iad.gov/ioss/department/about-the-ioss-10019.cfm|title=About the IOSS|last=|first=|date=|website=National OPSEC Program|publisher=Interagency OPSEC Support Staff|access-date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International and private sector application ==
Although originally developed as a US Military methodology, Operations Security has been adopted worldwide for both military and private sector operations.  
In 1992, the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]] added OPSEC to its glossary of terms and definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/aap6/AAP-6.pdf|title=NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions|last=|first=|date=|website=AAP-6|publisher=NATO|access-date=June 16, 2016}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[private sector]] has also adopted OPSEC as a defensive measure against [[competitive intelligence]] collection efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Competitive Intelligence|last=Kahaner|first=Larry|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=252–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military and private sector security and information firms often require OPSEC professionals. Certification is often initially obtained from military or governmental organizations, such as:&lt;br&gt;

=== Patient portraits ===
[[File:Portrait_of_a_patient,_Surrey_County_Asylum_(8408235730).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Portrait_of_a_patient,_Surrey_County_Asylum_(8408235730).jpg|thumb|Portrait of a patient, Surrey County Asylum]]
In 1856, only a couple of decades after photography began, [[Hugh Welch Diamond|Hugh W. Diamond]], a [[psychiatrist]] at the [[Springfield University Hospital|Surrey Asylum]] in Surrey County, England began taking photographs of his patients to aid in [[Diagnosis|diagnosing]] and [[Treatment of mental disorders|treating]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/a-z-photography-collection-hugh-welch-diamond/|title=D is for… Dr. Hugh Welch Diamond: Photography and the pseudoscience of physiognomy|work=National Science and Media Museum blog|access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/283091|title=Hugh Welch Diamond {{!}} Patient, Surrey County Lunatic Asylum {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/1805/hugh-welch-diamond-british-1809-1886/|title=Hugh Welch Diamond (British, 1809–1886) (Getty Museum)|website=The J. Paul Getty in Los Angeles|access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cvltnation.com/portraits-of-insanity-the-photos-of-dr-hugh-welch-diamond/|title=Portraits of Insanity The Photos of Dr. Hugh Welch Diamond -|date=7 November 2014|work=CVLT Nation|access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the portraits contained more information about his patients' levels of [[emotion]] than [[language]], [[definition]]s, or [[classification]]s, they helped with more accurate diagnoses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, [[Psychological pain|mental suffering]] can be categorized under vague terms such as [[Distress (medicine)|distress]], [[Sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], [[grief]], melancholy, [[anguish]], and [[Depression (mood)|despair]], but a photograph speaks for itself, precisely identifying where the patient is on the scale of unhappiness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In sharing these portraits with the patients' themselves, Diamond found that the portraits can produce a positive effect on the patients, especially if successive portraits illustrate their progress to recovery.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One [[case study]] conducted by Diamond revealed how a patient's portraits helped lead to a [[cure]] through providing an attainable outside perspective of reality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The patient [[Suffering|suffered]] from [[delusion]]s which consisted of supposed possession of great wealth and holding status of being a [[Queen regnant|Queen]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In seeing her portraits and her frequent conversations about them with her therapist, she was able to gradually let go of her former imagined status.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In addition to helping diagnose and treat his patients, Diamond also suggested that these portraits could help in protection and clear representation of patients in case of readmission; similarly to how [[mug shot]]s are helpful for prisons with improving certainty of previous conviction and in recapturing someone who might have escaped.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Personal photographs ===
'''Photoanalysis,''' proposed by Robert U. Akeret, is the study of [[body language]] in personal photographs (e.g. family photographs) to increase [[self-awareness]], better understand [[interpersonal relationship]]s, and more accurately [[Recall (memory)|recollect]] past [[Episodic memory|episodic events]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saffady|first=William|date=October 1974|title=Manuscripts and Psychohistory|url=http://www.americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.37.4.234216kt88624n30|journal=The American Archivist|pages=559|via=The American Archivist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://truecenterpublishing.com/photopsy/people_pics.htm|title=Photographic Psychology: Interpreting People Pics|website=''truecenterpublishing.com''|access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Phototherapy''', like photoanalysis, is a therapeutic technique which analyzes personal photographs and the [[feeling]]s, [[thought]]s, [[Memory|memories]], and [[Association (psychology)|associations]] these photos evoke, as a way to deepen [[insight]] and enhance communication during therapy session.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artsintherapy.com/what-is-phototherapy/|title=What is PhotoTherapy? {{!}} Arts in Therapy Network|website=www.artsintherapy.com|access-date=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, phototherapy is being practiced by Judy Weiser in [[Vancouver]], Canada in the PhotoTherapy Center.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phototherapy-centre.com/about-judy-weiser/|title=Judy Weiser|date=2 July 2014|work=PhotoTherapy &amp; Therapeutic Photography Techniques|access-date=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ambiguous photographs ===
'''Walker Visuals,''' four 13" x 19" color, ambiguous, abstract, [[dream]]like, and evocative photographs, were created by psychiatrist and photographer, Joel Walker.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Nellie|date=Spring 2002|title=A Picture Unleashes a Thousand Words|url=https://phototherapytherapeuticphotography.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/a_picture_unleashes_a_thousand_words_j-walker_2002.pdf|journal=MEDHUNTERS magazine|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zakia|first=Richard|year=2003|title=Perception and Imaging: The Walker Visuals|url=http://masteringphoto.com/the-walker-visuals/|journal=Perception and Imaging: Photography–A Way of Seeing|volume=4|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joelwalker.com/|title=Joel Walker, photographer, Psychiatrist|website=''joelwalker.com''|access-date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to the [[Rorschach test]], what is perceived when looking at these photographs depends on one's own history, expectations, [[need]]s, [[belief]]s, feelings, and what happened just before viewing the image.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Walker created these images after observing how his patients responded to strange photos he had taken and displayed on his office wall.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; From there, Walker expended his collection to include a range of themes from positive to negative.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The images act as representations of his patient's inner world which allow them to better verbalize feelings and memories.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Walker visuals can be used universally across culture, language, [[Educational stage|education]], and [[Socioeconomic status|class]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Photographers' photographs ===
'''Reading Pictures''' is the study of photographs as reflections of the makers' personal, [[Qualia|subjective experiences]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Morgovsky, a pioneer in Reading Pictures, established six fundamental [[mindset]]s needed for Reading Pictures:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://andradamihailescu-mpp.blogspot.com/2013/04/joel-morgovsky-reading-pictures.html|title=Major Practical Project – Hodie Sum: Joel Morgovsky – Reading Pictures|last=Mihailescu|first=Andrada|website=Major Practical Project – Hodie Sum|access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Overcoming The Illusion of Reality (OTIR):'' Understand that photographs are [[Two-dimensional space|2D]] [[Representation (arts)|representations]], rather than reality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# ''The Rule of No [[Accident]]s (RNA):'' Everything in a photograph is there on [[purpose]]; created when one makes the decision to expose a moment in time as a representation of a conscious experience.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# ''Free Association (FA):'' An [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] of [[Openness to experience|openness]] to projected, emotional content of photograph.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# ''Attribution Process (AP):'' Guess the cause of observed behavior; ask questions like: "What does it mean that this person would take this particular photograph, of this subject matter, from this point of view, using these methods?".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This mindset was proposed by Fritz Heider and Harold Kelley.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
# ''Thematic Analysis (TA):'' Analyze [[Cognition|cognitive]] and emotional themes that run through collections of work to construct a working model of the photographer's experiential world.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# ''Genre and Skill Level (GSL):'' Take into consideration genre and skill level.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 
#* Examples of genre include [[landscape]], [[Still life|still-life]], [[portrait]]ure, documentary, straight, surreal, etc.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 
#* Skill level can be classified along levels of articulation (LOA):&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
#** &lt;u&gt;[[Innocence|Innocent]] Photographers:&lt;/u&gt; camera owners who take pictures on an irregular basis for chronicling family events, [[vacation]]s, and special moments.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They do not consider themselves photographers beyond a functional level and articulate themselves the least, but Reading Pictures can still be applied on the work innocents.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
#** &lt;u&gt;Amateur Photographers:&lt;/u&gt; people who enjoy photography, join photography societies, and obtain new and updated cameras, lenses, light sources, etc.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; These photographers are less personally expressive, since they are often [[Artistic inspiration|inspired]] to [[Imitation|imitate]] work of other photographers they [[Admiration|admire]], and are masked by attempting to master a technical skill.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
#** &lt;u&gt;[[Expert|Mature]] Photographers:&lt;/u&gt; photographers that consciously use the medium as [[Creativity|creative]] self-expression; they developed their own ways of seeing through the lens and have their own personal style, which is consistent through most of their work.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This group is the most articulate, so reading a few photos of theirs can provide insight into their personal cognitive and emotional experience.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3733">In [[computability theory]], a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[natural number]]s is called '''recursive''', '''computable''' or '''decidable''' if there is an [[algorithm]] which takes a number as input, terminates after a finite amount of time (possibly depending on the given number) and correctly decides whether the number belongs to the set.

A more general class of sets consists of the [[recursively enumerable set]]s, also called '''semidecidable''' sets.  For these sets, it is only required that there is an algorithm that correctly decides when a number ''is'' in the set; the algorithm may give no answer (but not the wrong answer) for numbers not in the set.

A set which is not computable is called '''noncomputable''' or '''undecidable'''.

==Formal definition==

A subset {{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;}} of the [[natural number]]s is called '''recursive''' if there exists a [[total function|total]] [[computable function]] {{math|''f'' }} such that 
{{math|''f''(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;) {{=}} 1 }} if {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; &amp;isin; &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; }} and {{math|''f''(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;) {{=}} 0 }} if {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; &amp;notin; &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; }}.  In other words, the set {{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;}} is recursive [[if and only if]] the [[indicator function]] {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[computable function|computable]].

==Examples==

*Every finite or [[cofinite]] subset of the natural numbers is computable. This includes these special cases:
**The [[empty set]] is computable.
**The entire set of natural numbers is computable.
**Each natural number ([[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers#The contemporary standard|as defined in standard set theory]]) is computable; that is, the set of natural numbers less than a given natural number is computable.
*The set of [[prime number]]s is computable.
*A [[recursive language]] is a recursive subset of a [[formal language]].
*The set of Gödel numbers of arithmetic proofs described in Kurt Gödel's paper "On formally undecidable propositions of Principia Mathematica and related systems I" is computable; see [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

==Properties==

If ''A'' is a recursive set then the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''A'' is a recursive set. If ''A'' and ''B'' are recursive sets then ''A'' ∩ ''B'', ''A'' ∪ ''B'' and the image of ''A'' &amp;times; ''B'' under the [[Cantor pairing function]] are recursive sets.

A set ''A'' is a recursive set [[if and only if]] ''A'' and the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''A'' are both [[recursively enumerable set]]s. The [[preimage]] of a recursive set under a [[total function|total]] [[computable function]] is a recursive set. The image of a computable set under a total computable [[bijection]] is computable.

A set is recursive if and only if it is at level {{math| &amp;Delta;{{su|p=0|b=1}} }} of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

A set is recursive if and only if it is either the range of a nondecreasing total computable function or the empty set. The image of a computable set under a nondecreasing total computable function is computable.

'''Rudolf Carnap''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|n|æ|p}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/carnap "Carnap"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈkaɐ̯naːp|lang}}; May 18, 1891 – September 14, 1970) was a German-born [[philosopher]] who was active in Europe before 1935 and in the United States thereafter. He was a major member of the [[Vienna Circle]] and an [[advocate]] of [[logical positivism]].  He is considered "one of the giants among twentieth-century philosophers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb6h4nb3q7&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00004&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id= California Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
[[File:Wuppertal Ronsdorf - Villa Carnap 01 ies.jpg|thumb|Carnap's birthplace in Wuppertal]]
Carnap's father had risen from the status of a poor ribbon-weaver to become the owner of a ribbon-making factory. His mother came from academic stock; her father was an educational reformer and her oldest brother was the archaeologist [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]]. As a ten-year-old, Carnap accompanied his uncle on an expedition to Greece.&lt;ref name=DCDVlife&gt;{{cite book|last=Quine, W.V. and Rudolf Carnap|title=Dear Carnap, Dear Van: The Quine-Carnap Correspondence and Related Work|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap was raised in a religious family, but later became an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"Carnap had a modest but deeply religious family background, which might explain why, although he later became an atheist, he maintained a respectful and tolerant attitude in matters of faith throughout his life." Buldt, Bernd: "Carnap, Paul Rudolf", Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography Vol. 20 p.43. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his formal education at the [[Barmen]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]. From 1910 to 1914, he attended the [[University of Jena]], intending to write a thesis in [[physics]]. But he also studied carefully [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' during a course taught by [[Bruno Bauch]], and was one of very few students to attend [[Gottlob Frege]]'s courses in [[mathematical logic]]. While Carnap held moral and political opposition to [[World War I]], he felt obligated to serve in the German army. After three years of service, he was given permission to study physics at the [[University of Berlin]], 1917–18, where [[Albert Einstein]] was a newly appointed professor. Carnap then attended the [[University of Jena]], where he wrote a thesis defining an [[axiom|axiomatic theory]] of [[space]] and [[time]]. The physics department said it was too philosophical, and Bruno Bauch of the philosophy department said it was pure physics. Carnap then wrote another thesis in 1921, with Bauch's supervision, on the theory of space in a more orthodox [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian style, and published as ''Der Raum'' (''Space'') in a supplemental issue of ''[[Kant-Studien]]'' (1922). 

Frege's course exposed him to [[Bertrand Russell]]'s work on logic and philosophy, which put a sense of the aims to his studies. He accepted the effort to surpass traditional philosophy with logical innovations that inform the sciences. He wrote a letter to Russell, who responded by copying by hand long passages from his ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' for Carnap's benefit, as neither Carnap nor his university could afford a copy of this epochal work. In 1924 and 1925, he attended seminars led by [[Edmund Husserl]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. W., and Thomasson, Amie L. (eds.), 2005, ''Phenomenology and Philosophy of Mind''. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, p. 8 n. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and continued to write on physics from a [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] perspective.

Carnap discovered a kindred spirit when he met [[Hans Reichenbach]] at a 1923 conference. Reichenbach introduced Carnap to [[Moritz Schlick]], a professor at the [[University of Vienna]] who offered Carnap a position in his department, which Carnap accepted in 1926. Carnap thereupon joined an informal group of Viennese intellectuals that came to be known as the [[Vienna Circle]], directed largely by [[Moritz Schlick]] and including [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[Herbert Feigl]], with occasional visits by Hahn's student [[Kurt Gödel]]. When [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] visited Vienna, Carnap would meet with him. He (with Hahn and Neurath) wrote the 1929 manifesto of the Circle, and (with [[Hans Reichenbach]]) initiated the philosophy journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]''.

In February 1930 [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] lectured in Vienna, and during November 1930 Carnap visited Warsaw. On these occasions he learned much about Tarski's [[model theory|model theoretic]] method of [[semantics]]. [[Rose Rand]], another philosopher in the Vienna Circle, noted, "Carnap's conception of semantics starts from the basis given in Tarski's work but a distinction is made between logical and non-logical constants and between logical and factual truth... At the same time he worked with the concepts of intension and extension and took these two concepts as a basis of a new method of semantics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rand|first=Rose|title=Reading Notes and Summaries on Works by Rudolph Carnap, 1932 and Undated|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/u/ulsmanuscripts/pdf/31735061817825.pdf|work=Rose Rand Papers|publisher=Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Carnap was appointed Professor at the German [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]]. In 1933, [[W. V. Quine]] met Carnap in Prague and discussed the latter's work at some length. Thus began the lifelong mutual respect these two men shared, one that survived Quine's eventual forceful disagreements with a number of Carnap's philosophical conclusions.

Carnap, whose [[socialism|socialist]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]] beliefs put him at risk in Nazi Germany, emigrated to the United States in 1935 and became a [[naturalized citizen]] in 1941. Meanwhile, back in Vienna, [[Moritz Schlick]] was murdered in 1936. From 1936 to 1952, Carnap was a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]]. During the late 1930s, Carnap offered an assistant position in philosophy to [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], who accepted and became one of his most significant intellectual collaborator. Thanks partly to Quine's help, Carnap spent the years 1939–41 at Harvard, where he was reunited with Tarski. Carnap (1963) later expressed some irritation about his time at Chicago, where he and [[Charles W. Morris]] were the only members of the department committed to the primacy of science and logic. (Their Chicago colleagues included [[Richard McKeon]], [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Charles Hartshorne]], and Manley Thompson.) Carnap's years at Chicago were nonetheless very productive ones. He wrote books on [[semantics]] (Carnap 1942, 1943, 1956), [[modal logic]], and on the philosophical foundations of [[probability]] and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] (Carnap 1950, 1952).

After a stint at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], he joined the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|philosophy department at UCLA]] in 1954, [[Hans Reichenbach]] having died the previous year. He had earlier refused an offer of a similar job at the [[University of California]], because accepting that position required that he sign a [[loyalty oath]], a practice to which he was opposed on principle. While at [[UCLA]], he wrote on scientific knowledge, the [[analytic statement|analytic]] – [[synthetic statement|synthetic]] dichotomy, and the [[verification principle]]. His writings on [[thermodynamics]] and on the foundations of probability and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], were published posthumously as Carnap (1971, 1977, 1980).

Carnap taught himself [[Esperanto]] when he was 14 years of age, and remained sympathetic to it (Carnap 1963). He later attended the [[World Congress of Esperanto]] in 1908 and 1922, and employed the language while traveling.

Carnap had four children by his first marriage to Elizabeth Schöndube, which ended in divorce in 1929. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Ina Stöger, in 1933.&lt;ref name=DCDVlife /&gt; Ina committed suicide in 1964.

== Topics in the development of Carnap's philosophy ==
Below is an examination of the main topics in the evolution of the philosophy of Rudolf Carnap. It is not exhaustive, but it outlines Carnap’s main works and contributions to modern epistemology and philosophy of logic. 

=== PhD dissertation ===
From 1919 to 1921, Carnap worked on a doctoral thesis called “Der Raum. Ein Beitrag zur Wissenschaftslehre” (1922). In this dissertation on the philosophical foundations of geometry, Carnap tried to provide a logical basis for a theory of space and time in physics. Considering that Carnap was interested in pure mathematics, natural sciences and philosophy, his dissertation can be seen as an attempt to build a bridge between the different disciplines that are geometry, physics and philosophy. For Carnap thought that in many instances those disciplines use the same concepts, but with totally different meanings. The main objective of Carnap’s dissertation was to show that the inconsistencies between theories concerning space only existed because philosophers, as well as mathematicians and scientists, were talking about different things while using the same “space” word. Hence, Carnap characteristically argued that there had to be three separate notions of space. “Formal” space is space in the sense of mathematics: it is an abstract system of relations. “Intuitive” space is made of certain contents of intuition independent of single experiences. “Physical” space is made of actual spatial facts given in experience. The upshot is that those three kinds of “space” imply three different kinds of knowledge and thus three different kinds of investigations. It is interesting to note that it is in this dissertation that the main themes of Carnap’s philosophy appear, most importantly the idea that many philosophical contradictions appear because of a misuse of language, and a stress on the importance of distinguishing formal and material modes of speech.  

=== ''Der Logische Aufbau der Welt'' ===
From 1922 to 1925, Carnap worked on a book which became one of his major works, namely ''Der logische Aufbau der Welt'' (1928) (translated as “The logical structure of the world”, 1967). That achievement has become a landmark in modern epistemology and can be read as a forceful statement of the philosophical thesis of logical positivism. Indeed, the Aufbau suggests that epistemology, based on modern symbolic logic, is concerned with the logical analysis of scientific propositions, while science itself, based on experience, is the only source of knowledge of the external world, i.e. the world outside the realm of human perception. According to Carnap, philosophical propositions are statements about the language of science; they aren’t true or false, but merely consist of definitions and conventions about the use of certain concepts. In contrast, scientific propositions are factual statements about the external reality. They are meaningful because they are based on the perceptions of the senses. In other words, the truth or falsity of those propositions can be verified by testing their content with further observations.  

In the Aufbau, Carnap wants to display the logical and conceptual structure with which all scientific (factual) statements can be organized. Carnap gives the label “constitutional” to this epistemic-logical project. It is a constructive undertaking that systematizes scientific knowledge according to the notions of symbolic logic. Accordingly, the purpose of this constitutional system is to identify and discern different classes of scientific concepts and to specify the logical relations that link them. In the Aufbau, concepts are taken to denote objects, relations, properties, classes and states. Carnap argues that all concepts must be ranked over a hierarchy. In that hierarchy, all concepts are organized according to a fundamental arrangement where concepts can be reduced and converted to other basic ones. Carnap explains that a concept can be reduced to another when all sentences containing the first concept can be transformed into sentences containing the other. In other words, every scientific sentence should be translatable into another sentence such that the original terms have the same reference as the translated terms. Most significantly, Carnap argues that the basis of this system is psychological. Its content is the “immediately given”, which is made of basic elements, namely perceptual experiences. These basic elements consist of conscious psychological states of a single human subject. In the end, Carnap argues that his constitutional project demonstrates the possibility of defining and uniting all scientific concepts in a single conceptual system on the basis of a few fundamental concepts.    

=== Overcoming metaphysics ===
From 1928 to 1934, Carnap published papers (''Scheinprobleme in der Philosophie,'' 1928 – translated as “Pseudoproblems in Philosophy”, 1967) in which he appears overtly skeptical of the aims and methods of metaphysics, i.e. the traditional philosophy that finds its roots in mythical and religious thought. Indeed, he discusses how, in many cases, metaphysics is made of meaningless discussions of pseudo-problems. For Carnap, a pseudo-problem is a philosophical question which, on the surface, handles concepts that refer to our world while, in fact, these concepts do not actually denote real and attested objects. In other words, these pseudo-problems concern statements that do not, in any way, have empirical implications. They do not refer to states of affairs and the things they denote cannot be perceived. Consequently, one of Carnap’s main aim has been to redefine the purpose and method of philosophy. According to him, philosophy should not aim at producing any knowledge transcending the knowledge of science. In contrast, by analyzing the language and propositions of science, philosophers should define the logical foundations of scientific knowledge. Using symbolic logic, they should explicate the concepts, methods and justificatory processes that exist in science. 

Carnap believed that the difficulty with traditional philosophy lied in the use of concepts that are not useful for science. For Carnap, the scientific legitimacy of these concepts was doubtful, because the sentences containing them do not express facts. Indeed, a logical analysis of those sentences proves that they do not convey the meaning of states of affairs. In other words, theses sentences are meaningless. Carnap explains that to be meaningful, a sentence should be factual. It can be so, for one thing, by being based on experience, i.e. by being formulated with words relating to direct observations. For another, a sentence is factual if one can clearly state what are the observations that could confirm or disconfirm that sentence. After all, Carnap presupposes a specific criterion of meaning, namely the wittgensteinian principle of verifiability. Indeed, he requires, as a precondition of meaningfulness, that all sentences be verifiable, what implies that a sentence is meaningful only if there is a way to verify if it is true or false. To verify a sentence, one needs to expound the empirical conditions and circumstances that would establish the truth of the sentence. As a result, it is clear for Carnap that metaphysical sentences are meaningless. They include concepts like “god”, “soul” and “the absolute” that transcend experience and cannot be traced back or connected to direct observations. Because those sentences cannot be verified in any way, Carnap suggests that science, as well as philosophy, should neither consider nor contain them. 

=== The logical analysis of language ===
At that point in his career, Carnap attempted to develop a full theory of the logical structure of scientific language. This theory, exposed in ''Logische Syntax der Sprache'' (1934) (translated as “The logical syntax of language”, 1937) gives the foundations to his idea that scientific language has a specific formal structure and that its signs are governed by the rules of deductive logic. Moreover, the theory of logical syntax expounds a method with which one can talk about a language: it is a formal meta-theory about the pure forms of language. In the end, because Carnap argues that philosophy aims at the logical analysis of the language of science and thus is the logic of science, the theory of the logical syntax can be considered as a definite language and a conceptual framework for philosophy. 

The logical syntax of language is a formal theory. It is not concerned with the contextualized meaning or the truth-value of sentences. In contrast, it considers the general structure of a given language and explores the different structural relations that connect the elements of that language. Hence, by explaining the different operations that allow specific transformations within the language, the theory is a systematic exposition of the rules that operate within that language. In fact, the basic function of these rules is to provide the principles to safeguard coherence, to avoid contradictions and to deduce justified conclusions. It is to be noted that Carnap sees language as a calculus. This calculus is a systematic arrangement of symbols and relations. The symbols of the language are organized according to the class they belong to and it is through their combination that we can form sentences. The relations are different conditions under which a sentence can be said to follow, or to be the consequence, of another sentence. The definitions included in the calculus state the conditions under which a sentence can be considered of a certain type and how those sentences can be transformed. We can see the logical syntax as a method of formal transformation, i.e. a method for calculating and reasoning with symbols. 

It is in the ''logical syntax'' that Carnap introduces his notable principle of tolerance. This principle suggests that there is no moral in logic. When it comes to using a language, there is no good or bad, fundamentally true or false. In this perspective, the philosopher’s task is not to bring authoritative interdicts prohibiting the use of certain concepts. In contrast, philosophers should seek general agreements over the relevance of certain logical devices. According to Carnap, those agreements are possible only through the detailed presentation of the meaning and use of the expressions of a language. In other words, Carnap believes that every logical language is correct only if this language is supported by exact definitions and not by philosophical presumptions. It is to be noted that Carnap embraces a formal conventionalism. That implies that formal languages are constructed and that everyone is free to choose the language it finds more suited to his purpose. There should not be any controversy over which language is the correct language; what matters is agreeing over which language best suits a particular purpose. Carnap explains that the choice of a language should be guided according to the security it provides against logical inconsistency. Furthermore, practical elements like simplicity and fruitfulness in certain tasks influence the choice of a language. Clearly enough, the principle of tolerance was a sophisticated device introduced by Carnap to dismiss any form of dogmatism in philosophy.    

=== Inductive logic ===
After having considered problems in semantics, i.e. the theory of the concepts of meaning and truth (''Foundations of Logic and Mathematics,'' 1939; ''Introduction to Semantics,'' 1942; ''Formalization of Logic'', 1943), Carnap turned his attention to the subject of probability and inductive logic. His views on that subject are for the most part exposed in ''Logical foundations of probability'' (1950) where Carnap aims to give a sound logical interpretation of probability. Carnap thought that according to certain conditions, the concept of probability had to be interpreted as a purely logical concept. In this view, probability is a basic concept anchored in all inductive inferences, whereby the conclusion of every inference that holds without deductive necessity is said be more or less likely to be the case. In fact, Carnap claims that the problem of induction is a matter of finding a precise explanation of the logical relation that holds between a hypothesis and the evidence that supports it. An inductive logic is thus based on the idea that probability is a logical relation between two types of statements: the hypothesis (conclusion) and the premises (evidence). Accordingly, a theory of induction should explain how, by pure logical analysis, we can ascertain that certain evidence establishes a degree of confirmation strong enough to confirm a given hypothesis. 

Carnap was convinced that there was a logical as well as an empirical dimension in science. He believed that one had to isolate the experiential elements from the logical elements of a given body of knowledge. Hence, the empirical concept of frequency used in statistics to describe the general features of certain phenomena can be distinguished from the analytical concepts of probability logic that merely describe logical relations between sentences. For Carnap, the statistical and the logical concepts must be investigated separately. Having insisted on this distinction, Carnap defines two concepts of probability. The first one is logical and deals with the degree to which a given hypothesis is confirmed by a piece of evidence. It is the ''degree of confirmation''. The second is empirical, and relates to the long run rate of one observable feature of nature relative to another. It is the ''relative frequency.'' Statements belonging to the second concepts are about reality and describe states of affairs. They are empirical and, therefore, must be based on experimental procedures and the observation of relevant facts. On the contrary, statements belonging to the first concept do not say anything about facts. Their meaning can be grasped solely with an analysis of the signs they contain. They are analytical sentences, i.e. true by virtue of their logical meaning. Even though these sentences could refer to states of affairs, their meaning is given by the symbols and relations they contain. In other words, the probability of a conclusion is given by the logical relation it has to the evidence. The evaluation of the degree of confirmation of a hypothesis is thus a problem of meaning analysis. 

Clearly, the probability of a statement about relative frequency can be unknown; because it depends on the observation of certain phenomena, one may not possess the information needed to establish the value of that probability. Consequently, the value of that statement can be confirmed only if it is corroborated with facts. In contrast, the probability of a statement about the degree of confirmation could be unknown, in the sense that one may miss the correct logical method to evaluate its exact value. But, such a statement can always receive a certain logical value, given the fact that this value only depends on the meaning of its symbols.              

==Primary source materials==
The Carnap Papers consist of approximately 10,000 personal letters of correspondence. The papers were donated by his daughter, Hanna Carnap-Thost in 1974. Documents that contain financial, medical, and personal information are restricted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Guides to Archives and Manuscript Collections at the University of Pittsburgh Library System | accessdate = 2015-12-02  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were written over his entire life and career. Carnap used the mail regularly to discuss philosophical problems with hundreds of others. The most notable were: Herbert Feigl, Carl Gustav Hempel, Felix Kaufmann, Otto Neurath, and Moritz Schlick. Photographs are also part of the collection and were taken throughout his life. Family pictures and photographs of his peers and colleagues are also stored in the collection. Some of the correspondence is considered notable and consist of his student notes, his seminars with Frege, (describing the ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and the logic in mathematics). Carnap's notes from Russell's seminar in Chicago, and notes he took from discussions with Tarski, Heisenberg, Quine, Hempel, Gödel, Jeffrey are part of the University of Pittsburgh's Archives and Collections. Digitized contents include:

&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 1,000 pages of lecture outlines are preserved that cover the courses that Carnap taught in the United States, Prague, and Vienna, Prague. Drafts of his published works and unpublished works are part of the collection. includes manuscript drafts and typescripts both for his published works and for many unpublished papers and books. A partial listing include his first formulations of his "Aufbau". "Quasizerlegung"(1932), and "Vom Chaos zur Wirklichkeit"(1922) "Topologie der Raum-Zeit-Welt" (Topology of the Space-Time World, 1924) is his later 104-page piece about a logical reconstruction of the space-time framework without the use of mathematics. The holdings include a large number of unpublished papers.
Much material is written in an older German shorthand, the Stolze-Schrey system. He employed this writing system extensively beginning in his student days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Much of the content has been digitized. The University of California also maintains a collection of Rudolf Carnap Papers. Microfilm copies of his papers are maintained by the Philosophical Archives at the University of Konstanz in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Samuel Sinyangwe''' (born c. 1990) is an American [[Policy analysis|policy analyst]] and [[Racial equality|racial justice]] [[Activism|activist]]. Sinyangwe is a member of the [[Movement for Black Lives]] and a co-founder of We the Protestors, a group of digital tools that include Mapping Police Violence, a database of police killings in the [[United States]], and [[Campaign Zero]], a policy platform to end police violence. Sinyangwe is a co-host the [[Pod Save the People|''Pod Save the People'']] podcast, where he discusses the week's news with a panel of other activists.

== Early life ==
Sinyangwe was born circa 1990.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He grew up in [[College Park (Orlando)|College Park]] neighborhood of [[Orlando, Florida]] and attended [[Winter Park High School]] in the [[International Baccalaureate|International Baccalaureat]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e program.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cordeiro|first1=Monivette|title=How an Orlando data scientist is helping #BlackLivesMatter make the case against police violence|url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/how-an-orlando-data-scientist-is-helping-the-blacklivesmatter-movement-make-the-case-against-police-violence/Content?oid=2478826|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=Orlando Weekly|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has discussed the influence of his upbringing in Florida, where he was a black child often surrounded by white peers, on his eventual career trajectory; he was shaken and moved to action after the 2013 [[Trial of George Zimmerman|acquittal of George Zimmerman]] in the shooting death of [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|Trayvon Martin]] in [[Sanford, Florida]], where Sinyangwe had regularly attended soccer practice: "I was that kid. I could have been Trayvon. That’s why it hit me so personally and that’s why I realized that needed to be something that took the priority in terms of my focus."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Sinyangwe graduated from [[Stanford University]], where he studied how race intersects with American politics, economics, and class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marusic|first1=Kristina|title=This Map Of Police Violence Aims To Create A Path To Justice|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2133351/map-police-violence/|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=MTV News|date=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Sinyangwe started his career at PolicyLink with the Promise Neighborhoods Institute.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dHxqDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT476&amp;ots=ftZuIq_nxZ&amp;dq=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PT486#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge Handbook of Developments in Digital Journalism Studies|last=Richardson|first=Allissa V.|date=2018-09-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781351982085|editor-last=Eldrige II|editor-first=Scott|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=28.

Satellite crop monitoring technology allows to perform online crop monitoring on different fields, located in different areas, regions, even countries and on different continents. The technology's significant advantage is a high automation level of sown area condition and its interpretation in an interactive map which can be read by different groups of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.cropio.com/#top/|title=Cropio – Change the way of farming with Cropio|website=about.Cropio.com|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrium-geo.com/en/84-deimos-1-optical-satellite-imagery/|title=DMC Constellation : Airbus Defence and Space|website=www.Astrium-Geo.com|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precisionagriculture.com.au/|title=For Farmers - Precision Agriculture|website=www.PrecisionAgriculture.com.au|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science and technology studies''', or '''science, technology and society''' studies (both abbreviated '''STS''') is the study of how society, politics, and culture affect [[scientific research]] and technological [[innovation]], and how these, in turn, affect [[society]], [[politics]] and [[culture]].

==History==
Like most [[interdisciplinary]] programs, STS emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest—typically, during the 1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Bijker, W. E., Hughes, T. P., Pinch, T. and Douglas, D. G., ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology'', [[MIT Press]], Cambridge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although [[Ludwik Fleck]]'s (1935) monograph ''Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' anticipated many of STS's key themes.  In the 1970s [[Elting E. Morison]] founded the STS program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), which served as a model. By 2011, 111 STS research centres and academic programs were counted worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stswiki.org/index.php?title=Worldwide_directory_of_STS_programs The STS Wiki].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key themes===

*[[History of technology]], that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned [[technological determinism]], a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific "natural" development.  At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the [[history of medicine]].
* [[History and philosophy of science]] (1960s). After the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual [[paradigm]]s, programs were founded at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and elsewhere that brought [[historians of science]] and philosophers together in unified programs.
*[[Technology and society|Science, technology, and society]]. In the mid- to late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as [[women's studies]]) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of "science, technology, and society" programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]], scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by [[science]] and [[technology]]. Unlike scholars in [[science studies]], history of technology, or the history and philosophy of science, they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate, "[[ivory tower]]" researchers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. As an example of the activist impulse, feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of [[Women in science|women]] from science and engineering.
*Science, engineering, and public [[policy studies]] emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement:  A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public's best interests.{{According to whom|date=November 2013}} The science, technology, and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow's science and technology, but this discipline took a different approach: It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy. Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies, and most of these were eventually absorbed into [[systems engineering]]. Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches, and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society departments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, leading universities in the US, UK, and Europe began drawing these various components together in new, interdisciplinary programs. For example, in the 1970s, Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology. Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together, as well as their location within the various universities. For example, the University of Virginia's STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields (with particular strength in the history of technology); however, the program's teaching responsibilities—it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students—means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in [[engineering ethics]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===The "turn to technology" (and beyond)===
{{see also|Social construction of technology}}

A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science. During that decade, two works appeared ''en seriatim'' that signaled what [[Steve Woolgar]] was to call the "turn to technology": ''Social Shaping of Technology'' (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985) and ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems'' (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). MacKenzie and [[Judy Wajcman|Wajcman]] primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design. In a seminal article, [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Wiebe Bijker]] attached all the legitimacy of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge. This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology.

The "turn to technology" helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs. More recently, there has been an associated turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as [[Carl May]], [[Annemarie Mol]], Nelly Oudshoorn, and Andrew Webster) and ecological interventions (such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Sheila Jasanoff]], [[Matthias Gross]], [[S. Lochlann Jain]], and Jens Lachmund).

==Professional associations==
The subject has several professional associations.

Founded in 1975, the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], initially provided scholarly communication facilities, including a journal (''Science, Technology, and Human Values'') and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars. The society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide. The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice; and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives. Proposals have been made to add the word "technology" to the association's name, thereby reflecting its stature as the leading STS professional society, {{According to whom|but there seems to be widespread sentiment|date=November 2013}} that the name is long enough as it is.

In [[Europe]], the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easst.net/ European Association for the Study of Science and Technology].&lt;/ref&gt;  was founded in 1981 to "stimulate communication, exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology". Similarly, the [[European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology]] (ESST) researches and studies science and technology in society, in both historical and contemporary perspectives.

In Asia several STS associations exist.
In [[Japan]], the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies (JSSTS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssts.jp/content/section/14/51/ Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2001. The Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network (APSTSN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://apstsn.org/ Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily has members from Australasia, Southeast and East Asia and Oceania.

In Latin America ESOCITE (Estudios Sociales de la Ciencia y la Tecnología) is the biggest association of Science and Technology studies. The study of STS (CyT in Spanish, CTS in Portuguese) here was shaped by authors like Amílcar Herrera and Jorge Sabato y Oscar Varsavsky in Argentina, José Leite Lopes in Brazil, Miguel Wionczek in Mexico, Francisco Sagasti in Peru, Máximo Halty Carrere in Uruguay and Marcel Roche in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Kreimer, P. (2007). Estudios sociales de la ciencia y la tecnología en América Latina: ¿para qué?, ¿ para quién? Redes, 13(26), 55–64. Retrieved from http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/907/90702603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1958, the [[Society for the History of Technology]] initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology. After the "turn to technology" in the mid-1980s, the society's well-regarded journal (''Technology and Culture'') and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests.

Less identified with STS, but also of importance to many STS scholars, are the [[History of Science Society]], the [[Philosophy of Science Association]], and the American Association for the History of Medicine.

Additionally, within the US there are significant STS-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations, including the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[National Women's Studies Association]], and the [[American Sociological Association]].

==Important concepts==
=== STS social construction ===
{{Main|Social construction of technology}}

Social constructions are human created ideas, objects, or events created by a series of choices and interactions.&lt;ref name="Science Technology and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhouse|first1=Edward|title=Science Technology and Society|date=2014|publisher=University Readers|location=San Diego|page=255|edition=1st|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs. Some examples of social construction include class, race, money, and citizenship.

The following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set, a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other. According to the article "What is Social Construction?" by Laura Flores, "Social construction work is critical of the status quo. Social constructionists about X tend to hold that:
# X need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not determined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable
Very often they go further, and urge that:
# X is quite as bad as it is.
# We would be much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed." 
In the past, there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the introduction of new knowledge. Such viewpoints include the past concept of a correlation between intelligence and the nature of a human's ethnicity or race (X may not be at all as it is).&lt;ref name="The Social Construction of What"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacking|first1=Ian|title=The Social Construction of What?|date=1999|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, England|isbn=978-0674004122|page=6|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the evolution and interaction of various social constructions within science and technology can be found in the development of both the high-wheel bicycle, or [[velocipede]], and then of the [[bicycle]].  The velocipede was widely used in the latter half of the 19th century. In the latter half of the 19th century, a social need was first recognized for a more efficient and rapid means of transportation.  Consequently, the velocipede was first developed, which was able to reach higher translational velocities than the smaller non-geared bicycles of the day, by replacing the front wheel with a larger radius wheel. One notable trade-off was a certain decreased stability leading to a greater risk of falling. This trade-off resulted in many riders getting into accidents by losing balance while riding the bicycle or being thrown over the handle bars.

The first "social construction" or progress of the velocipede caused the need for a newer "social construction" to be recognized and developed into a safer bicycle design.  Consequently, the velocipede was then developed into what is now commonly known as the "[[bicycle]]" to fit within society's newer "social construction," the newer standards of higher vehicle safety. Thus the popularity of the modern geared bicycle design came as a response to the first social construction, the original need for greater speed, which had caused the high-wheel bicycle to be designed in the first place.  The popularity of the modern geared bicycle design ultimately ended the widespread use of the velocipede itself, as eventually it was found to best accomplish the social-needs/ social-constructions of both greater speed and of greater safety.&lt;ref name="MIT Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bijker,|first1=Wiebe|title=The Social Construction of Technological System|date=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-52137-7|pages=28–45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technoscience ===
{{Main|Technoscience}}

Technoscience is a subset of Science, Technology, and Society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology. It states that fields are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward. Both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement. Technoscience excels at shaping human thought and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lukes, Power: A Radical View (London: Macmillan, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technosocial ===
{{split section|Technosocial|date=June 2015}}

"Technological action is a social process."&lt;ref name = "Goldman, 1992"&gt;Goldman, S. (1992). No Innovation Without Representation (pp. 148-160). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt; Social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other. This includes the aspect that social, political, and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued. In other words, "technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social/political/ economic/psychological phenomena, so 'technology' includes a spectrum of artifacts, techniques, organizations, and systems."&lt;ref name = "Woodhouse, 2013"&gt;Woodhouse, E. (2013). In The Future of Technological Civilization (Revised ed., pp. 1-258).&lt;/ref&gt; Winner expands on this idea by saying "in the late twentieth century technology and society, technology and culture, technology and politics are by no means separate."&lt;ref name = "Winner, 1993"&gt;Winner, L. (1993). Artifacts/Ideas and Political Culture (pp. 283-292). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
* Ford Pinto&lt;ref name = "Dowie, 1997"&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness?page=2 Dowie, M. (1977, October 1). Pinto Madness. Retrieved February 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; – Ford Motor Company sold and produced the Pinto during the 1970s. A flaw in the automobile design of the rear gas tank caused a fiery explosion upon impact. The exploding fuel tank killed and injured hundreds of people. Internal documents of test results, proved Ford CEO Lee Iacocca and engineers were aware of the flaw. The company decided to ignore improving their technology because of profit-driven motives, strict internal control, and competition from foreign competitors such as Volkswagen. Ford Motor Company conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine if altering the Ford Pinto model was feasible. An analysis conducted by Ford employees argued against a new design because of increased cost. Employees were also under tight control by the CEO who rushed the Pinto through production lines to increase profits. Ford finally changed after public scrutiny. Safety organizations later influenced this technology by requiring stricter safety standards for motor vehicles.
* DDT/toxins&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – DDT was a common and highly effective insecticide used during the 1940s until its ban in the early 1970s. It was utilized during World War 2 to combat insect-borne human disease that plagued military members and civilian populations. People and companies soon realized other benefits of DDT for agricultural purposes. Rachel Carson became worried of wide spread use on public health and the environment. Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring'' left an imprint on the industry by claiming linkage of DDT to many serious illness such as cancer. Carson's book drew criticism from chemical companies who felt their reputation and business threatened by such claims.. DDT was eventually banned by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after a long and arduous process of research on the chemical substance. The main cause for the removal of DDT was the public deciding that any benefits outweighed the potential health risk.
* Autopilots/computer aided tasks (CATs)&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – From a security point of view the effects of making a task more computer driven is in the favor of technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot. Due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average, using autopilot, have been shown to be safer. Thus the technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety, and society affects the technology because people want to be safer so they are constantly trying to improve the autopilot systems.
* Cell phones&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – Cell phone technology emerged in the early 1920s after advancements were made in radio technology. Engineers at Bell Laboratories, the research and development division of AT&amp;T discovered that cell towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many directions. The discovery by Bell Labs revolutionized the capabilities and outcomes of cellular technology. Technology only improved once mobile phone users could communicate outside of a designated area. First generation mobile phones were first created and sold by Motorola. Their phone was only intended for use in cars. Second generation mobile phone capabilities continued to improve because of the switch to digital. Phones were faster which enhanced communication capabilities of customers. They were also sleeker and weighed less than bulky first generation technology. Technologically advances boosted customer satisfaction and broadened cell phone companies customer base. Third generation technology changed the way people interact with other. Now customers had access to wifi, texting and other applications. Mobile phones are now entering into the fourth generations.  Cellular and mobile phones revolutionized the way people socialize and communicate in order to establish modern social structure. People have affected the development of this technology by demanding features such as larger screens, touch capabilities, and internet accessibility.
* Internet&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; –  The internet arose because of extensive research on ARPANET between various university, corporations, and ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), an agency of the Department of Defense. Scientist theorized a network of computers connected to each other. Computing capabilities contributed to developments and the creation of the modern day computer or laptop. The internet has become a normal part of life and business, to such a degree that the United Nations views it as a basic human right. The internet is becoming larger, one way is that more things are being moved into the digital world due to demand, for example online banking. It has drastically changed the way most people go about daily habits.

===Deliberative democracy===
[[Deliberative democracy]] is a reform of [[representative democracy|representative]] or [[direct democracy|direct]] democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society.  Deliberative Democracy is a tool for making decisions.  Deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to [[Aristotle’s writings]]. More recently, the term was coined by Joseph Bessette in his 1980 work ''Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government'', where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the [[United States Constitution]] with emphasis on public discussion.&lt;ref name="Bohman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohman|first1=James|title=The Coming of Age of Deliberative Democracy|journal=[[The Journal of Political Philosophy]]|date=1998|volume=6|issue=4|pages=400–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberative Democracy can lead to more legitimate, credible, and trustworthy outcomes.  Deliberative Democracy allows for "a wider range of public knowledge," and it has been argued that this can lead to "more socially intelligent and robust" science. One major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction.&lt;ref name="Chilvers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilvers|first1=Jason|title=Deliberating Competence, Theoretical and Practitioners Perspectives on Effective Participatory Appraisal Practice|journal=[[Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values]]|date=March 2008|volume=33|issue=2|url=http://sth.sagepub.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ryfe, there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy:
*Rules of equality, civility, and inclusivity may prompt deliberation even when our first impulse is to avoid it.
*Stories anchor reality by organizing experience and instilling a normative commitment to civic identities and values, and function as a medium for framing discussions.
*Leadership provides important cues to individuals in deliberative settings, and can keep groups on a deliberative track when their members slip into routine and habit.
*Individuals are more likely to sustain deliberative reasoning when they have a stake in the outcomes.
*Apprenticeship teaches citizens to deliberate well. We might do well to imagine education as a form of apprenticeship learning, in which individuals learn to deliberate by doing it in concert with others more skilled in the activity.&lt;ref name="Ryfe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryfe|first1=David M.|title=Does Deliberative Democracy Work?|journal=[[Annual Review of Political Science]]|date=March 4, 2005|volume=8|pages=63–64|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Importance of deliberative democracy in STS====
Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} there has been a movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology. Jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology, but now there needs to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology.&lt;ref name="Jasanoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Sheila|title=Technologies of Humility: Citizen Participation in Governing Science|journal=Minerva|date=2003|volume=41|issue=3|pages=223–244 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1025557512320|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliberative democracy in practice====
Ackerman and Fishkin offer an example of a reform in their paper "Deliberation Day." The deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular, complex, and controversial issues, through devices such as Fishkin’s Deliberative Polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|last2=Fishkin|first2=James S.|title=Deliberation Day|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/media/news/2004/03/10/586/deliberation-day/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the United States Federal Government. However, things similar to this have been implemented in small, local, governments like New England towns and villages. New England town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting.&lt;ref name="Bohman"/&gt;

An ideal Deliberative Democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants. While the main aim is to reach consensus, a deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints, concerns due to uncertainties, and questions about assumptions made by other participants. It should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate. Independent managers of debates should also have substantial grasp of the concepts discussed, but must "[remain] independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process."&lt;ref name="Chilvers"/&gt;

===Tragedy of the commons===
{{see also|Tragedy of the commons}}

In 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] popularised the phrase "tragedy of the commons." It is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource. Since then, the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource. Although Garrett Hardin was not an STS scholar, the concept of tragedy of the commons still applies to science, technology and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardin|first1=Garrett|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/sotp/pdfs/162-3859-1243.pdf|website=www.sciencemag.org|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contemporary setting, the Internet acts as an example of the tragedy of the commons through the exploitation of digital resources and private information. Data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents. Virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidow|first1=Bill|title=The Tragedy of the Internet Commons|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-tragedy-of-the-internet-commons/257290/#disqus_thread|website=theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[net neutrality]] can be seen as an example of tragedy of the commons in an STS context. The movement for net neutrality argues that the Internet should not be a resource that is dominated by one particular group, specifically those with more money to spend on Internet access.

A counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by Andrew Kahrl. Privatization can be a way to deal with the tragedy of the commons. However, Kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on [[Long Island]], in an attempt to combat overuse of Long Island beaches, made the residents of Long Island more susceptible to flood damage from [[Hurricane Sandy]]. The privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape. Tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed. This attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter-productive. Privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Matthew E.|title=Environmental and Urban Economics|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-counter-example-to-tragedy-of-commons.html|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative modernity===
Alternative [[modernity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Shmuel|title=Multiple Modernities|journal=Dædalus|date=Winter 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feenberg|first1=Andrew|title=Alternative Modernity : The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520089860}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society. Modernity represents the political and social structures of the society, the sum of interpersonal discourse, and ultimately a snapshot of society's direction at a point in time. Unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society. Also, this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world. Problems can be summarized into two elements: inward failure to analyze growth potentials of a given society, and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials.

Previously, modernity carried a connotation of the current state of being modern, and its evolution through European colonialism. The process of becoming "modern" is believed to occur in a linear, pre-determined way, and is seen by Philip Brey as a way of to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations. This thought ties in with [[modernization theory]], the thought that societies progress from "pre-modern" to "modern" societies.

Within the field of science and technology, there are two main lenses with which to view modernity. The first is as a way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards. In effect, we can discuss the notion of "alternative modernity" (as described by Andrew Feenberg) and which of these we would like to move towards. Alternatively, modernity can be used to analyze the differences in interactions between cultures and individuals. From this perspective, alternative modernities exist simultaneously, based on differing cultural and societal expectations of how a society (or an individual within society) should function. Because of different types of interactions across different cultures, each culture will have a different modernity.

===Pace of innovation===
{{See also|Pace of innovation}}

Pace of Innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring, with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid. Both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology.

===No innovation without representation===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{main|No innovation without representation}}

"No innovation without representation" is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments.

* [[Langdon Winner]] states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be. It is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "Artifact/Ideas and Political Culture." Technology and the Future (1993): 283-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spoken about by [[Massimiano Bucchi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucchi, Massimiano. "No Innovation without Representation (A Parliament of Things for the New Technical Democracies)." http://www.fondazionebassetti.org/. 20 Dec. 2003. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering, it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions, as talked about by [[Steven L. Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Steven L. "No Innovation Without Representation: Technological Action in a Democratic Society." New Worlds, New Technologies, New Issues (1992): 148-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privileged positions of business and science===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{Main|Privileged positions of business and science}}

The privileged positions of business and science refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge, ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

===Legacy thinking===

Legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual, because it is already widely accepted by society.

Legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works.  By accepting ideas without questioning them, people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical.  Legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy, who have the means to project their ideas on the public.  It may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good.
Examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society. The belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized, leading to public acceptance of corporate [[lobbying]]. As a result, a self-established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the Constitution to the fullest extent. This can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Bill, and Sarah Harkins. "Fixed Fortunes: Biggest Corporate Political Interests Spend Billions, Get Trillions." Sunlight Foundation Blog. Sunlight Foundation, 17 Nov. 2014. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking however keeps the population from acting to change this, despite polls from Harris Interactive that report over 80% of Americans feel that big business holds too much power in government.&lt;ref&gt;Corso, Regina, SVP. "PACs, Big Companies, Lobbyists, and Banks and Financial Institutions Seen by Strong Majorities as Having Too Much Power and Influence in DC." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. Harris Interactive, 29 May 2012. Web. 21 Apr. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Americans are beginning to try to steer away this line of thought, rejecting legacy thinking, and demanding less corporate, and more public, participation in political decision making.

Additionally, an examination of [[net neutrality]] functions as a separate example of legacy thinking. Starting with [[dial-up]], the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Internet today is a vital part of modern-day society members. They use it in and out of life every day.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"&gt;"Net Neutrality: A Free and Open Internet." The White House. The White House, 26 Feb. 2015. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources. Since the American public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do. Legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a &lt;!--which kind? - human right/..?--&gt;utility. Legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a &lt;!--basic?--&gt;utility. Due to pressure from grassroots movements the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"/&gt; Now AT&amp;T and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in-large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking’s grip on American&lt;!--this article &amp; legacy thinking relates to the global population not just the American--&gt; culture and politics.

For example, those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the [[water privatization|privatization of clean drinking water]] as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Flow. Oscilloscope Pictures, 2008. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partially because access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them. For a person living in such circumstances, it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past. Additionally, a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water.

This notion can be examined through the thought experiment of "[[veil of ignorance]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward. Science Technology and Society. Spring 2015 ed. N.p.: U Readers, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the "you get what you pay for" mentality applied to a life necessity. By utilizing the "veil of ignorance", one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances, allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="974">'''Subglacial streams''' are streams which flow in a channel at the bottom of an [[ice-sheet]] or a [[glacier]], and are usually close to the [[glacier terminus]] or snout. These are fed by streams on top of the glacier which descend through ducts in the ice called moulins. The pressures are very high in these streams due to the huge mass of ice above them, consequently, they have very high erosive power meaning they will increase the volume of water flowing through, maintaining the high pressure. Some subglacial streams have the strange property of 'flowing' uphill due to the colossal pressures that are present.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Moore | first1 = Peter D. | last2 = Garratt | first2 = Richard | title = Tundra | publisher = Infobase Publishing | year = 2007 | pages = 50–51 | isbn = 978-0-8160-5933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supplementary process''' is a method of [[debt collection]] where the debtor who has a court money judgement against him is brought into court, "requiring the judgment debtor to appear at a time and place named therein and submit to an examination relative to his or its property and ability to pay."&lt;ref&gt;M.G.L. Ch. 224, s. 14 https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleII/Chapter224/Section14&lt;/ref&gt; The process is common in [[Massachusetts]] under M.G.L. Ch. 224, s. 14.  If the debtor does not appear in court, a [[Capias ad respondendum]] may issue where a sheriff brings the debtor into court to respond.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5201">A '''teloblast''' is a large cell in the embryos of [[clitellate]] [[annelid]]s which asymmetrically divide to form many smaller cells known as [[blast cells]].  These blast cells further proliferate and differentiate to form the [[segmentation (biology)|segmental]] tissues of the annelid.  Teloblasts are well studied in [[leeches]], though they are also present in the other major class of clitellates: the [[oligochaetes]].

[[Image:Wiki3 fig1.jpg|thumb|alt=teloblasts in leech development | Teloblasts divide asymmetrically to form small blast cells which wrap around the embryo and extend rostrally. Here, the embryo is shown at late stage 7 (upper right). The N, O, P, Q, and M teloblasts are always positioned in the same relative orientations (lower left).]]

== Developmental role and morphology ==

All teloblasts are specified from the D quadrant [[macromere]] after the second round of divisions post-fertilization. There are five pairs of teloblasts, one on each side of the embryo. Four of the teloblasts (N, O, P, and Q) give rise to [[ectodermal]] tissue  and one pair (M) gives rise to [[mesodermal]] tissue. The column of blast cells arising out of each teloblast is known as a bandlet.  All five bandlets coalesce into one [[germinal band]] on each side of the embryo, extending out from the teloblast towards the head (in the [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] direction). The teloblasts are located at the rear of the embryo.

Teloblasts have two separate [[cytoplasmic]] domains: the teloplasm and the vitelloplasm. The teloplasm contains the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[ribosomes]], [[mitochondria]], and other subcellular [[organelles]]. The vitelloplasm contains mostly [[yolk]] [[platelets]]. Only the teloplasm gets passed onto the daughter stem cells after [[cell division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0012-1606(80)90344-9 | author = Fernández, J., &amp; Stent, G. S. | title = Embryonic development of the glossiphoniid leech Theromyzon rude: structure and development of the germinal bands | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 407–34 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7409309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== O/P specification ==

The O and P teloblasts are specified from two separate but identical precursors, which form an equivalence group These two precursor cells are termed O/P cells for their ability to become either O or P teloblasts. Signals from the surrounding cells act to specify which fate the teloblasts and their progeny take on. Interactions with the q bandlet, however transient, can induce the p fate in the adjacent o/p bandlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kuo, D., &amp; Shankland, M. | title =Evolutionary diversification of specification mechanisms within the O/P equivalence group of the leech genus Helobdella | journal = Development | volume = 131 | issue = 23 | pages = 5859–69 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15525668 | doi = 10.1242/dev.01452}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M bandlet has been shown to In some species (i.e. Helobdella triserialis), the provisional epithelium covering the cells plays a role in inducing the O fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0012-1606(87)90255-7 | author = Ho, R. K., &amp; Weisblat, D. A. | title =A provisional epithelium in the leech embryo: Cellular origins and influence on a developmental equivalence group. | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 520–534 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3549391}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of cell-cell interactions, the O/P precursors will become O teloblasts. O and P bandlets exhibit very different mitotic patterns (see figure) which are used to identify them in experimental manipulations.

[[Image:OPteloblast.jpg|thumb|alt=O/P teloblast specification| O and P teloblasts have very different cell division patterns. The patterns of stereotyped mitoses for other teloblasts can be found here:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bissen, S. T., &amp; Weisblat, D. A. | title = The durations and compositions of the cell cycles in embryos of the leech, Helobdella triserialis | journal = Development | volume = 105 | pages = 105–118 | year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Segmental fates ==

The N and Q teloblasts contribute two blast cells per segment, one making up the anterior half of the segment, the second making up the posterior half of the segment.  The O, P, and M lineages contribute one blast cell per segment, but the contributions from each blast cell spans a segmental boundary.  These segmental boundaries were discovered by injecting teloblasts with cell lineage tracers after a few blast cells have already been generated.  During development, the N and Q bandlets, which eventually have 64 blast cells each, slide past the O,P,and M bandlet, which only have 32 cells.  Thus, the segmental boundaries within each bandlet are already specified before all the bandlets come into complete register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weisblat DA, Shankland M | title = Cell lineage and segmentation in the leech | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 312 | issue = 1153 | pages = 39–56 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2869529 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1985.0176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2223">'''The Group''' was an informal but highly influential [[Not-for-profit arts organization|art association]] formed in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]] in 1927. Initially begun by ex-students from [[Ilam School of Fine Arts|Canterbury College of Art]], its aim was to provide a freer, more experimental alternative to the academic salon painting exhibitions of the [[Canterbury Society of Arts]]. The Group exhibited annually for 50 years, from 1927 to 1977, and was continuously at the forefront of New Zealand art's [[avant-garde]] scene.

Many of the country's best-known artists were associated at some time with The Group, among them [[Colin McCahon]], [[Doris Lusk]], [[Toss Woollaston]], [[Rita Angus]], [[Olivia Spencer Bower]], [[Leo Bensemann]], [[Rata Lovell-Smith]], [[Philip Trusttum]], and [[Douglas MacDiarmid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 15.  – Canterbury region – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/canterbury-region/page-15|website = www.teara.govt.nz|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en|first = New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last = Taonga}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of The Group extended into other areas of New Zealand culture through the collaborations and friendship of members with the likes of writer and editor [[Charles Brasch]] and composer [[Douglas Lilburn]].&lt;ref name="Bensemann"&gt;http://www.nzportraitgallery.org.nz/whats-on/leo-bensemann-friends-portraiture-and-the-group&lt;/ref&gt; Its influence was such that it is occasionally referred to as "[[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] South".&lt;ref name="Bensemann"/&gt;

      <comment>I made the date of publication more accurate, as the journal was actually established in 1897. The Biblical world, which ran concurrent with The American Journal of Theology, was established in 1882 under the name of "The Hebrew Student" and this may have been the source of the confusion.</comment>

'''Urban ecosystems''' are the [[city|cities]], [[town]]s, and urban strips constructed by [[human]]s.

This is the growth in the urban population and the supporting built infrastructure has affected both [[urban environment]]s and also on areas which surround urban areas. These include semi or 'peri-urban' environments that fringe cities as well as agricultural and natural landscapes. Semi environments  can also be called peri-urban.

Nowadays scientists are developing ways to measure and understand the effects of [[urbanization]] on human and [[environmental health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neighborhood- scale urban forest ecosystem classification|last = Steenberg|volume=163|journal = Journal of environmental management|publisher =|year = 2015|isbn =|location =|pages =134–145|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By considering urban areas as part of a broader [[Socioecology|social-ecological system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Urban ecosystem health assessment:A review|last = Meirong|first = Su|journal= The Science of the Total Environment|volume=408|issue=12|year = 2010|isbn =|location =|pages = 2425–2434|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientists can investigate how urban landscapes function and how they affect other landscapes with which they interact. In this context, urban environments are affected by their surrounding environment but also affect that environment. Knowing this may provide clues as to which alternative development options will lead to the best overall environmental outcome.

CSIRO CSE's&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090708192523/http://www.csiro.au/org/cse.html&lt;/ref&gt; urban ecosystem research is focused on:

*Understanding how cities work as integrated social-ecological systems 
*Developing [[sustainable development|sustainable approaches to development]] of city fringe areas that reduce negative impact on surrounding environments 
*Developing approaches to [[urban design]] that provide for health and opportunity for citizens.
