An '''acting coach''' or '''drama coach''' is a [[teacher]] who trains performers–typically film, television, theatre and, [[musical theatre]] [[actor]]s–and gives them advice and [[mentoring]] to enable them to improve their acting and dramatic performances, prepare for [[audition]]s and prepare better for roles.
==Qualifications and roles==
Acting coaches need to have a "talent...for reading people, all their utterances and [[body language]]."&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;Eric Liu. "The People Whisperers:What a Hollywood acting coach taught me about teaching" in Slate. http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/teachings/2005/01/the_people_whisperers.html&lt;/ref&gt; Acting coaches have been called "people whisperers", a reference to "[[horse whisperer]]s" who help to train animals.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Acting coach [[Ivana Chubbuck]] states that one of her roles is to ensure that "every actor...must know what the character's objective is in a scene—to win someone's love, respect, sympathy, whatever—and then must have a ruthlessness about achieving the objective."&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Chubbuck works with actors to help them to connect with the emotion inside the character.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Acting coaches also "...help [drama] students audition for college".&lt;ref name=mcmahon&gt;Regan McMahon. "THEATER Acting coach preps drama students for college auditions" in ''The Chronicle'' Saturday, January 22, 2011 http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Acting-coaches-help-students-audition-for-college-2478509.php&lt;/ref&gt; Acting coach and actor Woodell-Mascall is "...skilled at zeroing in on what young actors need to do to improve their performance." Woodell-Mascall tells one student actor to "...really think about who [the character] is and what she's feeling. It's got to be real.&lt;ref name=mcmahon /&gt; She provides [[constructive criticism]] to students. Woodell-Mascall has helped students to get into drama programs at schools "...including NYU, Juilliard, Rutgers and UCLA".&lt;ref name=mcmahon /&gt; Some acting coaches use an "...approach and technique of acting training [that] are considered established, proven methods of creating the [dramatic] work", such as using the "...methodology of [[Constantin Stanislavski]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Uta Hagen]], [[Lee Strasberg]], and [[Sanford Meisner]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://kimtobinactingstudio.com/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some acting coaches provide students with a DVD or SD card recording of their acting, for the student to review their progress.

==Notable individuals==
Major acting coaches include: [[Larry Moss (acting coach)|Larry Moss]], [[Ivana Chubbuck]], [[Michelle Danner]], [[Terry Schreiber]], [[David Mamet]], [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Michael Woolson]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Chambers Stevens]], and [[Sanford Meisner]].

==Working conditions==
Acting coaches may be freelancers who are hired for an hourly or daily rate, or they may be hired on a longer-term basis by a [[film studio]], [[production company]] or [[theatre company]]. Some acting coaches have developed their own unique methods and founded their own acting schools. Acting coaches' income varies a great deal from one coach to another. For example, an acting coach providing training to a community theatre troupe or a high school musical earns much less than an acting coach training top [[Hollywood]] celebrities. Acting classes are often provided in person; however, with the widespread availability of high-speed Internet, some coaches offer mentoring online over [[Skype]] or other video linkups. Acting coaches may offer private coaching, group sessions or a combination of both.

==Other roles==
In some cases, acting coaches are hired to train [[singer]]s in acting skills. Popular music singers may need to learn acting skills for their live concert shows, which sometimes include staged sequences, and for performing in [[music video]]s. For example, Goth-rocker [[Amy Lee]] was provided with an acting coach by her record label. In [[Classical music]], singers performing staged [[opera]]s may get help from an acting coach to prepare them for their roles. Sometimes CEOs and other leaders hire acting coaches to help them improve their performance of speeches and other general communications activities. While most acting coaches mentor actors, some also coach directors on how to improve their direction of actors. Some acting coaches offer introductions to the acting industry, to help new actors learn about auditions, the casting process, the role of agents, key acting terminology (e.g., "[[wikt:callback|callback]]" auditions), and about important industry organizations.

'''Afro-Surrealism''' or '''Afrosurrealism''' is a literary and cultural aesthetic that is a response to mainstream [[surrealism]] in order to reflect the lived experience of [[people of color]]. First coined by [[Amiri Baraka]] in 1974,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=D. Scot|first1=Miller|title=Call it Afro-Surreal|url=http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/|website=San Francisco Bay Guarian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this movement focuses on the present day experience of African Americans.  Afro-Surrealism is based on the manifesto written by D. Scot Miller, in which he says, "Afro-Surrealism sees that all 'others' who create from their actual, lived experience are surrealist..."  The manifesto delineates Afro-Surrealism from Surrealism and Afro-Futurism. The manifesto also declares the necessity of Afro-Surrealism, especially in [[San Francisco]], California. The manifesto lists ten tenants that Afro-Surrealism follows including how "Afro-Surrealists restore the cult of the past," and how "Afro-Surreal presupposes that beyond this visible world, there is an invisible world striving to manifest, and it is our job to uncover it."

Afro-Surrealism can be seen in music, photography, film, the visual arts and poetry. Notable practitioners of Afro-Surrealism include [[Ted Joans]], [[Bob Kaufman]], [[Krista Franklin]], [[Kool Keith]], [[Terrence Nance]], [[Will Alexander (poet)|Will Alexander]], [[India Sky Davis]], [[Kara Walker]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Starr Finch]], Romare Bearden and [[Christopher Burch (artist)|Christopher Burch]].

== Influence ==
The AfroSurreal arts movement came about after D. Scot Miller penned The Afrosurreal Manifesto for The San Francisco Bay Guardian in May, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/&lt;/ref&gt; Until that time, the term "Afrosurreal Expressionism" was used solely to describe the writings of Henry Dumas by Amiri Baraka. Later that year, Miller spoke with Baraka about extending the term by shortening the description. It was agreed by the two of them that "Afrosurreal" without the "expressionism" would allow further exploration of the term.  [http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/10/28/anti-doofus-agenda/].  Afrosurrealism may have some similar origins to [[surrealism]] in the mid-1920s, in that an aspect of it [Negritude] came after [[André Breton]] wrote the [[Surrealist Manifesto]], but as Leopold Senghor points out in Miller's manifesto, “European Surrealism is empirical. African Surrealism is mystical and metaphorical.”.&lt;ref&gt;http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Afro-Surrealism incorporates aspects of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], [[Négritude]] and Black Radical Imagination as described by Professor Robin DG Kelley in his definitive work Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination (2003),&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2017/05/a-converstion-with-robin-d-g-kelley/&lt;/ref&gt; and further with his definitive Afrosurreal historical anthology, Black, Brown, &amp; Beige:
Surrealist Writings from Africa and the Diaspora (2009).&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/book/3194&lt;/ref&gt;  Aspects of Afro-Surrealism can be traced to Martiniquan Suzanne Césaire’s discussion of the “revolutionary impetus of surrealism” in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Editor’s Notes|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.editor.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 1–2|volume = 5|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though much has been written and said about artist/activist/statesmen Aimé Césaire, much more needs to written about his partner Suzanne, a brilliant surrealist thinker, and mother of the Afrosurreal aesthetic. Her quest for “The Marvelous” over the “miserablism” expressed in the usual arts of protest inspired the Tropiques surrealist group, and especially René Ménil.

“The true task of mankind consists solely in the attempt to bring the marvelous into real life,” Ménil says in “Introduction to the Marvelous,”[1930s] “so that life can become more encompassing. So long as the mythic imagination is not able to overcome each and every boring mediocrity, human life will amount to nothing but useless, dull experiences, just killing time, as they say.”

Suzanne Césaire’s proclamation, “Be in permanent readiness for The Marvelous,” quickly became a credo of the movement; the word “marvelous” has since become re-contextualized with regard to contemporary black arts and interventions.&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2016/10/afrosurreal-the-marvelous-and-the-invisible/&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1956 essay for ''[[Présence Africaine]]'' Haitian novelist [[Jacques Stephen Alexis]] wrote,'' "What, then, is the Marvellous, except the imagery in which a people wraps its experience, reflects its conception of the world and of life, its faith, its hope, its confidence in man, in a great justice, and the explanation which it finds for the forces antagonistic to progress?"''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introduction: The No-Theory Chant of Afrosurrealism|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.francis03.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 95–112|volume = 5|issue = 1|first = Terri|last = Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Alexis is seen to have an acute sense of reality that is not dissimilar to traditional surrealism, and his coining of the term "Marvelous Realism" reflects how he was influenced by the earlier works of the Negritude/Black Surrealist Movement.

== Development ==
Afro-Surrealism was coined by [[Amiri Baraka]] in his 1974 essay on Black Arts Movement avant-garde writer [[Henry Dumas]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/10/01/433229181/henry-dumas-wrote-about-black-people-killed-by-cops-then-he-was-killed-by-a-cop&lt;/ref&gt;  Baraka notes that Dumas is able to write about ancient mysteries that were simultaneously relevant to the present day. This idea that the past resurfaces to haunt the present day is a crucial to Afro-Surrealism.

Cinematographer [[Arthur Jafa]] expanded the field of Afro-Surrealism by experimenting with film. Jafa introduces the idea of "the alien familiar," in order to represent the Black experience and its innate surreal characteristics. "I want it to have something that I and my friends call 'the alien familiar.' If a work succeeds in a way or is able to conjure what a Black cinema would be or what this hypothetical manifestation of this particular tradition in the cinematic arena might be, it should be both alien because you’ve never seen anything quite like it, and at the same time, it should be familiar on some level to Black audiences."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jafa, “The Notion of Treatment: Black Aesthetics and Film, based on an interview with Peter Hassli and additional discussions with Pearl Bowser,” in Oscar Micheaux and His Circle: African-American Filmmaking and Race Cinema of the Silent Era, ed. Pearl Bowser et al. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This focus on the alien aspect of the Black experience, and on Black folk culture, are what separate Afro-Surrealism from magical realism and surrealism.

=== The Future-Past ===
&lt;ref&gt;Miller, D. S. "Afrosurreal Manifesto: Black Is the New black—a 21st-Century Manifesto." ''Black Camera'', vol. 5 no. 1, 2013, pp. 113-117. ''Project MUSE'', muse.jhu.edu/article/525948.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Afro-Futurism which speculates on black possibilities in the future, Afrosurrealism, as Miller describes, is about the present. Rather than speculate on the coming of the four horseman, Afrosurrealists understand that they rode through too long ago. Through Afrosurrealism, artists expose this form of the future past that is "RIGHT NOW." Most Afrosurrealists reject the study of the future pushing themselves to focus on the present, the future that has already past.

=== The everyday lived experience ===

Much of Afro-Surrealism is concerned with the everyday life because it is said that there is nothing more surreal than the Black experience.  According to Terri Francis, "Afrosurrealism is art with skin on it where the texture of the object tells its story, how it weathered burial below consciousness, and how it emerged somewhat mysteriously from oceans of forgotten memories and discarded keepsakes. This photograph figures Afrosurrealism as bluesy, kinky-spooky."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Meditation|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.francis02.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 94-94|volume = 5|issue = 1|first = Terri|last = Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present day realism ===
In the manifesto from which present day Afrosurrealism is based, writer D. Scot Miller states in a response to Afrofuturism:

"Afro-Futurism is a diaspora intellectual and artistic movement that turns to science, technology, and science fiction to speculate on black possibilities in the future. Afro-Surrealism is about the present. There is no need for tomorrow’s-tongue speculation about the future. Concentration camps, bombed-out cities, famines, and enforced sterilization have already happened. To the Afro-Surrealist, the Tasers are here. The Four Horsemen rode through too long ago to recall. What is the future? The future has been around so long it is now the past."

As The AfroSurreal Manifesto and Afrofuturism come to the fore in artistic, commercial and academic circles, the struggle between the specific and “the scent” of present-day manifestations of Black absurdity has come with it, posing interesting challenges to both movements. For Afrofuturists, this challenge has been met by inserting Afrocentric elements into its growing pantheon, the intention being to centralize Afrofuturist focus back on the continent of Africa to enhance its specificity. For the Afrosurrealists, the focus has been set at the “here and now” of contemporary Black arts and situations in the Americas, Antilles, and beyond, searching for the nuanced “scent” of those current manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2017/05/the-electrical-scent-of-damas-negritude-the-harlem-renaissance-and-the-afrosurreal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Afro-Surrealist scholar Rochelle Spencer identifies at least three different subgenres of black speculative art, and Spencer argues that Afro-Surrealism is the most present-focus, though it is not devoid of technology and may include allusions to modern technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Black Science Fiction Studies Matter|url = http://www.themarysue.com/black-science-fiction-studies-matter/|website = www.themarysue.com|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Francis, the juxtaposition between the old and the present day is what makes Afro-Surrealism so unique. As Francis puts it, "Surrealism here, the Afro-surreal, like the marvelous discussed above, is actually a realism so real, so contrary to the norms of publicized blackness, that it represents a rupture, a radical break from ordinary understanding such that the old feels new—because it was never known.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~blackcam/pastIssues/Fall2013.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of Afrosurrealist Works ==

=== ''Zong!,'' M. NourbSe Philip and Setaey Adamu Boateng ===
In &lt;ref&gt;Philip, Marlene Nourbese. Zong! Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;''Zong!'', M. NourbSe Philip crafts a powerful counter-narrative surrounding the events of the [[Zong massacre|''Zong'' massacre]]. Utilizing the words from the legal decision to build her poetry, Philip rejects the idea of an archival past. Instead Philip looks to the present moment to understand how to read this legal decision and understand the case. Following the footsteps of Toni Morrison’s ''Beloved'', Philip presupposes the notion of a past that is not past allowing these past artifacts to haunt the present moment. Rather than organize the fragments, Philip allows the fragments to tell themselves. This is not to say that Philip gives the fragments voices, but instead gives them space. The space in the poem allows Philip’s audience to hear the silence of these voices, to truly understand the missing narratives form the past and the role that has on the present.

=== ''Beloved'', Toni Morrison ===
As mentioned earlier, Toni Morrison’s &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Toni. Beloved: A Novel. New York: Knopf : Distributed by Random House, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;''Beloved'' remains an important milestone for Afrosurrealists. Here, Morrison imagines a narrative of a slave women grieving the death of her baby daughter, Beloved. With no trace of a past, Beloved reappears of on the steps of 124, confused and looking for her mother. Following this moment, the novel crafts a haunting tale of a woman seeking to understand the sudden reappearance of her daughter and the scars left behind from slavery. In ''Beloved,'' Morrison attempts to come to grip with the legacies left by slavery, challenging the notion that these legacies exits only from the past. From the epigraph, “''Sixty Million and more'',” Morrison presupposes there is no way to count those affected from slavery and additionally, that the number is ever-growing into the present. In her award-winning novel, Morrison expands the idea of the past, attempting to demonstrate the past is ever present and moreover, that the past is RIGHT NOW.

The '''''Albani Torlonia Altarpiece''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Pietro Perugino]],  executed in 1491 and housed in the [[Torlonia Collection]], [[Rome]]. It was commissioned by Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the future [[pope Julius II]].

==Description==
The [[polyptych]] includes two levels: the lower one has at center a Nativity scene and, at the sides, two arched panels depicting [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Jerome]] and [[Saint George]], sharing the same background. The upper one as, in the center, a [[lunette]] with a ''Crucifixion'', flanked by two small panels, with the Annunciation Angel and the Annunciation to the Virgin, set in a double portico.

The main scene, that of the Nativity, is perhaps inspired by that painted by Perugino in the [[Sistine Chapel]], which is now lost. The Child is housed in the Virgin's dress, lying on a red cushion; [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph]] are adoring him, flanked by two kneeling angels and, behind, the ox and the donkey. The scene is set inside a perspective portico, while the background includes a series of hills.

'''''Angela's Ashes: A Memoir''''' is a 1996 [[memoir]] by the Irish-American author Frank McCourt, with various anecdotes and stories of his childhood. It details his very early childhood in [[Brooklyn, New York]], but focuses primarily on his life in [[Limerick, Ireland]]. It also includes his struggles with poverty and his father's [[alcoholism]].

The book was published in 1996 and won the 1997 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]]. A sequel, ''[['Tis]]'', was published in 1999, followed by ''[[Teacher Man]]'' in 2005.

==Synopsis==
Born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on 19 August 1930, Frank (Francis) McCourt is the oldest son of Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan McCourt. Both of his parents emigrated from Ireland and married in a shotgun wedding over Angela's pregnancy with Frankie. Angela is originally from Limerick, Ireland, and is fond of music, singing, and dancing. Malachy, from Northern Ireland, is an alcoholic known for his "odd manner" and for telling fantastical stories about Irish heroes. Frankie is often said to closely resemble his father, having a hang-dog face and the same "odd manner." The narrative is told from the point of view of Frankie as a child.

In America, the McCourts live in modern tenement housing next to a park and share a floor, and a communal lavatory, with other immigrant families from Ireland, Italy, and the Jewish communities.

Frankie has four younger siblings: [[Malachy McCourt|Malachy]], born in 1931, who is often favored over Frankie for being an attractive, open child; blond twins Oliver and Eugene, born in 1932; and an infant sister, Margaret, in 1935.

The family often struggles with poverty as Malachy Sr. engages in an endless struggle to find work and alcohol. The family's prospects, and Angela's spirits, lift whenever he finds a new job and brings home his first week's wages, but eventually he finds himself spending all of his pay in pubs, despite Angela's many schemes to prevent him from doing so, and losing his job after a few weeks.

Margaret's birth seems to instill new life into the family: the whole family falls in love with her, Malachy Sr most of all. He gives up drinking and finds steady work to support the family. However, due to her parents' ignorance of children's disease, Margaret lives for only seven weeks. With her death, Malachy Sr abandons his family for days to indulge in an alcoholic binge, while Angela falls into a severe, debilitating depression. Frank, age six, is forced to feed and care for his younger siblings, often with the kind intervention of the neighbors. The neighbors soon realize the family's dire straits and intervene, contacting Angela's cousins, who in turn recommend the family return to Ireland with Angela's family in [[Limerick, Ireland|Limerick]].

Angela is pregnant with a new baby, as they return to Ireland from America, and lose the child, shortly after moving to Limerick.

The [[Great Depression]] has struck Ireland, particularly Limerick, even harder than it did the United States. There is little work, and conditions for poor families are miserable. Malachy Sr finds it even more difficult to find work because of his Northern Ireland accent and mannerisms, the children are mocked for their American accents, and many neighbors, as well as Angela's family, look down on the McCourts for their return from America.

The family is forced to rely on [[Welfare|the dole]] and charity from the local [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]], which requires extensive, and humiliating application processes. Angela and Malachy Sr often argue about this as Malachy drinks the welfare money meant to feed the family, and views Angela's asking for charity as begging and degrading. For many years, the family subsists on little more than bread and tea.

Within a year of the family's arrival, Oliver and Eugene also die—Oliver of what is implied to be [[scarlet fever]] and Eugene, a few months later, from grieving the loss of his twin and malnutrition. After each death, Angela sinks into depression, and the family moves because she cannot bear being in the same house. Each move results in the McCourts sliding down into worse and worse circumstances. Eventually, they end up living in a slum house. The entire ground floor floods for half a year, requiring the family to live in an upstairs room together. Their house is located next to the only lavatory on the whole street. There is a constant traffic of families dumping chamber pots in the filthy lavatory, which often backs up and smells. Two additional baby brothers, Michael (born 1936), and [[Alphie McCourt|Alphie]] (Alphonsus, b.&amp;nbsp;1940), are born in Limerick.

Frankie grows up in Limerick as a sensitive and intelligent child. He often makes unique observations from those around him and has an emotional need to help. His strict Catholic upbringing preys on his imaginative nature and thoughts on whether he will be going to hell plague on his mind. Frankie must balance his Catholic beliefs against a church which frequently rejects him due to his poverty and family, his Irish upbringing against his desire to return to America once he's grown, and his desire for his father's attention against his loyalty to his mother. Strangers often prefer his more attractive and outgoing siblings, but Frankie wins over a few champions, mainly in the form of his school teachers and the various adults who hire him for odd jobs.

Frank develops [[typhoid fever]] and is taken to a Catholic hospital, where for the first time he has adequate food, warmth, and access to limitless books, and the time to read them, giving birth to his lifelong love of literature. Frankie additionally contracts chronic [[conjunctivitis]], which does little to improve his looks or perceived, sarcastic demeanor.

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], many Limerick men find work at a defence plant in [[Coventry, England]], leaving their families behind and sending back money to support them. These good-paying jobs lift many of the McCourts' neighbors out of poverty. Malachy Sr leaves the family behind and secures a defence job. For several weeks, the payments allow the family to enjoy small luxuries such as candy and visits to the movies. But soon, the money stops coming and Malachy Sr abandons his family for good.

Frank and his brothers begin to scavenge the streets for [[coal]] or [[peat]] turf for fuel. They also steal leftover food from restaurants at the end of the day and grocery deliveries from doorsteps.

Eventually, the family is evicted and homeless. With few options, Angela and her children move in with her bachelor cousin, Laman Griffin. Laman is a petty tyrant who resents the presence of the children and enjoys degrading them and Angela. A preteen Frankie resents this treatment, but puts up with it for his mother and younger brothers. Upon discovering that part of Laman's deal for providing housing is a sexual relationship with Angela, Frankie has a fight with Laman and is thrown out of the house. Shortly after, Malachy Jr leaves Laman Griffin's to join the military as a bugle boy.

Frankie moves in with his maternal uncle, who was dropped on his head as a child and now lives in the house left to him by his deceased mother. Frank gets a job as a telegram delivery boy on his 14th birthday and begins to support himself while saving for his passage to America. The interesting people and situations Frankie meets on his deliveries cause him to grow as a person.

Frankie supports his youngest brothers by providing food and respite from Laman Griffin when they come to visit him. Eventually, his brothers ask if they can move in with him, which he allows, and they are shortly followed by Angela. Frankie must now turn over the majority of his wages to his mother as the bread winner of the family, though he still takes on various odd jobs to earn extra for his ticket to America, such as writing threatening collection letters on behalf of a local [[moneylender]].

On his sixteenth birthday, Frank's uncle takes him to the pub to buy him his first beer. Frank gets drunk and returns home, singing like his father used to. When his mother shames him for drinking the way his father did, Frank hits her, accusing her of being a whore for Laman Griffin, and is immediately ashamed of himself.

One day Frank returns to the moneylender's home to find she has died. Liberated, Frank takes money from her purse and throws her ledger of debtors into the river to free the neighborhood of their debts. The contents of the moneylender's purse give him enough money to return to America at the age of nineteen. Frank arrives in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], ready to begin a new life in the country of his birth.

== 4th Edition 2012 ==
[[File:Marrakech Biennale 4 -Higher Atlas.jpg|thumb|Marrakech Biennale 4 -Higher Atlas]]
The 4th Edition of The Marrakech Biennale opened on 29 February and was co-ordinated by Jessica Bannister. The 5 days opening was titled 'Surrender' and consisted of Performances, Debates, Talks and Screenings as well as the opening of the Main Visual Arts Exhibition on 1 March.
[http://www.higheratlas.org/ Higher Atlas], a major exhibition curated by [http://nsamman.blogspot.com/ Dr Nadim Samman] and [http://www.carsonchan.net/ Carson Chan] took place at the Théâtre Royal, Koutoubia Cisterns, Bank Al-Maghrib, Cyber Parc Arsat Moulay Abdeslam and Dar Al-Ma’mûn in Marrakech (1 March-3 June 2012). High connotes reverie and transcendence. Higher Atlas suggests a cartography of the beyond. All works were new site-specific commissions, conceived and created on location with local craftspeople and manufacturers.
Over thirty international artists, architects, writers, musicians and composers showed their work, including Karthik Pandian, Juliana Cerqueira Leite, Juergen Mayer H, Andrew Ranville, Felix Kiessling, Finnbogi Petursson and Turner Prize nominated Roger Hiorns. The exhibition sought to engage in an expansive dialogue with the city.

The 5th edition of the Marrakech Biennale took
place, from February 28 to March 30, 2014, under the patronage of His Majesty
King Mohammed VI.

The MB5 was attended by over 450 artists
including more than 100 Moroccan artists, it had over 30,000 visitors. It
mobilized more than 80 sponsors and patrons and invited over 150 international
and national journalists and professionals.Thanks to an extensive programme, as well as
the quality of the artists and media coverage, the event got ranked among the
top 20 biennials in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World's Top 20 Biennials and Triennials - artnet News|url = https://news.artnet.com/art-world/worlds-top-20-biennials-triennials-and-miscellennials-18811|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition, curated by Hicham Khalidi, invited 43 artists from Morocco and several other countries. The vast majority of the artworks were site specific, produced in and inspired by the context of Marrakech. The artpieces were diffused between the venues of the 16th century [[El Badi Palace]], the Dar Si Said, which houses the Museum of Moroccan Arts, the former Bank Al Maghrib in the middle of the [[Jemaa El Fna]] square - This square is the pulsing heart of the Medina of Marrakech, and it has been defined by [[UNESCO]] as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity- and a unique art deco building in the area of Gueliz called L'Blasa, Which is now the headquarters of the 6th edition of the Marrakech Biennale in 2016.

Cinema and Video considered contemporary creations from North Africa in dialogue with other regions, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. With the participation of the pioneering founder of the festival of video installation Casaprojecta, Jamal Abdenassar, video installation as a hyphen between film, visual art, and performing art was very present in this edition. The film screenings and roundtables were combined by a carte blanche to the legendary Cinematheque de Tanger.

Led by the Moroccan writer and theater author Driss Ksikès, the Literary discipline promoted access to public space through a series of roundtables as well as performative lectures, connecting performing art and literature. These events took place in the Royal Theater, a contested theater and opera house built in the late 70s yet never used as such. Playing on this, it was also the main venue of the previous edition of the Marrakech Biennale. The literature section also took place in Riad [[Denise Masson]], the house of the first woman who ever translated the Koran into French and Dar Cherifa, the oldest house of the Medina. Finally, the exhibition opened to the most public space of the city as it merges with the visual art exhibition in the main square Jemaa El Fna, fusing the new and the old.

=== Performing Arts ===
Curated by Khalid Tamer

Performing Arts was organized by the founder of Alwaln’art, the public space festival in Marrakech, Khalid Tamer. He created a circulation that reimagines the relationships of public space to both outsiders and natives between several venues of the Biennale. This movement is organized as a dialogue between the contemporary and the traditional, connecting the two areas where the Biennale took place: the more traditional space of the Medina and the modern area of Gueliz, the first area built outside of the Medina fortification starting in 1913. The main purpose of this circulation in the public space is to invite the immediate and spontaneous audience to participate in the Biennale by interconnecting the main venues.

'''Building design''' refers to the broadly based [[architecture|architectural]], [[Architectural engineering|engineering]] and [[Technology|technical]] applications to the [[design]] of [[building]]s. All building projects require the services of a building designer, typically a licensed [[architect]] or [[structural engineer]]. Smaller, less complicated projects often do not require a licensed professional, and the design of such projects is often undertaken by building designers, draftspersons, [[interior designers]] (for interior fit-outs or renovations), or [[General contractor|contractor]]s. Larger, more complex building projects require the services of many professionals trained in specialist disciplines, usually coordinated by an architect.

== Occupations ==

===Architect===
{{main|Architect}}
An architect is a person trained in the planning, design and supervision of the construction of buildings. Professionally, an architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a practicum (or internship) for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture. In most of the world's jurisdictions, the professional and commercial use of the term "architect" is legally protected.

===Building engineers===
{{main|Building engineering}}
[[Building engineering]] typically includes the services of [[Electrical engineers|electrical]], [[Mechanical engineers|mechanical]] and [[Structural engineers]].

===Draftsperson (Draughtsman)===
A [[technical drawing|draftsperson]] or [[Documentation|documenter]] is someone who has attained a certificate or [[diploma]] in architectural drafting (or equivalent training), and provides services relating to the preparation of [[Technical drawing|construction documents]] rather than building design. Some draftspersons are employed by architectural design firms and building contractors, while others are self-employed.

===Building designer===
In many places, [[building code]]s and legislation of professions allow persons to design single family residential buildings and in some cases light commercial buildings without an architectural license. As such, "Building designer" is a common designation in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and elsewhere for someone who offers building design services but is not a licensed architect or engineer.

Anyone may use the title of "building designer" in the broadest sense. In many places, a building designer may achieve certification demonstrating a higher level of training. In the U.S., the ''National Council of Building Designer Certification'' (NCBDC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbdc.com/about.htm National Council of Building Designer Certification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520084800/http://www.ncbdc.com/about.htm |date=2008-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an offshoot of the ''American Institute of Building Design'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aibd.org/professional_certification.html American Institute of Building Design] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518104652/http://www.aibd.org/professional_certification.html |date=May 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; administers a program leading to the title of ''Certified Professional Building Designer'' (CPBD). In most cases, building designers are trained as [[architectural technologist]]s or draftspersons; they may also be architecture school graduates that have not completed licensing requirements.

Many building designers are known as "residential" or "home designers", since they focus mainly on residential design and remodeling. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]], "Residential Designer" is a regulated term for those who are registered as such under Nevada State Board of Architecture, Interior Design and Residential Design, and one may not legally represent oneself in a professional capacity without being currently registered.

In [[Australia]] where use of the term architect and some derivatives is highly restricted but the architectural design of buildings has very few restrictions in place, the term building designer is used extensively by people or design practices who are not registered by the relevant State Board of Architects. In [[Queensland]] the term building design is used in legislation which licences practitioners as part of a broader building industry licensing system. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] there is a registration process for building designers and in other States there is currently no regulation of the profession. A Building Designers Association operates in each state to represent the interests of building designers.

===Building Surveyor (UK)===
[[Chartered Building Surveyor|Building surveyors]] are technically minded general practitioners in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?idno=121&amp;state=showocc |title=Building surveyor: Job description |publisher=Prospects.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; trained much like [[architectural technologist]]s. In the UK, the knowledge and expertise of the building surveyor is applied to various tasks in the property and construction markets, including building design for smaller residential and light commercial projects. This aspect of the practice is similar to other European occupations, most notably the ''geometra'' in [[Italy]], but also the ''géomètre'' in [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]].
the building surveyors are also capable on establishment of bills of quantities for the new works and renovation or maintenance or rehabilitation works.

The profession of Building Surveyor does not exist in the US. The title ''Surveyor'' refers almost exclusively to [[Surveying|Land surveyors]]. [[Architect]]s, Building Designers, Residential Designers, Construction Managers, and [[Home Inspector]]s perform some or all of the work of the U.K. Building Surveyor.

[[File:Libros de Eloísa Cartonera 2.jpg|thumb|Cartonera books from Eloísa Cartonera.]]
'''Cartonera''' is a social, political and artistic [[publishing]] movement that began in [[Argentina]] in 2003 and has since spread to countries throughout [[Latin America]] and, more recently, to [[Europe]] and [[Africa]]. The founders, [[Washington Cucurto]], Javier Barilaro, and Fernanda Laguna started [[Eloísa Cartonera]] in [[Buenos Aires]] in response to the [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|2001 economic crisis]] during which the [[Argentine peso]] plummeted to one third of its value. The tough economic conditions led to an increase in the number of [[Waste picker|cartoneros]], people who make their living collecting and selling salvaged materials to recycling plants.

Cartonera books are made from cardboard bought from cartoneros at three to five times the price set by recycling plants. The cardboard is then used to create covers for short books of prose or poetry. Each book cover is hand painted and sold on the streets at the cost of production in order to increase access to literature. This method of publication has provided the opportunity for unknown authors to be published, as well as for renowned authors to reach a more diverse audience. Beyond selling affordable books, the cartoneras promote literacy and the democratization of literature through workshops and book fairs which bring the greater public in contact with literature. The cartonera publishers also involve the community in the process of book creation and distribution through a cooperative learning experience which pushes aside educational and socioeconomic divides among participants. The books are generally published in small editions of 100 or fewer; however, popular texts are kept in print or printed through neighboring cartoneras.&lt;ref&gt;Laguna, Fernanda. "No hay cuchillo sin rosas: Historia de una editorial latinoamericana". Buenos Aires: Eloísa Cartonera. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilbija"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.meiotom.art.br/AkademiaCartoneraArticles.pdf |year=2009 |title=Akademia Cartonera: A Primer of Latin American Cartonera Publishers |publisher=Parallel Press / University of Wisconsin–Madison Libraries |editor-last=Bilbija |editor-first=Ksenija |editor2-last=Celis Carbajal |editor2-first=Paloma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the cartoneras publish books in print form, information about the publishing houses themselves is often available electronically through their webpages, blogs, and wikis, or through online newspaper stories, interviews, and journal articles. While digital mediums are often used to write about cartonera, the books themselves are art-objects steeped in the smells and smudges of tempera paint and rough scissor-cut edges. Some cartonera books are now being preserved, most notably through the [https://uwdc.library.wisc.edu/collections/arts/eloisacart/ University of Wisconsin-Madison's Cartonera Publishers library collection and database], but the majority of the editions continue to circulate (as they are intended to do) and will disintegrate within ten years due to acid in the cardboard. As with other digitized databases and guides, the list below includes some of the presently known cartoneras, a number which is always shifting.

'''''Cath Finntrágha'''''&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;Alternative spellings include ''Cath Finntrága'' (Meyer) and ''Cath Fionntrágha''.&lt;/ref&gt; ('''''The Battle of Ventry'''''&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;Alternative English titles include ''The Battle of Ventry / Ventry Harbour/ Ventry Strand / the White Strand''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Early Modern Irish]] prose narrative of the [[Finn Cycle]]. It dates probably to the 15th century in its current form, but apparently relied on older material. It concerns the deeds of the warrior-hero [[Finn mac Cumaill]] and his ''[[fianna]]'' as they defend Ireland against a foreign invasion led by the world-king Dáire Donn.

==Synopsis==
[[Dáire]] (or Dáiri) Donn, called "king of the great world" and ostensibly the most powerful ruler in Europe, intends to invade Ireland. Apart from seeking to gratify a more general ambition to conquer territory, he has a pretext and motif which are directed at [[Finn mac Cumaill]] in person. First of all, Dáire seeks retribution for the fact that Finn has eloped with the wife and daughter of Bolcán (Vulcan), King of France, when in the mercenary service of the latter. Second, Dáire's sense of honour and pride is ignited by stories about Finn's successes. He musters a large body of forces from all across Europe and invades Ireland at ''Finntraighe'' (lit. 'fair strand'), the shore of [[Ventry]] ([[County Kerry]]), near [[Dingle]]. A mighty and protracted battle ensues. Finn's son [[Oisín]] faces Bolcán in combat, who much like [[Buile Shuibhne|Suibne Geilt]], goes insane and flies off, ultimately landing at Glenn Bolcáin. The young son of the King of Ulster arrives with a troop of boys to rally to Finn's support but is killed. It is only when the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] are called in that the Irish become victorious. When Finn slays Dáire Donn and the Greek amazon Ógarmach, the invaders admit defeat and take flight.

==Manuscripts and textual history==
The text in its present form was probably written in the 15th century and is represented by two vellum manuscripts: (1) Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B. 487, 1–11, and (2) Dublin, Royal Irish Academy, MS 29 (''olim'' 23 L 24), 328–337, 355–361. In a note to Rawlinson B. 487, the scribe [[Finnlaech Ó Cathasaigh]] of Tirawley (County Mayo) declares to have composed the tale for Sadbh Ní Mháille (daughter of Tadg Ó Maille), wife of [[Richard MacWilliam Bourke]] (d. 1479).

Earlier allusions to Finn's battle at Ventry suggest that one or several versions of the story were current as early as the 12th century. The event is first referred to in a love-story of the ''[[Acallam na Senórach]]'', in which Finn sets out to meet the enemy in battle, but interrupts the journey to act as a match-maker for Cáel and Créde. During the seventeen days of the battle, the couple offer assistance to Finn, but on the last day, Cáel drowns at sea in pursuit of an opponent and Créde dies of grief.&lt;ref name="ftn3"&gt;''Acallam na Senórach'', tr. Dooley and Roe, pp. 24–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the 15th-century ''Cath Finntrágha'' appears to offer a thoroughly revised tale, which incorporates miscellaneous narrative material from the Finn Cycle, the [[Ulster Cycle]] and the [[Mythological Cycle]]. It has been argued that much of its framework was suggested by the earlier tale ''[[Cath Trága Rudraigi]]'' (''The Battle of Dundrum Bay''), in which [[Norsemen]] forces invade Ireland and do battle at [[Dundrum, County Down|Dundrum Bay]] (County Down).

==Antiquarian commentary==
[[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] provides a number of interesting insights into the Battle of Ventry in his Ordnance Survey letters of 1841. He noted several burial carns near Cantraw, presumed evidence of a great slaughter, along with local claims of finds of many bones and skulls at the east end of the strand. He also noted a boggy area known for the slaughter of the mighty men,  ''Guin na dTreanfhear''.&lt;ref&gt;John O’Donovan in his Ordnance Survey Letters on the Antiquities of the County of Kerry, of 30 July 1841 (ref. 14/C/30/8 (viii) [http://www.askaboutireland.ie/aai-files/assets/ebooks/OSI-Letters/KERRY_14%20C%2030.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chigirie01.jpg|thumb|A modern example of ''chigiri-e'']]
{{Nihongo|'''''Chigiri-e'''''|ちぎり絵}} is a Japanese art form in which the primary technique uses coloured [[paper]] that is torn to create images, and may resemble a water colour painting. The technique dates from the [[Heian period]] of [[History of Japan|Japanese history]] when it was often used in conjunction with calligraphy. Handmade paper is essential for the creation of ''chigiri-e'' images.

==History==
In Japan's Heian period ''chigiri-e'' was used in conjunction with [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]].  [[Japanese poetry|Poems]] were written on a background of either plain or decorated coloured paper, such as in the textural passages of the [[The Tale of Genji#Illustrated scroll|Genji scrolls]].&lt;ref name="jart-baker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japanese Art |last=Stanley-Baker |first=Joan |year=2000 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |isbn=0-500-20326-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century calligraphy paper was usually white or light blue: it could be decorated and coloured and then mounted onto a support.

''Chigiri-e'' has become a popular art form. It can be used to create either realistic images or abstract ones.  Its use in Japan is often decorative, using flowers and landscapes as subject matter. The paper may be coloured by the craftsman paper-maker but many artists colour the paper themselves, using vegetable [[dyes]], coloured inks or powder pigments. The paper most often used is [[Tengujoshi]]: a handmade, long-fibered, very light weight paper (0.03 millimetres thickness).

The craft of paper-making had almost disappeared until, in the early 1900s, a craftsman developed Tengujoshi, one of the strongest and finest papers currently made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kougei.or.jp/english/crafts/1009/d1009-5.html | title = Interviews | accessdate = 2007-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The craft takes three years to learn. This paper, due to its strength, transparency and lightness, is also used for repairing and restoring paintings and other art works. The paper can be made in any range of colors, or may be uncolored.  Although very light weight its long fibres assure its strength. It is made with 100% [[mulberry]] and is sifted through bamboo boards woven with a layer of [[silk]]; only about 100 sheets may be produced in one day. There is also a less-labour-intensive machine-made version of Tengujo paper.

==Themes==
Traditionally Heian calligraphy backgrounds incorporated [[Chinese art|Chinese]] patterns and themes and are often used in [[Ukiyo-e|woodblock]] techniques to achieve them (grasses, bamboo, water).  These themes are still used.  Colorful [[collage]]s could be made with torn (''chigiri-e'') or cut (''kiri-e'') paper.  Some were further decorated with colour pigments or metallic dust. This provides the under-drawing for aristocratic calligraphy.&lt;ref name="jart-baker" /&gt; The combination of texture and transparency results in a characteristic richness of colour. "Colour names and layered colours are woven throughout Heian poetry and literature.  The use of layered colour is also found in clothing in this period.&lt;ref name="dalby-kimono"&gt;{{cite book |title=Kimono |last=Dalby |first=Liza |year=2001 |publisher=Vintage |location=London |isbn=0-09-942899-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many collage techniques found images are used but in chigiri-e the torn paper itself is used to create images.

'''''Chitrochor''''' (English title : Picture Imperfect) is a 1951 [[Bengali language|Bengali]] detective novella, written by [[Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay]]. This story features the famous fictional Bengali [[private investigator]] [[Byomkesh Bakshi]], his assistant-cum-friend Ajit Bandyopadhyay and his wife Satyabati. This place takes place in a picturesque town in the border of north Bengal. This story has been adapted as a film, known as [[Abar Byomkesh]] in 2012, featuring [[Abir Chatterjee]] as Byomkesh Bakshi, and [[Saswata Chatterjee]] as Ajit Bandopadhay.

==Plot==
Byomkesh had fallen critically ill and is being nursed back to health by his wife, Satyabati, and dear friend, Ajit . On medical advice, Byomkesh goes to Dooars to recuperate with his two caring companions. He takes a decided turn for the better with the change in climate, much to the relief of Satyabati and Ajit.

But, as fate would have it, mystery arrives. At Dooars, Byomkesh meets Bengali inhabitants from the local community, including Dr. Ashwini Ghatak, Prof. Adinath Shome, Mahidhar Chaudhury, photographer Nakuleshwar, police officer Purander Pandey, deputy magistrate Umanath Ghosh  and banker Amaresh Raha. They have a get-together at the residence of Mahidhar Chaudhary, where everybody is regaled by the singing of Mahidhar's young daughter Rajani .

The flow of the party is somewhat interrupted by the sudden arrival of Falguni Pal, a poor artist, who has the rare talent of painting anyone's portrait after seeing his subject for only a few minutes. In passing, Mahidhar reports that a robbery had taken place at his house a couple of days back. The thief, however, had ignored all of Mahidhar's riches and stolen only a group photograph of Mahidhar with the other Bengali neighbours. Adding to the odd nature of the situation is that all the others who had a copy of that photograph seem to have misplaced or lost the same. The issue is apparently trivial, but, nonetheless, intrigues the ever-alert Byomkesh.

Matters take a more serious turn when there is yet another attempted robbery, this time, at the house of the deputy magistrate, Umanath Ghosh. Falguni Pal, the artist, is murdered in cold blood.

In yet another twist, Byomkesh finds out that both Adinath Shome and Ashwini Ghatak are romantically inclined towards the beautiful Rajani.

The strange disappearance of that one photograph leads Byomkesh to believe that someone is trying to remove all evidence of his presence in the locality. And after a series of hits and misses, Byomkesh finds out the killer to be the banker, Amaresh Jha. He was trying to flee with the bank's money and used a fake beard, while in the group photograph he was not wearing it. He stole those photographs and killed Falguni as he drew Amaresh's sketch when he was not in his beard. But, to escape jail, he commits suicide in the local station in the presence of Byomkesh and some others. This was most disgusting to Byomkesh as he wanted to catch hold of him alive.

The '''Cincinnati Conservatory of Music''' was a [[College or university school of music|conservatory]], part of a girls' [[finishing school]], founded in 1867 in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 221&lt;/ref&gt; It merged with the [[College of Music of Cincinnati]] in 1955, forming the [[University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music|Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music]], which is now part of the [[University of Cincinnati]].

The Conservatory, founded by '''Clara Baur''', was the first music school in Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;Shotwell, pg. 373&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, Mr. Burnet Corwin Tuthill, General Manager of the Conservatory, instigated the formation of the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] together with five other institutions ([[American Conservatory of Music]], Bush Conservatory of Music, Louisville Conservatory of Music, Pittsburgh Musical Institute, and Walcott Conservatory of Music) at a meeting held on June 10, 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Tuthill, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, Inc., became an institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music on February 1, 1930. Its certificate was signed by the President, Harold L. Bulter and Secretary, Burnet M. Bushelf.

Noted alumni include singer and actor [[Aaron Lazar]], trumpeter [[Al Hirt]], jazz pianist [[Pat Moran McCoy]], singer and entertainer [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], composers [[Harold Morris (composer)|Harold Morris]], [[Conlon Nancarrow]] and Christy Altomare of ''Spring Awakening'' fame, as well as pathologist [[Aldred Scott Warthin]].

Used by [[Sumer|Sumerians]] and other [[Mesopotamian]] cultures beginning in the third millennium BC, '''clay nails''', also referred to as dedication or '''foundation pegs''', cones, or nails, were cone-shaped nails made of [[clay]], inscribed with [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]], baked, and stuck into the mud-brick walls to serve as evidence that the [[temple]] or building was the divine property of the [[god]] to whom it was dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=They Wrote on Clay |author=Edward Chiera |authorlink=Edward Chiera |editor=George G. Cameron |page=93 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1938 |isbn=978-0-226-10425-6 |series=Babylonian Tablets Speak Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Versions were also made of metal, including [[casting]]s with figurative designs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Oscar White Muscarella|Muscarella, Oscar White]], ''Bronze and Iron: Ancient Near Eastern Artifacts in the Metropolitan Museum of Art'', pp. 303-312, 1988, Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|0870995251}}, 9780870995255, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5sxqNhfmcQUC&amp;pg=PA303 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Hurrian foundation pegs]] (Syria, c. 2300 – c. 2159 BCE).

Additionally, uninscribed clay cones painted in different colors were used by Sumerians to create decorative [[mosaic]] patterns on walls and pillars of buildings, which also offered some protection against weathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cone mosaic excavated at the "Columned Hall," Uruk, Mesopotamia |work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/L.1995.48.2 |publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similar [[funerary cone]]s of [[ancient Egypt]] used the cone base as the major writing surface.

As some of the oldest 'documents' in history, the sponsor, responsible for the construction, or dedication of a work, some of the oldest histories, and/or intrigues are recorded. (Boasting sometimes led to historical inaccuracies, or misstatements of facts.)

===King Entemena===
King [[Entemena]]'s nail is a prime example of a clay nail in excellent condition, as well as a detailed story. He was king of [[Lagash]] towards the late-middle of the 3rd millennium BC.

===King Hammurabi===
One of King [[Hammurabi]]'s clay nails was acquired in March 1938 from an antique dealer. The nail, although fully preserved, is missing almost the entire shaft. The head has a diameter of 187 millimeters. In comparison, the shaft at the base is 110 millimeters in diameter. Both the head and shaft are inscribed with cuneiform writing in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. There are three columns of text on the head of the nail; the first column on the upper half having dulled over the course of centuries, and the lower half of the third column broken off. The clay nail bears the number A 24645 at the Oriental Institute, the [[University of Chicago]]'s archaeology museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gelb|first1=I. J.|title=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|journal=Chicago Journals|date=1948|volume=7|issue=4|pages=267–271|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/542219?sid=21105499609531&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739560&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=70 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two replicas of the clay nail with the same inscription located at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]] and the [[Oxford Museum]]. However, each were transliterated and translated differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clay|first1=A. T.|title=The American Journal of Theology|journal=Chicago Journals|date=1916|volume=20|issue=3|pages=427–430|jstor=3155663}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philadelphia version is filled with missing text, although the complication was solved with the help of the Chicago version. Simultaneously, the Oxford text gives the Sumerian version. All three clay nails are now preserved in each of their respected locations. They are easily recognized to be from the Hammurabi period due to their distinct style of having a mushroom shape, broad heads, and short shafts.

'''Colonial architecture''' is an architectural style from a mother country that has been incorporated into the buildings of settlements or colonies in distant locations. Colonists frequently built settlements that synthesized the architecture of their countries of origin with the design characteristics of their new lands, creating hybrid designs.&lt;ref name="ovaita"&gt;{{cite book |last=Guaita |first=Ovidio |year=1999 |title=On distant shores: colonial houses around the world |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BRUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=world+colonial+architecture&amp;dq=world+colonial+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=obfkUqKfFIqKiQfB2oFA&amp;redir_esc=y |location= |publisher=Monacelli Press |isbn=9781580930512 |accessdate=January 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spanish Colonial architecture]] is still found in the former colonies of the [[Spanish Empire]] in the [[Americas]] and in the [[Philippines]]. In Mexico, it is found in the [[Historic center of Mexico City]], [[Puebla]], [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]], [[Querétaro]], [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], and [[Morelia]]. [[Antigua Guatemala]] in [[Guatemala]] is also known for its well-preserved Spanish colonial style architecture. Other cities known for Spanish colonial heritage are [[Ciudad Colonial]] of [[Santo Domingo]], the ports of [[Cartagena, Colombia]], and [[Old San Juan]] in [[Puerto Rico]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16683">'''Computer art''' is any [[art]] in which [[computer]]s play a role in production or display of the artwork.  Such art can be an image, sound, animation, [[video]], [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD-ROM]], [[video game]], [[website]], [[algorithm]], [[performance]] or gallery installation. Many traditional disciplines are now integrating [[Digital data|digital]] technologies and, as a result, the lines between traditional works of art and new media works created using computers has been blurred. For instance, an artist may combine traditional [[painting]] with [[algorithm art]] and other digital techniques.   As a result, defining computer art by its end product can thus be difficult.  Computer art is bound to change over time since changes in technology and [[software]] directly affect what is possible.

== The term "computer art" ==
On the title page of the magazine ''Computers and Automation'', January 1963, Edmund Berkeley published a picture by [[Efraim Arazi]] from 1962, coining for it the term "computer art." This picture inspired him to initiate the first [[Computer Art Contest]] in 1963. The annual contest was a key point in the development of computer art up to the year 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/Publication/206|title=Computers and Automation - Database of Digital Art|author=|date=|website=dada.compart-bremen.de|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Franke: ''Grenzgebiete der bildenden Kunst, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart'' In: ''Katalog'', 1972, S. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Wiki.picture by drawing machine 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Desmond Paul Henry]], Picture by Drawing Machine 1, c. 1960]]
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

The precursor of computer art dates back to 1956–1958, with the generation of what is probably the first image of a human being on a computer screen, a ([[George Petty]]-inspired)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_first_ever_computer_art_was_made_possible_by_the_cold_war_and_it_was_a |title=Boobs not bombs: The first ever computer art was made possible by the Cold War... &amp; it was a girly pic |publisher=Dangerous Minds |date=2013-01-25 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pin-up]] girl at a [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] air defense installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/the-never-before-told-story-of-the-worlds-first-computer-art-its-a-sexy-dame/267439/ |title=The Never-Before-Told Story of the World's First Computer Art (It's a Sexy Dame) |author= Benj Edwards |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desmond Paul Henry]] invented the Henry Drawing Machine in 1960; his work was shown at the Reid Gallery in London in 1962, after his machine-generated art won him the privilege of a one-man exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=O'Hanrahan, Elaine |year=2005 |title=Drawing Machines: The machine produced drawings of Dr. D. P. Henry in relation to conceptual and technological developments in machine-generated art (UK 1960–1968). Unpublished MPhil. Thesis. |publisher=John Moores University, Liverpool}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Beddard |first1=Honor |title=Computer art at the V&amp;A |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/research-journal/issue-02/computer-art-at-the-v-and-a/ |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s, most individuals involved in the creation of computer art were in fact engineers and scientists because they had access to the only computing resources available at university scientific research labs. Many artists tentatively began to explore the emerging computing technology for use as a creative tool. In the summer of 1962, [[A. Michael Noll]] programmed a digital computer at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey to generate visual patterns solely for artistic purposes .&lt;ref&gt;Noll, A. Michael, “The Beginnings of Computer Art in the United States: A Memoir,” ''Leonardo'', Vol. 27, No. 1, (1994), pp. 39-44.&lt;/ref&gt; His later computer-generated patterns simulated paintings by [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Bridget Riley]] and became classics.&lt;ref name="design.osu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/PDFs/dietrich-leonardo.pdf|format=PDF|title= Visual Intelligence: The First Decade of Computer Art |accessdate=2008-04-28 |author=Dietrich, Frank |year= 1986 |pages= 159–169|publisher=Leonardo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noll also used the patterns to investigate aesthetic preferences in the mid-1960s.

The two early exhibitions of computer art were held in 1965: Generative Computergrafik, February 1965, at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, Germany, and Computer-Generated Pictures, April 1965, at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York. The Stuttgart exhibit featured work by [[Georg Nees]]; the New York exhibit featured works by Bela Julesz and A. Michael Noll and was reviewed as art by ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Stuart, “Art ex Machina,” ''The New York Times'', Sunday, April 18, 1965, p. X23.&lt;/ref&gt; A third exhibition was put up in November 1965 at Galerie Wendelin Niedlich in Stuttgart, Germany, showing works by [[Frieder Nake]] and Georg Nees. Analogue computer art by Maughan Mason along with digital computer art by Noll were exhibited at the AFIPS Fall Joint Computer Conference in Las Vegas toward the end of 1965.

In 1968, the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (ICA) in London hosted one of the most influential early exhibitions of computer art called [[Cybernetic Serendipity]]. The exhibition included many of whom often regarded as the first digital artists, [[Nam June Paik]], Frieder Nake, Leslie Mezei, Georg Nees, A. Michael Noll, [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]], and [[Charles Csuri]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Raimes, Jonathan. (2006 ) The Digital Canvas, Abrams. {{ISBN|978-0-8109-9236-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, the [[Computer Arts Society]] was founded, also in London.&lt;ref&gt;Page, No. 1, April 1969, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the opening of Cybernetic Serendipity, in August 1968, a symposium was held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, under the title "Computers and visual research".&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Klütsch: [http://www.computerkunst.org/Kluetsch_London_Zagreb.pdf ''The Summer 1968 in London and Zagreb: Starting or End Point for Computer art?''] (PDF 2,19 MB).&lt;/ref&gt; It took up the European artists movement of New Tendencies that had led to three exhibitions (in 1961, 63, and 65) in Zagreb of concrete, kinetic, and constructive art as well as op art and conceptual art. New Tendencies changed its name to "Tendencies" and continued with more symposia, exhibitions, a competition, and an international journal (bit international) until 1973.

[[Katherine Nash]] and Richard Williams published ''Computer Program for Artists: ART 1'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nash, Katherine|author2=Richard H. Williams|title=Computer Program for Artists: ART I|journal=Leonardo |volume= 3|issue=4|date=October 1970|pages=439–442|doi=10.2307/1572264|jstor=1572264|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PARC (company)|Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) designed the first [[Graphical User Interface]] (GUI) in the 1970s. The first [[Macintosh computer]] is released in 1984, since then the GUI became popular. Many graphic designers quickly accepted its capacity as a creative tool.

==Output devices==
Formerly, technology restricted output and print results: early machines used pen-and-ink plotters to produce basic hard copy.

In the early 1960s, the Stromberg Carlson SC-4020 microfilm printer was used at Bell Telephone Laboratories as a plotter to produce digital computer art and animation on 35-mm microfilm. Still images were drawn on the face plate of the cathode ray tube and automatically photographed. A series of still images were drawn to create a computer-animated movie, early on a roll of 35-mm film and then on 16-mm film as a 16-mm camera was later added to the SC-4020 printer.

In the 1970s, the dot matrix printer (which was much like a [[typewriter]]) was used to reproduce varied fonts and arbitrary graphics. The first animations were created by plotting all still frames sequentially on a stack of paper, with motion transfer to 16-mm film for projection.  During the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix printers were used to produce most visual output while microfilm plotters were used for most early animation.&lt;ref name="design.osu.edu"/&gt;

In 1976, the [[inkjet printer]] was invented with the increase in use of personal computers.  The inkjet printer is now the cheapest and most versatile option for everyday digital color output. Raster Image Processing (RIP) is typically built into the printer or supplied as a software package for the computer; it is required to achieve the highest quality output.  Basic inkjet devices do not feature RIP.  Instead, they rely on graphic software to rasterize images.  The [[laser printer]], though more expensive than the inkjet, is another affordable output device available today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Graphic software ==
[[Adobe Systems]], founded in 1982, developed the [[PostScript]] language and digital fonts, making drawing painting and image manipulation software popular. [[Adobe Illustrator]], a vector drawing program based on the [[Bézier curve]] introduced in 1987 and [[Adobe Photoshop]], written by brothers Thomas and John Knoll in 1990 were developed for use on MacIntosh computers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Bruce Wands| title=Art of the digital age| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HguVQgAACAAJ| year=2006| isbn=978-0-500-23817-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and compiled for DOS/Windows platforms by 1993.

== Robot painting ==
A ''robot painting'' is an artwork painted by a robot. It differs from other forms of printing that uses machinery such as [[offset printing]] and [[inkjet printing]], in that the artwork is made up of actual brush strokes and artist grade paints. Many robot paintings are indistinguishable from artist created paintings.

One of the first robot painters was [[AARON]], an artificial intelligence/artist developed by Professor [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]], UCSD, in the mid-1970s. Another pioneer in the field, [[Ken Goldberg]] of UC Berkeley created an 11' x 11' painting machine in 1992. Multiple other robotic painters exist though none are currently mass-produced.

== Neural style transfer ==
[[File:Jimmy Wales in France, with the style of Munch's "The Scream" applied using neural style transfer.jpg|thumb|A [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jimbo_Wales_in_France.jpg photo] of [[Jimmy Wales]] rendered in the style of ''[[The Scream]]'' using neural style transfer]]

Non-photorealistic rendering (using computers to automatically transform images into stylized art) has been a subject of research since the 1990s. Around 2015, ''neural style transfer'' using [[convolutional neural networks]] to transfer the style of an artwork onto a photograph or other target image became feasible&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576&lt;/ref&gt;. One method of style transfer involves using a framework such as VGG or ResNet to break the artwork style down into statistics about visual [[feature (computer vision)|features]]. The target photograph is subsequently modified to match those statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Jing, Y., Yang, Y., Feng, Z., Ye, J., &amp; Song, M. (2017).

[[Image:Embroidery and fabric collage by Esther Nisenthal Krinitz, 1991 .jpg|thumb|right|400px|’On Friday, October 15, 1942, it was the beginning of the end, the somber march of the [[Rachów, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Rachow]] Jews to their deaths’, Embroidery and fabric collage by Esther Nisenthal Krinitz, 1991]]

'''Esther Nisenthal Krinitz''' (1927&amp;ndash;2001) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[artist]].

==The Final Solution==
In September 1939, as a 12-year-old, Esther watched [[Nazi Germany|German]] soldiers arrive in her village of Mniszek, strategically located along the east bank of the [[Vistula River]]. For the next 3 years, German troops used Jewish slave laborers from Mniszek and the nearby city of [[Rachów, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Rachów]] to build roads and bridges for their Eastern campaign. Once the Nazis moved to implement the "[[Final Solution]]", however, the Jews of  Rachów and Mniszek—those who had not already been murdered—were instructed to leave their homes and report to the train station in [[Kraśnik]], about 20 miles away. No one knew where they were going. Many thought they were going to be taken to a [[ghetto]] somewhere. Others whispered darkly of [[death camps]].

Esther was by then 15, the second in a family of 5 children and the oldest girl. Her family had managed to struggle through the German occupation, watching their already-meager livelihood dwindle to nearly nothing. Her father, a horse trader, could no longer travel. Soldiers had taken the last of her mother's geese just as her eggs were about to hatch. The night before their departure, as her family assembled what few belongings remained to them, Esther decided she would not go with them. She turned to her mother for help, insisting that one of the Polish farmers among her father's friends would take her in and give her work. Although at first reluctant to let her go, Esther's mother agreed to give her some provisions and destinations.

As the family said their goodbyes to her, Esther realized she could not carry out her plan by herself and insisted that her 13-year-old sister, Mania, go with her. Mania was reluctant, wanting only to stay with the rest of the family, but Esther was emphatic. On October 15, 1942, her father, Hersh; her mother, Rachel; her older brother, Ruven; and her little sisters, Chana and Leah, set off on the road to Kraśnik. It was the last time Esther saw her family.

==Escape==
Mania was heartbroken and cried to go back to their family. Giving in, Esther turned back with her to the Kraśnik road, filled by now with a stream of [[refugees]]. Esther and Mania joined them, walking with their cousin Dina and her baby past fields and through the [[sandhill]]s of the valley. As they walked on, Esther realized that the next bend in the road would lead to the train station, and she halted in panic, insisting that she could not continue.  At this, their cousin turned to Mania and told her she should leave the road and go with her sister.

Esther and Mania went first to the house of Stefan, a good man who embraced them when they arrived.  But after sheltering them for a couple of days, Stefan told them that the rest of the village knew where they were and that the [[Gestapo]] would soon come looking for them. In tears, he put them out of his house.

Knowing now that it was not safe for them to be seen, Esther and Mania waited in the forest until the rain ended and their clothes dried.  While they waited, Esther devised a plan: They would make their way to another village where they were not known. There, they would say that they had come from the northern part of Poland, where their family, like others in the region, had lost its farm to a German family. With their digging tools in sacks across their shoulders, they would ask for work in harvesting potatoes.

==Grabówka==
They eventually came to the village of Grabówka. Pretending to be a [[Polish Catholic Church|Polish Catholic]] girl named Josephina, Esther found work with an old farmer whose wife was ill and bedridden.  Mania also became a housekeeper, for the village's sheriff and his mother.  Until 1944, Esther and Mania cooked, cleaned, cared for animals, helped in the fields, went to church, and lived out the daily lives of two Polish farm girls.

Although the Germans did not have a camp in the village, the Gestapo were stationed nearby and soldiers came and went in the village frequently, commandeering food and other supplies as they needed them. They also took young people for labor camps, now that the Jews had been eliminated. So even though she was assumed to be Polish, Esther was still forced to run up to the attic of the barn to hide when the Germans were seen to be in the village.

In May 1944, after both the farmer and his wife had died and Esther was living on the farm by herself, an old soldier in Grabówka, a veteran of the First World War, told his neighbors that he could hear artillery fire in the distance to the east. The Russians were pushing the Germans back across Poland, and the old soldier predicted that the front would be in their village within a few days. Under his direction, the neighbors dug out a [[bunker]] and prepared to go below. The battle front arrived as predicted, and the neighbors spent a night in the bunker as the German and Russian artillery engaged on the ground immediately above them.

==Liberation==
That day, at sunset, a platoon of [[USSR|Soviet]] soldiers arrived in Grabówka. Esther and her neighbors ran to greet them.  After waiting 2 weeks, Esther left for Mniszek to see who else had returned. When she arrived in Mniszek, her former neighbors were shocked to see her. Only a few other Jews had come back. All the rest were rumored to have been taken to a death camp nearby called [[Majdanek]]. Unable to find the rest of her family, Esther decided to join the [[Polish Army]], then continuing on its way west to [[Warsaw]] under [[Marshal Zhukov]]'s command.

Before she left, Esther set out to see Majdanek for herself. The Polish Army had taken over the camp, and soldiers who had been there for a while served as guides, taking new recruits around to point out the horrors inflicted by the Nazis.  Esther noticed the enormous cabbages growing in the fields around the [[crematorium]], later learning that it had been the dumping site for ashes.

With Marshal Zhukov's army, Esther eventually arrived in Germany.

==After the war==
After the war ended in 1945, Esther returned to Grabówka to get Mania and in 1946, the two of them returned to Germany, making their way to a [[Displaced Persons]] camp in the favored [[American Zone]], in the city of [[Ziegenheim]]. She met Max Krinitz there and, in November 1946, married him in a ceremony conducted in the camp. The following year, pregnant with their first child, Esther joined Max in [[Belgium]], where he had gone to work in the coal mines. While in Belgium, he contacted a cousin who lived in the United States and she agreed to arrange for sponsorship of his [[immigration]]. In June 1949, Esther, Max and their daughter arrived in New York.

==Return to Poland==
In June 1999, exactly 50 years after she left Europe, Esther returned to Mniszek to see what remained. The landscape of central Poland had not changed: farmers driving horse-drawn wooden wagons, red and yellow fields of poppy and mustard, women carrying baskets overflowing with ripe strawberries. Both in Mniszek and Grabówka, Esther met again with friends and neighbors from her childhood. "Yes, it was just like that!" they said when she showed them photographs of her art.

Immediately following her return from Poland, Esther became seriously ill; she died in 2001 at the age of 74.

==Pictures==
Esther Nisenthal Krinitz began her series of fabric pictures in 1977, with a depiction of her home and family in Mniszek. Although trained as a [[dressmaker]] and highly skilled in [[needlework]], Esther had no training in art and no conception of herself as an artist. Yet her first picture was so well received by her family and friends and was so personally satisfying that Esther went on to do another, also of her childhood home.

The next subjects for her art were two dreams she had had while hiding in Grabówka. Each dream—one in which her grandfather had appeared to her and another in which her mother came for her—had left singular vivid images in Esther's memory, and translating them into pictures was an important accomplishment for her. Once the dream sequence was completed, Esther decided to begin a narrative series that grew increasingly complex. With the addition of text, her art became illustrations of Esther's story of survival.

==Art and Remembrance==
[http://www.artandremembrance.org Art and Remembrance] is traveling an exhibit of Esther Nisenthal Krinitz's to museums in the United States, and in the future hopes to bring the art to Poland, Israel and other countries that share the legacy of the Holocaust. The entire collection began its public exhibitions at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland and has subsequently been exhibited at more than a dozen museums in the US [http://www.artandremembrance.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.showPost&amp;contentID=127]. In 2012, it returned to the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, where it will stay until September 1, 2013.  Future exhibits include the Florida Holocaust Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida and the Evansville Museum of Art and Science in Evansville, Indiana.

In 2011, Art and Remembrance completed the 30-minute documentary film, "Through the Eye of the Needle: The Art of Esther Nisenthal Krinitz." The film tells the story of her harrowing experiences surviving the Holocaust in Poland and how she came to create an amazing and beautiful narrative in embroidery and fabric collage through images of Esther’s artwork, and the story in her own voice, as well as interviews with family members and others.

"Trained as a dressmaker but with no training in art, Esther picked up a needle and thread, intending simply to show her children all that she had gone through. Yet the art she created -- both beautiful and shocking -- is universal in its appeal, expressing deep love of family and personal courage in the face of terror and loss," says the Smithsonian.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Fabric-of-Survival-The-Art-of-Esther-Nisenthal-Krinitz-4765&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Etiology''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; alternatively '''aetiology''' or '''ætiology''') is the study of [[Causality|causation]], or origination. The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἰτιολογία}}, ''aitiología'', "giving a reason for" ({{lang|grc|αἰτία}}, ''aitía'', "cause"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logía]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aetiology | work = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-521942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|etiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is commonly used in [[medicine]], (where it is a branch of medicine studying causes of disease) and in [[philosophy]], but also in [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[Forms of government|government]], [[geography]], [[spatial analysis]], [[theology]], and [[biology]], in reference to the causes or origins of various [[phenomena]].

In the past, when many physical phenomena were not well understood or when histories were not recorded, [[myth]]s often arose to provide etiologies. Thus, an etiological myth, or [[origin myth]], is a myth that has arisen, been told over time or written to explain the origins of various social or natural phenomena. For example, [[Virgil]]'s [[Aenead]] is a [[national myth]] written to explain and glorify the origins of the [[Roman Empire]]. In [[theology]], many religions have [[creation myths]] explaining the origins of the world or its relationship to believers.

==Medicine==
{{Main|Cause (medicine)}}
In medicine, the etiology of an illness or condition refers to the frequent studies to determine one or more  factors that come together to cause the illness. Relatedly, when disease is widespread, [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies investigate what associated factors, such as location, sex, exposure to chemicals, and many others, make a population more or less likely to have an illness, condition, or disease, thus helping determine its etiology. Sometimes determining etiology is an imprecise process. In the past, the etiology of a common sailor's disease, [[scurvy]] was long unknown. When large, ocean-going ships were built, sailors began to put to sea for long periods of time, and often lacked fresh fruit and vegetables. Without knowing the precise cause, [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook]] suspected scurvy was caused by the lack of vegetables in the diet.  Based on his suspicion, he forced his crew to eat [[sauerkraut]], a cabbage preparation, every day, and based upon the positive outcomes, he [[inferred]] that it prevented scurvy, even though he did not know precisely why. It took about another two hundred years to discover the precise etiology: the lack of [[vitamin C]] in a sailor's diet.

== Mythology ==
{{Main|Origin myth}}
An etiological myth, or origin myth, is a [[mythology|myth]] intended to explain the origins of cult practices, natural phenomena, proper names and the like. For example, the name [[Delphi]] and its associated deity, ''[[Apollo|Apollon Delphinios]]'', are explained in the [[Homeric Hymn]] which tells of how Apollo, in the shape of a [[dolphin]] (''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphis}}''),  propelled [[Crete|Cretans]] over the seas to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word ''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphus}}'' ("womb"), many etiological myths are similarly based on [[folk etymology]] (the term "[[Amazons|Amazon]]", for example). In the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (published circa 17 BC), [[Virgil]] claims the descent of [[Augustus Caesar]]'s [[Julian clan]] from the hero [[Aeneas]] through his son [[Ascanius]], also called Iulus. The story of [[Prometheus]]' sacrifice [[trick at Mecone]] in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' relates how Prometheus tricked [[Zeus]] into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', the origin of the color of mulberries is explained, as the white berries become stained red from the blood gushing forth from their double suicide.

''Film à clef'' is the film equivalent of the literary ''[[roman à clef]]'', and the two share the same techniques.&lt;ref name="id.l_Film"/&gt;

Many ''films à clef'' are [[biopic]]s of Hollywood personalities.&lt;ref name="id.l_Film"/&gt;

'''''Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts''''' was a [[literary magazine]] founded in 1962 by the poet [[Ed Sanders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Laura Martisiute|title=10 Cool Magazines From The Past You’ll Want To Get Your Hands On|url=http://listverse.com/2015/12/28/10-cool-magazines-from-the-past-youll-want-to-get-your-hands-on/|accessdate=December 9, 2016|work=Listverse|date=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York City. Sanders later co-founded the musical group [[The Fugs]]. Sanders produced thirteen issues of ''Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts'' from 1962 to 1965.&lt;ref name="Haralson2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric L. Haralson|title=Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noCrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA402|accessdate=December 4, 2015|date=January 21, 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-76322-2|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The credo for the magazine, originated by Sanders, was ''I'll print anything.'' Its first issue contained the following dedication: "Dedicated to [[Pacifism]], [[Unilateral disarmament|Unilateral Disarmament]], [[National security|National Defense]] thru [[Nonviolent resistance|Nonviolent Resistence]] [sic], Multilateral Indiscriminate Apertural Conjugation, [[Anarchism]], [[World Federalism]], [[Civil Disobedience]], Obstructers &amp; Submarine Boarders, and All Those [[Groping|Groped]] by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] in the Silent Halls of Congress."&lt;ref name="no1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cdn.realitystudio.org/images/bibliographic_bunker/fuck_you/fuck-you-press-pdfs/fuck-you.01.pdf|title=Fuck You/A Magazine of the Arts|number=1|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts'' was produced on a [[mimeograph]] and printed on multi-colored [[construction paper]].

==Legacy==
''Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts'' was a core publication in the [[Mimeo Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realitystudio.org/bibliographic-bunker/fuck-you-press-archive/ |title=RealityStudio website: Fuck You Press Archive|work=Reality Studio|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dedicated to [[free expression]], and especially defying the [[taboo]]s around sex and drugs, advocating free love [[promiscuity]] and the use of [[psychedelics]] long before those were picked up by the more widespread countercultural movements of the late Sixties. Ed Sanders and his collaborators served as a bridge between the [[Beat generation]] of the Fifties and the later [[Hippie]] [[counterculture]] of the mid Sixties.

== Shot ==
In the photo, Jangju is crawling through muddy ground of the marshes in south of Iran while he is holding a rifle in ready state.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; The photograph became viral and was published in several media outlet both due to the special style of the soldier and it also attracted a lot of attention since the family name of the boy, "Jangju" meaning Warrior in Persian language was a good fit for the picture.&lt;ref name="Pars"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran, dopo 37 anni trovato il corpo di un soldato|url=http://parstoday.com/it/news/iran-i112875-iran_dopo_37_anni_trovato_il_corpo_di_un_soldato|website=Pars Today|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=it-IT|date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Yaghobzadeh]] was working for the Gamma and Associated Press news agencies at the time of capturing the famous photograph. The same photo used as a propaganda for recruiting volunteers by Iranian authorities during war time and afterwards.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

== Background ==
Jangju was a volunteer [[Basij]]i.&lt;ref name="Pars" /&gt; He was killed in February 1984 during [[Operation Kheibar]], part of the Battle of the Marshes, when Iran sent soldiers back over the Iraqi border, before they too became bogged down north of Basra.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

== Funeral and aftermath ==
The remains of his body was discovered and identified in the former Iran-Iraq war zone and sent back to Tabriz after 34 years on September 5, 2017. On September 6, 2017 the coffin of Hassan Jangju, which was draped in the Iranian flag, was borne through the streets by a huge crowd and laid to rest with full military honours. The ceremony for condolences to the Jangju's family was led by [[Ali Larijani]], speaker of the Iranian parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=مراسم تشییع پیکر شهید تازه شناسایی شده"حسن جنگجو" برگزار شد+تصاویر|url=http://tn.ai/1512409 |website=خبرگزاری تسنیم - Tasnim|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=مادر شهید جنگجو در روز تشییع پسرش دار فانی را وداع گفت|url=http://tn.ai/1512402 |website=خبرگزاری تسنیم - Tasnim|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours after the funeral, his mother Jeyran Pourali died.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; Jangju's family described how the mother would lay out his clothes on a chair at the dinner table every evening, resembling his presence at home.

'''Henryk Pillati''' (19 January 1832 in [[Warsaw]] – 16 April 1894 in Warsaw) was a Polish illustrator, caricaturist and history painter, in the [[Classicism|Classical]] style.

== Biography ==
He was born to a wealthy family. In 1845, at the age of only thirteen, he entered the {{ill|School of Fine Arts (Warsaw)|pl|Szkoła Sztuk Pięknych w Warszawie|lt=School of Fine Arts}} in Warsaw. Three years later, both of his parents died during a [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics#Second, 1829–51|cholera epidemic]]. This forced him to leave school and find work to support his surviving younger siblings.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[http://www.pinakoteka.zascianek.pl/Pillati/Pillati_bio.htm Biographical notes] @ Pinakoteka.&lt;/ref&gt;

He managed to get by selling small paintings of [[Genre art|genre]] scenes and episodes from the [[Polish-Swedish wars]]. From 1852 to 1853, he created a series of large canvases, designed for decorating steamships owned by Count [[Andrzej Artur Zamoyski]], on the [[Vistula River]]. The ships were later confiscated by the Russians during the [[January Uprising]].&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

Later, he received private scholarships that enabled him to spend a year studying at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris. Four years later, he continued his studies at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], then spent some time in Rome.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

After 1860, although he continued to paint historical scenes, he was primarily engaged in providing illustrations for books (notably works by [[Adam Mickiewicz]] and [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]]) and several periodicals in Warsaw, including the ''[[Tygodnik Ilustrowany]]'', ''{{ill|Kłosy (magazine)|pl|Kłosy (czasopismo)|lt=Kłosy}}'' (Ears), ''{{ill|Wędrowiec|pl|Wędrowiec (czasopismo)}}'' (The Wanderer) and ''{{ill|Biesiada Literacka|pl}}'' (Literary Feast).&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.agraart.pl/nowe/artists/pillati-henryk-polska-agra-art-aukcje-obrazy-antyki.html Brief biography] @ Agra Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, he moved to Saint Petersburg to work for a publishing house, but his increasing alcoholism ruined his health to the point that his younger brother, {{ill|Ksawery Pillati|pl|lt=Ksawery}}, who was also a painter, had to bring him home, where he spent his final years living in the residence of the Warsaw Charitable Society. His life was later given fictional treatment in the novel ''Malaria'' by {{ill|Wiktor Gomulicki|pl}}.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

'''Katherine Milhous''' (1894–1977) was an [[American people |American]] artist, illustrator, and writer. She is known best as the author and illustrator of ''[[The Egg Tree]]'', which won the 1951 [[Caldecott Medal]] for U.S. picture book illustration. Born into a [[Quaker]] family active in the [[printing]] industry in Philadelphia, Milhous is also known for her graphic designs for the [[Works Progress Administration]](WPA). Her work has been exhibited at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].

==Life==
Katherine Milhous was born November 27, 1894, to Osborn and Katherine Daly Milhous of Philadelphia, Quakers who made their living as printers. When she was young they moved  to [[Pitman, New Jersey]], a small camp-meeting town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Our Town | work = Pittman, NJ | url = http://members.tripod.com/~passinthru_2/pitman.htm| accessdate = 2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Philadelphia to attend the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] and the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Poster of an Amish Family, Pennsylvania|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9569/|work=Work Projects Administration Poster Collection|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milhous helped support her schooling by illustrating magazines. In 1934, while at the Academy of Fine Arts, she won the Cresson Traveling Fellowship, which allowed her to study overseas. She then returned to Philadelphia where, for forty years, she shared a studio with friend and fellow-artist Frances Lichten.&lt;ref name=freelibrary&gt;{{cite web | title = Katherine Milhous and Frances Lichten Papers| work = Free Library of Philadelphia | url = http://libwww.freelibrary.org/ead/view.cfm?name=Milhous | accessdate = 2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1935 to 1940 Milhous was a supervisor for the Philadelphia [[Federal Art Project]] (FAP), a branch of the [[Works Progress Administration]].&lt;ref name=WDL1/&gt; Among her duties was the creation of posters promoting Pennsylvania. She incorporated familiar [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] designs into her posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Purchase Posters | work = Kate Milhous | url =http://postersforthepeople.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=kate+milhous&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |accessdate = 2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alice Dalgliesh]], head of the Children's Book division of [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Charles Scribner's &amp; Sons]], saw Milhous' posters during an exhibition in an FAP gallery, and hired her as a staff designer. Milhous co-wrote and illustrated several books with Dalgliesh, who was also an award-winning children's writer. She also illustrated for others, as well as writing and illustrating her own books.&lt;ref name=freelibrary/&gt;

Milhous was a member of the [[AIGA|American Institute of Graphic Arts]]. She died in Philadelphia on December 5, 1977. Her papers are held in the University of Minnesota [[University of Minnesota Libraries#Library buildings and collections | Children's Literature Research Collection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Katherine Milhous Collection | work = University of Minnesota| url = 
http://special.lib.umn.edu/findaid/xml/CLRC-58.xml| accessdate = 2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Free Library of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=freelibrary/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Milhous' books were generally well received by reviewers, both for their writing and their illustrations. ''Appalonia's Valentine'' was called "distinguished… original and beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Books for Young People | work = The Saturday Review | url = 
http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1954feb13-00052| accessdate = 2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''Patrick and the Golden Slippers'', about Philadelphia's Mummers' Parade, the same magazine wrote "This is a picture book of enduring value to young Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Autumn Color | work = The Saturday Review | url = http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1951oct20-00038 | accessdate = 2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her Caldecott Medal-winning ''The Egg Tree'', "Her use of bright [[tempera]] paints brought to life the bold borders and vibrant pages of the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Biography of Katherine Milhous| work = by Miranda Orso | url = http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Milhous__Katherine.html | accessdate = 2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alabama ===
In 1985, [[University of Alabama]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] began to offer a master's degree in the book arts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookarts.ua.edu/ University of Alabama book arts program]&lt;/ref&gt; in the School of Library and Informational Studies. It emphasizes making books by hand.

The CODEX Foundation, founded in 2005 and located in Berkeley, holds The CODEX International Symposium and Artists' Book Fair every two years in early February, on the odd year.  It is the largest artists' book fair in the world with over 300 artists coming from more than 26 countries.

Their mission also carries with it a deep obligation to publish in an affordable format essays, manifestos, and theoretical writings that serve to promote and contextualize the work of contemporary artists of the book. The editorial strategy is to publish exemplary materials that showcase the state of the art of the book worldwide, and to provide a broader public platform for the artists, writers, and printers whose art, craft, and livelihoods depend largely on a healthy commercial environment for their work. To support its mission they have published Book Art Object Vol.s 1 &amp; 2 devoted to the exhibitors and symposia proceedings of CODEX events, both volumes are considered as valuable books of reference for the field, 14 Code(X)+1 monographs devoted to critical theory, and Alchimie du Verbe and Mapping the Artist’s Cosmos box set Assembly-Exchanges, original prints from 52 renowned book artists and printers.

The '''''Madonna Standing''''' (or '''''Madonna al latte''''') is a small painting by the Flemish artist [[Rogier van der Weyden]] dating from about 1430–1432. It is the left panel of a diptych held in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] (KHM), Vienna since 1772. The right panel portrays [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine]] and is also attributed by the KHM to van der Weyden, but is inferior in quality and generally regarded as by a workshop member.&lt;ref name= "Catherine"&gt;Panofsky, p. 251 and n. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel shows the Madonna and Child standing in a painted niche. The architecture of the [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]'s contains biblical and heavenly figures rendered in [[grisaille]], including [[God the Father]], the [[Holy Spirit]] represented by a dove, and Adam and Eve. The painting is influenced by [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Ghent altarpiece]], which the younger artist probably saw after he moved to Ghent around 1432. Borrowings from van Eyck include the positioning of a living figure in a [[niche (architecture)|niche]], separating Adam and Eve across panels, and placing figure of God leaning on the frame.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, 354&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - Prado P02722.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The ''[[Durán Madonna]]'', oil on oak wood, ''circa'' 1435–1438. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.]]

The painting is a ''[[Nursing Madonna|Madonna Lactans]]''. The Madonna and Child stand in a space delimited by the rich brocade of the throne at the back and the delicate curtain of tracery in the front, a flattening of the picture space into a kind of relief regarded by Panofsky as already unmistakably Rogerian.&lt;ref name= "description"/&gt; It was a technique he would further refine in his ''[[Durán Madonna]]'' of 1435–1438. In this work, Mary holds the child in her arms as he suckles at her breast. The blue colour of her robe may allude to her devotion and fidelity to her son. She is wearing a crown, positioning her as [[Queen of Heaven]]. The Child is unclothed save for a white linen cloth, foreshadowing the shroud in which his body was later placed following the [[Descent from the Cross|Deposition]].&lt;ref name="b329"&gt;Birkmeyer, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

The niche around the central couple contains a number of biblical figures in grisaille. [[God the Father]] is shown at the centre top, just above the niche's concave [[Molding (decorative)|moulding]]. He is depicted in frontal [[Perspective (graphical)|foreshortening]], giving the impression that He is emerging from the clouds around Him. He seems to lean forward with one hand raised in blessing and the other resting on the frame, the latter a device likely borrowed from the depiction of the prophet [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]] in the right [[lunette]] on the exterior of the Ghent altarpiece. In both depictions the father is shown directly above Mary, looking down at her and resting on the painting's frame.&lt;ref name="b330"&gt;Birkmeyer, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; In the current panel, a dove hovers above Mary, symbolising the [[Holy Spirit]].

To Mary's left and right are the figures of Adam and Eve, referencing the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Redemption]].&lt;ref&gt;Acres, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Eve stands underneath an apple tree, with a large serpent with a human head coiling its body around its trunk. She eats from the [[forbidden fruit]], indicating that she is depicted at the moment of the [[fall of man]]. However Roger avoids providing the work with a narrative element by reversing the typical portrayal of the first couple; Adam is to the left, Eve to the right. Unusually for art to this point, they stand apart, divided on either side of the imitation pictorial frame. Again, this is likely borrowed from the Ghent altarpiece, where the couple are separated by five panels.&lt;ref name="b331"&gt;Birkmeyer, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; The lions on the armrests of the chair behind Mary show that she is standing in front of a [[Throne of Solomon]], as is also depicted in [[Jan van Eyck | Jan Eyck's]] ''[[Lucca Madonna]]'' recalling the [[Seat of Wisdom]] tradition.&lt;ref name="b329" /&gt;

By portraying the ancillary figures in grisaille, Rogier is making a distinction between the earthly, who are rendered as in flesh, and the divine, depicted frozen in time, as imitation sculpture.&lt;ref name="b331" /&gt;

==Dating==
This painting along with the '' [[Virgin and Child Enthroned (van der Weyden) |Virgin and Child Enthroned]]'' are generally cited as the earliest known works by van der Weyden.&lt;ref name = "Ward"&gt;Ward, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] suggested he produced them while still in the workshop of [[Robert Campin]]. John Ward of the [[University of Florida]] suggests he executed the ''Madonna Standing'' after leaving Campin's studio to travel to [[Ghent]] where he likely saw [[Jan van Eyck]]'s newly completed ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' which is signed and dated May 6, 1432.&lt;ref name= "description"&gt;Panofsky, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt;

Karl Birkmeyer, noting the many borrowing from van Eyck, believes that the panel was completed after Rogier left his apprenticeship. He draws on documentary evidence that the artist did not leave Campin's studio until August 1, 1432, and offers that the technical and compositional skill of the work already indicates the ability and creative freedom of a master craftsman. Birkmeyer goes on to distinguish how the borrowing of motifs are not merely echoes, and that Rogier builds on them and absorbs them into his own expressive language. Many of the motifs he was to return to in more mature works; notably in the heightened abstraction of the ''[[Durán Madonna]]''.&lt;ref name="b331" /&gt;

The '''Malvern Wells War Memorial''' is located on Wells Road in the village of [[Malvern Wells]] near [[Great Malvern]] in Worcestershire. The memorial marks the deaths of local individuals who died fighting in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. It was dedicated in June 1920 by [[Lieutenant Colonel W R Chichester]] in the aftermath of the First World War. A a further inscription was later added to mark the Second World War. The memorial is a tall thin [[Portland stone]] octagonal pillar topped by a sculpture of a [[pelican]] [[Attitude (heraldry)#Vulning / In her Piety|vulning herself]], a heraldic and [[Pelican#Christianity|Christian symbol of sacrifice]].&lt;ref name="MalPC"&gt;Malvern Wells Parish Council: War Memorial [http://www.malvernwells-pc.gov.uk/parish-council/parish-assets/35-malvern-wells-war-memorial Malvern Wells Parish Council], accessdate: January 3, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IWM"&gt;War Memorial: Malvern Wells (WMR-32991): [http://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/32991 War Memorial: Malvern Wells (WMR-8111)], accessdate: January 2, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial was designed by the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] architect and designer [[Charles Voysey (architect)|C.F.A. Voysey]]. It has been [[Listed building#England and Wales|Grade II listed]] on the [[National Heritage List for England]] since June 1973.&lt;ref name="IWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHLE&gt;{{NHLE|num=1082759|desc=War Memorial|access-date=3 January 2018|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voysey's only other free standing war memorial, the [[Potters Bar war memorial]], was designed in 1920.&lt;ref name=NHLEPot&gt;{{NHLE|num=1174621|desc=The War Memorial, St John's Churchyard|access-date=3 January 2018|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No names are recorded on the memorial, this was a deliberate decision to represent the many local people wounded but not killed in the war.&lt;ref name="MalPC"/&gt; It was built at a cost of £800-900.&lt;ref name="IWM"/&gt;

==Inscription==
The memorial is inscribed:
{{Quote|1914-1918 / IN THANKFULNESS TO GOD FOR VICTORY &amp; IN HONOUR OF DEVOTION, SELF-SACRIFICE &amp; GLORIOUS ACHIEVEMENT / ALSO IN MEMORY OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR 1939-1945&lt;ref name="IWM"/&gt;}}

Major temples inhabited by a divine triad could be completed by a [[peristyle]]-surrounded mammisi, in which the goddess of the triad would give birth to the son of the triad itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The son, whose divine birth was celebrated annually, was associated with the Pharaoh (even in the [[Hieros gamos|hierogamy]] scenes on the walls).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Taweret]], [[Raet-Tawy]] and the Seven [[Hathor]]s who presided over [[childbirth]] were particularly revered here, but it is equally common to find references to [[Bes]], [[Khnum]] and [[Osiris]] himself as [[List of fertility deities|fertility deities]].

The most important surviving examples — in [[Dendera]], [[Edfu]], [[Kom Ombo]], [[Philae]], [[El Kab]], [[Athribis]], [[Armant, Egypt|Armant]], the [[Dakhla Oasis]] etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; — are from the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman]] periods in [[Egypt]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Wilkinson|Wilkinson, Richard H.]] (2000). ''The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; but the first one, in Dendera, dates back to the [[Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt|30th dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Nectanebo I]] (379/378–361/360 BC), one of the last native rulers of Egypt. Equipped with a [[hypostyle]] by Pharaoh [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]] (181–145 BC) and with a peristyle by [[Ptolemy X Alexander I]] (110–88 BC), it was dedicated to Harsiese ("Horus son of [[Isis]]").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This 30th dynasty project was then repeated, by the Græco-Roman rulers, for some of the major shrines in the country.

The famous Roman mammisi — the less ancient one associated with the Dendera Temple complex — was built by [[Augustus]] immediately after [[Battle of Actium|his conquest of Egypt]] (31 BC). The murals show Augustus' far successor [[Trajan]] at the sacrificial ceremony for Hathor and are among the most beautiful in Egypt. The mammisi was dedicated to Hathor and her child [[Ihy]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On the [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]] above the pillar capitals are representations of Bes as the patron god of birth.  &lt;gallery mode="nolines" widths="200" heights="160"&gt;

[[File:École des beaux-arts (from the live).jpg|thumb|240px|Male model posing at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in the 19th century]]
An '''art [[Model (person)|model]]''' poses for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]], providing a visual reference for the human figure in a [[work of art]]. However, more than being simply the subject of art, models are often thought of as [[muses]], a source of inspiration without whom the art would not exist.&lt;ref name="Steinhart"&gt;
{{cite book| author=Steinhart, Peter |year=2004| title=The Undressed Art: Why We Draw| publisher=Alfred A. Knopf| location=New York| isbn=1-4000-4184-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common types of art works that use models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Art models are often paid [[professional]]s with skill and experience but are rarely employed full-time, and artists may also rely on friends and family to pose. Paid art models are usually anonymous and unacknowledged subjects of the work. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of artists that gather to share the expense of a model. Models are also employed privately by professional artists.  Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. For example, [[Norman Rockwell]] used his friends and neighbors as models for both his commercial and fine art work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2012/11/16/art-entertainment/norman-rockwell-art-entertainment/chuck-marsh.html|title=A Day in the Life of Norman Rockwell Model Chuck Marsh|author=Denny, Diana|accessdate= November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual who is having their own portrait painted or sculpted is usually called a "sitter" rather than a model, since they are paying to have the work done rather than being paid to pose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2625544/Lucian-Freud-portrait-worth-millions-destroyed-by-sitter.html|title=Lucian Freud portrait worth millions destroyed by sitter|author=Pierce, Andrew|year=2008|accessdate=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sitter|title=sitter|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|accessdate=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the history of Western art, drawing the human figure from living models was considered the most effective way to develop the skill of draftsmanship. First, it is best to draw from life, rather than copying two dimensional images such as photographs.&lt;ref name="Nicolaides"&gt;{{cite book| author=Nicolaides, Kimon| year=1975| title=The Natural Way to Draw| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co.| location=Boston| isbn=0-395-20548-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, an artist has a connection to drawing another human being that cannot exist with any other subject.&lt;ref name="Berry"&gt;{{cite book| author=Berry, William A.| year=1977| title=Drawing the Human Form: A Guide to Drawing from Life| page=4| publisher=Van Nortrand Reinhold Co.| location=New York| isbn=0-442-20717-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite book| last=Jacobs| first=Ted Seth| year=1986| title=Drawing with an Open Mind| publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications| location=New York| isbn=0-8230-1464-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Models for life drawing classes are usually [[Nude (art)|nude]]. In the [[classroom]] setting, where the purpose is to learn how to [[drawing|draw]] the [[Human figure|human form]] in all the different shapes, ages and ethnicity, there are no real limitations on who the model can be. In some cases, the model may pose with various [[Theatrical properties|props]], one or more other models, against real or artificial background, in natural or artificial light.

The role of art models has changed through different eras as the meaning and importance of the human figure in art and society has changed.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite book| author=Clark, Kenneth| year=1956| title=The Nude - A Study in Ideal Form: Chapter 1. ''The Naked and the Nude''| publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton| isbn=0-691-01788-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Postle"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Postle| first1=M.| last2=Vaughn| first2=W.| year=1999| title=The Artist's Model: from Etty to Spencer| publisher=Merrell Holberton| location=London| isbn=1-85894-084-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nude modeling, nude art and [[nudity]] in general are at times subject to social disapproval, at least by some elements in society.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite book| author=Phillips, Sarah R.| year=2006| title=Modeling Life: Art Models Speak about Nudity, Sexuality and the Creative Process| publisher=SUNY Press| location=Albany| isbn=978-0-7914-6908-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posing==
Poses can range in length from seconds to many hours. There is a drawing exercise where the model slowly but continuously moves, but the shortest is usually one minute. Short dynamic poses are used for [[gesture drawing]] exercises or warm-ups, with the model taking strenuous or precarious positions that could not be sustained for a longer pose—just long enough for the artist to quickly capture the essence of it. Drawing sessions proceed though groups of 5, 10, 15, or 20 minute poses generally for a total of three hours. Active, gestural, or challenging standing poses are often scheduled at the beginning of a session when the models' energy level is highest. Specific exercises or lesson plans may require a particular type of pose, but more often the model is expected to do a series of poses with little direction. The more a model knows about the types of exercises used to teach art, the better they become at posing.&lt;ref name="Steinhart"/&gt;
&lt;gallery class=center widths=220 heights=165 caption="Posing for a typical figure artists' group" mode=packed&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Poses fall into three basic categories: standing, seated and reclining. Within each of these there are varying levels of difficulty, so one kind is not always easier than another. Artists and life drawing instructors will often prefer poses in which the body is being exerted, for a more dynamic and aesthetically interesting subject. Common poses such as standing twists, slouched seated poses and especially the classical [[contrapposto]] are difficult to sustain accurately for any amount of time, although it is often surprising what a skilled model can do. The model's level of experience and skill may be taken into account in determining the length of the posing session and the difficulty of the poses.

While posing, a model is expected to remain essentially motionless,&lt;ref name="Bulloch"&gt;{{cite book| author=Bullock, Linda| year=2005| title=Finding Human Form: Artists' Models in Studio and Classroom| publisher=R.S. Press| location=Ashville| isbn=0-9613949-9-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and usually remains silent.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; Exact requirements may vary depending upon the artist or instructor, but an experienced model will not speak, wriggle, scratch, or readjust during the pose. To accommodate the physical limitations, a schedule such as 20 to 25 minutes of posing, with five- or ten-minute breaks is observed. These breaks—during which the model usually wears a robe or puts on clothing—allow the model to stretch, relax and attend to other needs.

In art schools classrooms or studios, the model usually poses on a raised platform called the model stand or dais. In sculpture studios this platform may be built to rotate to allow for a 360° view for every artist.&lt;ref name="Rooney"&gt;{{cite book| author=Rooney, Kathleen| year = 2009| title=Live Nude Girl: My Life as an Object| publisher=University of Arkansas Press| location=Fayetteville| isbn =1-55728-891-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long poses are generally required for painting (hours or days) and sculpture (perhaps days). To aid in resuming a long pose after a break, chalk marks and/or masking tape are often placed on the model stand.

===Nude modeling===
{{See also|Depictions of nudity|Nude (art)}}
[[File:Masked nude woman, seated, by Thomas Eakins.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Masked nude'', drawing by [[Thomas Eakins]] (c. 1863–66)]]
Models for life drawing classes usually pose nude, though visually non-obstructive personal items such as small jewelry and eyeglasses may be worn. In a job advertisement seeking nude models, this may be referred to as being "undraped" or "disrobed." Art models who pose in the nude for [[life drawing]] are also called '''life models''' or '''figure models'''.

==== Etiquette in academia ====
During art school classes or in other academic settings, strict rules are observed to maintain decorum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.edinboro.edu/directory/offices-services/hr/policies/documents/G003%20Hiring%20Models%20For%20Art%20Courses.pdf| publisher=EDINBORO UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA | title=HIRING MODELS FOR ART COURSES-Policy No. G003 |accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photography is often forbidden, and in some schools, the students are not allowed to also be models, as it creates the possibility of conflict for the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695264705/UVSC-drafts-nude-modeling-rules.html?pg=all| title=UVSC drafts nude-modeling rules
| author=Amy K. Stewart| publisher=Deseret News| date=March 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to and visibility of the area where a nude model is posing is tightly controlled. Disrobing is done discreetly, and the model wears a robe when not posing.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; It is generally prohibited for anyone (including the instructor) to touch a model. Very close examinations are only made with the permission of the model. Some institutions allow only the instructor to speak directly with a model.

===Suggestive poses===
Experienced models avoid any sexually suggestive poses.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; Art instructors and institutions may consider the incident of a male model gaining an [[erection]] while posing cause for termination, or at any rate, grounds for not hiring him again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modelreg.co.uk/st_GuidelinesContentiousIssues.php |title=RAM Guidelines - Contentious Issues| accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any of these policies may vary in different parts of the world. In Europe and South America attitudes are more relaxed, while in China and Korea attitudes are more repressed.&lt;ref name="Bulloch"/&gt; In non-academic settings, models may pose as requested by professional artists within the limits of the law and their own comfort. For example, the French artist [[Yves Klein]] applied paint to models' bodies which were then pressed into or dragged across canvas both as [[performance art]] and as painting technique; and in 2010 at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], a retrospective of the work of [[Marina Abramović]] included two nude models standing in a narrow doorway through which visitors passed.

===Modeling in private===
The conventions for professional artists working in private are much less defined, especially as the models are often friends or family. However, artists who regularly hire strangers tend to observe art school standards in order to make models feel more comfortable, and to avoid possible legal issues. Professional artists often hire the same models on a regular basis. When a comfortable working relationship is established, many artists relax their standards and models do the same. This may be something as simple as not undressing in another room, or not wearing a robe during breaks. In addition, silence is no longer necessary if the artist is comfortable working and conversing with the model. A more collegial relationship may develop where artist and model feel that they are collaborating. However, in a private studio environment, with an artist on a deadline or with commission guidelines, stricter work standards may apply regarding punctuality and holding longer, more demanding poses, but also require higher rates of pay.

Artists frequently have used family members as models, both nude and otherwise, in creating their works and the role between male photographers and their wives as models is studied in Arthur Ollman’s book, ‘’The Model Wife.  It focuses on the photographers Baron [[Adolph de Meyer]], [[Alfred Stieglitz]], whose model wife [[Georgia O’Keefe]] was a celebrated artist in her own right, [[Edward Weston]], [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]], [[Emmet Gowin]], [[Lee Friedlander]], [[Masahisa Fukase]], [[Seiichi Furuya]], and [[Nicholas Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;Ollman, Arthur, The Model Wife, A Bullfinch Press Book/Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In Western countries, there is generally no objection to either sex posing nude for or drawing members of the opposite sex. However, this was not always so. In 1886, Thomas Eakins was famously dismissed from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art for removing the loincloth from a male model in a mixed classroom. Similarly, Victorian modesty sometimes required the female model to pose nude with her face draped (''Masked Nude'' by Eakins, for example). European arts academies did not allow women to study the nude at all until the end of the nineteenth century. Even today there remain some schools where the employment of nude models is limited (male models wearing jockstraps) or prohibited, usually for religious reasons.

==== Alternative views ====
All of the above is based upon a moderate position regarding the value of figure studies and nudity in art. There are also schools or studios that may be more [[Social conservatism|conservative]], or more [[Social liberalism|liberal]].
Many art programs in Christian institutions consider nudity in any form to be in conflict with their beliefs, and therefore hire only clothed models for art classes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-grant/christian-colleges-strugg_b_901394.html |title=Christian Colleges Struggle with Their Fine Art Programs  |author=Daniel Grant |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may bring into question the completeness of the art education offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://glimmerglass.olivet.edu/2012/03/01/nudity-in-art-is-professional-not-sexual/|title=Nudity in art is professional, not sexual|publisher=Associated Students of Olivet Nazarene University|date=March 1, 2012|first=Jenny|last=White|accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However other Christian institutions see no conflict but rather maintain the need for nude figure studies as part of a complete classical art education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordon.edu/download.cfm?id=1554 |title=POLICY ON THE USE OF NUDE MODELS IN ART| publisher=Gordon University, Department of Art.|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recognize that an appreciation of the beauty of the human body is compatible with a Christian education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.augie.edu/sites/default/files/Art-Policy-on-Nude-Models.pdf| title=Art Policy on Nude Models| accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Elkins voices an alternative to classical "dispassionate" figure study by stating that the nude is never devoid of erotic meaning, and it is a fiction to pretend otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Elkins| first=James| year=2001| title=Why Art Cannot Be Taught: A Handbook for Art Students| page=85| publisher=University of Illinois Press| location=Urbana| isbn=0-252-06950-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the staunch advocate of classical aesthetics, Kenneth Clark recognized that "biological urges" were never absent even in the most chaste nude, nor should they be unless all life is drained from the work.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;  However, most models maintain that posing nude need not be any more sexual than any other coed social situation as long as all participants maintain a mature attitude.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; However, decorum is not always maintained when either a model or the students are not familiar with the often unspoken rules. Models may be apprehensive about posing for incoming freshmen who, having never encountered classroom nudity, respond immaturely.&lt;ref name="Bulloch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooney"/&gt;

Acceptance of the erotic is apparent in the work and behavior of some artists, for example Picasso was also famous for having a series of model/muse/mistresses through his life: [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]], [[Fernande Olivier]], [[Dora Maar]], and [[Françoise Gilot]]. The painter [[John Currin]], whose work is often erotic, combines images from popular culture and references to his wife, [[Rachel Feinstein]].

A feminist view is the [[male gaze]], which asserts that nudes are inherently voyeuristic, with the viewer in the place of the powerful male gazing upon the passive female subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eaton|first=E.W.|title=Feminist philosophy of art|journal= Philosophy Compass | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 873–893 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00154.x | date = September 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00154.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
There has been controversy regarding the status of photography as a fine arts medium that is reflected in the unwillingness of some nude models for other fine art media to also pose for photography.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; The experience of nude modeling for an amateur photographer is different from that of posing for figure drawing/painting.&lt;ref name="Rooney"/&gt; Traditional media create a single image that is not a ''true likeness'' of the individual model, but photographs require a [[model release|release]] in order to protect the model's right to privacy. The hourly rate of pay for models posing for fine art photography is much higher than for other media, although less than for commercial photography.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

Occasionally the distinction of participating in [[Fine Art]] may make a young amateur model willing to pose for a photographer, with unexpected consequences; examples being [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. A signed print of one of the nude photographs of Madonna taken by [[Lee Friedlander]] in 1979 sold at auction in 2012 for $37,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/photographs/lee-friedlander-nude-1979-5176357-details.aspx|title=Christie's: Nude (Madonna), 1979|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although largely a result of her fame, the model does not share in this increased value of the artwork.
{{further information|Nude photography (art)}}

===Clothed modeling===
[[File:Rafael Frederico - Interior de Ateliê, 1898.jpg|thumb|320px|Artist working from a costumed model]]
Painting classes, and professional artists doing finished works often require clothed or costumed models who take poses that may be sustained until the work is completed. This creates some demand for clothed models in those schools that continue to teach [[academic painting]] methods. Some models may promote their services based upon having interesting or varied costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atelierkanawa.com/#!kimono-model |title=Kimono Model |accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing is required in public venues, such as Dr Sketchy's Anti-Art School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-07-04/people/model-behavior/|author= Rachel Kramer Bussel |title=Model Behavior| publisher = The Village Voice |accessdate= 10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but occurs in more traditional settings as well, such as the fund-raising marathons sponsored by the Bay Area Models Guild.&lt;ref name="Steinhart"/&gt; Other than costumes, the work requirements and conditions of clothed models for art are identical to that of nude models.

Professional portraits generally have a client or "sitter" rather than a model as the subject; and are now often done from photographs at least in part, although artists prefer to have at least some hours of live sitting particularly at the beginning to better capture the personality, and at the end for final touches.

==Training and selection==
Most models learn on the job, but many have experience in the performing arts, athletics, or yoga&lt;ref name="Bulloch"/&gt; that provide a basis for posing, such as strength, flexibility, and a well-developed sense of [[Proprioception|kinesthesis]].

In some countries there are organizations which concern themselves with the competence, conduct and reliability of art models. An example is the Register of Artists' Models (RAM) in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modelreg.co.uk/ |title=Register of Artists' Models |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some basic training is offered to beginners and membership is by audition – to test competence, not to discriminate on grounds of physical characteristics. RAM also acts as an important employment exchange for models and publishes the 'RAM Guidelines', which are widely referred to by models and employers. A similar organization in the United States, the Bay Area Models Guild in California, was founded in 1947. Groups also exist in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifemodelssociety.org.au/ |title=Lifemodelssociety.org.au |publisher=Lifemodelssociety.org.au |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301054945/http://www.lifemodelssociety.org.au/ |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyo.se/ |title=The Swedish Organization for Life Models |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figuremodelsguild.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227150301/http://www.figuremodelsguild.org/index.asp| archive-date=December 27, 2015| title=Figure Models Guild of Washington, D.C.|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other cities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artmodeltips.com/models/guilds|title=ArtModelTips.com: List of model guilds and associations|accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These groups may also attempt to establish minimum rates of pay and working conditions, but only rarely have models been sufficiently organized to go on strike.

===Appearance/age/gender===
Unlike [[Model (person)|fashion modeling]], modeling in an art school classroom is for the purpose of learning how to draw humans of different shapes, ages, and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Bulloch"/&gt; Obese models may be in demand by experienced artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1014381/I-mortified-strip-Freud-says-benefits-manager-Now-painting-I-posed-set-sell-35-million.html|title=I was mortified to strip off says benefits manager.

[[Nudity and children#Children|Children]] are genearally excluded from modeling nude for classes.  The minimum age can vary, but is often 15 to 18. Despite being nonsexual in nature, this may be influenced by the [[age of consent]] (i.e. at or slightly below). Children are not good candidates for art modeling since they lack the ability to hold still.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; A small number of photographers have done fine art works of nude children, under special circumstances, such as [[Sally Mann]] photographing her own children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mann, Sally and Price,Reynolds| title=[[Immediate Family (book)|Immediate Family]]| publisher=Aperture| year=1992| ISBN=0893815233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less well-known photographers have been charged as criminals for photos of their own children.&lt;ref name="Powell, Lynn 2010"&gt;{{cite book | author=Powell, Lynn |title=Framing Innocence: A Mother's Photographs, a Prosecutor's Zeal, and a Small Town's Response|publisher=The New Press|year=2010|isbn=1595585516}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jock Sturges]] photographed entire families of [[naturist]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogallery.com/Sturges_Jock/sturges-bio.html|title=Jock Sturges Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to an FBI investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo Lab Sets Off FBI Probe : Art: Jock Sturges' photographs of nude families are at issue|date=July 5, 1990|author=HAROLD MAASS|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers characterize many of these images as sexualizing children regardless of artistic merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexualizing Children: Thoughts on Sally Mann|first=MARY|last=GORDON|journal=Salmagundi|issue=111|year=1996|pages=144–145|publisher=Skidmore College|jstor=40535995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles and stereotypes in society are reflected in a different experience for male and female models, and different responses when those not in the arts learn that someone is a nude model. However, both male and female models tend to keep their modeling career distinct from their other social interactions, if for different reasons. Attitudes toward male nudity, issues of homosexuality when male artists work from male models, and some bias towards the female form in art may lead to less opportunity for male models,&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; and works of art that include male nudity are much less marketable.&lt;ref name="Steinhart"/&gt; However, historically this has not been the case (See below).

==History==
The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], who had the naked body constantly before them in the exercises of the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], had far less need of professional models than the moderns; but it is scarcely likely that they could have attained the high level reached by their works without constant study from nature. It was probably in Ancient Greece that models were first used. The story told of [[Zeuxis]] by [[Valerius Maximus]], who had five of the most beautiful virgins of the city of [[Crotone]] offered him as models for his picture of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], proves their occasional use. The remark of [[Eupompus]], quoted by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], who advised [[Lysippos]], "Let nature be your model, not an artist", directing his attention to the crowd instead of to his own work, also suggests a use of models which the many portrait statues of Greek and Roman times show to have been not unknown.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Models, Artists'|volume=18|page=640}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of some of these models of the era are themselves known, such as the beautiful [[Phryne]] who modeled for many paintings and sculptures.

The nude virtually disappeared from Western art during the Middle Ages due to a combination of civil disorder and the attitude of the early Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/numr/hd_numr.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This changed with the [[Renaissance]] and the rediscovery of classical antiquity, when painters generally made use of their relatives and friends as models, of which many examples might be quoted from [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Rome]] and other places, and the stories of [[Titian]] and the duchess of Ferrara and of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Simonetta Vespucci]], go to show that ladies of exalted rank were sometimes not averse to having their charms immortalized by the painter's brush.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The story of the love between [[Raphael]] and his mistress-model [[Margarita Luti]] (''La Fornarina'') is "the [[Archetype|archetypal]] artist-model relationship of [[Western culture|Western tradition]]".&lt;ref name="Lathers"&gt;{{cite book| author=Lathers, Marie |title=Bodies of Art: French Literary Realism and the Artist's Model |page=60| publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0-8032-2941-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Paid models were not unknown, as the story of the unfortunate contadino used by [[Jacopo Sansovino]] as model for his statue of the [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] will show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11559/11559-8.txt |title=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

[[File:Jan Vermeer - The Art of Painting - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[The Art of Painting]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]], c. 1666]]
Art modeling as an occupation appeared in the late Renaissance when the establishment of schools for the study of the human figure created a regular demand, and since that time the remuneration offered ensured a continual supply.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; However, academy models were only men until the 19th Century, as were the students. The status of nude models has fluctuated with the value and acceptance of nudity in art. Maintaining the classical ideals of Greece and Rome into the Christian Era, nudity was prominent in the decoration of Catholic churches in the Renaissance, only to be covered up with draperies or [[fig leaf|fig leaves]] by more prudish successors. The Protestant Reformation went even further, destroying many artworks. From being a possibly glamorous occupation celebrating beauty, being a nude model was at other times equivalent to prostitution, practiced by persons without the means to gain more respectable employment. The costumed models used to create historical paintings may not have been a distinct group, since nude studies were done in preparation for any figure painting.

In 19th century Paris, a number of models earned a place in art history. [[Victorine Meurent]] became a painter herself after posing for several works, including two of the most infamous: ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Manet's Olympia]]'' and '' [[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]''. [[Joanna Hiffernan]] (c. 1843{{snd}}after 1903) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] artists' model and [[muse]] who was romantically linked with [[United States|American]] [[Painting|painter]] [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] and [[France|French]] painter [[Gustave Courbet]]. She is the model for Whistler's painting ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]'' and is rumored to be the model for Courbet's painting ''[[L'Origine du monde]]''. [[Suzanne Valadon]], also a painter, modeled for [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], and [[Edgar Degas]]. She is best known as the figure in Renoir's ''[[Dance at Bougival]]'', and she was the mother of the painter [[Maurice Utrillo]].

When [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] attitudes took hold in England, studies with a live model became more restrictive than they had been in the prior century, limited to advanced classes of students that had already proved their worthiness by copying old master paintings and drawing from plaster casts. This is in part because many schools were publicly funded, so decisions were under the scrutiny of non-artists. Modeling was not respectable, and even less so for women. During the same period, the French art atelier system allowed any art student to work from life in a less formal atmosphere, and also admitted women as students. Live figure studies only returned to its classical status in art education throughout the England, Europe and the United States with the approach of the 20th Century.&lt;ref name="Postle"/&gt;

In the postmodern era, the nude has returned to gain some acceptance in the art world, but not necessarily the art model. Figure drawing is offered in most art schools, but may not be required for a fine art degree. Peter Steinhart says that in trendy galleries, the nude has become passé,&lt;ref name="Steinhart"/&gt; while according to Wendy Steiner there has been a revival in the importance of the figure as a source of beauty in contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Steiner.2001"&gt;{{cite book| first=Steiner| last=Wendy| year=2001| title=Venus in Exile: The Rejection of Beauty in Twentieth-century Art| publisher=The Free Press| location=| isbn=0-684-85781-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some established living artists work from models, but more work from photographs, or their imagination. Yet privately held open drawing sessions with a live model remain as popular as ever.&lt;ref name="Steinhart"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2010/12/01/nothing-like-the-real-thing/|title=Nothing Like the Real Thing|author=Gail Gregg|date=2010-12-01|publisher=ArtNews }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mookie Tenembaum''' (born 1955) is an Argentine born polymath; philosopher, lawyer, inventor, conceptual multidiciplinary artist and a radio host.

Tenembaum's philosophy, first published under the title "Disillusionism" in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;''Delilusionismo'' (Spanish Edition) Mookie, Tenembaum, Planeta (2012) {{ISBN|9789504928386}}&lt;/ref&gt; revolving around original concepts like "Autothanatodeimia", "Illusions" and "Anti-Forms", introduces original and critical perspectives on human behavior and organization.

Tenembaum's work reflects his views on [[Sovereign state|the State]], freedom, and ecology. For instance, he placed a ton of ice in the [[Plaza de Mayo]] in [[Buenos Aires]] and named it Placebo. He also caused controversy by publicly  projecting  on the chest and backs of six  half naked ballerinas two video spots: one a popular [[Coca-Cola]] TV ad in which a polar bear played with a baby seal and shared a Coke with it while in the opposite one a polar bear hunts and bloodily devours a baby seal, he named the piece Bearshit.

Since December 2015, Tenembaum leads a morning radio show called ''El Observador Internacional'', in which he analyses the landscape of international politics. It is delivered by [[Radio Jai]], an Argentine-Jewish radio station.

== Biography ==
He attended Law School at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and specialized in Anthropology at [[Temple University of Philadelphia]]. As a lawyer, he  also  worked as a city attorney of the city of [[Jerusalem]]. During the 90s he decided that some of his ideas could only be created and developed through art, specially art related to new technologies. Therefore, during the past years, Mookie has concentrated specifically on reflecting on the different problems related to the [[State (polity)|State]] by means of creating new-media works. Currently, Mookie is working on pieces having to do with the different social and ideological problems of the state, developing projects such as "Genesis", which by means of an on-line system which generates "trusts" with the status of juridical persons, it reveals how the State presents "traps" in their formulation and efficiency, which are not easily readable for most citizens. With this type of projects, Mookie makes them visible, strongly criticizing the State apparatus ruling Latin America. Chasing utopian goals, with his projects Mookie proposes social reinvention and, as a consequence, refoundation. His compasses in this goal are [[George Orwell]], [[J.J. Rousseau]], and [[John Locke]]'s theories, as well as [[Minarchist]] ideas. An expert on the Internet and new technologies, Mookie is a member of [[FiRE]] (Future in Review) an annual event that gathers one hundred people from all over the world to discuss the likely penetration of the latest technological innovations and their impact on a not so far away future. He also founded United Virtualities, a company of on-line systems, and created over twenty on-line technologies, such as Ooqa Ooqa (Explorer's enhanced native toolbar), Schvitzer (an intelligent text highlighter), and Yachne (a 3D animated messenger).

His art piece "Paranoia" was awarded the highest prize in 2008 official [[Salón Nacional de Bellas Artes]] the most prestigious award in Argentina.

Recently he was featured on [[CNN]]'s "[[Cala (TV series)|Cala]]".

His works have been the object of numerous individual and collective in his native Argentina, and abroad.

Concurrently, Tenembaum's philosophical work started with a virulent critique of "Illusions", which is the term he uses to dub States, Religions, Families and other such juridical persons. His, is a deconstructive critique revolving around the fundamental claim that these Illusions are nothing but onerous fever phantasms spawned by each physical person's terror of death, or ATD (after its Ancient Greek initials Auto-Thanatos-Deimia).

As of late, Tenembaum's system of Disillusionism has expanded into a wider discussion of human [[ethology]]. According to him, [[behavioral modernity]], depends not only upon ATD and Illusions, but also upon the neuro-physiology that explains pain, relief, pleasure, memory, anticipation and other rival contenders for the very limited [[attentional span]] of human animals. Furthermore, Disillusionism relies heavily upon negativity and discarding as driving forces behind both human evolution and common sense.

On a practical note, Tenembaum's philosophy also distinguishes animal aptitude from each individual's actual willingness to apply the abilities it possesses. Drawing a parallel with the ancestral [[pack hunter|packs]], in which a division of attention and tasks was biologically enforced amongst individuals, Disillusionism attempts to make sense of the exchanges and relationships inside each human individual's Egosphere, and discuses the part [[Common Sense]] might play in optimizing such organization.

Tenembaum is the father of five children and the eldest son of [[Baruch Tenembaum]], founder of the [[International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation]] and is a resident of Paraguay.

== History ==
Early Native American culture was rich with ceremonies, rituals and storytelling. These ceremonies had theatrical elements, but whether or not these traditions are early forms of modern-day theatre or are independent cultural practices is not clear. According to Henry Schafer, “A variety of rituals and ceremonies could be considered early forms of theatre….Others see this interpretation as a devaluation of sacred rituals as simply a pre-form of secular theatre.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last=Däwes | first=Birgit | title=Indigenous North American drama : a multivocal history | publisher=SUNY Press | publication-place=Albany | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-4384-4660-8 | language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first practitioners of Native Theatre was a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; poet named [[E. Pauline Johnson|Emily Pauline Johnson]], who performed dramatic readings of her poems in the late nineteenth century. Other early contributors to the Native Canadian Theatre scene included a non-native named Anthony Walsh who directed the “Can-Oos-Sez Skay-loo Drama Group,” from 1934 to 1942, and Emily General (Cayuga), who established a series of annual plays to be performed at the Great Pine Forest Theatre on the Six Nations Reserve in 1949.&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; In 1950, two non-Natives, Frank Morrison and Cecil West wrote and directed the opera ''Tzinquaw: The Thunderbird and the Killer Whale'', which premiered in Duncan, BC, performed by purely Native people. In Canada, playwrights James Reaney, John Herbert, and George Ryga made their contribution to Native theatre with ''The Ecstasy of Rita Joe'' (1970). Margo Kane (Saulteaux/Cree/Blackfoot) joined the production of ''The Ecstasy of Rita Joe'' in 1978 and became the first Native American actor to play the part of Rita Joe in 1981.

According to Henry Schafer, 1985-1995 was the “Golden Age” of Native Theatre.&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; Many Native Theatre companies and playwrights emerged during this period. Tomson Highway (Cree) joined the Native Earth Performing Arts (NEPA), starting as a musical director and performer.  In 1985, Ondinnok Mythological Theatre was founded in Montreal by French-speaking Native playwright Yves Sioui Durand. Other Native Theatre companies that emerged during this period were: Tunooniq Theater, Awasikan Theatre, Urban Shaman and Native Youth Theatre R-Street Vision. In 1987, on the Hobbema Reserve, Four Winds Theatre Group was founded by Darrel and Lori Wildcat (Cree), along with cofounders Rosa and Melvin John. After the Four Winds Theatre Group closed in 1991, the Johns went on to form Kehewin Native Performance Resource Network (KNPRN). “KNPRN concentrates on traditional theatre, storytelling, and dance and works with young people, touring all over Canada and internationally.” (1) In 1992, Margo Kane founded Full Circle: First Nations Performance in British Columbia. Two of the most recent Native Theatre companies to emerge are Saskatchewan Native Theatre Company (1999) and Red Sky Performance in Toronto (2000). From 1995 to present day Native Theatre has struggled to maintain its size and popularity. One major issue the Native Theatre scene faced was lack of funding. Although some of the theatre companies closed and some still struggle to survive, the Native Theatre scene is continuing to develop and mature. “Even though Native theatre is a relatively recent phenomenon in Canada, it is by now an integral part of the Canadian cultural landscape. It takes on many forms and draws from various traditions like storytelling, European theatre, traditional dance, and multimedia. It resists any clear-cut definition and is constantly exploring new forms of expression.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt;

The stories that inspire Native American Theatre have been around for hundreds of years, but did not gain formal recognition by colonial America.&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; This lack of recognition lasted until the 1930s when [[Lynn Riggs]], a playwright of [[Cherokee]] descent, brought Native Theatre into the spotlight through the Six Nations Reserve Forest Theatre in Ontario. Through these events, Native Theatre has been introduced to mainstream society and contemporary Native American Theater was born. Canadian playwright Drew Hayden Taylor explains how Native American theatre has been around for centuries, but has only recently been highlighted in North American mainstream media: “Native Theatre is much older than the scant few years. It is as old as this country, as old as the people who have been here for thousands of years, as old as the stories that are still told today. It is merely the presentation that has changed.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt;

Since the creation of contemporary Native American Theater, there have been plays available for publishing: “There are currently over 250 published and far over 600 unpublished plays by some 250 Native American and [[First Nations]] playwrights and theatre groups on the North American market.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; These numbers do not include the plays inside the ''North American Indian Drama'' collection as of 2006. Even though there is a large amount of plays available for production or analysis, the Native American drama genre is often overlooked by not only the general public, but also by universities. Shari Huhndorf states “drama remains the most overlooked genre in Native American literature.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; There needs to be more research and appreciation for Native American drama and its background. The lack of connection between plays from reservations and urban areas needs to improve in order for there to be more information from different angles and perspectives presented through dramatic literature. This can provide increased appreciation for Native American Theatre.

Contemporary Native American theater began in the 20th century and developed from oral culture and literature. These stories were used to “educate, entertain, and preserve” the new generations of the Native Americans. “However, indigenous theater was absent in Native writing during this period and the multiple reasons given for this nonexistence usually reflect a long history of silencing, discrimination, oppression, and displacement exercised in the genre.”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SIDONÍ LÓPEZ and HANANE BENALI|first=|date=2016|title=NATIVE AMERICAN THEATER: A CONCISE HISTORY|url=|journal=miscelánea: a journal of english and american studies|volume=54|pages=93–111|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories were usually told orally in a way accompanied by dancing, music, and other performances while the storyteller gets close to the audience to give them an immersive encounter of the story and the storyteller. These stories were usually exaggerated to give more drama for the audience. “This existence of this vibrant oral literature contrasts with the traditional Western conception that Native American cultures did not have history.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A non-Western historical record gave the misconception of Native Americans having no history before the arrival of European immigrants. Many Native American traditions and customs were suppressed due to colonization which prevented many from being able to tell their stories while they were oppressed. “The rise of the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] during the 1960s and the 1970s also contributed to this reawakening of Native cultures since it appeared as a movement in which minorities demanded an end to discrimination and the right to speak for themselves.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This gave pride and encouraged many to seek inspiration from history and ancestral roots. Today there are many theater productions performing Native American works.

== Characteristics ==
According to Rolland Meinholtz, who is an “instructor and artistic director of drama and dance at the Institute of American Indian Arts,” youth must understand the struggles of Native American culture through contemporary plays.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous North American Drama|last=Meinholtz|first=Rolland|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=77–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; “They needed to know it, understand it, deal with it, struggle with it, hopefully integrate it, and lastly, build upon it.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In order to produce a play to convey a Native American themed message, you need dance, verse, drums, masks, facial painting. Even when the play consisted of non-Native Americans, Native American drama is all about the story and presentation, not about those who play the roles. “Nevertheless, there could be absolutely no question whose theatre we were witnessing. The spare setting, the drumming, the chanting and singing, the dancing, its episodic nature, and its wry point of view all proudly proclaimed this was Indian Theatre.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Coyote is a metaphor to describe the character of Native American theater. Native American Theater production that does not fit into western conventions cannot easily be categorized as comedy or tragedy. Thus, the coyote trickster represents the shape shifting nature of Native Theater itself. “For Indian theatre, there is no clear division of comedy and tragedy as found, for example, in ancient Greek drama. Comedy and tragedy are one: one extreme transforming into the other. Everything humans perceive as fixed is actually transitory and subject to transformation.” According to Meinholtz Japanese Noh drama is a guide to achieving the spiritual goals he intended for Native American drama. Meinholtz is inspired by ancient Native American architecture to create contemporary theater spaces. “The Great Kivas were not the only examples of theatrical structures among Native Americans. The Zuni people build specifically designed rooms onto their houses in which to house the annual Shalako Ceremony.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Challenging Stereotypes ==
[[Geraldine Keams]] (Navajo Nation TV and film actress) disrupts Native American stereotypes in her work. Keams has challenges stereotypes through writing and creating plays that include Native American history, such as ''Flight of The Army Worm'', first performed in 1976 at [[Navajo Community College]]. ''Flight of the Army Worm'' is one of the first contemporary published plays that was done by a Native American Woman. Through ''Flight of The Army'' ''Worm'' Keams was able to educate others about the Navajo Nation. “The character of the announcer gives the audience factual information about historical events, while through song, the Guitar Player urges revolution. This combination of modes of presentation aims to sharpen spectator’s analysis of the historical events they see and hear about. Keams combines Western and Indigenous pedagogies by moving the story from the intellectual account by the announcer to the personal account of Grandmother.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drama by Contemporary Native American Women|last=Sullivan|first=Sharon|publisher=ProQuest|year=2004|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor|pages=34–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Native Theater Movement was built from several theaters, like the American Indian theatre Ensemble, Thunderbird Theater, and [[Spiderwoman Theater]].&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"&gt;{{cite book | last=Haugo | first=Ann | title=A Companion to Twentieth-Century American Drama | chapter=Native American Drama | publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd | publication-place=Oxford, UK | date=November 21, 2007 | isbn=978-0-470-99680-5 | doi=10.1002/9780470996805.ch21 | pages=334–351}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theater companies helped consolidate a nationwide Native Theatre movement across the United States and Canada. Native American drama had to fight against indifference and lack of knowledge on the part of some mainstream audiences. Native American playwrights write for a larger audiences who may not be aware that Native Americans are a significant demographic. This creates a double burden on the need to educate as well as to create drama. The “Three Miguel sisters" founded the Spiderwoman Theater (1975); their drama has raised the public profile of figures and themes of traditional Native American stories. As more anthologies of contemporary Native American drama are published, the variety and creativity of the contemporary scene has become more apparent. “Just the fact that you’re on the stage telling these stories is political, just the fact that you’re there…it is a public act claiming one's native identity is a political act.”&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"/&gt; The Native American Theatre Ensemble (1973) presented Native Americans on their own terms to combat stereotypical Indian misrepresentations.

Native American playwrights challenge centuries of stereotypes to create realistic characters conceived from their own personal experiences. The American Indian Theater Ensemble resolved to not only to rectify the cultural image of the Native American, but also to produce a body of drama intended primarily for the Indian community. “The purpose of making the company pan-tribal was to deconstruct stereotypes.”&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"/&gt; [[Hanay Geiogamah]] was active in the founding years of the American Indian Theatre Ensemble, which produced his one-act play ''Body Indian''. ''Body Indian'' is pan-tribal work that demonstrates the problems Native American playwrights face in creating realistic drama based on contemporary Native American life. While Native people have been performing on the stages of the American theatre since the nineteenth century, at the turn of the twenty-first century, only a handful of articles on Native Theatre have been published, and most appeared in magazines rather than academic journals. Scholars in Canada embraced First Nations theatre more quickly, with much of the scholarship during the 1990s appearing in Canadian journals and published by Canadian presses. Now, twenty years later, Native and non-Native scholars seek to redefine the place of Indigenous theatre within the history of "American" theatre or, more accurately, the theatre of the Americas.&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"/&gt;

== Influence ==
Indigenous American cultures have been a major aspect of Chicano drama.&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilmer | first=S. E. | title=Native American performance and representation | publisher=University of Arizona Press | publication-place=Tucson | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-8165-0240-0 | pages=155–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicano/playwrights have been inspired by [[Native American mythology]] and history through the use of symbolism and characters to represent Chicano/as, who are considered to be descendants of indigenous Mexico. Before the end of the Mexican War (1848), Mexico consisted of both Texas and California. The use of symbols in Chicano/a plays range from the use of characters being in the play on stage or “at other times the Indio is imagined through the use of Indigenous music, flutes, and drums.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; These symbols provide information that is not easily seen and influence the action of the play and were influenced by the Chicano/an’s indigenous roots.

In the play Day of the Swallows, Estela Portillo Trambley uses an Indigenous male character to represent the protagonist’s Native American roots. The main character appears as the “noble savage” who represents the Indio in the play and Eduardo is paired with a contrasting character, Josefa, who is connected to her heritage and is traditionally feminine. Josefa’s connection to her heritage in this play “is through images that only she can see and feel.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; This play uses these visions as symbols that are influenced by their indigenous heritage. “Eduardo symbolizes the best and the worst of humanity in Josefa’s world, for he is Nature personified as Man.” ''Mummified Deer'' was written in 1984 by Luis Valdez. His character Cajeme, a deer dancer named after a famous Yaqui who fought against the Mexican government, is portrayed through different elements in the play. “Cajeme represents her inner thoughts, her fears, her Yaqui blood and being.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; These plays were written to reconnect Chicanos with their Native American roots.

Estela Portillo Trambley and Luis Valdez were the most well-known authors of the Indigenous Chicano drama. They were the early proponents of bringing indigenous roots into Chicano/a plays. Trambley stated in an interview, “I hope…[Chicanos] still relate to seasons and to plants and to colors and to the wind, and to the Indian in them, or the element that is closest to the Earth.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; Trambley is “regarded by most Chicano/critics and scholars as the author who inspired and opened the doors for all the Chicana writers who followed her.” Both of these playwrights used their own style while writing their individual plays. Trambley focused more on writing in the style of realism, which was more general with no indication of specific indigenous people, while Valdez wrote and produced in more specifics communities as well as by using “a surreal vision of the Chicano’s distorted postmodern, internally colonized condition.” Trambley stated in an interview, “I hope…[Chicanos] still relate to seasons and to plants and to colors and to the wind, and to the Indian in them, or the element that is closest to the Earth.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt;

'''''On the hills - virgin forest''''' (Croatian: '''''Na bregovima - prašuma''''') is a painting by Croatian artist [[Ivan Rabuzin]] from 1960.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063611/CRO_280_003.html |title=Na bregovima – prašuma, Ivan Rabuzin |website=europeana.eu |language=en |access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The 69.2 x 116.7&amp;nbsp;cm. oil painting is held by the [[Croatian Museum of Naive Art]] in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="europeana.eu" /&gt;

==Analysis==
The naive style is typical of Ivan Rabuzin; lyrical and idealized landscapes based on a sequence of circles or round shapes, filled with optimism and spirituality. His style is recognized worldwide as unique and great contribution to the development of [[naïve art]].  It is characterized by modernism of visual expression, as it reduces the use of geometric shapes, causing his art to be among the legacy of contemporary art.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu" /&gt; His works are easily recognizable thanks to the combination of stylization and geometric abstraction. The colors in his paintings highlight the location and size of the images, highlighting their symbolic significance and importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=hr |last=Sumpor |first=Svjetlana |url=http://www.hmnu.hr/hr/95_obljetnica_rodenja_ivana_rabuzina/151/5 |title=95. obljetnica rođenja Ivana Rabuzina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''open music model''' is an economic and technological framework for the [[recording industry]] based on research conducted at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. It predicts that the playback of prerecorded music will be regarded as a service rather than as individually sold products, and that the only system for the [[digital distribution]] of music that will be viable against piracy is a subscription-based system supporting [[file sharing]] and free of [[digital rights management]]. The research also indicated that [[United States dollar|US$]]9 per month for unlimited use would be the [[market clearing]] price at that time, but recommended $5 per month as the long-term optimal price.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8438|title=Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models|author=[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]]|publisher=[[MIT Sloan School of Management]]|date=May 10, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its creation in 2002, a number of its principles have been adopted throughout the recording industry,&lt;ref name=irunway&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-runway.com/blog/on-demand-music-streaming-to-battle-piracy/|title=On-Demand Music Streaming to battle Piracy|author=Gautham Somraj Koorma|publisher=[[iRunway]]|date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been cited as the basis for the business model of many [[Comparison of on-demand streaming music services|music subscription services]].&lt;ref name=lespresso&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/affari/2014/07/01/news/spotify-il-business-folle-sbarca-a-wall-street-1.171553|title=Spotify, il business folle sbarca a Wall Street|author=Marco Consoli|publisher=[[L'Espresso]]|date=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazeta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technologie.gazeta.pl/internet/1,104665,18056619,Dla_uzytkownikow_streaming_muzyki_jest_spelnieniem.html|title=Dla użytkowników streaming muzyki jest spełnieniem marzeń, a dla wytwórni – źródłem obaw|author=Karol Kopańko|publisher=[[Gazeta.pl]]|date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The model asserts that there are five [[necessary and sufficient|necessary]] requirements for a viable commercial music digital distribution network:
{| class="wikitable"
! # !! style="width: 20%;" | Requirement !! Description
|-
| 1 || Open file sharing || users must be free to [[file sharing|share files]] with each other
|-
| 2 || Open file formats || content must be distributed in open formats with no [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions
|-
| 3 || Open membership || [[copyright]] holders must be able to freely register to receive payment
|-
| 4 || Open payment || payment should be accepted via multiple means, not a closed system
|-
| 5 || Open competition || multiple such systems must exist which can interoperate, not a designed monopoly
|}The model was proposed by [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]] in his 2002 research paper ''Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models''&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt; at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. The following year, it was publicly referred to as the Open Music Model.&lt;ref name="opensource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.com/life/11/11/drm-graveyard-brief-history-digital-rights-management-music|title=The DRM graveyard: A brief history of digital rights management in music|author=Ruth Suehle|publisher=[[Red Hat]] Magazine|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model suggests changing the way consumers interact with the digital property market: rather than being seen as a good to be purchased from online vendor, music would be treated as a service being provided by the industry, with firms based on the model serving as intermediaries between the music industry and its consumers. The model proposed giving consumers unlimited access to music for the price of [[United States dollar|US$]]5 per month&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt; (as of 2002), based on research showing that this could be a long-term optimal price, expected to bring in a total revenue of over [[United States dollar|US$]]3&amp;nbsp;billion per year.&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

The research demonstrated the demand for third-party file sharing programs. Insofar as the interest for a particular piece of digital property is high, and the risk of acquiring the good via illegitimate means is low, people will naturally flock towards third-party services such as [[Napster]] and Morpheus (more recently, [[BitTorrent (protocol)|Bittorrent]] and [[The Pirate Bay]]).&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

The research showed that consumers would use file sharing services not primarily due to cost but because of convenience, indicating that services which provided access to the most music would be the most successful.&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

== Industry adoption ==
The model predicted the failure of [[digital distribution|online music distribution]] systems based on [[digital rights management]].&lt;ref name=opensource /&gt;&lt;ref name=CollectiveCopyright&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2602197|title=Collective Copyright|author1=Emanuele Lunadei |author2=Christian Valdiva Torres |author3=Erik Cambria |publisher=[[International World Wide Web Conference]] 2014|date=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of the model included that it would not eliminate the issue of piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/120018441/Music-Distribution-Technology-and-the-Value-of-Art-in-Society|title=Music Distribution: Technology and the Value of Art in Society|author=Sungwon Peter Choe|publisher=[[KAIST]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others countered that it was in fact the most viable solution to piracy,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.iplawintheus.com/open-music-model/|title=Open music model|author=Andrew Traub|publisher=US Intellectual Property Law|date=November 25, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101061826/http://www.iplawintheus.com/open-music-model/|archivedate=January 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; since piracy was "inevitable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cse.tkk.fi/Datacommunications/Doctoral_dissertations/Lic-Yrjo_Raivio.pdf | title=Mobile Services and the Internet: A Study of Emerging Business Models|author=Yrjö Raivio|publisher=[[Helsinki University of Technology]]|date=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters argued that it offered a superior alternative to the current [[Trade group efforts against file sharing|law-enforcement based methods]] used by the recording industry.&lt;ref&gt;

Several aspects of the model have been adopted by the recording industry and its partners over time:

* The abolition of digital rights management represented a major shift for the industry. In 2007, [[Steve Jobs]], CEO of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], published a letter&lt;ref name=stevejobs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/kr/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/|title=Thoughts on Music|author=[[Steve Jobs]]|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for an end to DRM in music. A few months later, [[Amazon.com]] launched a store single individual DRM-free mp3's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/amazon_mp3.php|title=Amazon MP3 Launches DRM-Free Music Store|author=Marshall Kirkpatrick|publisher=[[ReadWriteWeb]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, iTunes Store abolished DRM on most of its individual tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/137946/2009/01/itunestore.html|title=iTunes Store goes DRM-free|author=Peter Cohen|publisher=[[MacWorld]]|date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open payment was relatively straightforward to implement, and the [[iTunes Store]] offered gift cards, which could be purchased with cash, from its launch in 2003.
* In 2010, [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] announced a download ability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1627779/rhapsody-streaming-music-mp3-playlists-iphone-itunes-apple-ipad-entertainment|title=Rhapsody First Subscription Service in U.S. to Offer Offline Music on iPhone|author=Kit Eaton|publisher=[[FastCompany]]|date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their subscribers using [[iPhones]].
* In 2011, Apple launched its [[iTunes Match]] service with a subscription model, supporting file-sharing between a user's own devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erikras.com/2011/11/16/cloud-music-and-itunes-match/|title=Cloud Music and iTunes Match|author=Erik Rasmussen|date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subscription price did not include the cost of acquiring content, which would still have to be purchased on a per track basis from the iTunes Store.
* Pricing close to the model's suggested $5 per month price, or its $9 per month market clearing price, has been adopted by many platforms:
** In 2005, [[Yahoo! Music]] was launched at $5 per month with [[digital rights management]].
** In 2011, [[Spotify]] introduced a $5 per month premium subscription in the United States with [[digital rights management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/07/spotify-launches-in-the-u-s-at-last/|title=Spotify Launches in the U.S at Last|author=Charlie Sorrel|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 2011, [[Microsoft]] [[Zune]] offered a subscription service for music downloads with [[digital rights management]] known as a [[Zune Pass]], at $10 a month.

'''Orra White Hitchcock''' (March 8, 1796 – May 26, 1863) was one of America's earliest women botanical and scientific illustrators and artists, best known for illustrating the scientific works of her husband, geologist [[Edward Hitchcock]] (1793–1864), but also notable for her own artistic and scientific work.

== Life ==

Hitchcock was born to a prosperous farming family (Jarib and Ruth Sherman White) in [[South Amherst, Massachusetts]].  She was educated by a tutor and at two “ladies” schools, proved herself a child prodigy in numerous scientific and classical subjects, and showed early promise in drawing and painting.  From 1813 to 1818 she taught young girls natural sciences, and the fine and decorative arts at [[Deerfield Academy]].  Her early training grounded her in both science and art. Hitchcock has been called the [[Connecticut River]] Valley's “earliest and most often published woman artist.”&lt;ref&gt;Eugene C. Worman Jr., “The Watercolors and Prints of Orra White Hitchcock,” ''AB Bookman’s Weekly'' 83:7 (February 13, 1989), p. 646.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's art was integral to the work of her husband, geologist [[Edward Hitchcock]], Principal of Deerfield Academy, minister, professor and third president of [[Amherst College]] (1845–1854). She made hundreds of illustrations for Edward Hitchcock's scientific publications, including detailed landscapes of the [[Connecticut River]] Valley for his Massachusetts geological survey volumes, and custom designed charts that illustrated his local discoveries and his classroom lectures.  In addition, she made detailed drawings of native flowers and grasses and small precise watercolors of small local mushrooms.  Her work is a time-focused chronicle of the scenic, botanically and geologically diverse Connecticut River Valley in western Massachusetts. Orra White Hitchocock, a scientist in her own right, had the contemporary reputation as one of the valley's “most distinguished naturalists.”&lt;ref&gt;Stephen W. Williams, M.D., “Report on the Indigenous Medical Botany of Massachusetts,” ''Transactions of the American Medical Association'' 2 (1849); accessed online at: [http://www.herbaltherapeutics.net/Mass.doc.pdf www.herbaltherapeutics.net/Mass.doc.pdf] on p. [2] of the PDF file; accessed February 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Painted herbarium ==

Between 1817 and 1821 the Hitchcock and her husband collected native plants for a conventional herbarium. At the same time, she created a 64-page album of watercolors of about 175 local flower and grass specimens for her Herbarium parvum, pictum.  This painted herbarium is in the Deerfield Academy Archives.&lt;ref&gt;http://deerfield.edu/about/archives/gallery/orra-white-hitchcock-herbarium/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mushroom album ==

Orra White married Edward Hitchcock on May 31, 1821.  In the summer and fall, she created a small watercolor album of native mushrooms and lichens, Fungi selecti picti.  Edward Hitchcock labeled and catalogued the specimens.  This painted album is in the Smith College Archives; a facsimile has been published by the Mortimer Rare Book Room, Smith College.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/rarebook/publications&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Autumnal Scenery, lithograph after Orra White Hitchcock.tif|thumb|left|Autumnal Scenery (courtesy of Amherst College Archives)]]

== Landscapes and geological illustrations ==

Orra White Hitchcock made drawings for more than 200 plates and 1,000 wood-engraved or woodcut illustrations for Edward Hitchcock's professional publications.  The subjects included landscapes, geologic strata, specimens, and more. The most well known appear in her husband's seminal works, the 1833 ''Report on the Geology, Mineralogy, Botany, and Zoology of Massachusetts'' and its successor, the 1841 ''Final Report'' produced when he was State Geologist.  For the 1833 edition, [[Pendleton's Lithography|Pendleton's Lithography]] (Boston) [[Lithography|lithographed]] nine of Orra White Hitchcock's [[Connecticut River]] Valley drawings and printed them as plates for the work.  In 1841, [[B.W. Thayer &amp; Co.|B. W. Thayer and Co.]], Lithographers (Boston) printed revised lithographs and an additional plate.  The hand-colored plate "Autumnal Scenery. View in Amherst" is Orra White Hitchcock's most frequently seen work.

== Classroom drawings ==

Between 1828 and the 1840s, Hitchcock made hundreds of large and dramatic classroom charts of geologic cross-sections, prehistoric beasts (like the Megatherium), fossils and ichnological (later called dinosaur) footprints.  She copied scientific illustrations from contemporary works and made original illustrations of Edward Hitchcock's new ideas or discoveries, like “Ornithichnites, Hitch.”  He considered them “indispensable aids” for his lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Hitchcock, ''Reminiscences of Amherst College'', Northampton, Mass.: Bridgman and Childs, 1863, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Amherst College Archives and Special Collections holds an extensive collection of classroom charts.

== Other works ==

Hitchcock's first documented published drawing is from an 1818 article by Edward_Hitchcock in the periodical ''[[Port Folio (magazine)|Port Folio]]''.  On rare occasions, she created illustrations for other scientists. Hitchcock's last documented work was her symbolic illustrations for her husband's ''Religious Lectures on Peculiar Phenomena in the Four Seasons'',&lt;ref&gt;Edward Hitchcock. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntoTAAAAYAAJ Religious Lectures on Peculiar Phenomena in the Four Seasons]'' (Amherst, Mass.:  J.S. &amp; C. Adams, 1850).&lt;/ref&gt; including an emblematic representation of spring and a stylized rainbow.

Orra White Hitchcock raised 6 surviving children, taught them art and science and was Edward Hitchcock's partner in his scientific undertakings. She travelled with her husband in the United States and to England and Europe (in 1850).  She is the mother of geologist [[Charles Henry Hitchcock]] (1836–1919) and physical education and hygiene pioneer [[Edward Hitchcock Jr.|Edward Hitchcock, Jr.]] (1828–1911).

Edward_Hitchcock acknowledged his wife's essential contributions to his work in the dedication of ''The Religion of Geology'',&lt;ref&gt;Edward Hitchcock. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UBgHAAAAQAAJ The Religion of Geology and its Connected Sciences] (Boston: Phillips, Sampson &amp; Co., 1851).&lt;/ref&gt; citing her drawings as more powerful than his pen.

Orra White Hitchcock died at 67 on May 26, 1863 from [[Consumption (disease)|consumption]].

Though she was not a trained professional, Hitchcock's scientific intellect and the artistic ability to visually transcribe key scientific principles and natural phenomena, flora and fauna, enabled her to make substantial contributions to the understanding of geology and botany in the first half of the nineteenth century in the United States.
   
While published illustrations exist, only a small number of Hitchcock's original works survives.  The Amherst College Archives and Special Collections has the most extensive documentation of her life and work, in the ''Edward and Orra White Hitchcock Papers''&lt;ref&gt;[http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/amherst/ma27_main.html Edward and Orra White Hitchcock Papers, Amherst College Archives and Special Collections.]&lt;/ref&gt; and copies of all of Edward Hitchcock's scientific publications.  The [[Mead Art Museum]] at Amherst College held the first major retrospective exhibition of her work in 2011, "Orra White Hitchcock (1796-1863): An Amherst Woman of Art and Science," with a catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Herbert and Daria D’Arienzo, ''Orra White Hitchcock (1796-1863):  An Amherst Woman of Art and Science'' (Amherst, Mass.: [[Mead Art Museum]] and [[University Press of New England]], 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt with his Page''''' (c. 1607-1608) is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] master [[Caravaggio]], in the [[Louvre]] of [[Paris]].

[[Alof de Wignacourt]] joined the Order of the Knights of Saint John (the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]) in 1564, aged seventeen, and distinguished himself the next year at the [[Siege of Malta (1565)|Great Siege of Malta]], when the Turks were defeated and never returned to the island. He was elected Grand Master in 1601, determined to enhance the prestige of the Order and its new post-siege capital, [[Valletta]]. It was not surprising, therefore, that he would welcome the opportunity to have at his court the most famous painter in Rome and Naples, Michelangelo da Caravaggio.

Caravaggio arrived in Malta from Naples in July 1607 and according to his early biographers [[Giovanni Baglione]] and [[Giovanni Bellori]], he began at once with portraits of Wignacourt and other knights from the highest ranks of the Order. This famous portrait shows the Grand Master in formal armour, holding his baton of command, every gleaming inch an image of the military might of the Knights. At the time Wignacourt was about sixty years old. He had [[Wignacourt towers|strengthened the fortifications]] of the island, built [[Wignacourt Aqueduct|an aqueduct]] to guarantee water to the city, and launched several attacks on the Turks. He had turned the Knights into a sovereign power, making himself in effect a prince answerable to no-one except the Pope, with his own increasingly wealthy court.

One of his innovations had been to surround to himself with young pages, in imitation of the fashion of the princely courts. The pages were taken from the most noble Catholic families of Europe. According to John Gash and others the page in the portrait is probably Nicholas de Paris Boissy, a French aristocrat destined for a distinguished career – he became Grand Prior of France in 1657. He is placed a little awkwardly within the composition: his feet are aligned with the feet of de Wignacourt, as if standing beside de Wignacourt, but his hand and the helmet overlap Wignacourt's elbow, giving the impression that from the waist up he is in front of the knight. The fact can be explained by Caravaggio's practice of painting separately from live models – de Wignacourt and the page were apparently not together in the studio at the same time.

The boy's lively expression and alert gaze make him an attractive subject in his own right, to the extent that he was several times copied by later artists visiting Malta.  Wignacourt, encased in splendid black and gold Milanese armour, stares upwards and outwards out of the frame in a dignified manner that invites the viewer to gaze upon him in awe, leaving the page, with his look of boyish interest, as the sole thoroughly human presence, and a far more sympathetic one than the self-conscious man of steel. The double-portrait with the pageboy was an unusual combination for the time. It may have been ordered by Wignacourt to stress the dignity of his court, or Caravaggio may have been inspired by a painting by [[Titian]] that he could have seen in his youth in Milan, ''[[Alfonso d'Avalos Addressing his Troops]]'', showing the Spanish governor of the city addressing his knights with a page beside him holding his helmet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6006">A '''rack jobber''' (also known as a '''rack merchandiser''') is a company or trader that has an agreement with a retailer to display and sell products in a store. The outlets for the products would be ones that traditionally don't stock such products such as gas stations, grocery stores and others not traditionally associated with the products sold. Often the products are of a budget variety.&lt;ref name="Sheeran 1961" /&gt;

== Etymology of the phrase ==
Rack Jobbing began in the 1930s with the Music Dealers Service with their music sheet racks which they operated.&lt;ref name="Continuum Encyclopedia 2003" /&gt; Because the ownership of the products remain the property of the rack jobber, the potential loss incurred by the seller is reduced if nobody buys the product. The proceeds of the sale from the product are then divided/shared by the rack jobber and retailer. Historically, possibly, one of the main products that have been supplied to stores in this fashion are record LPs.&lt;ref name="Cambridge online dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farlex Dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Continuum Encyclopedia 2003" /&gt; Other items that rack jobbers supply have been beauty aids, greeting cards, hardware, paperback books and toys.&lt;ref name="Ross 2003" /&gt; The display, maintenance and stock rotation of the merchandising are the responsibility of the rack jobber who must periodically come into the store.&lt;ref name="careersinmusic" /&gt;

==Record LPs==
The first LP rack jobber in the [[United States|U.S.]] was [[Elliott Wexler]] (1913–1966) who started Music Merchants in Philadelphia in 1952.&lt;ref name="Denisoff 1995" /&gt;

One record label whose catalogue was sold via rack jobbers was [[Sutton Records|Sutton]], which was founded by [[Bob Blythe]], the former president of [[Tops Records]]. In 1963, the label began with 225 records in its catalogue, which was sourced from labels that included Music Craft, Omega and Tiara.&lt;ref name="Billboard 1963 Mar 2" /&gt; Another record label that found its way into the racks was [[Crown Records]], a budget label owned by the [[Bihari brothers]].&lt;ref name="Billboard 1964 Nov 28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard 1963 Aug 24" /&gt;  In the 1960s, one third of record sales were from records sold via rack jobbers. Eventually the rack jobbers moved into more traditional department stores by making arrangements with the retailer in various ways. One of them was asking the retailer to allow a certain amount of sell-space and the rack jobber deciding what goes in the space. Also there could be a verbal guarantee that all of the products would be sold and if not, the next time around, the rack jobber would bring back merchandise that would.&lt;ref name="Denisoff 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard 1958 Apr 28" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42143">The '''Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce''' ({{lang-de|Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg}} or ''ERR'') was a [[Nazi Party]] organization dedicated to appropriating cultural property during the [[Second World War]]. It was led by the chief ideologue of the Nazi Party, [[Alfred Rosenberg]], from within the [[NSDAP Office of Foreign Affairs]] (''Außenpolitischen Amt der NSDAP'' or ''APA''). Between 1940 and 1945, the ERR operated in [[France]], the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Poland]], the [[Baltic States]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and on the territory of the Soviet Union in the ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]'' and ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]''. Much of the looted material was recovered by the Allies after the war, and returned to rightful owners, but there remains a substantial part that has been lost or remains with the Allied powers.

==Formation==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-067-10, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg|thumb|200px|Alfred Rosenberg in 1939]]

The ERR was initially a project of ''[[Advanced School of the NSDAP|Hohe Schule der NSDAP]]'', a Nazi-oriented elite university, which was subordinate to [[Alfred Rosenberg]]. Rosenberg wanted it to be a research institute filled with cultural material on the opponents of the Nazi ideology. These included Jewish, [[freemasons|Masonic]], Communist and democratic organizations from throughout Germany and from the occupied countries. Plans to build monumental buildings for the University on the shores of [[Lake Chiemsee]] failed to materialize after the outbreak of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Piper: ''Alfred Rosenberg – der Prophet des Seelenkrieges. Der gläubige Nazi in der Führungselite des nationalsozialistischen Staates.'' In: Michael Ley / Julius H. Schoeps (eds): ''Der Nationalsozialismus als politische Religion''. Bodenheim bei Mainz 1997, p. 122, {{ISBN|3-8257-0032-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the occupation of France the staff of the ERR joined the [[SS]] in the search for books, archival material, and huge stocks of artifacts that were in the possession of people of Jewish descent. Soon after the German Embassy in Paris and [[SS]]-''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' also began to steal the most valuable paintings from prominent national museums, galleries, and non-Jewish private collections. Rosenberg and his organization wanted to be involved in these art raids. He was able to get full authority from [[Adolf Hitler]] to be the only official art procurement organization acting in the occupied countries. For this reason, in a [[Führer Directive]] of 5 July 1940, Hitler authorized the ERR to confiscate:

* precious manuscripts and books from national libraries and archives;
* important artifacts of ecclesiastical authorities and Masonic lodges;
* all valuable cultural property belonging to Jews.

The "Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg" was officially established in "Office West" in [[Paris]] and was divided into different functional departments. The ERR central administration was transferred to Berlin on 1 March 1941 where it became formal subdivision of the German Foreign Office.

The Nazis were so eager to acquire valuable [[masterpiece]]s that art theft became the most important field of work of the ERR. In addition to art, many libraries were looted for the Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question in [[Frankfurt]], but especially for the library of the ''Hohe Schule''. The operations staff had eight main regional task forces and five technical task forces (music, visual arts, history, libraries, churches). Raids connected with the ERR also plundered the belongings of people deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Between April 1941 to July 1944, 29 convoys transported goods seized from Paris to [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] in Germany, the ERR's principal place of storage. Until 17 October 1944, as estimated by the ERR itself, 1,418,000 railway wagons containing books and works of art (as well as 427,000 tonnes by ship) were transitioned to Germany.

==ERR Operations==

===Belarus===
"More than two hundred libraries of Belarus, especially the state (now national) library, suffered irreparable damage during the occupation. An associate of the national library, T. Roshchina, calculated that 83 percent of the library’s collection was plundered and destroyed. After the war, some six hundred thousand volumes from the library were found in Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia, and were subsequently returned. About one million books, however, including rare and old printed volumes, have still not been located."&lt;ref&gt;Adam Maldis. "The Tragic Fate of Belarusan Museum and Library Collections During the Second World War." p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Day by day for 26 months, the Hitlerites systematically destroyed one of the most ancient Russian cities, [[Smolensk]]. The Soviet Prosecution has presented to the Tribunal a document as Document Number USSR-56, containing the report of the [[Extraordinary State Commission of the Soviet Union]]. I shall not quote this document; but I shall only refer to it and endeavor, in my own words, to emphasize the fundamental points of this document, dealing with the reported theme now. In Smolensk, the German fascist invaders plundered and destroyed the most valuable collections in the museums. They desecrated and burned down ancient monuments; they destroyed schools and institutes, libraries, and sanatoriums. The report also mentions the fact that in April 1943, the Germans needed rubble to pave the roads. For this purpose, they blew up the intermediate school. The Germans burned down all the libraries of the city and 22 schools; 646,000 volumes perished in the library fires."&lt;ref&gt;Nuremberg Trial Proceedings. Volume 8, 64th Day, Thursday, February 21, 1946. Morning Session. See the website, accessed on August 27, 2012: http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/02-21-46.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
By the middle of 1941, most of the ERR work in Belgium concentrated on small collections in Jewish homes. Larger operations involved the Jesuit convent in Enghien involved removing 200 crates of books and archives, and looting the École des Hautes Études in [[Ghent]], which involved transporting 56 crates of books. "Both institutions were considered outposts of French culture on Flemish soil and unfriendly to Nazism." The Jesuit collection was considered a treasure trove of information on the politics of Catholicism in Belgium, and of Catholic procedures to thwart the Germans. The Jesuit College in [[Leuven]] and the regional office in Brussels, for example, acted as a refuge for library materials.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia Kennedy Grimsted|Grimsted, P.K.]] ''Returned from Russia''. pp. 203–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Libraries and archives sees as enemy and international were confiscated outright by the ERR, as indicated by the following three examples. The contents of the communist bookshop OBLA, Brussels, were sent to [[Racibórz]], Poland. The records of the International Federation for Housing and Town Planning were confiscated and brought to Germany. A similar fate overtook the archives and library of the international Jesuit college at [[Enghien]], which was called a "Zentrale der anti-Deutschland speziell anti-National-Sozialistischen Information" ("Center for anti-German and anti-National Socialist Information").&lt;ref&gt;Lust, Jacques. 1997. "The Spoils of War Removed from Belgium During World War II." In: Simpson, Elizabeth, ed. "Spoils of War." p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czechoslovakia===
"The 700,000 volumes of the [[Charles University]] Library in Prague were stolen as a unit."&lt;ref&gt;Stubbings. ''Blitzkrieg and Books''. p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

A library was created in the [[Theresienstadt]] ghetto, about forty miles from [[Prague]]. Books were brought in by many of the people deported to this camp as part of their personal possessions, but also books from the collections of the Rabbinical Seminary Libraries of Berlin and [[Breslau]], and the Jewish communities of [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]] were also shipped there. Part of the German effort included having the prisoners translate and catalog many Hebrew books, to be added to the ERR "Museum of the Extinct Race" envisioned by Alfred Rosenberg. Almost 30,000 Hebrew and Judaica volumes had catalog cards created by the ghetto inmates.&lt;ref&gt;Intrator, Miriam. 2007. "People Were Literally Starving for any Kind of Reading." ''Library Trends''. Volume 55 (3) Winter 2007. pp. 516–17, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, there were 17,148 public, school and university libraries in Czechoslovakia, having a book stock of 8,528,744 volumes. Many of these items were confiscated by the Germans, especially any Czech books dealing with geography, biography or history. Works by any Czech writers were taken away, many burned, most others taken directly to the paper pulp mills. Special libraries were devastated, and suffered a loss of about 2,000,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Zivny, Ladislav. 1946. "Czechoslovak Libraries During the War and After." ''Library Journal''. June 15, 1946. p. 877.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[File:Hermann Goering - Nuremberg2.jpg|thumb|upright|Göring at the Nuremberg Trials]]
[[Georg Ebert]], who was a member of Rosenberg’s ''Aussenpolitisches Amt'' ([[NSDAP]] Bureau for Foreign Affairs, also referred to as the APA), discovered that a Masonic grand lodge, the [[Grand Orient de France]], had been abandoned in [[Paris]]. This was one of the most important Masonic grand lodge in Europe. Ebert personally guarded the building, with its library collection, museum and archives, until he could turn it over to the army. This was one point in the origin of the ERR, which eventually developed into a central headquarters in Berlin, with subsidiary offices (''Hauptarbeitsgruppen'' (Main Work Groups) in Paris, [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgrade]], [[Riga]] and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Donald E. and Herbert P. Rothfeder, 1984, "The Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg and the Looting of Jewish and Masonic Libraries During World War II." ''Journal of Library History'', volume 18 (1), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In January 1940, Hitler gave Rosenberg his task: to loot Jewish and Masonic cultural treasures, including synagogues, libraries, and archives in western Europe. By fall 1940, Hitler ordered Rosenberg to confiscate all Jewish art collections since these materials were now deemed "ownerless" by Nazi decree. Jews in France, as in most of Europe, were now labeled "stateless" and no longer had property rights. With France part of the German-occupied territories, the ERR and Rosenberg now fell under [[Hermann Göring]]'s authority and control, with the Gestapo seeking out Jewish houses, apartments, and shops in the hopes of finding valuable pieces."&lt;ref&gt;Rothfeld, Anne, 2002, "Nazi Looted Art: The Holocaust Records Preservation Project." ''Prologue'', Volume 34 (3), Fall 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Alfred Rosenberg]] reported to Hitler that his Einsatzstab had commenced confiscations in Paris by October 1940, with the assistance of the [[Service de Sûreté]] (S.D.) and the "[[Police Secrète Militaire]] ([[Geheime Feldpolizei]])."&lt;ref&gt;Cassou, Jean. 1947. ''Le Pillage par les Allemands des Œuvres d’Art et des Bibliothèques Appartenant à des Juifs en France''. Pages 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Sonderstab Bildende Kunst]]" (Special Arts Staff), a section of the ERR, confiscated numerous Jewish art collections, often of international renown (for instance, the Rothschild collection). In the Netherlands, this Sonderstab did not seize much more than about a thousand works of art. The [[Sonderstab Musik, Kirchen, Osten, Bibliothekenaufbau der Hohen Schule und Rassenpolititische Fragen]] (Special Staffs for Music, Churches, the East, the High School Library and Race-political Questions) each fought for its own corner. By 1942, no fewer than 3,500 collections, libraries and archives had been ‘secured’ by the [[Hauptarbeitsgruppe Frankreich]] (Main Working Group, France) of the ERR- France having been divided into five districts.&lt;ref&gt;Aalders, Gerard. ''Nazi Looting''. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The libraries of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] (AIU) and the French Rabbinical Seminary (SIF) were high on the list of German locations to loot. The AIU had built a new library in 1937, including an eight story high tower and reading room, and boasting of 50,000 books. By March 1940, 647 crates of books had been removed from the AIU, and 243 crates of books from the SIF. A list by the ERR dated March 1941 indicated that 81 libraries had been looted in Paris alone, and a later supplemental list included another 30 libraries of Jewish, Masonic, socialist and émigré collections had been seized.&lt;ref&gt;Grimsted. ''Returned from Russia''. pp. 137–139.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:JohannesVermeer-TheAstronomer(1668).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vermeer]]'s ''The Astronomer'', donated to charity by the [[Rothschild]] family in 1982.]]
"These albums were created by the staff of the Third Reich’s Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR). This special unit was organized in the summer of 1940 under Reich Leader [[Alfred Rosenberg]], initially to collect political material in occupied countries for exploitation in the "struggle against Jewry and [[Freemason]]ry." The ERR established its base of operations in Paris in July 1940 and on November 5, [[Hermann Göring]] assigned the ERR the responsibility for the confiscation of "ownerless" Jewish art collections. On November 18 of that year, Adolf Hitler ordered that all confiscated works of art be brought to Germany and placed at his personal disposal.

Before the war, Paris was the world's largest and most important art market. This was where well-off French, European and American collectors bought and sold their best pieces. From the beginning of the century, Jewish ''marchands d'art'' had established themselves as the best art dealers and experts, resultantly shaping and influencing global taste. Dealers included: the Wildensteins, where [[Georges Wildenstein]] dealt in Old Masters; the [[Bernheim-Jeune]]s who specialized in Impressionists and post-Impressionists painters, and in 1901 had opened the first [[Van Gogh]] show; and [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], the contracted dealer of [[Picasso]] and [[Braque]].&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next several years, the ERR would be engaged in an extensive and elaborate art looting operation in France that was part of Hitler’s much larger premeditated plan to steal art treasures from conquered nations. Soon after the German occupation of France in 1940, the German military, and subsequently the ERR, focused their art confiscations on the world-renowned Jewish-owned art collections from families such as the [[Rothschilds]], and the [[Veil-Picards]], [[Alphonse Kann]], and Jewish dealers such as the [[Germain Seligman|Seligman]]ns. According to the German ERR documents from 1944, the art seizures in France totaled 21,903 objects from 203 collections. There were 5,009 items confiscated from the Rothschild family collections, 2,687 items from the [[David-Weill]] collection, and 1,202 from Alphonse Kann’s collection. French officials, at the end of the war, estimated that one third of all art in French private hands had been confiscated.&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt;

====Jeu de Paume Galerie====
[[Image:Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]]
All looted and confiscated art works were initially shipped by truck to the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], where Nazi art historians, experts, photographers, maintenance and administrative personnel appraised, filed, photographed and packed the now decreed "ownerless cultural goods" for transport to Germany.&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt; The first shipment art works sent to Germany from Paris required 30 rail cars and consisted primarily of Rothschild paintings intended for the [[Führermuseum|Führermuseum/European Museum of Art (EMoA)]] in [[Linz]], Austria. Among the first fifty-three paintings shipped to Hitler was [[Vermeer]]’s Astronomer from the [[Édouard de Rothschild]] collection, today in the [[Musée du Louvre]] in Paris. As the ERR staff looted and catalogued the French collections, they created photograph albums specifically intended for the [[Reich Chancellery]] and Hitler in an effort to keep them apprised of their work in France, and more importantly, to provide a catalogue of items from which Hitler and his curators could choose art treasures for EMoA. A group of these photograph albums were presented to Hitler on the occasion of his birthday on 20 April 1943, by Alfred Rosenberg to "send a ray of beauty and joy into [his] revered life." ERR staff stated that nearly 100 such volumes were created during the years of their art looting operation."&lt;ref&gt;National Archives and Records Administration Public Affairs Staff. "National Archives Announces Discovery of Hitler Albums Documenting Looted Art."  Announcement made on November 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The latest advice from authentic neutral sources said that the [[Gestapo]] had seized the libraries of all the Masonic organizations in France. The [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] (the French National Library) there upon put in a claim for these books, but the latest word was that the Germans declined to hand over them over, saying the material would be sent to Germany for purposes of study. The library of the [[Alliance Israelite]] in Paris, worth several million francs, also was said to have been seized and sent to Germany. From the Bibliothèque Nationale - one of the world’s leading libraries - the Germans were reported to have received an inventory of manuscripts, rare books and similar material that had been stored elsewhere in France for security during the war. German officials, according to the information received here, have been exercising close supervision over the French publishing industry. They have also taken over the [[Maison du Livre de Français]], the most important French book exporting agency."&lt;ref&gt;"Nazi Police Purge Libraries in Paris." 1941. ''New York Times''. Jan 7, 1941; p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

So called ''degenerate art'' was legally banned by the Nazis from entering Germany, and so once designated was held in what was called the Martyr's Room at the Jeu de Paume. Much of Paul Rosenberg's professional dealership and personal collection were so subsequently designated by the Nazis. Following [[Joseph Goebels]] earlier private decree to sell these degenerate works for foreign currency to fund the building of the Führermuseum and the wider war effort, [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a series of ERR approved dealers to liquidate these assets and then pass the funds to swell his personal art collection, including [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. With the looted degenerate art sold onwards via [[Switzerland]], Rosenberg's collection was scattered across Europe. Today, some 70 of his paintings are missing, including: the large Picasso watercolor ''Naked Woman on the Beach'', painted in Provence in 1923; seven works by Matisse; and the ''Portrait of Gabrielle Diot'' by [[Degas]].&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt;

After the war, many of the books hidden by the Germans were collected by the [[Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives]] section of the American military government, and collected at the [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach Depot]]. There, many of the larger collections were identified and eventually returned to their owners. By the end of 1948, " ... the French regained the archives of the Paris bank of [[Rothschild Freres]], the [[Libschutz Librairie de Paris]], the library of the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle de Paris]], the library of the [[Ecole Rabbinique de Paris]], and the [[Biliothèque de Chinon]]."&lt;ref name="Poste"&gt;Posté, Leslie. 1948. "Books Go Home". ''Library Journal''. December 1, 1948, p. 1704.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
Greece was also visited by the ERR after the country’s fall in April 1941. A special unit headed by Dr. [[Johannes Pohl]], chief of the Hebraica collection at the [[Frankfurt Institute]]’s library, appeared in [[Salonica]], where he had Rosenberg agents seal the [[yeshiva]] collections, in which the city abounded. However, members of the community were able to hide or disguise many of the collections from the Germans. A later visit in September 1942 by a scholar named Maertsch, likewise resulted in no new additions to the Frankfurt library. However, a 1943 report does show that 10,000 volumes had been received from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Donald E. and Herbert P. Rothfeder, 1984, "The Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg and the Looting of Jewish and Masonic Libraries During World War II." ''Journal of Library History'', volume 18 (1), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the war, Greece was rich in libraries. The National Library, which included the Public and University libraries in Athens, contained more than 400,000 volumes. "Reports reaching American authorities in Cairo have told of the pillaging of libraries, laboratories and workshops of the Universities of Athens and Salonika ... A large part of the [[University of Athens]] library is reported to be lost. The libraries of three American colleges were reported to have been used as fuel in the central heating system used by the Germans."&lt;ref&gt;"Library Pillaging by Nazis Surveyed." 1945. ''New York Times''. Apr 4, 1945, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-729-0001-23, Italien, Überführung von Kunstschätzen.jpg|thumb|280px|German soldiers of the [[Hermann Göring Division]] posing in front of [[Palazzo Venezia]] in Rome in 1944 with a picture taken from the Biblioteca del [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Nazionale di Napoli]]]]
"The ERR were also active in the west. After the German occupations of [[Rome]] in 1943, ERR officers inspected the contents of the [[Roman Synagogue]]’s two great libraries, the [[Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica]] and [[Collegio Rabbinico Italiano]], which contained extraordinary collections gathered over the 2,000 year history of Jewish life in Rome. They demanded the libraries’ catalogs; just days before the first deportation of Roman Jews to Auschwitz, two specially ordered railcars destined for Alfred Rosenberg’s institute in Frankfurt were loaded with ten thousand books from these libraries."&lt;ref&gt;Battles, Matthew. 2003. ''Library: An Unquiet History''. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Two archaeological libraries, the [[Hertziana Library of History and Art]], and the [[German Archaeological Institute]]’s library of the history, topography, art and customs of ancient Rome, were removed from Rome and taken to Germany by the Nazis. At the end of the war, the two library collections were discovered in two Austrian salt mines packed away in 1,985 wooden cases. The German Library’s collection was unharmed, but some of the Hertziana collection and the card catalog were damaged by water when part of the mine flooded. They were returned to Rome, where they became part of the [[Galleria Comunale d'Arte Moderna, Rome|Gallery of Modern Art]], where both collections will be in the care of the new [[International Union for the study of Archaeology, Art and History in Rome]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Two Roman Libraries Regained from the Nazis." 1946. ''New York Times''. February 3, 1946. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, many of the major collections looted from Italy were identified by the [[Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives]] service of the American military government and returned to their owners. The [[Collegio Rabbinico Italiano]], the [[Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz]], and the [[Deutsche Historische Bibliothek Rom]] were all returned, although not all were intact, to their owners in Italy. "These last two collections were seized by Hitler with the idea of re-establishing them in Germany."&lt;ref name="Poste"/&gt;

===Lithuania===
In [[Vilna]] (Vilnius, Vilno, Wilno, etc.) the ERR set up a collecting point for Lithuania. Dr. Gotthard of the Berlin headquarters arrived in August 1941, and began looting the [[Mattityahu Strashun#Library|Strashun]] library. He conscripted the labor of two [[Gestapo]] prisoners, including [[A.Y. Goldschmidt]], librarian of the [[Hispanic-Ethnographic Society]]. Eventually, he committed suicide rather than assist the looting of the libraries. Dr. [[Johannes Pohl]] appeared in January 1942, and ordered that the city be made a collecting point for the region, and concentrated at the ''[[YIVO|Yidisher Visenshaftlikker Institut]]'' (Institute for Jewish Research). Materials were brought in from the private collections from [[Kaunas]], [[Šiauliai]], [[Mariampolė]], [[Volozhin]] and other towns, and included books from over 300 synagogues and personal libraries. Some of the Jewish workers were able to smuggle out and hide some of the most valuable books in the ghetto, which was stopped when the ghetto was liquidated in July 1943. The accumulated collection of over 100,000 volumes were separated into piles by century of publication, and about 20,000 were selected for shipment to Germany. The remaining materials were pulped to avoid storage and transportation costs, and to make a small profit. One incident involved an assistant of Dr. Pohl dumping out five cases of rare books in order to make room for an illegal shipment of hogs.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Donald E. and Herbert P. Rothfeder, 1984, "The Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg and the Looting of Jewish and Masonic Libraries During World War II." ''Journal of Library History'', volume 18 (1), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
"The Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg (ERR), established by Rosenberg in 1939, was represented in the Netherlands by an Amsterdam office. In 1940, the ERR confiscated all property belonging to the [[Freemason]]s, among which was the famous [[Biblioteca Klossiana]]. This library had been bought by Prince Hendrik (1876–1934) ([[Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]), husband of Queen Wilhemina ([[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]]), and had been presented by him to the order of Freemasons. It contained important [[incunabula]] and books on the [[occult]], which were not available anywhere else in the Netherlands. Other parts of the library and the order’s archive were of importance as well. The library of the [[International Institute for Social History]] in Amsterdam was closed, and the ERR took over the building for its offices. In July 1940 the institute’s very important collection of newspapers and the library of approximately 160,000 volumes were confiscated. German arguments over their final destination kept the materials in Amsterdam until the winter of 1944, when they were transported to Germany in eleven ships. The [[International Archives of the Women’s Movement]], established in Amsterdam in 1935, lost its whole collection after the institute was closed by the [[Sicherheitspolizei]] (Security Police) in June 1940. In August 1942, 499 crates containing books and archives taken from, among others, Jewish antiquarian book dealers and theosophical societies were transported to Berlin."&lt;ref&gt;Leistra, Josephine. 1997. "A Short History of Art Loss and Art Recovery in the Netherlands." In: Simpson, Elizabeth, ed. "Spoils of War." p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the looted Jewish property, especially books, was sent to Rosenberg’s ''[[Institut zur Erforschung der Judenfrage]]'' in Frankfurt. Established in March 1941, the Institute served as the core research library for the planned Hohe Schule. Some of the other ERR research institutes that received looted books included the ''[[Institut für Biologie und Rassenlehre]]'' in Stuttgart, the ''[[Institut für Religionswissenschaft]]'', and the ''[[Institut für Deutsche Volkskunde]]''. In the Netherlands, where Seeligmann’s library was looted, the ERR enjoyed a monopoly on cultural property confiscation between 1940 and 1944. A particularly large number of books were seized, with an estimated value of thirty to forty million Reichsmarks. However, not all of those books were sent to the ERR’s research institutes. Certain collections, including Seeligmann’s, were sent to other Nazi agencies, such as the Reich Main Security Office (''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]''; RSHA) in Berlin.

The RSHA was interested specifically in information about those they perceived to be the prime enemies of the state. Accordingly, the RSHA in Berlin received looted library and archival materials relating to "enemies" such as the Jews. The RSHA Office Seven (Amt VII), which specialized in ideological research, established a center for the evaluation of looted documents. By August 1943, it contained more than 500,000 catalogued volumes. Most of the Jewish materials collected by Amt VII related to Zionist groups, rescue agencies, communities, and cultural organizations. Materials pertaining to Jewish political, economic, cultural, and intellectual leaders were also collected. Seeligmann, who founded the [[Genootschap voor Joodsche Wetenschap in Nederland]] (Society for the Science of Judaism in the Netherlands) and served as president of the [[Dutch Zionist Organization]], was of interest to the RSHA. By August 1943, his library became part of the Amt VII library and archive center.&lt;ref&gt;Yavnai, Elisabeth M. 2003. "Jewish Cultural Property and Its Postwar Recovery." In: "Confiscation of Jewish Property in Europe, 1933–1945." USHMM. pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
In Norway, there were 150 school libraries and 50 public libraries that were destroyed by the Germans. Most of these libraries were in the province of [[Finnmark]], where there was widespread destruction during the evacuation of the German Army forces. The Norwegians did not burn the German propaganda works that had filled their shelves when the original Norwegian books were removed. They will be kept for the study by future generations who will want to study the period of the German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, Jessie Ash. 1947. "From Scandinavia: Task of Rebuilding 200 of Norway’s Libraries Now Under Way." ''Christian Science Monitor''. July 12, 1947, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
[[Image:Raphael missing.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Raphael]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'' was looted by the Germans from the [[Czartoryski Museum]] in 1939. ]]
" ... From the very beginning of the establishment of the [[Staatsbibliothek Krakau]], special importance was given to materials related to the natural sciences, mathematics, geography and medicine. In the fiscal year 1940–1941, the amount of money spent on book purchases was surprisingly high." The Germans recognized the value of the scientific collection, and from 1941 through 1944, 35,599 books were borrowed by 2,621 patrons, mostly German civil servants and military personnel. Polish civilians were not allowed access to the library during the occupation. [[Gustav Abb]], the German overseer of libraries, decided to send much of the reference collection to Germany in 1944. "Abb decided to send the major part of the reference collection, as well as most of the books bought by the Staatsbibliothek to Germany (altogether about 25,000 volumes). [Polish] Librarians, charged with the task of filling boxes with books, tried to sabotage Abb’s orders. They hid a large number of books and stuffed boxes with old newspapers. Despite those heroic efforts to save the collection, the Germans were still able to send a great number of books to Adelsdorf (Adelin) in [[Silesia]]. Fortunately, after the war the library was able to recover most of the books that Abb had evacuated form the library." Later in the war, the main reading room was used as sleeping quarters for German soldiers, and other parts of the library were used as a hospital for Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Sroka, Marek, 1999, "The University of Cracow Library under Nazi Occupation: 1939–1945." ''Libraries &amp; Culture'' v. 34 no 1 (Winter 1999) pp. 5, 6 and 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Frankfurter Zeitung]], Wochen-Ausgabe, 28 March 1941: "For us it is a matter of special pride to destroy the [[Yeshiva|Talmudic Academy]] which has been known as the greatest in Poland ... We threw out of the building the great Talmudic Library and carted it to market. There we set fire to the books. The fire lasted for twenty hours. The Jews of [[Lublin]] were assembled around and cried bitterly. The cries almost silenced us. Then we summoned a military band, and the joyful shouts of the soldiers silenced the sounds of Jewish cries."&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Kenneth R. 1946. "The Conquest of Books." ''Library Journal''. Volume 71 (2), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
Rosenberg commanded the "Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg für die Besetzten Gebiete" or "ERR," that was responsible for collecting art, books and cultural objects from invaded countries, also returned their captured library collection back to Berlin during the retreat from Soviet Union. The ERR stands for "Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg für die Besetzten Gebiete" which means the "Reich Leader Rosenberg Task Force for Occupied Territories." "ERR dispatches note they had to abandon their offices before the removal of the materials on hand could be completed ‘due to lack of loading spaces’ and the fact that German artillery, located in the center of the city [Kiev], was firing continually over their heads. Still, they managed to send on both their paintings 9,279) and prehistoric materials, which had come from [[Kharkov]], their own library and office furniture, and the materials collected by the [[Department of Seizures]], amounting to some ten thousand books and nearly a hundred cases of [[Bolshevist]] paintings, documents and archives ... "&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lynn H. ''The Rape of Europa''. pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the note of Vaycheslav M. Molotov [sic: [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]], People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, dated 27 April 1942, presented before the [[International Military Tribunal]], it was recorded that the Germans burned the library of 40,000 volumes belonging to one of the oldest agricultural libraries in the [[U.S.S.R.]], the [[Shatilov]] selection station in the [[Oryol|Orel]] district. Also submitted to the International Military Tribunal was the statement following: "There was no limit to the desecration of the Hitlerite vandals of the monuments and homes representing Ukrainian history, culture and art. Suffice to mention, as an example of the constant attempts to humiliate the national dignity of the Ukrainian people, that after plundering the [[Korolenko Library]] in [[Kharkov]], the occupiers used the books as paving stones for the muddy street in order to facilitate the passage of motor vehicles."&lt;ref&gt;Posté, Leslie I. "The Development of US Protection of Libraries and Archives in Europe During World War II." pp. 240–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

1941–1944 Soviet Union: As a result of the German invasion, heavy damage was done to Russian libraries. It has been estimated that more than 100 million books have been destroyed, mainly from public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeven, Hans van der; Van Albada, Joan, 1996, "Memory of the World: Lost Memory: Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the 20th Century." pp. 7–15. They comment from: ''Bibliothekswesen und Bibliographie in der USSR. Uebersetzungen aus der Grossen Sowjetenzyklopädie''. Berlin [c. 1958], 38; ELI vol. 26, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

"At [[Pskov]], 1,026 church books were removed from the kremlin (fortress), including sixteenth- to eighteenth- century manuscripts and seventeenth century printed books. Nearly 35,000 volumes were removed from the Pskov pedagogical institute, including 25,000 works of Russian scholars. At Novgorod, the library of the historical museum which was "displaced", contained rare periodicals such as Russkaia rech’ of 1880 and Bibliograf of 1860. Books removed included editions of [[Voltaire]] of 1785 and [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] of 1796. All in all, 35,000 volumes were removed. Unique editions of [[archaeology]], including 51 books on the history of ancient Russia, were removed from the [[Novgorod]] library for the German professor Engel. Publications on ethnology were removed for Professor Thiele ... The above-mentioned [[Sonderkommando Künsberg]] was active in removing the [[czar]]s’ libraries from the suburbs of [[Leningrad]] and the contents of museums and libraries from [[Rostov]] and [[Taganrog]]. In addition to the ERR, Künsberg’s clients were: the main branch of the Reich Security Agency; RSHA ([[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]); the geographic service of the ministry of Foreign Affairs; the State Library; the Slavic Studies seminar; and the [[Hermann Göring]] economic library."&lt;ref&gt;Shvidkoi, Mikkhail. 1997. "Russian Cultural Losses During World War II." In: Simpson, Elizabeth, ed. "Spoils of War." pp. 69, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinrich Himmler]] sent a secret message to the [[SS]] and ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) units in order to ensure their cooperation with the main troops in the total destruction and devastation of the parts of the Ukraine to be evacuated: "The aim to be achieved is that when the areas in the [[Ukraine]] are evacuated, not a human being, not a single head of cattle, not a hundredweight of cereals, and not a railway line remains behind; that not a house remains standing, not a mine exists that is not ruined for years to come, that there is no well left unpoisoned. The enemy must really find a land completely burnt and destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;Crankshaw, Edward. 1956. ''Gestapo: Instrument of Tyranny''. pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial recovery after the war==
It is estimated that Nazi Germany looted three million books during the course of the war. Of these, more than one million were discovered by American forces at [[Hungen]], [[Hesse]], in May 1945. The books had been moved there from Frankfurt in early 1944 when Allied bombing of the city became threat to the collection and were subsequently moved back to the former Rothschild Library for cataloguing.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" &gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date= |title=Activity Report on the activities of the commission for the recovery of the bibliographic patrimony of the Jewish community in Rome stolen in 1943 |url=http://presidenza.governo.it/USRI/confessioni/doc/rapporto_finale_eng.pdf |publisher=[[Government of Italy]] - [[Presidency of the Council of Ministers (Italy)|Presidency of the Council of Ministers]]|page= |docket= |access-date=3 October 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mystery" &gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Frank|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/194543/missing-jewish-books-of-rome |title=The Mystery of the Missing Jewish Books of Rome |date= |publisher=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|website= |access-date=3 October 2018 |language= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=E.

[[File:Gullager Salisbury.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Portrait of a woman wearing a heavily ruffled [[cap]], 1789]]
In [[sewing]] and [[dressmaking]], a '''ruffle''', '''frill''', or '''furbelow''' is a strip of [[textile|fabric]], [[lace]] or [[ribbon]] tightly [[gather (sewing)|gathered]] or [[pleat]]ed on one edge and applied to a [[clothing|garment]], [[bedding]], or other textile as a form of [[trim (sewing)|trimming]].&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield, S.F.A. and B.C. Saward, ''The Dictionary of Needlework'', 1885, facsimile edition, Blaketon Hall, 1989, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''flounce''' is a particular type of fabric manipulation that creates a similar look but with less bulk. The term derives from earlier terms of ''frounce'' or ''fronce''.&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield and Saward, ''The Dictionary of Needlework'', p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; A wavy effect is achieved without gathers or pleats by cutting a curved strip of fabric and applying the inner or shorter edge to the garment. The depth of the curve as well as the width of the fabric determines the depth of the flounce. A [[godet (sewing)|godet]] is a circle wedge that can be inserted into a flounce to further deepen the outer floating wave without adding additional bulk at the point of attachment to the body of the garment, such as at the hemline, collar or sleeve.

Ruffles appeared at the [[draw-string]] necklines of full [[chemise]]s in the 15th century, evolved into the separately-constructed [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] of the 16th century. Ruffles and flounces remained a fashionable form of trim, off-and-on into modern times.&lt;ref&gt;For styles and construction of ruffles, frills and flounces through the centuries, see the Arnold, Baumgarten and Tozer volumes listed below&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Tell es-Sultan''' (Sultan's Hill) is a [[UNESCO]]-listed archaeological site in the [[West Bank]],&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Jericho: Tell es-Sultan|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5704/|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; located two kilometres north of the centre of [[Jericho]]. The [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] was inhabited from the 10th millennium BCE, and has been called "the oldest town in the world", with many significant archaeological finds; the site is also notable for its role in the history of [[Levantine archaeology]].

==History==

===Natufian hunter-gatherers, {{circa}} 10,000 BCE===
The first permanent settlement on the site developed between 10,000 and 9000 BCE.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mama.org/exhibits/ancient/prehistoric/ |title=Prehistoric Cultures |publisher=Museum of Ancient and Modern Art |year=2010 |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Younger Dryas]] period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, Tell es-Sultan was a popular camping ground for [[Natufian]] hunter-gatherer groups due to the nearby [[Ein as-Sultan]] spring; these hunter-gatherers left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mithen |first=Steven |title=After the ice: a global human history, 20,000-5000 BCE |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Mass. |isbn=0-674-01999-7 |page=57 |edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 9600 BCE the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas [[stadial]] came to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement. [[Epipaleolithic]] construction at the site appears to predate the invention of [[agriculture]], with the construction of Natufian structures beginning earlier than 9000 BC, the very beginning of the [[Holocene]] epoch in geologic history.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp689&gt;Freedman et al., 2000, p. 689–671.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Pottery Neolithic, {{circa}} 8500 BCE===
[[File:Jerycho8.jpg|right|thumb|Dwelling foundations unearthed at Tell es-Sultan in Jericho]]
:'''Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)'''
The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A phase at Tell es-Sultan (ca. 8500 – 7500 BCE)&lt;ref name=Nigro&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nigro|first1=Lorenzo|title=THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF COLLAPSE AND RESILIENCE: TELL ES-SULTAN/ANCIENT JERICHO AS A CASE STUDY|journal=ROME «LA SAPIENZA» STUDIES ON THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PALESTINE &amp; TRANSJORDAN|date=2014|volume=11|page=272|url=https://www.academia.edu/8688397/The_Archaeology_of_Collapse_and_Resilience_Tell_es-Sultan_ancient_Jericho_as_a_Case_Study|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the emergence of one of the world's first major [[proto-cities]]. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed "[[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]]" (abbreviated as PPNA), sometimes called the [[Neolithic#Fertile Crescent|Sultanian]] era after the town. PPNA villages are characterized by small circular dwellings, burial of the dead under the floor of buildings, reliance on hunting wild game, the cultivation of wild or domestic cereals, and no use of pottery yet.

The PPNA-era town, a settlement of around {{convert|40000|m2}}, contained round mud-brick houses, yet no street planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourfatherlutheran.net/biblehomelands/palestine/jericho/jericho.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220035014/http://www.ourfatherlutheran.net/biblehomelands/palestine/jericho/jericho.htm |archivedate=20 February 2008 |title=Old Testament Jericho |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=20 February 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circular dwellings were built of [[Adobe|clay and straw]] bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about {{convert|5|m}} across, and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity and number of the inhabitants of Jericho during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates going as high as 2000–3000, and as low as 200–300.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9043547/Jericho "Jericho"], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akkermans 2004 57"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Akkermans |first1=Peter M.

The town was surrounded by a massive stone wall over {{convert|3.6|m}} high and {{convert|1.8|m}} wide at the base (see [[Tell es-Sultan#Wall of Jericho|Wall of Jericho]]), inside of which stood a stone tower (see [[Tell es-Sultan#Tower of Jericho|Tower of Jericho]]), placed in the centre of the west side of the tell.&lt;ref name="BarkaiLiran"&gt;Ran Barkai and Roy Liran.

:'''Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)'''
After a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]. This second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten [[plastered human skulls]], painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features.&lt;ref name=Ringp367&gt;Ring et al., 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R44VRnNCzAYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA367&amp;dq=jericho+babylonian+ring&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 367–370].&lt;/ref&gt; These represent either [[teraphim]] or an early example of [[portrait]]ure in [[art history]], and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp689/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;Janson and Janson, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bounding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room ({{convert|6.5|x|4|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} and {{convert|7|x|3|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}) with internal divisions, the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish [[terrazzo]]-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.

[[Kathleen Kenyon]] interpreted one building as a [[shrine]]. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fit into this niche.

The dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A [[human skull|skull]] cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; [[cowry|cowries]] were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in [[Tell Ramad]] and [[Beisamoun]] as well.

Other finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, scrapers, a few [[tranchet axe]]s, [[obsidian]], and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also [[Quern-stone|querns]], hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and [[Therianthropy|theriomorphic]] clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.

===Bronze Age===
:''This section deals with the archaeology of Bronze Age Jericho; for the Biblical battle, see [[Battle of Jericho]]''
A succession of settlements followed from 4500 BCE onward, the largest constructed in 2600 BCE.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

Tell es-Sultan was continually occupied into the Middle Bronze Age; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.{{sfn|Kuijt|2012|p=167}}

During the Middle Bronze Age Tell es-Sultan was a small prominent city of the [[Canaan]] region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the [[Maryannu]], a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the [[Mitanni]]te state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported "...the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period" and there was "a massive stone revetment... part of a complex system" of defenses (pp.&amp;nbsp;213–218).&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, Kathleen "Digging up Jericho"(London, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronze-Age city fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530 BCE. Notably this carbon dating {{circa}} 1573 BCE confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating {{circa}} 1550 by Kenyon.

===Iron Age===
Tell es-Sultan remained unoccupied from the end of the 15th to the 10th-9th centuries BCE, when the city was rebuilt.{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}} Of this new city not much more remains than a [[Four room house|four-room house]] on the eastern slope.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"&gt;{{cite book |work=Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land |title=Jericho |author=Avraham Negev and Shimon Gibson |year=2001 |location=New York and London |publisher=Continuum |page=259 |isbn=0-8264-1316-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 7th century Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the [[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylonian]] conquest of [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]] in the late{{dubious|586 BCE is rather early, not late, in the century.|date=June 2017}} 6th century.{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}}

===Abandonment of the Tell===
After the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late{{dubious|586 BCE is rather early, not late, in the century.|date=June 2017}} 6th century,{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}} whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the [[Return to Zion#The return to Zion|Restoration]] after the [[Babylonian captivity]], left only very few remains.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt; The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt;

==Archaeological excavation==
{{See also|Levantine archaeology}}
The first excavations of the site were made by [[Charles Warren]] in 1868 at the request of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]. He dug through the mud bricks of the [[Tell es-Sultan#Wall of Jericho|wall]] without realizing what it was, suggesting there was little of interest at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wagemakers |first1=Bart |title=Archaeology in the 'Land of Tells and Ruins': A History of Excavations in the Holy Land Inspired by the Photographs and Accounts of Leo Boer |date=2014 |publisher=Oxbow Books |isbn=9781782972464 |page=122ff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNAVBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Sellin]] and [[Carl Watzinger]] excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907–1909 and in 1911, finding the remains of two walls which they initially suggested supported the [[Bible|biblical]] account of the [[Battle of Jericho]]. They later revised this conclusion and dated their finds to the Middle [[Bronze Age]] (1950-1550 BC).&lt;ref name="Hoppe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie J. Hoppe|title=New light from old stories: the Hebrew scriptures for today's world, p. 81-|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPUAPIYRTtAC&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=September 2005|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=978-0-8091-4116-6|pages=82–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was again excavated by [[John Garstang]] between 1930 and 1936, who again raised the suggestion that remains of the upper wall was that described in the [[Bible]], and dated to around 1400 BCE.&lt;ref name="Bromiley1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey W. Bromiley|title=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A-D|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wo8csizDv0gC&amp;pg=PA275|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=13 February 1995|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-3781-3|pages=275–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive investigations using more modern techniques were made by [[Kathleen Kenyon]] between 1952 and 1958. Her excavations discovered a [[Tell es-Sultan#Tower of Jericho|tower]] and [[Tell es-Sultan#Wall of Jericho|wall]] in trench I. Kenyon provided evidence that both constructions dated much earlier than previous estimates of the site's age, to the [[Neolithic]], and were part of an early [[proto-city]]. Her excavations found a series of seventeen early Bronze Age walls, some of which she thought may have been destroyed by [[earthquake]]s. The last of the walls was put together in a hurry, indicating that the settlement had been destroyed by nomadic invaders. Another wall was built by a more sophisticated culture in the Middle Bronze Age with a steep [[plaster]]ed escarpment leading up to mud bricks on top.&lt;ref name="Bromiley1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam C. Davis|title=Dame Kathleen Kenyon: digging up the Holy Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qYqFpz_4CwC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=9 July 2011|year=2008|publisher=Left Coast Press|isbn=978-1-59874-326-5|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lorenzo Nigro]] and [[Nicolo Marchetti]] conducted excavations in 1997-2000. Since 2009 the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome "La Sapienza" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH under the direction of Lorenzo Nigro and Hamdan Taha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tell es-Sultan/Jericho|url=http://www.lasapienzatojericho.it/|publisher=Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies by Ran Barkai from [[Tel Aviv University]] and Roy Liran have suggested [[astronomical]] and [[social]], rather than military, purposes in the construction of the tower.&lt;ref name="Parry"/&gt;

As he grew older, he studied at [[Benchen Monastery]]&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt; and was eventually [[Dharma name|given the name]] Karma Tenzin Thinle Namgyal from [[Tai Situpa|Situ Rinpoche]].&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt; Soon after, he was given ordination by Situ Rinpoche and entered a three-year retreat.&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt;

He was an expert in mandala painting and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Tenga_Rinpoche Tenga Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Tenga Rinpoche left Benchen for [[Lhasa]]. After the [[14th Dalai Lama]] left Tibet in relation with the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], he escaped with [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], and the brother of Dilgo Khyentse, the 9th [[Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche]].&lt;ref name="Tenga Brilliant Moon"&gt;Tenga Rinpoche, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0voLU0FgYy8C&amp;pg=PA193 Visions in Exile] p. 193-197, in ''Brilliant Moon: The Autobiography of Dilgo Khyentse''&lt;/ref&gt; He then eventually traveled to northern India.&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt; In India, he settled at [[Rumtek Monastery]], the main seat of [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa Lama|the 16th Karmapa]].&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt; Tenga Rinpoche served the 16th Karmapa for seventeen years,&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt; nine of those years in the position of [[Dorje Lopön]].&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt;

In 1976 Tenga Rinpoche settled in [[Swayambhunath]], [[Nepal]], where he founded a second Benchen Monastery and a retreat center in [[Pharping]].&lt;ref name="Tenga Brilliant Moon" /&gt;

In 1986, Tenga Rinpoche established the new [[Benchen Monastery]] in [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt;

He visited France regularly, giving teachings at [[Kagyu-Dzong]] in Paris and [[Vajradhara-Ling]] in Normandy. On September 21, 2003, he laid the [[cornerstone]] of the [[Temple for Peace]] in Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727140515/http://www.oceandesagesse.org/doc/dossier_presse_FR.pdf Dalaï Lama France 2008], see page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2012, at 3:24 in the morning Nepali time, Tenga Rinpoche died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benchen.org/en/tenga-rinpoche/news/231-the-passing-of-tenga-rinpoche.html The passing of Tenga Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyima Döndrup, the yangsi (reincarnation) of the previous Tenga Rinpoche was born December 14, 2014 in Nepal. He was discovered in 2017 following the indications of the [[Ogyen Trinley Dorje|17th Karmapa]] who met him on March 21, 2017 in [[Bodhgaya]] for a ceremony at Tergar Monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kagyuoffice.org/an-amazing-story-finding-the-reincarnation-of-tenga-rinpoche/ An Amazing Story: Finding the Reincarnation of Tenga Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Floating Feather''''' is the commonly used name for an [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] artist [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]], properly titled '''''A Pelican and Other Birds Near a Pool'''''. The fine detail of the [[feather]] floating on the pond led to the "official" title being quickly supplanted.

The picture was painted around 1680, probably for either the hunting lodge of the [[Stadholder]] [[William III of England|William III of Orange]], which is now the royal palace at [[Soestdijk]], or [[Het Loo|Het Loo Palace]] in [[Apeldoorn]].

The painting shows a number of [[bird]]s, both common and exotic, gathered around a pool. Hondecoeter was known for his bird studies and in particular for the realistic portrayal of the subjects. Although he experimented with different styles early in his career, after 1660 he favoured compositions similar to that seen in ''The Floating Feather'': carefully observed subjects set in farmyards, courtyards or country parks with architectural or landscape features enhancing the backgrounds. His paintings were admired by the regents and merchants of [[Amsterdam]], and by William III, who had works at three of his palaces. Hondecoeter's murals and large paintings were well-suited to both the large country houses and the tastes of the time.

Hondecoeter kept his own [[poultry]] yard at his house, but visited the country houses of his patrons where he could study more exotic species. It was said that he had trained a [[rooster]] to stand still on command, so that he could paint it without interruption. In this picture, alongside the [[great white pelican]] are species of wild fowl and [[domesticated duck]], among them a [[Eurasian teal]], [[common merganser]], [[red-breasted goose]], [[Eurasian wigeon]], [[common shelduck]], [[muscovy duck]], [[brant goose]], [[smew]], [[Egyptian goose]], and [[northern pintail]]. On the far side of the pool are also large birds from different continents: a [[southern cassowary]], [[black crowned crane]],  and [[American flamingo]]. A [[sarus crane]] and a second flamingo are visible in the background. Flying above the pool there is a [[golden oriole]] depicted.
[[Image:pelicanpark.jpg|left|thumb|''A Pelican and other exotic birds in a park'']]
Hondecoeter produced a strikingly similar picture, ''A Pelican and other exotic birds in a park'', in which some elements of the composition are identical: the birds on the water, the group of exotic birds, the pelican, and the floating feather. Other features are similar, such as the landscape and the muscovy duck which is seen in full, while some are entirely different; in this picture a [[Moluccan cockatoo]] perches in a tree above the pool and different birds are introduced on the far side of the pool to the right. The exact date of this painting is not known, but it is estimated to be between 1655 and 1660.

== Critical Response ==
In ''The Asian Review of Books'', Nigel Collett called ''The Gurkha's Daughter'' a "promising debut", adding that Parajuly, "gets deep under the skin of his characters to reveal the often very difficult circumstances in which they live. I am aware of no other writer in English who has so vividly brought to life the dilemmas and constrictions of daily Nepalese life. The effect is poignant." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianreviewofbooks.com/new/?ID=1397#!&lt;/ref&gt;  Babatdor Dkhar of the ''Calcutta Telegraph'' referenced the initial buzz surrounding Parajuly's two-book deal, saying that fears he would not live up to expectation proved unfounded.  "Parajuly paints colourful landscapes of a world that forever has remained in the background. A world that made sense in the stereotype. A world whose characters come out of their small roles and make the starring ones their own. He brings to life the dreams, the everyday, the aspirations, the failures, love, the differences that add and the ones that remove." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130104/jsp/northeast/story_16399935.jsp#.UzNcVM6a_-K&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Lady'' magazine gave three stars to the collection, saying they were, "Stylistically reminiscent of Raymond Carver, while at the same time opening a door on to an unfamiliar world." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lady.co.uk/culture/books/1580-book-reviews-2-january?highlight=WyJ0aGUiLCJndXJraGEncyIsImRhdWdodGVyIiwic3RvcmllcyIsInRoZSBndXJraGEncyIsInRoZSBndXJraGEncyBkYXVnaHRlciIsImd1cmtoYSdzIGRhdWdodGVyIiwiZ3Vya2hhJ3MgZGF1Z2h0ZXIgc3RvcmllcyIsImRhdWdodGVyIHN0b3JpZXMiXQ==&lt;/ref&gt; John Garth in ''The Guardian'' has written a long review of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/25/gurkhas-daughter-prajwal-parajuly-review|title=The Gurkha's Daughter by Prajwal Parajuly – review|last=Garth|first=John|date=25 January 2013|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tower of Babel''''' was the subject of three paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. The first, a miniature painted on ivory, was painted while Bruegel was in Rome and is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, 6, one of the works belonging to [[Giulio Clovio]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morra|first=Joanne|title=Utopia Lost: Allegory, Ruins and Pieter Bruegel’s Towers of Babel|journal=Art History|year=2007|volume=30|issue=2|pages=200|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8365.2007.00538.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two surviving paintings, often distinguished by the prefix "Great" and "Little", are in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]] and the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] in [[Rotterdam]] respectively.  Both are [[oil painting]]s on wood panels.

The Rotterdam painting is about half the size of the Vienna one. In broad terms they have exactly the same composition, but at a detailed level everything is different, whether in the architecture of the tower or in the sky and the landscape around the tower.  The Vienna version has a group in the foreground, with the main figure presumably [[Nimrod]], who was believed to have ordered the construction of the tower,&lt;ref name="Art and the Bible" /&gt; although the Bible does not actually say this.  In Vienna the tower rises at the edge of a large city, but the Rotterdam tower is in open countryside. 

The paintings depict the construction of the [[Tower of Babel]], which, according to the [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Bible]], was built by a unified, [[Confusion of tongues|monolingual]] humanity as a mark of their achievement and to prevent them from scattering: "Then they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.'" (Genesis 11:4).

==Description and analysis==
Bruegel's depiction of the architecture of the tower, with its numerous arches and other examples of [[Roman engineering]], is deliberately reminiscent of the Roman [[Colosseum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malam|first=John|title=Pieter Bruegel|year=1999|publisher=Carolrhoda Books|isbn=1-57505-366-7|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Christians of the time saw as a symbol of both hubris and persecution. Bruegel had visited [[Rome]] in 1552–1553. Back in [[Antwerp]], he may have refreshed his memory of Rome with a series of engravings of the principal landmarks of the city made by the publisher of his own prints, [[Hieronymous Cock]], for he incorporated details of Cock's engravings of Roman views in both surviving versions of the ''Tower of Babel''.  

The parallel of Rome and [[Babylon]] had a particular significance for Bruegel's contemporaries: Rome was the Eternal City, intended by the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]] to last forever, and its decay and ruin were taken to symbolize the vanity and transience of earthly efforts.&lt;ref name="Art and the Bible"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tower of Babel|url=http://www.artbible.info/art/tower-of-babel.html|work=Art and the Bible|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tower was also symbolic of the religious turmoil between the [[Catholic church]] (which at the time conducted all services in Latin) and the polyglot Protestant religion that was increasingly popular in the [[Netherlands]].  The subject may have had a specific topicality, as the famous [[Plantin Polyglot|Polyglot Bible]] in six languages, a landmark in Biblical scholarship, was published in Antwerp in 1566.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 502&lt;/ref&gt;  Although at first glance the tower appears to be a stable series of concentric pillars, upon closer examination it is apparent that none of the layers lies at a true horizontal. Rather the tower is built as an ascending spiral.

The workers in the painting have built the [[arch]]es perpendicular to the slanted ground, thereby making them unstable, and a few arches can already be seen crumbling. The foundation and bottom layers of the tower had not been completed before the higher layers were constructed.
[[File:La Tour de Babel, Van Valckenborch, 1594.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Van Valckenborch's ''Tower of Babel'' 1594]]
[[Lucas van Valckenborch]], a contemporary of Bruegel's, also painted the Tower of Babel in the 1560s and later in his career, possibly after seeing Bruegel's depiction.&lt;ref name="Art and the Bible" /&gt; Both were part of a larger tradition of painting the tower during the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew West (linguist)|title=72 More Views of the Tower of Babel|url=http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2008/12/72-more-views-of-tower-of-babel.html|work=BabelStone|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (detail) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail at right side, with original rock formation.]]

The story of the [[Tower of Babel]] (like that in [[The Suicide of Saul]], Bruegel's only other painting with an [[Old Testament]] subject) was interpreted as an example of pride punished, and that is no doubt what Bruegel intended his painting to illustrate.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the hectic activity of the engineers, masons and workmen points to a second moral: the futility of much human endeavour. [[Nimrod]]'s doomed building was used to illustrate this meaning in [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]]''.&lt;ref&gt;This book's online text may be viewed at [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20179 ''The Ship of Fools''], [[Project Gutenberg]]. See also article by N. Collins, on [http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/tower-of-babel.htm Encyclopedia of Art Education] Accessed 4 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Bruegel's knowledge of building procedures and techniques is considerable and correct in detail. The skill with which he has shown these activities recalls that his very last commission, left unfinished at his death, was for a series of documentary paintings recording the digging of a canal linking [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Allegretti, ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Both towers are shown partly-built with stone facings over a massive brick framework, a typical technique in [[Roman architecture]], used in the Colosseum and other huge Roman buildings.  Grand and formal architecture of this sort is not a usual interest of Bruegel in either paintings or drawings, although it was typical subject matter for many of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 502; Orenstein, 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;  Nadine Orenstein, in discussing his only known drawing of buildings in Rome, concludes from the details taken from the Colosseum in both ''Tower'' paintings that he "must" have recorded them in drawings on his visit ten years before, but given the easy availability of prints this does not seem conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, 96-97; see [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=712020&amp;partId=1 this British Museum page] for another drawing of Roman ruins, perhaps the Colosseum, recently attributed to Bruegel&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no surviving drawings that are studies for this or any other of Bruegel's paintings. This is despite indications that Bruegel did make use of preparatory studies. Both ''Tower'' versions are full of the type of details which are likely to have been worked out in sketches first.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;  Except for a lack of mountains, the paintings contain the main ingredients of the [[world landscape]], a type of composition followed in many of Bruegel's earlier landscapes.  The Vienna tower is built around a very steep small mountain, which can be seen protruding from the architecture at the centre near the ground and to the right higher up.

==Provenance==
The Vienna painting is signed and dated "Brvegel. FE. M.CCCCC.LXIII ", on the stone block directly in front of the king.  It was painted in 1563 for the Antwerp banker [[Nicolaes Jonghelinck]],&lt;ref name="khm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bilddatenbank.khm.at/viewArtefact?id=323 |title=KHM Bilddatenbank |accessdate=2011-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103131309/http://bilddatenbank.khm.at/viewArtefact?id=323 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of Bruegel's best patrons, who owned no fewer than 16 of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting appears as the main element on one box art design of the video game ''[[Civilization III]]''.

They are briefly mentioned in ''[[Shadow Man (video game)|Shadowman]]'', where Jaunty explains that Bruegel was shocked at how The Asylum resembled his paintings.

The painting also makes an appearance in the 2012 video game, ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops 2]]'', in the zombie survival mode in the map, 'Green Run' on a wall in a section of the map (Town).

'''Writing NSW''', formerly known as '''New South Wales Writers' Centre''' and '''WritersNSW''', is [[New South Wales]], Australia's leading provider of services to writers, including courses, seminars and workshops, writing groups, festivals and events, grants and prizes, and information and advice. A not-for-profit organisation formerly known as the NSW Writers’ Centre, we have been providing quality support to the writers of our state since 1991.

Writing NSW is managed by Executive Director Jane McCredie. The director and staff are responsible to a management committee elected by Centre members. As of 2018 there were approximately 2,000 members.

The Centre offers a program of activities including workshops, seminars, festivals, grants and competitions, as well as mentorships, leveraging opportunities for emerging writers and suggesting pathways to publication. It is the peak body for writers in the state of New South Wales.

Writing NSW occupies Garry Owen House, a restored Georgian mansion set in the grounds of [[Callan Park Hospital for the Insane|Callan Park]]. The office is open from Monday to Friday 9:00&amp;nbsp;am to 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm and Saturday 9:00&amp;nbsp;am to 1:00&amp;nbsp;pm.

The change of name from the New South Wales Writers' Centre took place in 2018.

'''''Écriture féminine''''' translates from the [[French language|French]] as "women's writing".&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, Chris. ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Literary Terms''. OUP, 1990. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory, which unpacks the relationship between the cultural and psychological inscription of the female body and female difference in language and text,&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Showalter|Showalter, Elaine]]. Critical Inquiry, Vol. 8, No. 2, Writing and Sexual Difference, (Winter, 1981), pp. 179-205. Published by: The University of Chicago Press. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1343159&lt;/ref&gt; is a strain of [[Feminism in France|feminist literary theory that originated in France]] in the early 1970s through the work of theorists including [[Hélène Cixous]], [[Monique Wittig]], [[Luce Irigaray]],&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, Luce, ''Speculum of the Other Woman'', Cornell University Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chantal Chawaf]],&lt;ref&gt;Cesbron, Georges, " Ecritures au féminin. Propositions de lecture pour quatre livres de femmes" in Degré Second, juillet 1980: 95-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mistacco, Vicki, "Chantal Chawaf," in Les femmes et la tradition litteraire - Anthologie du Moyen Âge à nos jours; Seconde partie: XIXe-XXIe siècles, Yale Press, 2006, 327-343&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine Clément]], and [[Julia Kristeva]]&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, Julia  ''Revolution in Poetic Language'', Columbia University Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, "To Inscribe in the Feminine: A Kristevan Impossibility? Or Femininity, Melancholy and Sublimation." ''Parallax, n. 8'', [Vol. 4(3)], 1998. 81-117.&lt;/ref&gt; and has subsequently been extended by writers such as psychoanalytic theorist [[Bracha Ettinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, ''Matrix . Halal(a) - Lapsus. Notes on Painting, 1985-1992''. MOMA, Oxford, 1993. ({{ISBN|0-905836-81-2}}). Reprinted in: ''Artworking 1985-1999''. Edited by Piet Coessens. Ghent-Amsterdam: Ludion / Brussels: Palais des Beaux-Arts, 2000. ({{ISBN|90-5544-283-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, ''The Matrixial Borderspace'' (essays 1994-1999), Minnesota University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who emerged in this field in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, "Does Art Think?", in: ''Art and Thought'' Blackwell, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Écriture féminine as a theory foregrounds the importance of language for the psychic understanding of self. The theory draws on the foundational work in psychoanalysis about the way that humans come to understand their social roles. In doing so, it goes on to expound how women, who may be positioned as 'other' in a masculine symbolic order, can reaffirm their understanding of the world through engaging with their own outsiderness.&lt;ref&gt;"Murfin, Ross C." http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~rlbeebe/what_is_feminist_criticism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cixous==

[[Hélène Cixous]] first coined ''écriture féminine'' in her essay, "[[Hélène Cixous#The Laugh of the Medusa (1975)|The Laugh of the Medusa]]" (1975), where she asserts "woman must write her self: must write about women and bring women to writing, from which they have been driven away as violently as from their bodies" because their sexual pleasure has been repressed and denied expression. Inspired by Cixous' essay, a recent book titled ''Laughing with Medusa'' (2006) analyzes the collective work of [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Hélène Cixous]].&lt;ref&gt;Zajko, Vanda and Leonard, Miriam, ''Laughing with Medusa''. Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These writers are as a whole referred to by Anglophones as "the French feminists," though Mary Klages, Associate Professor in the English Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder, has pointed out that [[Post-structural feminism|"poststructuralist theoretical feminists"]] would be a more accurate term.&lt;ref name="Klages" /&gt; [[Madeleine Gagnon]] is a more recent proponent. And since the aforementioned 1975 when Cixous also founded women's studies at Vincennes, she has been as a spokeswoman for the group ''Psychanalyse et politique'' and a prolific writer of texts for their publishing house, ''des femmes''. And when asked of her own writing she says, "''Je suis là où ça parle''" ("I am there where it/id/the female unconscious speaks.") &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Ann Rosalind. Feminist Studies, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Summer, 1981), pp. 247-263. Published by: Feminist Studies, Inc. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3177523&lt;/ref&gt;

American feminist critic and writer [[Elaine Showalter]] defines this movement as "the inscription of the feminine body and female difference in language and text."&lt;ref&gt;Showalter, Elaine. "Feminist Criticism in the Wilderness." ''The New Feminist Criticism: essays on women, literature, and theory''. Elaine Showalter, ed. London: Virago, 1986. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Écriture féminine'' places experience before language, and  privileges non-linear, cyclical writing that evades "the discourse that regulates the [[phallogocentrism|phallocentric]] system."&lt;ref&gt;Cixous, Hélène. "The Laugh of the Medusa." ''New French Feminisms''. Elaine Marks and Isabelle de Courtivron, eds. New York: Schocken, 1981. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Because language is not a neutral medium, it can be said to function as an instrument of patriarchal expression. As Peter Barry writes, “the female writer is seen as suffering the handicap of having to use a medium (prose writing) which is essentially a male instrument fashioned for male purposes”.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Peter. ''Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory''. New York: Manchester UP, 2002. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Ecriture féminine'' thus exists as an antithesis of masculine writing or as a means of escape for women.&lt;ref&gt;However, the phallogocentric argument has been criticised by W. A. Borody as misrepresenting the history of philosophies of ‘’indeterminateness’’ in Western culture.  Borody claims that the "black and white" view that the masculine = determinateness and the feminine = indeterminateness contains a degree of cultural and historical validity, but not when it is deployed to self-replicate a form of gender-othering it originally sought to overcome. See Wayne A. Borody (1998) pp. 3, 5 "[http://kenstange.com/nebula/feat013/feat013.html Figuring the Phallogocentric Argument with Respect to the Classical Greek Philosophical Tradition]." ''Nebula: A Netzine of the Arts and Science'', Vol. 13 (pp. 1-27).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Rosemarie Tong, “Cixous challenged women to write themselves out of the world men constructed for women. She urged women to put themselves-the unthinkable/unthought-into words.”&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie Putnam 2008"&gt;Tong, Rosemarie Putnam. Feminist Thought : A More Comprehensive Introduction. New York: Westview P, 2008.276.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Almost everything is yet to be written by women about femininity: about their sexuality, that is, its infinite and mobile complexity; about their eroticization, sudden turn-ons of a certain minuscule-immense area of their bodies; not about destiny, but about the adventure of such and such a drive, about trips, crossings, trudges, abrupt and gradual awakenings, discoveries of a zone at once timorous and soon to be forthright.&lt;ref name=Klages&gt;Klages, Mary. "[http://www.colorado.edu/English/courses/ENGL2012Klages/cixous.html Helene Cixous: The Laugh of the Medusa]."&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With regard to [[Phallogocentrism|phallogocentric writing]], Tong argues that "male sexuality, which centers on what Cixous called the "big dick", is ultimately boring in its pointedness and singularity. Like male sexuality, masculine writing, which Cixous usually termed phallogocentric writing, is also ultimately boring" and furthermore, that "stamped with the official seal of social approval, masculine writing is too weighted down to move or change".&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie Putnam 2008" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Write, let no one hold you back, let nothing stop you: not man; not the imbecilic capitalist machinery, in which the publishing houses are the crafty, obsequious relayers of imperatives handed down by an economy that works against us and off our backs; not ''yourself''. Smug-faced readers, managing editors, and big bosses don't like the true texts of women- female-sexed texts. That kind scares them.&lt;ref&gt;Hélène Cixous, Summer 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Cixous, ''écriture féminine'' is not only a possibility for female writers; rather, she believes it can be (and has been) employed by male authors such as [[James Joyce]] or [[Jean Genet]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Some have found this idea difficult to reconcile with Cixous’ definition of ''écriture féminine'' (often termed ‘white ink’) because of the many references she makes to the female body (“There is always in her at least a little of that good mother’s milk. She writes in white ink”.&lt;ref&gt;Klages, Mary. "Helene Cixous: 'The Laugh of the Medusa.&lt;/ref&gt;) when characterizing the essence of écriture féminine and explaining its origin. This notion raises problems for some theorists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Ecriture féminine'', then, is by its nature transgressive, rule-transcending, intoxicated, but it is clear that the notion as put forward by Cixous raises many problems. The realm of the body, for instance, is seen as somehow immune to social and gender condition and able to issue forth a pure essence of the feminine. Such essentialism is difficult to square with feminism which emphasizes femininity as a social construction…"&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Peter. ''Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory''. New York: Manchester UP, 2002.128.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Irigaray and Kristeva==

For Luce Irigaray, women's sexual pleasure ''[[jouissance]]'' cannot be expressed by the dominant, ordered, "logical," masculine language because, according to Kristeva, feminine language is derived from the pre-oedipal period of fusion between mother and child which she termed [[Julia Kristeva#The semiotic|the semiotic]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garrattt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the maternal, feminine language (which Irigaray called ''parler femme'', womanspeak)&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; is not only a threat to culture, which is patriarchal, but also a medium through which women may be creative in new ways. Irigaray expressed this connection between women's sexuality and women's language through the following analogy: women's ''jouissance'' is more multiple than men's unitary, phallic pleasure because &lt;ref&gt;Murfin, Ross C. http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~rlbeebe/what_is_feminist_criticism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"woman has sex organs just about everywhere...feminine language is more diffusive than its 'masculine counterpart'. That is undoubtedly the reason...her language...goes off in all directions and...he is unable to discern the coherence." &lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, Luce. [[This Sex]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irigaray and Cixous also go on to emphasize that women, historically limited to being sexual objects for men (virgins or prostitutes, wives or mothers), have been prevented from expressing their sexuality in itself or for themselves. If they can do this, and if they can speak about it in the new languages it calls for, they will establish a point of view (a site of difference) from which phallogocentric concepts and controls can be seen through and taken apart, not only in theory, but also in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Ann Rosalind. Feminist Studies, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Summer, 1981), pp. 247-263. Published by: Feminist Studies, Inc. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3177523.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==

The approach through language to feminist action has been criticised by some as over-theoretical: they would see the fact that the very first meeting of a handful of would-be feminist activists in 1970 only managed to launch an acrimonious theoretical debate as marking the situation as typically 'French' in its apparent insistence on the primacy of theory over politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toril Moi|Moi, Toril, ed.]] ''French Feminist Thought''. Basil Blackwell Ltd, 1987. ({{ISBN|0-631-14972-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in practice the French women's movement developed in much the same way as the feminist movements elsewhere in Europe or in the United States: French women participated in consciousness-raising groups; demonstrated in the streets on the [[International Women's Day|8 March]]; fought hard for women's right to choose whether to have children; raised the issue of violence against women; and struggled to change public opinion on issues concerning women and women's rights.

Further criticisms of écriture féminine include its essentialist view of the body; its over-reliance on a feminism of 'difference'; and its tendency to demonise not only the masculine but those (many) women authors who write or have written in more conventional, linear literary forms.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Holmes, ''French Women's Writings, 1848-1994'' (1996) p. 228-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==

As a result of the difficulties inherent in the notion of "écriture féminine", very few books of literary criticism have run the risk of using it as a critical tool.&lt;ref&gt;See however Frédéric Regard, ''L'écriture féminine en Angleterre'', Paris, Presses Universitaires de France, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. S. Byatt]] offers: "There is a marine and salty female wave-water to be...read as a symbol of female language, which is partly suppressed, partly self-communing, dumb before the intruding male and not able to speak out...thus mirroring those female secretions which are not inscribed in our daily use of language (''langue'', tongue)".&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (1990) p. 244-5&lt;/ref&gt;
