{{Years in film}}
The decade of the '''1970s in film''' involved many significant films.

== Asian cinema ==
{{see also|Chinese films of the 1970s|Hong Kong films of the 1970s|Japanese films of the 1970s|Pakistani films of the 1970s|Philippine films of the 1970s}}
Asian cinema of the 1970s catered to the rising middle class fantasies and struggles. In the [[Bollywood]] cinema of India this was epitomized by the films of Bollywood superhero [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. These films portrayed adventurous plots with car chase trying to imitate Hollywood films like ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', presented music with Disco beats and also presented the young middle class man as an "''angry young man''". The women on the other hand were shown as ones who have adopted western values and outfits especially by heroines like [[Parveen Babi]] (who was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine for a story on Bollywood's success) and [[Zeenat Aman]]. However towards the very end of the 1970s, especially after the steep rise in land prices in urban areas and the decline in employment security, the heroines were seen more often as [[saree]]-women striving to have a prosperous middle-class family especially heroines like [[Jaya Prada]] and [[Hema Malini]]. In this way, the cinema of Asian region becomes a [[sociological]] statement of the [[social-economic]] times of the region and its people. In [[Malayalam cinema]], [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]] made ''Swayamvaram'' in 1972, which got wide critical acclaim. This was followed by the film ''Nirmalyam'' by [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]] in 1973.

Another Asian touchstone beginning in the early 1970s was traditional [[Hong Kong martial arts film]] which sparked a greater interest in Chinese martial arts to the West. [[Martial arts film]] reached the peak of its popularity largely in part due to its greatest icon, [[Bruce Lee]]. His films elevated the genre to a new level and sparked a greater interest in martial arts in the West. Lee became famous for playing Kato in the TV series The Green Hornet during the 1960s yet it was when he returned to Hong Kong and starred in three films that shot him to stardom all over Asia, ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971), ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972) and ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' (1972). Yet he achieved global stardom in his last completed film and the first [[Kung fu (term)|Kung fu]] film to be produced by a Hollywood studio, ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973).

==European cinema==
{{see also|List of British films|Danish films of the 1970s|French films of the 1970s|Turkish films of the 1970s|Georgian films of the 1970s|List of German films: 1970s|List of Polish films of the 1970s|Portuguese films of the 1970s|Spanish films of the 1970s|Swedish films of the 1970s}}
In [[European cinema]], the failure of the [[Prague Spring]] brought about nostalgic motion pictures reminiscent of the ones that celebrate the 1970s itself. These films expressed a yearning and as a premonition to the decade and its dreams. The [[Hungary|Hungarian]] director [[István Szabó]] made the motion picture ''[[Szerelmesfilm]]'' (1970), which is a nostalgic portrayal and a premonition of the fading of the young 1970s ethos of change and a friendlier social structure. The Italian director [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] made the motion picture ''[[The Conformist (film)|The Conformist]]'' (1970). German films after the war asked existential questions especially the works of [[Rainer Fassbinder]]. The films of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] director [[Ingmar Bergman]] reached a new level of expression in motion pictures like ''[[Cries and Whispers]]'' (1973). Young German directors made films that came to be known as the [[German New Wave|German new wave]]. It was the voice of a new generation that had grown up after the second world war. These included directors like [[Wim Wenders]], [[Hans-Jürgen Syberberg]] and [[Werner Herzog]].

==North American cinema==

The decade opened with [[Hollywood]] facing a financial slump, reflecting the monetary woes of the nation as a whole during the first half of the decade. Despite this, the 1970s proved to be a benchmark decade in the development of cinema, both as an art form and as a business. With young filmmakers taking greater risks and restrictions regarding language and sexuality lifting, Hollywood produced some of its most critically acclaimed and financially successful films since its "[[Cinema of the United States#Golden Age of Hollywood|golden era]]."

In the years previous to 1970, Hollywood had begun to cater to the younger generation with films such as ''[[The Graduate]]''. This proved a folly when anti-war films like ''[[R. P. M.]]'' and ''[[The Strawberry Statement (film)|The Strawberry Statement]]'' became major box-office flops. Even solid films with [[bankable star]]s, like the [[Pearl Harbor]] epic ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', flopped, leaving studios in dire straits financially. Unable to repay financiers, studios began selling off land, furniture, clothing, and sets acquired over years of production. Nostalgic fans bid on merchandise and collectibles ranging from [[Judy Garland]]'s [[Ruby slippers|sparkling red shoes]] to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM's]] own back lots.

More of the successful films were those based in the harsh truths of war, rather than the excesses of the 1960s. Films like the [[Francis Ford Coppola]]-scripted ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]] as the World War II general, and [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'', about a [[Korean War]] field hospital, were major box-office draws in 1970. Honest,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} old-fashioned films like ''[[Summer of '42]]'', and the [[Erich Segal]] adaptation, ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'', were commercial and critical hits. (Love Story and "Summer" remain, {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, two of the most successful films in Hollywood history. "Summer", costing $1,000,000 USD, brought in $25,000,000 at the box office, while "Love Story", with a budget of $2,200,000, earned $106,400,000).

One of the most insightful films of the decade{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} came from the mind of a Hollywood outsider, Czechoslovakian director [[Miloš Forman]], whose ''[[Taking Off (film)|Taking Off]]'' became a bold reflection of life at the beginning of the 1970s. The 1971 film satirized the American middle class, following a young girl who runs away from home, leaving her parents free to explore life for the first time in years. While the film was never given a wide release in America, it became a major critical achievement both in America and around the world (garnering the film high honors at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and several [[BAFTA Award]] nominations).

[[Sean Connery]] returned to the role of [[James Bond]] in 1971 in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' after [[George Lazenby]] filled the role in 1969. [[Roger Moore]] succeeded Connery in 1973 with an adaptation of [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' which was the most successful of his Bond films in terms of admissions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' was followed by an adaptation of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' in 1974, which at the time garnered the lowest box office taking of any Bond film before it. After its release [[Harry Saltzman]] co-owner of [[Danjaq]] with [[Albert R. Broccoli]] sold his half to [[United Artists]] causing a three-year gap until the next Bond film, the longest gap since the start of the franchise in 1962. The series picked up again in 1977 with ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' and ended the decade with ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' in 1979, which was the highest grossing Bond film (not adjusting for inflation) of all time until ''[[GoldenEye]]'' in 1995.

An adaptation of an [[Arthur Hailey]] novel would prove to be one of the most notable films of 1970, and would set the stage for a major trend in 1970s cinema.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The film, ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', featured a complex plot, characters, and an all-star cast of Hollywood A-listers and legends. ''Airport'' followed an airport manager trying to keep a fictional [[Chicago]] airport operational during a blizzard, as well as a bomb plot to blow up an airplane. The film was a major critical and financial success, helping pull [[Universal Studios]] into the black for the year. The film earned senior actress [[Helen Hayes]] an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] and garnered many other nominations in both technical and talent categories. The success of the film launched several other [[disaster film]]s, many of which following the same blueprint of major stars, a melodramatic script, and great suspense.

Three ''Airport'' sequels followed in 1974, 1977, and 1979, each successor making less money than the last.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} 1972 brought ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'', which starred a young [[Gene Hackman]] leading an all-star cast to safety in a capsized luxury liner. The film earned an [[Academy Award]] for visual effects (and Best Original Song for "[[The Morning After (1974 film)|The Morning After]]"), as well as numerous nominations, including one for its notable supporting star, [[Shelley Winters]], but its sequel in 1979 was far less successful. ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' teamed [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] and [[Paul Newman]] against a fire in a San Francisco skyscraper. The film cost a whopping $14 million to produce (expensive for its time), and won Academy Awards for Cinematography, Film Editing, and Best Original Song. The same year, the epic ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' featured questionable effects (camera shake and models) to achieve a destructive 9.9 earthquake in Los Angeles. Despite this, the film was one of the most successful of its time, earning $80 million at box office. By the late 1970s, the novelty had worn off and the disasters had become less exciting. 1977 brought a terrorist targeting a ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'', 1978 a ''[[The Swarm (film)|Swarm]]'' of bees, and a less-than-threatening ''[[Meteor (film)|Meteor]]'' in 1979.

The early 1970s also brought a rebirth of gritty crime film,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} three years after the influential ''[[Bullitt]]''. [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', starring [[Gene Hackman]] as a drug detective and [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[Serpico]]'', starring [[Al Pacino]] in the true-life story of an honest cop who fought corruption, were two of the most famous ones. Films like ''[[Get Carter]]'' featured gratuitous nudity, while [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s groundbreaking ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' featured much physical and sexual violence to complement its complex story. [[African American]] filmmakers also found success in the 1970s with such hits as ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'' and ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]''. Like other sequels in the 1970s, ''Shaft'' went on to have two more adventures, each less successful than the last.

An adaptation of a [[Mario Puzo]] novel, ''[[The Godfather]]'', was a box-office and critical success in 1972. The three-hour epic followed a Mafia boss, played by [[Marlon Brando]], through his life of crime. Beyond the violence and drama were themes of love, pride, and greed. ''The Godfather'' went on to earn $134 million at American box office, and $245 million throughout the world, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. It won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay. Its director [[Francis Ford Coppola]] was passed over in favor of [[Bob Fosse]] and his musical, ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'', which also earned an Oscar for its star, [[Liza Minnelli]]. ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' followed in 1974, with roughly the same principal cast and crew, earning Oscars for star [[Robert De Niro]], its director, composer, screenwriters and art directors. The film also earned the Best Picture Oscar for that year.

Not all of the "street smart" urban related films were 100% live action. Director [[Ralph Bakshi]] released the first animated full-length feature specifically oriented towards adults (''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'') then moved on to two other features that dealt with the mafia and other ethnic-related urban issues. Both ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'' and ''[[Coonskin (film)|Coonskin]]'' would prove that this kind of material could be handled effectively in the animation genre. Bakshi would later produce fantasy oriented films (''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'') before the decade ended.

Inaugurated by the 1969 [[New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre|release]] of [[Andy Warhol]]{{'s}} ''[[Blue Movie]]'', the phenomenon of [[Erotic art|adult erotic films]] being publicly discussed by celebrities (like [[Johnny Carson]] and [[Bob Hope]]),&lt;ref name="TM-20050329"&gt;{{cite web |last=Corliss |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Corliss |title=That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html |date=March 29, 2005 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taken seriously by critics (like [[Roger Ebert]]),&lt;ref name="RE-19730613"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Devil In Miss Jones - Film Review |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-devil-in-miss-jones-1973 |date=June 13, 1973 |work=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=February 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RE-19761124"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Alice in Wonderland:An X-Rated Musical Fantasy |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/alice-in-wonderland-1976 |date=November 24, 1976 |publisher=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=February 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a development referred to, by Ralph Blumenthal of ''[[The New York Times]]'', as "[[Golden Age of Porn#"Porno chic"|porno chic]]", and later known as the [[Golden Age of Porn]], began, for the first time, in modern American culture.&lt;ref name="TM-20050329" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19730121"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Ralph |title=Porno chic; 'Hard-core' grows fashionable-and very profitable |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/21/archives/pornochic-hardcore-grows-fashionableand-very-profitable.html |date=January 21, 1973 |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |accessdate=January 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jahsonic.com/PornoChic.html Porno Chic (Jahsonic.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to award-winning author [[Toni Bentley]], [[Radley Metzger]]{{'s}} 1976 film ''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]'', based on the play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]] (and its derivative, ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''), and due to attaining a mainstream level in storyline and sets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cult Film Reader |last=Mathijs |first=Ernest |last2=Mendik |first2=Xavier |publisher=[[Open University Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0335219230|page=}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the "crown jewel" of this '[[Golden Age of Porn|Golden Age]]'.&lt;ref name="PB-201406"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bentley |first=Toni |authorlink=Toni Bentley |title=The Legend of Henry Paris |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/the-legend-of-henry-paris |date=June 2014 |work=[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]] |accessdate=January 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204030128/http://www.playboy.com/articles/the-legend-of-henry-paris |archive-date=2016-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TB-201406"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bentley |first=Toni |authorlink=Toni Bentley |title=The Legend of Henry Paris |url=http://www.tonibentley.com/pdfarticles/playboy/RadleyMetzger_AuteuroftheErotic_ToniBentley.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |date=June 2014 |work=ToniBentley.com |accessdate=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle 1970s, films began to also reflect the disenfranchisement brought by the excesses of the past twenty years. A deeply unsettling look at alienation and city life, [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' earned international praise, first at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and then at the [[Academy Awards]], where it was nominated for Best Leading Actor ([[Robert De Niro]]), Best Supporting Actress ([[Jodie Foster]]), Best Score ([[Bernard Herrmann]]), and Best Picture. ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' dealt with the impeachment of [[Richard Nixon]], while Lumet's ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]'' portrayed greed and [[narcissism]] in both American society and television media. The film won Oscars for Best Actor ([[Peter Finch]]), Best Actress ([[Faye Dunaway]]), Best Supporting Actress ([[Beatrice Straight]]), and Best Screenplay ([[Paddy Chayefsky]]). Thanks to a stellar cast, experienced director, and a poignant story, ''Network'' became one of the largest critical successes of 1976. Another film, ''[[Rocky]]'', about a clubhouse boxer (played by [[Sylvester Stallone]]) who is granted a world championship title fight won the Best Picture [[Academy Award]] that year. The film also became a major commercial success and spawned four sequels through the rest of the 1970s and 1980s.

Throughout the 1970s, the horror film developed into a lucrative genre of film. It began in 1973 with the terrifying ''[[The Exorcist]]'', directed by [[William Friedkin]] and starring the young [[Linda Blair]]. The film saw massive success, and the first of several sequels was released in 1977. 1976 brought the equally creepy suspense thriller, ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'', about a man who becomes the target of a former Nazi dentist's torment after his brother dies. The same year, the [[Devil]] himself made an appearance in ''[[The Omen]]'', about the spawn of [[Satan]]. 1978's ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' was a precursor to the "slasher" films of the 1980s and 1990s with its psychopathic Michael Myers. Cult horror films were also popular in the 1970s, such as [[Wes Craven]]'s early gore films ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|Last House on the Left]]'' and ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'', as well as [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''.

The [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] was born in 1975. While the 1973 horror classic ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' was among the top five grossing films of the 1970s, the first film given the blockbuster distinction was 1975's ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. Released on June 20, the film about a series of horrific deaths related to a massive great white shark was director [[Steven Spielberg]]'s first big-budget Hollywood production, coming in at $9 million in cost. The film slowly grew in ticket sales and became one of the most profitable films of its time, ending with a $260 million gross in the United States alone. The film won Academy Awards for its skillful editing, chilling score, and sound recording. It was also nominated for Best Picture that year, though it lost to [[Miloš Forman]]'s ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (which also won acting awards for [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Louise Fletcher]]). It spawned the successful sequel, ''[[Jaws 2]]'' in 1978, which featured the same cast, but without [[Steven Spielberg]]. Another tailor-made blockbuster, [[Dino De Laurentiis]]' ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' was released, but to less than stellar success. ''King Kong'' did mark the first time a film was booked to theaters before a release date, a common practice today.

The massive success of ''Jaws'' was eclipsed just two years later by another legendary blockbuster and film franchise. The [[George Lucas]] science-fiction film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' hit theater screens in May 1977, and became a major hit, growing in ticket sales throughout the summer and the rest of the year. In time earning some $460 million, the good versus evil fantasy set in space was not soon surpassed. The film's breathtaking visual effects won an [[Academy Award]]. The film also won for [[John Williams]]'s uplifting score, as well as art direction, costume design, film editing, and sound. ''Star Wars'' effectively removed any specter of studio bankruptcy that had haunted the studios since early in the decade. When a television film, ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', was released as a spin-off from ''Star Wars'' in 1978; it failed to receive the status of the original film, and was deemed a flop. It would be two years until the ''Star Wars'' series would be revived with ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. Another success in visual effects came the same year as ''Star Wars'', with Spielberg's ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', another blockbuster and alien contact set in the wilderness. For the picture, Spielberg received his first Oscar nomination for directing. A year later the most iconic [[superhero]] was brought to the screen in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', who was portrayed by classically trained actor [[Christopher Reeve]]. It was met by resounding praise for strong performances and its epic scope which resulted in numerous sequels and is regarded as one of the greatest [[superhero film]]s ever made, beginning a new era of superhero films.

The success of [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Annie Hall]]'' in 1977 stirred a new trend in filmmaking.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} ''Annie Hall'', a love story about a depressed comedian and a free-spirited woman, was followed with more sentimental films, including [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Goodbye Girl]]'', ''[[An Unmarried Woman]]'' starring [[Jill Clayburgh]], the autobiographical [[Lillian Hellman]] story, ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'', starring [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]], and 1978's ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' and ''[[International Velvet (film)|International Velvet]]''.

Younger audiences were also beginning to be the focus of cinema, after the huge blockbusters that had attracted them back to the theater. [[John Travolta]] became popular in the pop-culture landmark films, ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', which introduced Disco to middle America, and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', which recalled the world of the 1950s. Comedy was also given new life in the irreverent ''[[Animal House]]'', set on a college campus during the 1960s. ''[[Up in Smoke]]'', starring [[Cheech &amp; Chong]], was another irreverent comedy about marijuana use became popular among teenagers. The new television comedy program, "[[Saturday Night Live]]", launched the careers of several of its comedians, such as [[Chevy Chase]], who co-starred in the 1978 hit ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' with [[Goldie Hawn]].

The decade closed with two films chronicling the [[Vietnam War]], [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''. Both films focused on the horrors of war and the psychological damage caused by such horrors. [[Christopher Walken]] and director [[Michael Cimino]] earned Oscars for their work on the film, which earned a Best Picture [[Academy Award]]. [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Meryl Streep]] were also nominated for their work in ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''. ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' won for cinematography and sound, and earned nominations for [[Robert Duvall]] and Coppola. [[Hal Ashby]]'s ''[[Coming Home (1978 film)|Coming Home]]'' portrayed life for Vietnam veterans. Actor [[Jon Voight]] won an [[Academy Award]] for his role in the film.

1979 saw the poignant ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', the inspiring ''[[Norma Rae]]'', and the nuclear thriller, ''[[The China Syndrome]]''. ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' scared summer film-going audiences of 1979 with its horrible monster from outer space, achieving similar success that Jaws had seen four years earlier. Meanwhile, ''[[The Onion Field]]'' and ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]'' focused on the failures of the American judicial system. The year ended with Hal Ashby's subtle black comedy ''[[Being There]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', a family film based on the [[Jim Henson]] puppet characters.

==Events==
The films in the 1970s came in many different varieties, as the socially conscious directors that emerged in the late 1960s grew in very different ways, influenced by music, literature, crime and war. The decade is most known for excelling in the crime-drama genre. The early part of the decade focused on increasingly realistic, gritty films, including [[Francis Ford Coppola|Coppola]]'s first two ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' pictures and [[Robert Altman]]'s [[black comedy]] ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]''. A trend that lasted through the decade was the popularity of [[disaster film]]s, starting with ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' in 1970. Another trend was the birth of the blockbuster horror film, initiated by [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', which spawned numerous imitators. A pivotal moment in films was the release of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s first blockbuster hit, ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', which was considered to be the birth of the [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] motion picture (a trend sealed two years later with the release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''). The end of the decade saw two epic [[Vietnam War]] films, from directors [[Michael Cimino]] (''[[The Deer Hunter]]'') and Coppola (''[[Apocalypse Now]]'').

[[File:John C Calhoun by Mathew Brady, 1849.jpg|thumb|right|Calhoun photographed by [[Mathew Brady]] in 1849|alt=Age 67, long gray hair, austere look, frowning, holding black cloak closed with both hands.]]
'''''A Disquisition on Government''''' is a political treatise written by U.S. Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]] and published posthumously in 1851. Written in response to what Calhoun saw as the growing subjugation of the Southern United States by the more populous North, especially in terms of Northern promotion of [[tariffs|tariff]] legislation and opposition to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], the 100-page ''Disquisition'' promotes the idea of a [[concurrent majority]] in order to protect what he perceived to be the South's interests. The ''Disquisition'', and other writings like it by Southern [[Fire-Eaters]], increased the feeling of sectionalism in the South and led ultimately to [[Secession in the United States|secession]] and the [[American Civil War]].

Calhoun died in 1850, and the ''Disquisition'' was published the following year.

==Premise==
The ''Disquisition on Government'' is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion.{{sfn|Bartlett|1994| pp= 351–55}} It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.{{sfn|Freehling|1965| pp= 25–42}}

==Summary==
Calhoun offered the concurrent majority as the key to achieving consensus, a formula by which a minority interest had the option to nullify objectionable legislation passed by a majority interest.  The consensus would be effected by this tactic of nullification, a veto that would suspend the law within the boundaries of the state.{{sfn|Coit|1950|pp= 150–151}}{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008| p= 171}}

Veto power was linked to the right of secession, which portended [[anarchy]] and social chaos. Constituencies would call for compromise to prevent this outcome.{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008| p= 174}} With a concurrent majority in place, the U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the Federal Judiciary would no longer exert collective authority over the various states. According to the [[Supremacy Clause]] located in Article 6, laws made by the federal government are the "supreme law of the land" only when they are made "in pursuance" of the U.S. Constitution.

These ideas are convincing if one shares Calhoun's conviction that a functioning concurrent majority never leads to stalemate in the legislature; rather, talented statesmen, practiced in the arts of conciliation and compromise would pursue "the common good",{{sfn|Coit |1950| p= 147}} however explosive the issue. His formula promised to produce laws satisfactory to all interests. The ultimate goal of these mechanisms were to facilitate the authentic will of the white populace. Calhoun explicitly rejected the founding principles of equality in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], denying that humanity is born free and equal in shared nature and basic needs. He regarded this precept as "the most false and dangerous of all political errors".{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008| pp= 166–167}} States could constitutionally take action to free themselves from an overweening government, but slaves as individuals or interest groups could not do so. Calhoun's stance assumed that with the establishment of a concurrent majority, minority groups would influence their own representatives sufficiently to have a voice in public affairs; the representatives would perform strictly as high-minded public servants. Under this scenario, the political leadership would improve and persist, corruption and demagoguery would subside, and the interests of the people would be honored. {{sfn|Krannawitter| 2008|pp= 170–171}} This introduces the second theme in the ''Disquisition'', and a counterpoint to his concept of the concurrent majority—political corruption.

Calhoun considered the concurrent majority essential to provide structural restraints to governance, believing that "a vast majority of mankind is entirely biased by motives of self-interest and that by this interest must be governed".{{sfn|Coit |1950| p= 149}} This innate selfishness would inevitably emerge when government revenue became available to political parties for distribution as patronage. Politicians and bureaucrats would succumb to the lure of government lucre accumulated through taxation, tariff duties and public land sales. Even a diminishment of massive revenue effected through nullification by the permanent minority would not eliminate these temptations. Calhoun predicted that electioneering, political conspiracies, and outright fraud would be employed to mislead and distract a gullible public; inevitably, perfidious demagogues would come to rule the political scene. A decline in authority among the principal statesmen would follow, and, ultimately, the eclipse of the concurrent majority.{{sfn|Freehling|1965|p=223}}

Calhoun contended that however confused and misled the masses were by political opportunists, any efforts to impose majority rule upon a minority would be thwarted by a minority veto.{{sfn|Freehling|1965|p=222}} What Calhoun fails to explain, according to American historian [[William W. Freehling]], is how a compromise would be achieved in the aftermath of a minority veto, when the ubiquitous demagogues betray their constituencies and abandon the concurrent majority altogether. Calhoun's two key concepts – the maintenance of the concurrent majority by high-minded statesmen on the one hand; and the inevitable rise of demagogues who undermine consensus on the other – are never reconciled or resolved in the ''Disquisition''.{{sfn|Freehling|1965|p=223}}

South Carolina and other Southern states, in the three decades preceding the Civil War, provided legislatures in which the vested interests of land and slaves dominated in the upper houses, while the popular will of the numerical majority prevailed in the lower houses. There was little opportunity for demagogues to establish themselves in this political milieu – the democratic component among the people was too weak to sustain a plebeian politician. The conservative statesmen – the slaveholding gentry – retained control over the political apparatus.{{sfn|Freehling|1965| pp= 225–226}}{{sfn|Varon|2008| pp= 91–92}}  Freehling described the state's political system of the era thus:

{{quote|quote=[T]he apportionment of [state] legislative seats gave the small majority of low country aristocrats control of the senate and a disproportionate influence in the house. Political power in South Carolina was uniquely concentrated in a legislature of large property holders who set state policy and selected the men to administer it. The characteristics of South Carolina politics cemented the control of upper class planters. Elections to the state legislature – the one control the masses could exert over the government – were often uncontested and rarely allowed the "plebeian" a clear choice between two parties or policies&amp;nbsp;...{{sfn|Freehling|1965| pp= 225–226}}}}

'''John C. Calhoun on the "concurrent majority" from his Disquisition (1850):'''

{{quote|quote=If the whole community had the same interests, so that the interests of each and every portion would be so affected by the action of the government, that the laws which oppressed or impoverished one portion, would necessarily oppress and impoverish all others – or the reverse – then the right of suffrage, of itself, would be all-sufficient to counteract the tendency of the government to oppression and abuse of its powers.&amp;nbsp;... But such is not the case. On the contrary, nothing is more difficult than to equalize the action of the government, in reference to the various and diversified interests of the community; and nothing more easy than to pervert its powers into instruments to aggrandize and enrich one or more interests by oppressing and impoverishing the others; and this too, under the operation of laws, couched in general terms – and which, on their face, appear fair and equal.&amp;nbsp;... Such being the case, it necessarily results, that the right of suffrage, by placing the control of the government in the community must&amp;nbsp;... lead to conflict among its different interests – each striving to obtain possession of its powers, as the means of protecting itself against the others – or of advancing its respective interests, regardless of the interests of others. For this purpose, a struggle will take place between the various interests to obtain a majority, in order to control the government. If no one interest be strong enough, of itself, to obtain it, a combination will be formed.&amp;nbsp;... [and] the community will be divided into two great parties – a major and minor – between which there will be incessant struggles on the one side to retain, and on the other to obtain the majority – and, thereby, the control of the government and the advantages it confers.{{sfn|Polin|Polin|2006| p= 380}}}}

==Publication==
The ''Disquisition'' was published in 1851, shortly after his death, as was another book, ''Discourse on the Constitution and Government of the United States''.{{sfn|Calhoun|1851}}

Many Southerners believed Calhoun's warnings, contained in the ''Disquisition'' and in his many other writings and speeches, and read every political news story from the North as further evidence of the planned destruction of the southern way of life. The climax came a decade after Calhoun's death with the election of Republican [[Abraham Lincoln]] in [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860]], which led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six other Southern states. They formed the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Perman|2012|p=11}}

'''Art &amp; Language''' is a [[conceptual art|conceptual artists']] collaboration that has undergone many changes since it was created in the late 1960s. The group was founded by artists who shared a common desire to combine intellectual ideas and concerns with the creation of art. The first issue of the group's journal, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]], was published in November 1969 in [[Chipping Norton]] in England, and was an important influence on conceptual art in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/art-language|title=Art &amp; Language {{!}} Artists {{!}} Lisson Gallery|website=www.lissongallery.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First years==

The ''Art &amp; Language'' group was founded around 1967 in the United Kingdom by [[Terry Atkinson]] (b. 1939), [[David Bainbridge (artist)|David Bainbridge]] (b. 1941), [[Michael Baldwin (artist)|Michael Baldwin]] (b. 1945) and [[Harold Hurrell]] (b. 1940).&lt;ref&gt;Neil Mulholland, ''The Cultural Devolution: art in Britain in the late twentieth century'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, p165. {{ISBN|0-7546-0392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These four artists began their collaboration around 1966 while they were art teachers in [[Coventry]]. The name of the group was derived from their journal, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]], originally created as a work conversation in 1966. The group was critical of what was considered mainstream modern art practices at the time. In their work conversations, they created conceptual art as part of their discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/art-and-language|title=Art &amp; Language {{!}} Tate|website=www.tate.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1968 and 1982, the group grew to nearly fifty people. Among the first to join were critic and art historian, [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]], and artist [[Mel Ramsden]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles Green, ''The Third Hand: Collaboration in Art from Conceptualism to Postmodernism'', UNSW Press, 2001, p47. {{ISBN|0-86840-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the early 1970s, individuals including [[Ian Burn]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Preston Heller]], [[Graham Howard]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Andrew Menard]], and [[Terry Smith (art historian)|Terry Smith]] joined the group. Two collaborators from Coventry, [[Philip Pilkington]] and [[David Rushton]], followed.
The relative degree of anonymity held within the group continues to have historical significance in the art community. Due to an uncertainty of the exact member lists, it is hard to know unequivocally not only who all of the contributors were but also what their exact contributions were.

The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leftmatrix.com/artlanguage.html|title=Art &amp; Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Volume 1, Number 1, May 1969) is subtitled ''The Journal of Conceptual Art''.  By the second issue (Volume 1, Number 2, February 1970), it became clear that there were conceptual art pieces and conceptual artists for whom and to whom the journal did not speak. In order to better encompass the purpose of the journal, the title was abandoned. Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]] had, however, brought to light the beginning of a new art movement. It was the first [[wikt:imprint|imprint]] to identify a public entity called ''[[Conceptual art|Conceptual Art]].'' The journal was the first of its kind to serve the theoretical and conversational interests of a community of artists and critics, who were also its producers and users. While that community was far from a unanimous agreement as to how to define the nature of conceptual art, the editors and most of its historic contributors shared similar opinions about other art movements. Conceptual art was critical of [[modernism]] for its bureaucracy and its historicism, and of [[minimalism]] for its philosophical conservatism. The practice of conceptual art, especially in its early years of origin, was primarily based on theory, and its form, predominately textual.

As the distribution of the journal and the teaching practices of the editors and others contributors expanded, the conversation grew to include more people. In England, by 1971, artists and critics including [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]], [[Philip Pilkington]], [[David Rushton]], [[Lynn Lemaster]], [[Sandra Harrison]], [[Graham Howard]] and [[Paul Wood (artist)|Paul Wood]] had joined. Around the same time in New York, [[Michael Corris]] joined, followed by [[Paula Ramsden]], [[Mayo Thompson]], [[Christine Kozlov]], Preston Heller, [[Andrew Menard]] and [[Kathryn Bigelow]].

The name ''Art &amp; Language'' remained precarious due to the various interpretations of both the many pieces of art and the purpose of the group. Its significance, or instrumentality, varied from person to person, alliance to alliance, discourse to discourse, and from those in New York who produced ''The Fox'' (1974–1976), for example, to those engaged in music projects and those who continued the Journal's edition. There was disagreement among members, and by 1976, there was a growing sense of divide that eventually led to competing individualities and varied concerns.

Throughout the 1970s, ''Art &amp; Language'' dealt with questions about art production and attempted a shift from conventional "nonlinguistic" forms of art, such as painting and sculpture, to more theoretically text-based works. The group often took argumentative positions against such prevailing views of critics like [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried]].
The ''Art &amp; Language'' group that exhibited in the international ''[[Documenta 5]]'' exhibitions of 1972 included Atkinson, Bainbridge, Baldwin, Hurrell, Pilkington, Rushton, and Joseph Kosuth, the American editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. The work consisted of a filing system of material published and circulated by ''Art &amp; Language'' members.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Bentkowska-Kafel, Trish Cashen, Hazel Gardiner, ''Digital Visual Culture: Theory and Practice'', Intellect Books, 2009, p104. {{ISBN|1-84150-248-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York Art &amp; Language==
Burn and Ramsden co-founded ''The Society for Theoretical Art'' and ''Analysis in New York'' in the late 1960s. They joined ''Art &amp; Language'' in 1970-71. ''New York Art &amp; Language'' became fragmented after 1975 because of disagreements concerning principles of collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Green, ''The Third Hand: Collaboration in Art from Conceptualism to Postmodernism'', UNSW Press, 2001, p48. {{ISBN|0-86840-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Beveridge]] and [[Carol Condé]], who had been peripheral members of the group in New York, returned to Canada where they worked with trade unions and community groups. In 1977, Ian Burn returned to Australia and Mel Ramsden to the United Kingdom.

==Late 1970s==

By the end of the 1970s, the group was essentially reduced to Baldwin, Harrison, and Ramsden with the occasional participation of [[Mayo Thompson]] and his group [[Red Crayola]]. The political analysis and development within the group resulted in several members leaving the group to work in more activist-oriented political occupations. Ian Burn returned to Australia, joining Ian Milliss, a conceptual artist who had begun work with trade unions in the early 1970s, in becoming active in Union Media Services, a design studio for social and community initiatives and the development of trade unions. Other members from the United Kingdom drifted off into a variety of creative, academic and sometimes "politicized" activities.

At the beginning of the 1970s, there were about thirty members. The ''Art &amp; Language'' group emphasized the use of language on the theory that language is the basis from which ideas and concepts are built. Their philosophy was that language permits index words which appear, disappear, and for some even persist, thus allowing viewers and artists alike to analyze the evolution of a word through the proposal of different definitions.

==Exhibitions and awards==
=== Awards and critics ===
In 1986, ''Art &amp; Language'' was nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].
In 1999, ''Art &amp; Language'' exhibited at [[MoMA PS1|PS1 MoMA]] in New York, with a major installation entitled ''The Artist Out of Work''. This was a recollection of ''Art &amp; Language''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s dialogical and other practices, curated by Michael Corris and Neil Powell. This exhibition closely followed the revisionist exhibition of ''Global Conceptualism: Points of Origin'' at the [[Queens Museum|Queens Museum of Art]], also in New York. The ''Art &amp; Language'' show at PS1 offered an alternative account of the antecedents and legacy of '"classic" conceptual art and reinforced a transatlantic rather than nationalistic version of events from 1968-1972. In a negative appraisal of the exhibition, [[art critic]] [[Jerry Saltz]] wrote, "A quarter century ago, 'Art &amp; Language' forged an important link in the genealogy of conceptual art, but next efforts have been so self-sufficient and obscure that their work is now virtually irrelevant."&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Saltz, ''Seeing out loud: the Voice art columns, fall 1998-winter 2003'', Geoffrey Young, 2003, p293. {{ISBN|1-930589-17-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Permanent collections ===
Other exhibits around the world include the works of Atkinson and Baldwin (working as ''Art &amp; Language'') held in the collection of the [[Tate]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2202&amp;page=1 tate.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Papers and works relating to ''New York Art &amp; Language'' are held at the [[Getty Research Institute]], Los Angeles. 

In March 2011, [[Philippe Méaille]] loaned 800 artworks of the ''Art &amp; Language'' collective to the [[Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art]], also known as MACBA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avui.cat/noticia/article/5-cultura/19-cultura/390089-un-tresor-al-macba.html?piwik_campaign=rss&amp;piwik_kwd=mesCultura Un tresor al Macba]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, the [[:fr:Conseil départemental de Maine-et-Loire|Conseil départemental de Maine-et-Loire]] and Philippe Méaille signed a long term lease agreement for the [[Château de Montsoreau]] to promote contemporary art in the [[Loire Valley]].

==Theoretical installations==

''Art &amp; Language'' and the ''[[Jackson Pollock Bar]]'' collaborated for the first time in January 1995, during the ''Art &amp; Language &amp; Luhmann'' symposium, organized by the Contemporary Social Considerations Institute (Institut für Sozial Gegenwartsfragen) of Freiburg. The 3-day symposium saw the intervention of speakers including [[Catherine David]], who prepared the Documenta X, and [[Peter Weibl]], artist and curator. There was also a theoretical installation of a ''Art &amp; Language'' text produced in playback by the ''Jackson Pollock Bar''. The installation was interpreted by five German actors playing the roles of Jack Tworkow, Philip Guston, Harold Rosenberg, Robert Motherwell and Ad Reinhardt. Using [[lip sync]], the actors used pre-recorded text for a "New Conceptual" conversation. Ever since this collaboration, each new ''Art &amp; Language'' exhibition has been joined by a ''Jackson Pollock Bar'' theoretical installation.

The '''art student scam''' is a [[confidence trick]] in which cheap, [[mass-produced]] paintings or prints are misrepresented as original works of art, often by young people pretending to be art students trying to raise money for art supplies or tuition fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scam art ripples Peninsula "Students" up-sell cheap, mass-produced works door-to-door|newspaper=''Peace Arch News'' |location=The (White Rock, British Columbia, Canada) |date= 10 August 2004 |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |id= |page=1 |quote=An Israeli art scam with suggested links to espionage and fundamentalist fundraisers may have turned up on the Semiahmoo Peninsula.

==Mass-produced paintings==
Most mass-produced prints and paintings originate in Asia.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} These are essentially posters, sometimes referred to as "Hong Kong horrors," printed on rough paper, making the absence of brush strokes less apparent. There is a confusion between "mass-produced paintings" which are actually prints. These are being sold over the internet described as real oil paintings, taking advantage of the difficulty of spotting the scam behind the screen. Sometimes a few brush strokes are added to the prints to give them a more authentic oil-painting look.

==Australia and New Zealand==
People posing as art students were reported in Australia and New Zealand from as early as 2003.&lt;ref name=moyes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/east-bays-courier/3403169/Warning-on-art-scam|title=Warning on art scam|last=Moyes|first=Sarah|author2=Michelle Robinson|date=5 March 2010|work=East And Bays Courier|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designfederation.net/general/beware-of-door-to-door-art-scams/|title=Beware of 'Israeli' door-to-door art scams!|last=Rogers|first=Sy|date=2 March 2009|work=Design Federation|accessdate=29 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719053941/http://www.designfederation.net/general/beware-of-door-to-door-art-scams/| archivedate= 19 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings, worth around [[A$]]5, were passed off as being worth hundreds of dollars.&lt;ref name="ABCAustralia"/&gt; Three backpackers—an Israeli and two Chileans—were taken to court in [[Dunedin]] for the scam in 2003 but were discharged as the judge said that they were "minnows" in the organisation. They reportedly made [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]15,000 in three weeks from the scam. The [[Consumers' Institute of New Zealand]] suspected that an Auckland man was the organiser of the operation.&lt;ref name="NZ"/&gt; A 23-year-old man was arrested in New South Wales, Australia, for operating the scam and 50 oil paintings were found in his car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/12/13/2445638.htm?site=idx-nsw|title=Police arrest 23yo over alleged art scam|date=13 December 2008|work=ABC News|accessdate=29 July 2010|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adviser for the New Zealand [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)#Organisation|Consumer Affairs Ministry]] said: "All around the world, students from various countries are doing this."

==Canada==
In 2004, a group of Israelis said to have been selling mass-produced paintings as their own work, for hundreds of dollars each, were deported from Canada for working in violation of their visas. The scam recurred in 2009 in [[Calgary]] and in [[Warman, Saskatchewan]]. Eight people claiming to be students from Israel, Germany, and France were arrested, and 100 paintings were seized by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and Border Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstalk980.com/story/20090904/21900 |title=Scam 'Artists' in Warman |last=Slobodian |first=Erin |date=4 September 2009 |work=News Talk 980 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909184329/http://www.newstalk980.com/story/20090904/21900 |archivedate=9 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
In China, scammers approach tourists at popular attractions such as the [[Forbidden City]] and [[Tiananmen Square]].&lt;ref&gt;"The famous art show ripoff in Tiananmen Square was recently cleaned up for the Olympics. This was a pretty funny one, where English-speaking 'art students' would strike up conversation with overseas visitors and tell them they happen to be in town for an art show across the street. The show was closing today when I first heard the spiel in 2006, it was closing today when I returned to Beijing in 2007, but the pre-Olympics cleanup really seems to have closed the collection of knockoff art." [http://www.startbackpacking.com/travel/china-scam/]. See also [http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Asia/China/Beijing_Shi/Beijing-1024960/Tourist_Traps-Beijing-Art_Students-BR-1.html].&lt;/ref&gt; The scammer speaks English well enough to get into a conversation with the foreigner and then claims to be an art student whose works are on display at a nearby exhibition, which is part of the scam and sells mass-produced art reproductions at exorbitant prices. There are warnings about this scam in tourist guides.&lt;ref name="ZH"&gt;''Frommer's China'', New York: Wiley, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-470-52658-3}}, p. 140. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1DqjMGlyY5QC] "You should also be leery of any English-speaking youngsters who claim to be 'art students' and offer to take you to a special exhibit of their work.... The art, which you will be pressured to buy, almost always consists of assembly-line reproductions of famous (or not-so-famous) paintings offered at prices several dozen times higher than their actual value."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaprimer.com/china-travel-tips/china-tourism-scams.html China Tourism Scams] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703045129/http://www.chinaprimer.com/china-travel-tips/china-tourism-scams.html |date=3 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
From the summer of 2000, news outlets in the [[Pacific Northwest]] reported that young people were posing as art students selling mass-produced oil paintings, both copies and originals, for US$780–$2000 each. The so-called art students were said to be selling in exhibitions and galleries, primarily targeting local businesses. They claimed to be studying at art schools in Europe and to be in the United States selling works by talented fellow artists to raise money for art supplies or school fees.&lt;ref name="Seattle"/&gt;

Through the early 2000s, some 13 separate incidents of "art student" encounters were reported across the United States.

In 2004, the scam surfaced again in Atlanta and Boston, with allegations that the Europeans art students were asking about the new [[National Security Agency]]'s data center.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In late September, 2017, the scam appears to be active in the suburbs southeast of Portland, Oregon, perpetrated by a woman going door-to-door claiming to be an Israeli art student. &lt;ref&gt; https://happyvalleyor.nextdoor.com/news_feed/?post=65305911/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Moving Image Archivists''' ('''AMIA''') is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[Nonprofit#USA|not-for-profit]] organization established to advance the field of [[Film preservation|moving image archiving]] by fostering cooperation among individuals and organizations concerned with the acquisition, description, preservation, exhibition and use of moving image materials.

==History==
[[File:AMPAS PickfordCenter.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]'s [[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]], 1313 N. [[Vine Street|Vine St.]], [[Hollywood]] - Home to the AMIA Office]]

Since the late 1960s, representatives from moving image archives have recognized the value of regular meetings to exchange practical information and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;For further information on the emergence of formal representation for the audiovisual preservation sector in the United States, see Anthony Slide, ''Nitrate Won't Wait: A History of Film Preservation in the United States'', Jefferson, NC, McFarland (1992), pp. 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, this group of archivists originally known as the Film and Television Archives Advisory Committee (F/TAAC) expanded from a handful of participants to several hundred archivists from over 100 national, regional and local institutions. In 1990, the name of the group was changed to the Association of Moving Image Archivists. In 1991, AMIA voted to formalize as an individual-based member-based [[professional association]], the only one of its kind in the moving image archival field. Although AMIA's office is based in the US, its membership is now drawn from across the world.  Further information on the origins and history of AMIA can be found [http://www.amianet.org/about/mission here].&lt;ref&gt;See also Tom McGreevey and Joanne L. Yeck, ''Our Movie Heritage'', New Brunswick, NJ, Rutgers University Press (1997), pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership is open to anyone who has an interest in the [[film preservation|preservation of moving images]] and associated sound recordings: in practice, most of the membership are professional [[archivist]]s (both [[public sector]] and [[Business|commercial]]) and people working in associated professions, e.g. [[librarian]]ship, the [[Film industry|film]] and [[television]] industry or [[Academia|academics]] in related fields.  AMIA offers both individual and institutional membership.

==Governing structure==
AMIA is governed by a [[Board of Directors]], which is elected by the membership on a two-year cycle, and chaired by a [[President#Non-governmental presidents|president]].  The Board oversees and ratifies the work of the sub-groups through which the work of the organization is undertaken.  The last significant changes to the governing structure were undertaken in 2009, when the present structure of committees and task forces was introduced.

===Current President===

===Committees and Task Forces===

AMIA is a volunteer based organization and projects rely on work done by its members in Committees and Task Forces.  More information about AMIA's Committees [http://www.amianet.org/community/committees can be found here].

* '''[[Committee]]s of the Board''' carry out the core management and policymaking functions of AMIA, e.g. running elections and organizing the conference.  Chairs are appointed directly by the Board of Directors, and although their members are volunteers drawn from within the wider AMIA membership, the rosters of Committees of the Board have to be approved by the Board.
* '''Committees of the Membership''' are the bodies through which AMIA's professional presence in the field exists.  They develop expertise, advocacy and education in the different topics and activities related to moving image archiving, e.g. preservation, copyright and cataloguing.  Their rosters are volunteers from within the AMIA membership, and they elect their chairs directly.
* '''[[task force|Task Forces]]''' are created by the Board of Directors to carry out a specific projects which does not fall squarely within the remit of an existing committee, and are dissolved on completion of that task.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9892">In [[architecture]] and [[spatial design]], '''atmosphere''' refers to the sensorial qualities that a space emits. Atmosphere is an immediate form of physical perception, and is recognised through emotional sensibility. Architects and designers use the notion of atmosphere to argue that architecture and space is designed and built for people to use and experience. [[Peter Zumthor]] in his book ''Atmospheres''&lt;ref&gt;Zumthor, Peter (2006). ''Atmospheres''. Birkhauser, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; constitutes architectural atmospheres as  "this singular density and mood, this feeling of presence, well-being, harmony, beauty...under whose spell I experience what I otherwise would not experience in precisely this way".

==About==
Spaces of atmosphere are shaped through a bodily interaction with architecture. The atmosphere is therefore closely linked to a philosophy of [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] and the analysis of [[topography]]. [[Vitruvius]] noted that since the human body is the measure of architecture, it is also that which determines atmospheric qualities. It is the human body that emanates the structural qualities of architecture. 

Drawing from Vitruvius’ discussion of architecture, a number of twentieth-century architects have adopted a phenomenological interpretation of their work, to understand architecture’s primary concern as the body in space. Among these architects include; Peter Zumthor, [[Steven Holl]] and [[Juhani Pallasmaa]]. Their architectural works draw from the philosophical tradition of [[Merleau-Ponty|Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], the correlation of the body and its sensory-motor functions. Merleau-Ponty in ''Phenomenology of Perception''&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. (1945) ''Phenomenology of Perception''. Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that, “the body and mind cannot be separated as subject and object”. The perception of the body influences what is perceived by the mind. 

German philosopher [[Gernot Böhme]] has also expanded on the architectural atmosphere, in his essay "Atmosphere as the Subject Matter of Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;Böhme, Gernot (2005). “Atmosphere As The Subject Matter of Architecture” in ''Natural Histories''. Herzog and de Meuron, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;  He addresses the nature of space as the physicality of an actual space and the atmospheric qualities that are embedded within a space. Böhme states that “we must be physically present” (p.&amp;nbsp;402) to experience space in its complete entirety. By inhabiting space individuals can sense the character that surrounds them. Inhabitants sense its atmosphere. Photography, written articles and the interpretation of other viewers of a space cannot compare to individual experience and interaction in interior spaces.  Spaces begin as voids, tangible and undefined structures, its atmospheres are articulated through cognitive subjects (memory, perception, judgement, emotion) and physical presence. Recently an italian philosopher [[Tonino Griffero]] addresses the theory of atmospheres in a thorough and systematic way, examining the role of atmospheres (underestimated in traditional aesthetics) in daily life and their main ontological and phenomenological characteristics,&lt;ref&gt;Griffero, Tonino (2010). ''Atmosferologia. Estetica degli spazi emozionali''. Laterza, Rome-Bari. tr. Atmospheres. Aesthetics of Emotional Spaces, Ashgate, Farnham 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and aims to consider atmospherical feelings and moods (including pain, shame, twilight, gaze, felt-bodily isles, etc.) as protypes of the new ontological category of quasi-things.&lt;ref&gt;Griffero, Tonino (2013). ''Quasi-cose. La realtà dei sentimenti.'' Bruno Mondadori, Milano 2013. tr. Quasi-Things. The Paradigm of Atmospheres, Suny, New York 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of architectural atmospheres==
Several aspects of architectural and spatial design have been identified as contributing to atmosphere:

'''Light'''

Light that fills a room can give the impression of a space being serene, exhilarating, gloomy, celebratory or creepy. Spaces are experienced by the mood transmitted within. Peter Zumthor describes his interest in light, which is crucial in creating atmospheres within his architecture –  “…Daylight, the light on things, is so moving to me that I feel almost a spiritual quality. When the sun comes up in the morning – which I always find so marvelous… and casts its light on things, it doesn’t feel as if it quite belongs in this world. I don’t understand light. It gives me the feeling there’s something beyond me, something beyond all understanding” (''Atmospheres'', p.&amp;nbsp;61).
 
Böhme outlines the concept; that stage design, like architecture provokes emotions and atmosphere. This sense of atmosphere is enhanced “not only of objects, wall and solids, but also of light, sound, colour…” Japanese novelist Junichiro Tanizaki in his book ''In Praise of Shadows''&lt;ref&gt;Tanizaki, Junichiro (1977). ''In Praise of Shadows''. Leete’s Island Books, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt; describes atmospheres poetically, through space and light within Japanese thought and practice of inhabiting in variations of darkness. “An empty space… a mere shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the darkness immutable tranquillity holds sway” (p.&amp;nbsp;33). The mystery and ambiguity of shadows created by light are primary atmospheric conditions of interior spaces.

The relationship between light and architecture occurs inevitably. Light, depending on how it is used can transform the spatial context. It can make a space seem pleasant or unpleasant, moving or ambiguous, light also plays with scale or it could be used simply to highlight elements within a space. Light makes space more enjoyable, comfortable, inhabitable and visible.

'''Object'''

[[Baudrillard|Jean Baudrillard]] in ''The System of Objects''&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, Jean (1968). ''The System of Objects''. Verso&lt;/ref&gt; used the term ‘atmosphere’ within the context of interior design to refer to the status image of consumption. The functional interior design, in Baudrillard’s description, is created of the combination of objects. This gives interior design its function. Objects within a space are constructed rather than inherent. Objects determine spaces of place. The objects placed in an interior create a certain atmosphere sought by the inhabitant. Objects act as replacements, products of mass production. Putting objects in a space is a means of expressing yourself. Thus the interior, through a series of cultural connotations takes on its ‘atmospheric’ qualities, where the term is used to describe a personal expression of status. 

Peter Zumthor’s view on objects within a space is that –  “The idea of things that have nothing to do with me as an architect taking their place in a building, their rightful place… It’s a great help to me to imagine the future of rooms in a house I am building, to imagine them actually in use” (''Atmospheres'', p.&amp;nbsp;39). Objects in a space give a sense of identity and expressiveness to place. Objects can acquire both tangible and intangible qualities, for example; an idea, memory, colour, furniture, smell, light and texture. These are all atmospheric features present within architecture.

'''Air'''

Air encapsulates buildings. Building are said to be alive. By inhabitation, life is given to interior spaces through imagination and presence. Air in buildings forms an atmosphere. Steven Connor in his essay "Building Breathing Space"&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Steven (2004). “Building Breathing Space” in ''Going Ariel: Air, Art, Architecture''. http://www.bbk.ac.uk/english/skc/bbs/&lt;/ref&gt; states, “Like the sky, space [is] mobile, mutable, perturbed, polymorphous, subject to stress, strain and fatigue. The most important agitations of space [are] sound, heat and odour" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). Connor expresses that these agitations are carried by air and fill space. Buildings defend and sustain their interiority; air creates an apparent atmosphere within architecture. 

'''Materials'''

Materials create architectural atmospheres. Materials can be transformed in multiple ways to obtain certain atmospherics in architecture and spaces. For example a stone can be split, cut, sawed, drilled, polished and with each process it will have a different quality. Materials are also combined with other materials in a building that play with texture, colour, temperature and tone; all of which create an atmosphere and mood. For Zumthor, “Materials react with one another and have their radiance, so that the material composition gives rise to something unique. Material is endless” (''Atmospheres'', p.&amp;nbsp;25).

'''Sound'''

Peter Zumthor outlines that, “Interiors are like large instruments, collecting sound, amplifying it, transmitting it elsewhere. That has to do with the shape peculiar to each room and with the surface of materials they contain, and the way those materials have been applied.” (''Atmospheres'', p.&amp;nbsp;29). Sounds are associated with certain rooms, places and memories. Empty spaces still produce sound through the stillness and silence of scale and materials. Sound in architecture is heard through physical presence and sensitivity. Sound induces emotional and sensual responses. Material, scale, memory and familiarity all create a sense of sound inside a building. It is up to individuals within a space to identify and associate with the sounds present. Sound is both a tangible and intangible sensational atmospheric quality. It allows the individual to physically hear, as well as feel and sense the characteristics present in architecture.

The '''Baghdad School''' was a relatively short-lived yet influential school of [[Islamic art]] developed during the late 12th century in the capital [[Baghdad]] of the ruling [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. The movement had largely died out by the early 14th century, five decades following the invasion of the [[Mongols]] in 1258 and the downfall of the Abbasids' rule, and would eventually be replaced by stylistic movements from the [[Mongol]] tradition.  The Baghdad School is particularly noted for its distinctive approach to manuscript illustration.  The faces depicted in illustrations were individualized and expressive, with the scenes often highlighting realistic features of everyday life from the period.  This stylistic movement used strong, bright colors, and employed a balanced sense of design and a decorative quality, with illustrations often lacking traditional frames and appearing between lines of text on manuscript pages.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s. v. "Baghdad school," accessed May 04, 2013, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/48804/Baghdad-school.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Baghdad School of art is noted for its manuscript artwork. The school consisted of calligraphers, illustrators, transcribers and translators, who collaborated to produce illuminated manuscripts derived from non-Arabic sources. The characteristic Baghdad School artistic style, which features sprightly characters bearing highly expressive faces and hand gestures (rather than stereotypical people), reached its peak in the first half of the 13th-century, although some examples can be identified at earlier periods.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad School," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., CRC Press, 2003, p. 1259&lt;/ref&gt;  Illustrations in this style represent a skilful blend of Byzantine, Persian and Arab features.&lt;ref&gt;Ekhtiar, M., ''Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' New York, N.Y., [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2011, p. 94; Ipşiroğlu, M.S., ''Painting and Culture of the Mongols,'' Abrams, 1966, p. 37; Rahimova, Z., "Miniature Painting of the Middle Eastern Arabic School of Miniature," ''Journal of the Academy of Arts'' (Uzbekistan), No. 2, 2015, [http://sanat.orexca.com/2015/2012-2-2015/miniature-painting-of-the-middle-eastern-arabic-school-of-miniature/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Very few illuminated copies of the [[Quaran|Q'ran]] from this period have survived, but a number of secular manuscripts are still extant.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., [[CRC Press]], 2003, p. 1259.&lt;/ref&gt; These manuscripts are primarily scientific treatises or social commentaries. 

The descriptor, "Baghdad School", was coined by the French [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]], Eustache De Lorey, in 1938, when he curated an exhibition of illustrations from ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani]]'' for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref&gt;Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Some art historians and curators used the term, ''Mesopotamian School,''&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," ''Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin,'' n.d.,  p,. 277, [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:]; Dimand, M.S., ''A Handbook of Mohammedan Decorative Arts,'' New York, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1930, pp 18-20 or Rahimova, Z., "Miniature Painting of the Middle Eastern Arabic School of Miniature," ''Journal of the Academy of Arts'' (Uzbekistan), No. 2, 2015, [http://sanat.orexca.com/2015/2012-2-2015/miniature-painting-of-the-middle-eastern-arabic-school-of-miniature/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars have suggested that the term should be replaced with something broader, such as the Arab School of Miniatures, because its exponents were not just confined to Baghdad and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Osier, P., ''Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations and illustrations of ''[[De Materia Medica]]''==

The [[Greeks|Greek]] [[materia medica]], in particular herbals and [[bestiaries]], which described the characteristics and medicinal uses of various plants and animals found in the Mediterranean world, were among the books transcribed.&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;“Preparation of Medicine from Honey: Leaf from an Arabic Translation of the Materia Medica of Dioscorides [Iraq, Baghdad School] (13.152.6)”. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000--. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/13.152.6 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several Arabic translations of [[Dioscorides]]' work, ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' have been discovered. [[Dioscorides]]' treatise was considered especially important, and remains one of the best examples of manuscript translation and illustration produced by the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; [[Dioscorides]] was a renowned [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] physician, herbalist, and pharmacist serving the [[Roman Empire]] and its armies during the first century CE, whose work gained influence throughout the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;

Of these, a manuscript known as the ''Mashhad Manuscript'', originally believed to be 13th-century  work, has been reassessed and now dated to between 1152 and 1176, providing one of the earliest examples of illustrations in the style of the Baghdad School.&lt;ref&gt;Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," Metropolitan Museum of Art, n.d. [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:] The manuscript has no colophon with date, but it has a 4-page introduction written by Mihran ibn Mansur ibn Miihran, who translated it for Najm ad-din Alpi, the Urtuqid prince, ruler from 1152 to 1176.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example of these translations is the translation and work probably by Abdallah ibn al-Fadl.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, M., ''New Accessions of Islamic Art,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, n.d. [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257747.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:]; Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, n.d., p,. 277, [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:] The manuscript has a colophon which establishes the date as the month of Rajab 620 A.H./ July-August 1224&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations were considered especially important, and it remains one of the best examples of manuscript translation and illustration produced by the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;  [[Dioscorides]] was a renowned Greek physician, herbalist, and pharmacist serving the [[Roman Empire]] and its armies during the first century CE, whose work gained influence throughout the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt; 

Among the illustrated manuscript leaves of the 13th-century [[Dioscorides]]' ''Materia Medica'' is the page entitled, “Physician Preparing an Elixir," also referred to by The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History as “Preparation of Medicine from Honey.”  It is dated 1224 CE and was found in [[Iraq]] or Northern Jazira, possibly [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;  The page depicts an illustration of a bearded physician with a colorful blue headscarf and red clothing seated on an ornamental stool.  He is mixing a yellow pot with a ladle while overlooking a yellow cauldron hanging from a red tripod above a wide blue container.  His other hand is raised up towards his mouth.  A large blue jug lies to the left of the tripod.  Two overhanging trees on either side of the scene bear leaves and two different types of what appear to be colorful fruit or flowers—red on the left and yellow on the right.  The ground below the scene is covered with green grass, however there is no background depicted in the illustration thus reducing the sense of depth. The style of illustration depicted on this manuscript leaf is thus an excellent example of the Baghdad School: the colors are bright and distinctive, the objects depicted in the scene have a balanced, symmetrical design with the trees framing the illustration, and finally, the man’s face appears to be in a state of deep, expressive contemplation.  The scene itself has a realistic and personalized quality to it, depicting a physician in a natural setting as he prepares a medicinal mixture containing honey for his patients, and yet also has ornamental characteristics with its design and choice of colors—another distinctive feature of the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

==Transcription and illustration of ''Maqamat''==
The Abbasid artist, [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]], who lived in [[Baghdad]] in the late Abassid era (12th to 13th-centuries), was one of the pre-eminent exponents of the Baghdad school. In 1236-37, he is known to have transcribed and illustrated the book, ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani|Maqamat]]'' (also known as the ''Assemblies'' or the ''Sessions''), a series of anecdotes of social satire written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopedia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative concerns the travels of a middle-aged man as he uses his charm and eloquence to swindle his way across the Arabic world.&lt;ref&gt;Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Basil-hood-1917.tif|right|thumb|250px|Basil Hood]]
'''Basil Willett Charles Hood''' (5 April 1864 &amp;ndash; 7 August 1917) was a British dramatist and lyricist, perhaps best known for writing the libretti of half a dozen [[Savoy Opera]]s and for his English adaptations of [[operetta]]s, including ''[[The Merry Widow]]''.

He embarked on a career in the [[British Army]], rising to the rank of captain, while writing theatrical pieces in his spare time. After some modest success, Hood and his collaborator, the composer [[Walter Slaughter]], had a major hit with their long-running show, ''[[Gentleman Joe]]'', in 1895. Another long-running success was ''[[The French Maid]]'' (1896). Hood then resigned from the army to pursue his career as a librettist full-time. With [[Arthur Sullivan]] and then [[Edward German]], he wrote several well-received pieces for the [[Savoy Theatre]], including ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'' (1899), ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901), ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902) and ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]'' (1903).

After [[comic opera]] went out of fashion, Hood turned to [[Edwardian musical comedy]], writing lyrics for ''[[The Belle of Mayfair]]'' (1906) and ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907), among others. He then found his greatest success with adaptations of continental operettas for the impresario [[George Edwardes]], writing English versions of such works as (1907), ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1908), ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'' (1908) and ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'' (1911), among others, sometimes drastically rewriting the book and lyrics. At the outbreak of [[World War I]], he took up a demanding post in the British [[War Office]], which is believed to have contributed to his early death.

==Life and works==

===Early life and military career===
Hood was born in [[Croydon]], Surrey, the youngest of nine children of the psychiatrist Sir William Charles Hood (1824–1870), [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], who was superintendent, physician and treasurer to [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] and later a [[Commissioners in Lunacy|Commissioner in Lunacy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily News'', 13 July 1868, p. 5; and "The Dundee Courier", 18 July 1868, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Jane ''née'' Willett (1826–1866).&lt;ref name=JDSmith&gt;Smith, J. Donald. "Who Was Basil Hood? – Part I", ''Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Magazine'', No. 84, Spring 2014, pp. 26–35&lt;/ref&gt; After both parents died in his early childhood, Hood was raised by his older siblings&lt;ref name=JDSmith/&gt; and educated at [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington]] and [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the [[Green Howards]] in 1883.&lt;ref name=mg&gt;"Obituary, Captain Basil Hood", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 8 August 1917, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, he married Frances Ada ''née'' English (1866–1922), but two months later she was institutionalised at Bethlem Royal Hospital, and she remained in asylums until her death.&lt;ref name=JDSmith/&gt; He was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in 1893 and retired in 1895, but joined the 3rd ([[Militia]]) Battalion later the same year. He resigned his commission in 1898.&lt;ref name=mg/&gt; A courteous gentleman, Hood was well-liked; he was also generous with money and a poor businessman.&lt;ref name=Smith2&gt;Smith, J. Donald. "Who Was Basil Hood? – Part II", ''Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Magazine'', No. 85, Summer 2014, pp. 15–32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early stage works===
Hood began writing for the theatre in his mid-twenties. His first one-act piece, ''The Gypsies'', with music by Wilfred Bendall (1850–1920), was mounted as a curtain-raiser at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] in 1890. ''[[The Times]]'' praised the piece and remarked on "a certain flavour of Gilbertian paradox".&lt;ref&gt;"Prince of Wales's Theatre," ''The Times'', 27 October 1890, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Hood provided the lyrics to [[Lionel Monckton]]'s song, "What Will You Have to Drink?", interpolated into the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' in 1892.&lt;ref name=BMT&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/british/authors/hood.html Basil Hood biography] at the British Musical Theatre website of the Gilbert and Sullivan archive, 31 August 2004, adapted from ''The Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre'' by [[Kurt Gänzl]], accessed 11 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Hood then wrote two short [[operetta]]s with music by [[Walter Slaughter]]. The first was ''Donna Luiza'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]], 27 March 1892, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; which ''The Times'' again compared to [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s work, this time less favourably.&lt;ref&gt;"Prince of Wales's Theatre", ''The Times'', 24 March 1892, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The second piece by Hood and Slaughter was ''The Crossing Sweeper'', presented at the Gaiety Theatre, with [[Kate Cutler]] and Florence Lloyd.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 16 April 1893, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frenchmaid1.jpg|thumb|right|Theatre poster from 1897]]
In 1895, Hood and Slaughter wrote a full-length [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]], ''[[Gentleman Joe]], the Hansom Cabbie'', a vehicle for the comedian [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]]. It ran for 391 performances in London, with a second company also presenting it in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 25 August 1895, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Its success prompted Hood to resign his army commission to concentrate on his writing,&lt;ref name=larkin&gt;Larkin, Colin (ed).

===Librettist of Savoy Operas===
After [[Arthur Sullivan]] finished collaborating with W. S. Gilbert (''[[The Grand Duke]]'', in 1896, was their last joint work), [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], the proprietor of the [[Savoy Theatre]], looked for other librettists to provide librettos for Sullivan to set. Hood was introduced to Sullivan by his old collaborator Wilfred Bendall, who was then Sullivan's secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Fredric Woodbridge. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/46772?q=Basil+Hood&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit  "Hood, Basil"], Grove Music Online, accessed 13 June 2010 (requires subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's several operas written in the 1890s without Gilbert had not been successful,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chieftain'', with [[F. C. Burnand]] ran for 97 performances in 1894–95, and ''The Beauty Stone'' with [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] and [[J. Comyns Carr]] ran for 50 performances in 1898: see Rollins and Witts, pp. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; but his new opera with Hood, ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'' (1899), ran for 213 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Hood also wrote the libretti for two short companion pieces at the Savoy. The first was ''[[Pretty Polly (opera)|Pretty Polly]]'', which ran with ''The Rose of Persia'' in 1900 and with ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' in 1900–01,&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/companions/pretty_polly/reviews.html ''Pretty Polly'': Reviews reproduced from ''The Pall Mall Gazette'' etc.] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 8 May 2008, accessed 11 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the second was ''[[Ib and Little Christina]]'' (1900), which played in several theatres including the Savoy (in 1901, as a companion piece to Hood's ''[[The Willow Pattern]]'').&lt;ref name=rw19&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Hood also wrote such plays, during this period, as ''The Great Silence'', with [[Louie Pounds]] (Coronet Theatre, London; 1900),&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 606&lt;/ref&gt; which was presented together with ''[[Cox and Box]]'' (starring [[Courtice Pounds]] as Box) and ''Ib and Little Christina'', with Louie Pounds as adult Christina (otherwise, the original cast reprised their roles).&lt;ref&gt;"The Coronet Theatre", ''The Morning Post'', 25 July 1900, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RoseofPHas.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration of scene from ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'', 1899]]
After the success for Hood and Sullivan of ''The Rose of Persia'', the pair were soon writing a second opera, ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901). Sullivan died while writing this new work, however, and the task of completing it fell to [[Edward German]]. The production was another reasonable success, with 205 performances.&lt;ref name=rw19/&gt; Hood wrote that, at the time of Sullivan's death, he and Sullivan had also begun work on a serious opera.&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt; Hood and German went on to collaborate on the successful ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902), which played at the Savoy for 120 performances, toured the provinces for 14 weeks, and then returned for another run at the Savoy.&lt;ref name=rw20&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Of ''Merrie England'', ''The Observer'' wrote, "It is not too much to say that Capt. Basil Hood and Mr. Edward German have, by means of the latest Savoy success, increased their reputations to an extent that will lead the musical public to look to them in future for work as epoch-making in its peculiar ''genre'' as that of Gilbert and Sullivan. Capt. Hood is the only writer of "words for music" whose lyrics can compare with those of Mr. Gilbert for finish, rhythmic piquancy, and verbal quaintness."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 6 April 1902, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Another piece in 1902, ''My Pretty Maid'', starring [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]], lasted less than two months.&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt; When ''Merrie England'' finished its second London run, German and Hood immediately followed it with ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]'' (1903) which ran for 115 performances and then went on tour. After that, their producer, [[William Greet]], turned away from light opera, which effectively ended their work together.&lt;ref name=BMT/&gt;

===Adapter of operettas===
[[Image:A Waltz Dream.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gertie Millar]] and [[Robert Evett]] in Hood's version of ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'']]
Between 1903 and 1906, Hood worked on several musical comedies, including one based on ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', but when producer [[Charles Frohman]] started altering his work to suit casting considerations, he withdrew his name from the book of what was produced with great success as ''[[The Belle of Mayfair]]'' (1906), although he remained credited with some lyrics. He also revived ''Little Hans Andersen'' at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], in 1903, and adapted [[Victorien Sardou]]'s play ''Les Merveilleuses'' as the libretto for [[George Edwardes]]'s musical at [[Daly's Theatre]], ''[[The Merveilleuses]]'' (1906). Next, he supplied the Gaiety Theatre with lyrics for the successful musical ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907).&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMT/&gt;

With the resurgence of interest in Continental European [[operetta]]s, Edwardes engaged Hood to prepare the English versions of what became a series of extremely successful productions. Critical opinion has differed about this period of Hood's career. ''The Times'', in its obituary notice, wrote, "He spent more ability in adapting librettos for the late George Edwardes than the quality of the work demanded … under these conditions he scarcely fulfilled his promise as a wit and poet.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 8 August 1917, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the view of the ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', "adapting German and Viennese operettas … is where he found his métier. Often discarding the original premise, he helped create lively and very popular operettas."&lt;ref name=larkin/&gt; Hood generally changed the structure of these works from three acts to two, often greatly re-writing them and adapting the plots.&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt; Shows that Hood adapted included the tremendously popular London production of ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' (1907); another hit, ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1908); ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'' (1908); another success, ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'' (1911), and the also popular ''Gypsy Love'' (1912).

Hood's original works were few in these years. In 1909, his ''Little Hans Andersen'' was revived under the management of [[William Greet]]. In 1913 he wrote his last musical comedy success, ''The Pearl Girl'', with [[Howard Talbot]].&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMT/&gt; In 1912, the actor-manager [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree|Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] proposed another collaboration between Hood and German to provide a musical production based on the life of [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]], but German declined the commission.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Tim. [http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?catNum=223419&amp;filetype=About+this+Recording&amp;language=English "Edward German (1862 –1936)"], Naxos, 1992, accessed 11 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years===
With the outbreak of [[World War I]], German-language operetta lost its popularity. After that, Hood supplied lyrics for individual numbers for some musicals, and a [[revue]], ''Bric-a-Brac'' with [[Lionel Monckton]] and [[Arthur Wimperis]], and some non-musical plays. In the early days of the war, he took up a post with the Cryptography Division of the [[War Office]].&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]]. [http://www.musicals101.com/who22.htm "Who's Who in Musicals: Additional Bios XII"], Musicals101.com, 2004, accessed 11 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the heavy demands of his wartime work, he wrote a patriotic light opera, ''Young England'', with music by [[George Clutsam|G. H. Clutsam]] and [[Hubert Bath]], starring [[Walter Passmore]], which ran at [[Daly's Theatre]] and then the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1916–17 before going on tour.&lt;ref&gt;"''Young England'': Music and Laughter at Daly's", ''The Times'', 26 December 1916, p. 9; ''The Times'' 4 January 1917, p. 8; and 26 March 1917, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In his final years, Hood developed an obsession with Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', which he believed contained a [[cryptogram]] that he worked to decipher. His companion of later years was Doris Armine Ashworth; she died about 1958.&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt;

Hood died suddenly in his flat in [[St. James's Street]], London, at the age of 53, from the effects of overwork and neglecting to eat.&lt;ref&gt;"Captain Basil Hood's Death: Excessive Concentration on Cryptograms", ''The Times'', 11 August 1917; p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, his  children's book,  ''Saint George of England'', was published in 1919 by George G. Harrap &amp; Co., London.&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt;

'''Benno Schotz''' (28 August 1891 [[Kuressaare|Arensburg]] – 11 October 1984 [[Glasgow]]) was an Estonian-born Scottish sculptor, and one of twentieth century Scotland's leading artists.

==Biography ==

===Early life===
Schotz was the youngest of six children of [[Jew]]ish parents, Jacob Schotz, a watchmaker, and Cherna Tischa Abramovitch. He was educated at the Boys Grammar School of [[Pärnu]], [[Estonia]]. Later he studied at the [[Grossherzogliche Technische Hochschule]] in [[Darmstadt]], Germany.

In 1912, he immigrated to Glasgow, where he gained an engineering diploma from the [[Royal Technical College]]. From 1914 to 1923 he worked in the drawing office of [[John Brown and Company]], a [[Clydebank]] [[shipbuilding|shipbuilder]]s, while attending evening classes in sculpture at the [[Glasgow School of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Manz, S. &amp; Panayi, P. (2013) ''Refugees and Cultural Transfer to Britain'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aS-PAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=john%20keppie&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20keppie&amp;f=false page 56] Routledge. {{ISBN|1317965930}} Retrieved March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic career===
Schotz became a full-time sculptor in 1923. An important early patron was the Dundee art collector William Boyd, thanks to whose influence both Dundee Dental School and Dundee Art Galleries &amp; Museums hold pieces by him.&lt;ref name="DundeeCourier"&gt;{{Citation
 | title = DENTAL HOSPITAL BENEFACTRESS
 | newspaper = Dundee Courier
 | page = 5
 | date = 19 September 1936
}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point onwards his reputation grew and he became a full member of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]], head of sculpture at the Glasgow School of Art (a post he held from 1938 until his retirement in 1961), and eventually was appointed the [[Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland]] in 1963. His pupils included the artists [[Hannah Frank]],  Stewart Bowman Johnson, and [[Inge King| Inge King (née Neufeld)]].

His homes at West Campbell Street and later Kirklee Road were a focus for meetings of artists, writers, actors, and politicians. He was also a member of [[Glasgow Art Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib6_1231758399 Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain &amp; Ireland 1851–1951] Retrieved 17 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped refugees such as [[Jankel Adler]] and [[Josef Herman]].

He was a committed [[Zionist]], and also proud of his adopted [[Scotland]]. He worked until a few weeks before his death at the age of 93. He was buried in [[Jerusalem]].

He was made a Freeman of the City of Glasgow in 1981. In that same year, Gordon Wright published his autobiography, ''Bronze in My Blood''.

== Work ==
During his career, Schotz produced several hundred portraits and compositions including figure compositions, religious sculptures, semi-abstracts and modelled portraits. His bust of [[James Maxton]] is on public display at the Maxton remembrance garden in [[Barrhead]] near [[Paisley (Scotland)|Paisley]]. Other publicly accessible work includes:
* ''Memorial to Provost [[John Jarvie]] of [[Kilsyth]]'', first freeman of the burgh, commissioned in 1954 is a portrait in relief and can be seen in John Jarvie Square, off East Burnside Street, [[Kilsyth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kilsyth.org.uk/landmarks.htm |title = Kilsyth Today |website = Kilsyth Community Council |accessdate = 7 January 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140107235410/http://www.kilsyth.org.uk/landmarks.htm |archivedate = 7 January 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a bust of William Boyd's daughter Joan at The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery &amp; Museum
* bust of [[Keir Hardie]], [[People's Palace, Glasgow]]

The majority of these works were all in Glasgow and the surrounding area. He was responsible for the repair on the bridge sculpture at Kelvingrove Park beside the now refurbished art gallery and museum.

Although Benno Schotz is frequently referred to as an Estonian sculptor, all his professional life was in Scotland. He became a naturalised British subject in 1930.
He became a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy, 1937. He headed the Sculpture and Ceramics dept. of the Glasgow School of Art from 1938 until his retirement in 1960. His active life as a sculptor continued thereafter with renewed vigor and he created his most ambitious and monumental works over the next 20 years. 
In 1963, he was appointed The Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland, a member of the Royal household. 
A major retrospective exhibition of his works (1971) was held at the Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh.
His interest in the drawing of trees developed, the drawings becoming more and more complex and abstract. He mounted a successful exhibition of Sculptures and Related Drawings in Glasgow (1961). His last sculpture was executed less than six weeks before his death, aged 93.
He was Life-President of the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.
Honors include: Freedom of the City of Glasgow; Honorary Fellow of The Hebrew University; Honorary LL.D, Strathclyde University; Honorary Member of the British Society of British Sculptors; Honorary Member of the Royal Institute of Architects in Scotland.

Schotz wrote at least one book: "Bronze is in my Blood",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstraven.com/sstowell/Family/Bob.html&lt;/ref&gt; a memoir of his life.

The '''Breadalbane Brooch''' is a luxurious [[Celtic art|Celtic]] [[penannular brooch]] probably made in [[Ireland]], but later altered and then found in [[Scotland]]. Probably dating to the 8th century, with 9th-century alterations, it is an intricately designed, [[silver-gilt]] dress fastener that is closely related to a select group of brooches that were produced in Ireland and Britain during the  'golden age' of late [[Celtic art]]. The brooch has been in the [[British Museum]] since 1919, and is normally on display.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=66790&amp;partId=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description ==
The brooch and pin were cast in silver with exquisite [[geometric]] and [[zoomorphic]] interlace patterns and inset with three green-glass [[cabochon]] gems (one of which is missing).  Several moulded sections were used, although the main ring was cast in one piece, other goldsmith's techniques were used in the decoration. both front and back were partially [[gilding|gilded]], with gold and [[gold foil]] also used in parts of the decoration. There may have been inset pieces of [[amber]], which are now missing. There is decoration on both front and back, in rather different styles, a feature also found in the [[Tara Brooch]] and [[Hunterston Brooch]].&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 94&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of a number of brooches which were made in the Irish "pseudo-penannular" style, with the ring fully closed (like the two just mentioned and the [[Londesborough Brooch]]), but later adapted to a true penannular brooch by cutting away the bridging section linking the large terminals.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 94-95&lt;/ref&gt; The pin, which moves freely around the ring between the terminals (see other picture), is broken but would have originally extended to at least double the brooch's diameter.  It appears to be a replacement, made in Scotland, probably at the same time that the form of the ring was adapted, by cutting the bridge to make the brooch truly penannular.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of ownership==
The design and manufacture of the brooch mixes Celtic and [[Picts#Art|Pictish]] styles - it may originally have been a gift from an Irish dignitary to his Scottish counterpart, who later repaired or embellished the brooch according to local tastes. The original [[provenance]] of the brooch is unknown, although it is conjectured that the brooch was found in [[Perthshire]] in Scotland as it was probably first owned by [[Gavin Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane]], whose country estate was located in that county. The brooch was later donated to the national collection by Sir John Ramsden, following the sale of the Breadalbane Collection in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Charles S. Roberts Awards''' (or '''CSR Awards''') was an annual award for excellence in the historical [[wargaming]] hobby. It was named in honor of [[Charles S. Roberts]] the "Father of Wargaming" who founded [[Avalon Hill]]. The award was informally called a "Charlie" and officially called a "Charles S. Roberts Award". ''[[The Wargamer (magazine)|The Wargamer]]'' magazine called it "very prestigious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wargamer.com/article/2857/industry-news-voting-for-the-charles-s-roberts-award-now-open |title=Industry News: Voting for the Charles S Roberts Award Now Open |work=[[The Wargamer (magazine)|The Wargamer]] |author=Scott Parrino |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2014 |quote=..the very prestigious Charles S Roberts Awards has started. |archiveurl=https://archive.is/6AqKU |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Created at the first Origins Game Convention in 1975, the awards were the "brainchild of Canadian hobbyist John Mansfield."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Origins: The National Convention af Five |journal=[[Moves (magazine)|Moves]] |author1=John Prados |date=June 1979 |volume= |number=45 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Mansfield, resident of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] and long time gamer, is manager of Pendragon Games &amp; Hobbies as of 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the awards were the [[Origins Awards]] but were informally known as the ''Charles Roberts Awards''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Origins: The National Convention af Five |journal=[[Moves (magazine)|Moves]] |author1=John Prados |date=June 1979 |volume= |number=45 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was only in 1988 that Charles Roberts officially agreed to let his name be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alanemrich.com/CSR_pages/CSR_Awards_Home.htm |title=CSR Awards Authorization |publisher=CSR website |author=Charles S.

Fortress America was not considered a traditional historical wargame by the older members in the wargaming community. Prior to 2000, the awards were given at the [[Origins Game Fair]]. Since 2000, the awards were given at the [[World Boardgaming Championships]] (formerly "AvalonCon"). The Award was managed by the Charles S. Roberts Award Committee with winners chosen by votes submitted by fans.

The Awards also included the [[Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame]] which recognized game designers and producers that have made a significant and long lasting contribution to the contemporary board wargaming hobby.

The last year the awards were given was 2012.

'''Cyber PowWow''' is an Aboriginally determined online gallery with digital artworks and a library of texts. It was conceived in 1996 and was live online from 1997 to 2004 in four main iterations. Cyber PowWow was part webspace and part chatroom, and all artwork displayed on the website was created specifically for Cyber PowWow. The website was hosted in Time Warner's "[[The Palace (computer program)|The Palace]]," a popular and influential chat room of the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Gaertner 55–78"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaertner|first=David|date=2016-04-15|title=Indigenous in Cyberspace: CyberPowWow,God's Lake Narrows, and the Contours of Online Indigenous Territory|url=http://uclajournals.org/doi/10.17953/aicrj.39.4.gaertner|journal=American Indian Culture and Research Journal|language=EN|volume=39|issue=4|pages=55–78|doi=10.17953/aicrj.39.4.gaertner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First Cyper PowWow exhibition ==
For the first Cyber PowWow event Six aboriginal artists and writers were invited to create work for the first Cyber PowWow event. The exhibition was launched with a simultaneous, distributed chat event. Participating artists, writers, and the wider public were invited to log on to the Palace to engage artists and visitors in discussions about the artwork. Skawennati Tricia Fragnito, one of the developers of Cyber PowWow, and Jason Lewis state that, "the event was successful in terms of the Aboriginal art and issues it brought into a public venue," but that, "critical dialogue was often interrupted by 'non-participants' drifting in from other chat rooms."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fragnito|first=Skawennati Tricia|date=|year=|title=Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/canada/aboriginal-territories-cyberspace|journal=|language=EN|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyber PowWow 2 ==
Cyber PowWow 2 signaled the launch of a separate Palace unique to Cyber PowWow. Eight Aboriginal artists and writers customized the chat space with imagery, scripts, and a variety of Indian avatars. Artists presented their work and answered questions about it from an enthusiastic audience composed largely of people from the Canadian contemporary art community. The participants included Ahasiw Maskegon-Iskwew, Sheryl Kootenhayoo, who contributed a Quicktime virtual reality piece, and [[Lori Blondeau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallery: CyberPowWow2|url=http://www.cyberpowwow.net/gallery.html|website=CyberPowWow|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who created and led a virtual round dance.&lt;ref name="Gaertner 55–78"/&gt;

== CPW 2K: Cyber PowWow Goes Global ==
The third incarnation of Cyber PowWow included not only Canadian and American artists, but, for the first time, Australian artists as well as non-Native artists. The Aboriginal participants were joined by Mare Burgess, a white feminist researcher who studies Indian warrior women, and Sheila Urbanoski, a white artists who grew up in a town bordering a reserve. Skawennati Tricia Fragnito remarked in her curatorial essay: "Now that we have marked our territory, built a Palace and furnished it, it is time to invite in our neighbours: digital artists in the non-Native world. These friends, collaborators, and kindred spirits can talk about the very topic that we are engendering: Aboriginal meets non-Aboriginal."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Death of the [[Reprobate]]''''' (33.4 x 19.6 cm) is an oil on panel painting by a follower of [[Hieronymus Bosch]] which depicts the deathbed struggle for the human soul between an angel and a demon. The style is somewhat similar to his ''[[Death of the Miser]]''. It is held in a private collection in [[New York City]], United States.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcgallery.com/B/bosch/bosch31.html |title=Hieronymus Bosch: Death of the Reprobate |date=9 August 2015 |accessdate=9 August 2015 |work=ABC Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is likely a copy of detail from a larger hell panel. It dates from the second half of the 16th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2582">[[File:Hans Memling - Donne Triptych - National Gallery London.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The ''Donne Triptych'' by [[Hans Memling]], c. 1470s, [[National Gallery, London]].]]
The '''''Donne Triptych''''' (or '''''Donne Altarpiece''''') is a hinged-[[triptych]] altarpiece by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Hans Memling]]. It consists of five individual panel paintings: a central inner panel, and two double-sided wings. It was painted for [[Sir John Donne]], probably sometime between the late 1470s or early 1480s, and is in the permanent collection of the [[National Gallery]], London, with the panels still in their original frames.

When Donne commissioned the work is unknown. Art historians have debated whether it was painted in the early 1480s, around the same time Memling painted ''[[Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine (Memling)|Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara]]'', in New York at the [[Metropolitan Art Museum]]. An earlier date of sometime in the late 1470s is possible, at the time he completed the similar ''[[St John Altarpiece (Memling)|St John Altarpiece]]'', or it may have been painted as a precursor to that altarpiece.&lt;ref name = "Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437054 "Virgin and Child with Saints"]. Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved May 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-memling-the-donne-triptych/29180 ''Donne Triptych''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425053108/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-memling-the-donne-triptych/29180 |date=April 25, 2014 }}. National Gallery. Retrieved May 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blum, 92&lt;/ref&gt; 

The donor, Sir John Donne, was a Welsh-born diplomat for the [[House of York]] who visited Bruges at least once, in 1468 to attend [[Charles the Bold]] and [[Margaret of York]]'s wedding; how he became acquainted with Memling is as uncertain as when he commissioned the triptych.&lt;ref name ="Bruce79"&gt;Bruce, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3144">'''En Foco''' is a non-profit organization that nurtures contemporary fine art and [[documentary photography|documentary photographers]] of diverse cultures, primarily U.S. residents of Latino, African and Asian heritage, and native peoples of the Americas and the Pacific.

Founded in 1974 and inspired by the civil rights movement, it has been in the forefront of documenting the artistic journeys created by photographic artists often overlooked by the mainstream art world.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Through its visual arts programs, En Foco strives to balance the inequities of the art world by creating the 'missing pages' in art history. In 1984 it created the bilingual (English/Spanish) photographic magazine ''Nueva Luz'', which concentrates on works by U.S.-based photographers of color. Some photographers En Foco has exhibited or written about are [[Hank Willis Thomas]] and [[Sama Raena Alshaibi]].

== History ==
Inspired by the 1973 traveling exhibition ''Dos Mundos'' (organized by the Institute of Contemporary Hispanic Art and exhibited in New York City, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico), a group of Puerto Rican photographers - Charles Biasiny-Rivera, Phil Dante, and Roger Cabán - banded together to form the core En Foco group and incorporated in 1974.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Gonzalez | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Focusing on the Hidden History | date=2012-01-24 | publisher= | url =http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/focusing-on-the-hidden-history/

'''''En attendant les hommes''''' is a 2007 documentary film by [[Katy Léna N'diaye]] about women [[muralist]]s in [[Oualata]], [[Mauritania]]. In this town on the far edge of the [[Sahara|Sahara desert]], three women practice traditional painting, and decorate the walls of the town. In a society apparently dominated by tradition, religion and men, these women unreservedly express themselves and comment freely on the relationship between men and women.&lt;ref name=Pialeprat&gt;{{cite web|last=Pialeprat|first=Sarah|title=En attendant les hommes de Katy Lena Ndiaye|url=http://www.cinergie.be/webzine/en_attendant_les_hommes_de_katy_lena_ndiaye|work=Cinergie|accessdate=18 March 2012|location=Belgium|date=Webzine n°122, December 2007|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Everworld''''' is a fantasy novel series written by [[K. A. Applegate]] and published by [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]] between 1999 and 2001. It consists of twelve books and a companion music CD titled ''The Everworld Experience''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Ever-World-Experience/release/4836367|title=Various - The Ever World Experience|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characters==
* '''David Levin''': The self-appointed leader of the protagonists. David takes on all the burdens of the group, and has been troubled by his past in which he was cowardly; he must prove himself to be a man.  Before being sucked into Everworld, he was involved in a romantic relationship with Senna Wales.  As such, he is most susceptible to the influence of Senna's powers. He shows his courage and bravery before [[Zeus]], other gods, and Vikings. David fights with the Sword of [[Galahad]], after witnessing Sir Galahad's death.  At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld to help protect it, as well as to escape his mother's smoking and depression problems.  David narrates ''#1: Search for Senna'', ''#5: Discover the Destroyer'', and ''#10: Understand the Unknown''.
* '''Christopher Hitchcock''': The reluctant clown of the group, Christopher often makes jokes specifically targeted towards the other members of the group (April ([[sexism]]), Jalil ([[racism]]), and David ([[antisemitism]])).  He does this to keep the others at a distance, so they won't get to know him. Christopher is, in his own words, on the road to becoming an [[alcoholic]] like his parents. However, he can be a jerk one minute, and a kind, caring person the next. Christopher gave up the offer to become an immortal because he failed to save the life of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], Zeus' male lover; blaming his failure on latent homophobia causes Christopher to fall into an alcoholic depression and is the turning point for his character. Christopher also decreases in his prejudice jokes when Keith, who is part of a group of racists and anti-Semitics that plan to overthrow the government, tries to recruit him.  At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld to avoid his parents' alcoholic nature, escape his younger brother's ridicule and abuse, and stay off the road to a possible alcoholic future.  Christopher narrates ''#2: Land of Loss'', ''#6: Fear the Fantastic'', and ''#11: Mystify the Magician''.
* '''April O'Brien''': The heroine of the group, April is Senna's half-sister; their personalities, however, are directly opposite, and the two hate each other with a passion. April is a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], somewhat [[feminism|feminist]], and very beautiful with red hair and green eyes. She is in the [[drama]] [[Club (organization)|club]] at her real world school, and she is often singing songs from ''Rent''. She is also said to be very popular at the main characters' high school.  April carries her own burdens in the group, and is often the voice of reason next to Jalil. She is a vegetarian.  She has the most reason to want to return to the Old World at the end of the series, due to how much she could possibly leave behind.  Ultimately, however, she opts to remain in Everworld due to her unbearable guilt and inability to face her father over her murder of Senna, knowing that it would never be acceptable in their home world, no matter how necessary it had been in Everworld.  April narrates ''#3: Enter the Enchanted'', ''#7: Gateway to the Gods'', and ''#12: Entertain the End''.
* '''Jalil Sherman''': The scientist and sole African-American of the group, he wants to find the "[[software]]" on which Everworld runs and control it. In the real world, Jalil is [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive]], but in Everworld, he is unaffected. His disorder is a secret to the rest of the group for a majority of the series. Senna, however, knows of his condition and was able to temporarily cure it while the two were in the Old World, on the condition he would swear to serve her. He refused. Jalil always tries hard to search for a logical explanation for the many illogical phenomena in Everworld. He and April often butt heads when it comes to [[religion]], but the two often fall on the same side in arguments within the group. At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld rather than return home to the Old World because he does not have to live with his disorder.  His name ironically means "godlike."  Jalil narrates ''#4: Realm of the Reaper'' and ''#8: Brave the Betrayal''.
* '''Senna Wales''': The witch who intertwines all the characters. Senna is David's girlfriend, Christopher's ex-girlfriend, and April's half-sister (they have the same father and different mothers) and has blond hair and gray eyes. Senna is the only main character with real magical power, and at times, uses the others for her own ends, whether through [[emotional manipulation]] or magic. Her magical power is much stronger in Everworld than in the Old World. Her name was originally Senda (meaning "gateway" in Spanish), but after her mother left her she began to refer to herself based on her father's mispronunciation. Senna sometimes uses her powers on others for her own benefit, whether for protection or distraction, though usually in an effort to further her own plans.  Senna's ultimate goal is to overthrow the powers of Everworld and rule over it for her own.  She is ultimately foiled in her plan, however, when she is killed by April in the penultimate book.  Senna only narrates ''#9: Inside the Illusion''.

==Recurring characters==
* '''[[Loki]]''': The [[Norsemen|Norse]] god of destruction who brought David, Senna, Christopher, Jalil, and April into Everworld. Loki wants to use Senna as a gateway to the Old World to escape Ka Anor. Loki escaped from his prison when he was brought to Everworld centuries ago and at some point in the recent past overthrew and imprisoned Odin.  He is also the father of [[Hel (being)|Hel]], [[Fenrisulfr|Fenrir]], and the [[Jörmungandr|Midgard Serpent]].
* '''[[Ka Anor]]''': The god-eating deity of the Hetwans who wants to devour all the gods in Everworld before they escape to the Old World. It also is trying to capture Senna, most likely to prevent the other gods from using her to escape.
* '''Thorolf''': A [[Viking]], in whose farm David, Christopher, Jalil, and April spend the night in ''Everworld #1: Search for Senna''. Died and "ascended" to Valhalla in ''Everworld #8: Brave The Betrayal''.
* '''Olaf Ironfoot''': A [[Viking]] king with an iron foot, Olaf fought alongside David, Christopher, and Jalil against the [[Aztecs]]. He engaged [[Huitzilopoctli]] in personal combat wielding [[Mjolnir]], before being sliced in half by the god. He is of African descent, likely due to the Vikings' tendency to intermarry with other peoples.
* '''Sven Swordeater''': A young [[Viking]] who was stabbed through the cheeks, causing a [[speech impediment]]. Sven was also killed by [[Huitzilopoctli]].
* '''Monsieur Jean-Claude LeMieux''': A [[Frenchman]] who is brought to Everworld thanks to a nuclear explosion. He lives in and is the [[mayor]] of the Greek version of [[Atlantis]].
* '''[[Étaín|Etain]]''': An [[Irish people|Irish]] woman, the half-[[elf]] daughter of the Queen of the Elves, whom Christopher falls in love with. Etain seems to have feelings for him too; however, the series ends with the implication that she probably married the dwarf-king Baldwin in exchange for his assistance in the war to save Everworld.
* '''Keith''': A violent and suicidal [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] who worked with Christopher at an independent copy store for a short amount of time.
* '''Anica''': A [[Wicca]]n who fled the Old World when Loki and other forces desiring a gateway began to search for her, taking refuge with the Egyption Pantheon of Everworld. Before leaving she left her illegitimate daughter with the girl's father and his family, the O'Briens. Anica fears Senna's wrath above all else, but at the same time, seeks her forgiveness.  She is last seen pleading for it, but it is unknown as to whether or not she receives it from Senna.
* '''[[Merlin]]''': The famous wizard who, along with Ka Anor and Loki, is trying to capture Senna, though in his case it is merely to keep anyone from using her, and likely to prevent her takeover of Everworld. Senna fears him the most, and refers to him as the most powerful being in Everworld, because while he lacks the power of the average god, his cleverness and imagination give him an edge. His ultimate goal is to bring all the deities and people of Everworld together to stop Ka Anor.

==People==

===Old-Worlders===
The Old-Worlders are people who do not live in Everworld and who live
in the old world.

===Gods===
Many gods were in the Everworld series.  Nearly all the gods shared similar characteristics such as shape shifting, physical perfection, superhuman strength and immortality. They could only be killed by the weapon of another god such as Thor's hammer Mjolnir or through severe injury. Even then, there is a chance they could heal. Real world weapons however do seem to harm gods. When the Sennites arrived with automatic weapons, they apparently killed Fenrir. Many of the gods had special powers related to their field and some were radically more powerful than others. Nearly all of them were portrayed as being cold and cruel in their attitude toward humans if not outright insane due to their power and long lives and would rather carry on their petty squabbles from ancient times. Most are slow to change or act unless they feel immediately threatened allowing the threat of the Hetwan to grow. The gods in Everworld included:
*[[Greek gods|Greek]]
**[[Zeus]]
**[[Athena]]
**[[Apollo]]
**[[Artemis]]
**[[Ares]]
**[[Dionysus]]
**[[Hercules|Heracles]]
**[[Hera]]

**[[God of Fire]]
''This list is not complete''

===Vikings===
The Vikings are very similar to their real world counterparts, but in many ways are easier to relate to than other groups of people. A mixture of farmers, craftsmen and warriors that glorify battle, but are trustworthy allies.  Among the peoples of Everworld they are easy to get along with and motivate into needed action instead of bickering amongst themselves. They are also the most cosmopolitan of Everworld humans, as they readily accept people of other races into their ranks (African, Asian, etc.) They worshiped Loki for an unknown period of time when he overthrew Odin and other major gods such as Thor and Balder disappeared.

===Aztecs===
The [[Aztecs]], in their ''Everworld'' incarnation, are portrayed as an utterly savage and barbaric society. They are first encountered at the end of the first book, ''Search for Senna''. The [[Aztecs]] are known by many names in Everworld, including "The Blood-Drinkers," "The Mexica," and "The Heart Eaters." Some groups worship [[Huitzilopoctli]], while others worship [[Quetzalcoatl]].

===Coo-Hatch===
The Coo-Hatch are strange creatures from an alien world who abandoned their gods after their God of the Flame and Goddess of the Ore brought them to Everworld against their will. A majority of the Coo-Hatch seem to be disillusioned by their deities and Everworld and want to go back to their realm. They often ally themselves with whomever they believe can achieve this goal. They have large red eyes with blue pupils, two main arms as well as two smaller arms that have more dexterity and are on the sides of their faces. Their mouths are long and tapered. Juvenile Coo-Hatch are small and flighted with needle-like mouths. The juveniles are very fast fliers, covering a space of 20 feet in the length of a human blink.

The Coo-Hatch are also master metal forgers and can create blades sharp enough to cut through any known material; they use this skill to make small, accurate throwing blades and metal tools. In exchange of April's chemistry book, the Coo-Hatch improve Jalil's pocket knife to their quality of metal, giving them a small blade that can cut through anything, the group dubbing it "Excalibur". The Coo-Hatch had no knowledge of guns or explosives prior to the exchange. The Coo-Hatch used the textbook to develop primitive cannons. The Coo-Hatch then aided the Hetwans in almost taking over Mt. Olympus. Later, some of the tribes of the Coo-Hatch team up with the protagonists and develop cannons to use in an assault on the Hetwans (which supposedly takes place after the series end).

Their one true desire is to go back to their forges on their home world, which they cannot do without a gateway like Senna or her mother. Though this plot was not built upon later in the series, Senna's mother was sought out to send them back to their world.

===Hetwan===
The Hetwan are large, sentient insectoid aliens that seem to exist as a collective hive rather than as a group of individuals. Male Hetwan consist of two arms, a pair of wings, fly-like eyes, and three constantly moving claws near their mouths. The claws are used to grasp a tube that is then used to project the Hetwan's [[acidic]] [[saliva]]. They continue moving at a slower pace after death. Female Hetwan are flying translucent sacks of organs. They travel in packs, where, upon encountering male Hetwan, they are savagely torn apart, thus birthing perhaps a dozen Hetwan on the waist of the male.

The Hetwan worship [[Ka Anor]], the dread god of terror, and serve his will to devour all the gods in Everworld. Though aliens, the Hetwan have no high-tech weaponry. They do, however, wield devices similar to long straws (nicknamed "Super-Soakers" by the main characters), out of which they shoot a burning, venomous acid.  The Hetwan themselves seem to feel no fear of death or anything.  As repeatedly stated by them they exist merely to serve Ka Anor and are absolutely loyal to him.

The Hetwan live in a great city that resembles a giant needle sticking out of a pit (referred to by Chris as "Junkie Dreamland"), with an assortment of strange creatures from their home world.

The main characters often fight against the Hetwan. Because Ka Anor intends to eventually kill and consume all of Everworld's gods, most of the peoples of Everworld would be considered enemies of the Hetwan, although they generally seek to appease them out of fear of destruction.

Little is known about the Hetwans' life before Everworld, but like all alien species (those not from [[human]] [[mythology]]), they were brought there from another world (not "our" world) by their particular deity, the dread-god Ka Anor. They then began to conquer everything they came across, while collecting [[deity|gods]] for their deity to consume. The Hetwan kingdom in Everworld alternates between perfectly hemispherical hills and gullies, giving a scooped-out appearance. The alien trees make strange musical sounds.  The Hetwan capital, where Ka Anor resides, is a massive tower (dubbed "Junkie Dream Mountain" for its needle-like appearance) in the middle of a lava and glass filled crater.  The only transportation across this gulf is by means of the "Red Wings", giant insects that can carry passengers.

===Knights===
The knights are classic men of [[chivalry]]. Self-described as "creatures of myth and legend", their main pastimes seem to be slaying [[dragons]], rescuing young girls, and feasting. Despite witnessing April taking out several [[trolls]], the knights still believe that women should act "womanly"—no fighting, allowing themselves to be looked over and pampered. They are very brave and value honor highly. The knights met in the series were all surviving members of the Knights of the Round Table such as [[Galahad]].  While they had not aged since entering Everworld they lack the immortality of many other beings.  Merlin is often allied with these beings.

===Eunuchs===
The [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] in Everworld are male warriors with big, muscular bodies but with high-pitched voices; this is because they were [[castration|castrated]] before they reached [[puberty]].

The symbol on their breastplates is a bloody dagger with two red diamonds. They always say "jewels" when referring to [[testicles]]. The eunuchs guard the City of [[Hel (being)|Hel]] (known only as "Her City"), kidnapping men to inhabit it as Hel's personal harem. (Why Hel's harem requires eunuchs is never explained, but perhaps indicates that her powers over or interest in castrated males is reduced or nonexistent.)

===Fairies===
The fairies share some characteristics with the wood [[nymphs]]. Like nymphs, they are about four feet tall and rather thin. Fairies can move quickly when necessary, though not as quickly as nymphs can. Unlike the fairies commonly portrayed, they do not have wings. Their typical attire is a leather [[tunic]] and a tight [[helmet]], and their main weapons are [[arrow]]s and [[sword]]s. Different colored tunics signify different jobs within Fairy Land; for example, a fairy wearing a dark blue tunic is part of the fairy version of the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and goes around making notes on the various stands within the city, while a fairy in a black tunic is part of the police force.

Fairies in Everworld, also called "[[leprechauns]]", are known for their cupidity---Fairy Land, which is very pristine and clean compared to other parts of Everworld, serves as a kind of economic center for the entire world. It has a King and Queen; though it is unclear who has official power, the Queen is portrayed as the brains of the two.

===Greeks===
In the books, the [[Greeks]] are battling the [[Hetwan]] to keep [[Ka Anor]] from conquering [[Mount Olympus]].  They live in the land surrounding the Everworld equivalent of Mt. Olympus.  They worship [[Zeus]] along with the other Olympian gods such as, [[Ares]], [[Hera]], and [[Athena]].  Among the gods of Everworld, Olympus is implied to be one of the most powerful places due to the large number of gods living there. Athena is one of the few gods who not only acts in a sane manner, but also aides the protagonists in their quest.

===Egyptians===
The [[Egyptians]] are a reactionary race living along the [[Nile]]. Due to centuries of ritual and inbreeding the Egyptian culture became weak. The [[Amazons]], led by Pretty Little Flower used this to their advantage and proceeded to subjugate and loot Egypt. This ended when the crocodile god [[Sobek]] freed the capital and killed Pretty Little Flower, becoming Lord of all Egypt. The rest of the Egyptian gods had become living statues due to their long lives and dedication to ritual.

===Dwarves===
[[norse dwarves|Dwarves]] are a mountain dwelling race. Dwarves stand about four feet tall with extremely stocky builds. Most dwarves have long hair and beards. They are generally seen with chainmail and some sort of weapon. While most dwarves seen are men, often women are mistaken for men, due to their masculine appearance. They are skilled in both mining and blacksmithing.

The dwarves are led by King Baldwin, who resides in his capital of Daggermouth. Beneath Daggermouth is a mining complex known as the Five Hills, each of which produce a different kind of metal. They are known to have close relations to the [[Vikings]], as is evidenced by their metalwork in Viking ships, as well as their reverence for [[Thor]] and [[Baldur]].

===Mermaids===
Mermaids are ruled by [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]. In the book, there are Mermen as well. The Mermen act as guards and are part of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'s army. The Mermaids swim around topless, and much to Christopher's delight, their hair rarely manages to cover their nudity.  They live underwater in the Roman version of Atlantis.

===Atlanteans===
A technologically advanced race living under the Everworld's ocean. They are led by Jean-Claude LeMieux, who serves as mayor of the city.  There is Roman and a Greek version of the city.

===Irish===
In the books, the [[Irish people|Irish]] have embraced [[technology]] faster than any other people; in one of their cities, they have [[electricity]] and [[cable cars]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}. This is believed to come to some degree from the telegraph that the main characters brought to Everworld, but also from the goddess Brigid. Their knowledge also may have come from the [[Druids]], who are ordered by colors; the "yellow" druids being those in the study of electricity and technology. The lands of the [[Irish people|Irish]] are protected by the Fiannans, a special order of knights.  They are ruled by a number of kings who are ruled by a high king.  Merlin is closely allied with them and they attribute his wisdom to maintaining peace in their land for over two hundred years.

===Sennites===
The Sennites are a group of [[white supremacy|white supremacists]] Senna brought over from the real world. With modern weapons, they are a force to be reckoned with. At the beginning of the final book, ''Entertain the End'', with Senna dead, David and the others wonder if the Sennites might forge an alliance with [[Ka Anor]]; this forces the four to make a deal with the gods in order to stem the threat.

{{other uses|Exposition (disambiguation)}}

'''Narrative exposition''' is the insertion of important background information within a [[narrative|story]]; for example, information about the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]], characters' [[backstory|backstories]], prior plot events, historical context, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= |year=2009|title=Kaplan SAT Subject Test: Literature 2009–2010 Edition|publisher=Kaplan Publishing|page=60|isbn=1-4195-5261-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a specifically literary context, exposition appears in the form of [[expository writing]] embedded within the narrative. Exposition is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] (also known as ''modes of discourse''), along with [[description]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[narrative mode|narration]], as elucidated by [[Alexander Bain]] and John Genung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Carlota S.|title=Modes of Discourse: The Local Structure of Texts|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78169-5|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/?id=okPPSq1G1OQC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=Bain+and+genung#v=onepage&amp;q=Bain%20and%20genung&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the rhetorical modes is present in a variety of forms, and each has its own purpose and [[Convention (norm)|conventions]]. There are several ways to accomplish exposition.

&lt;!-- THIS SECTION ACTUALLY IS ABOUT "INCLUING"—NOT "INCLUDING."  PLEASE READ THE ARTICLE BEFORE EDITING. --&gt;
'''Indirect exposition''', sometimes called '''incluing''', is a technique of [[worldbuilding]] in which the reader is gradually exposed to background information about the world in which a story is set. The idea is to ''clue'' the readers in to the world the author is building without them being aware of it. This can be done in a number of ways: through [[Dialogue in writing|dialogues]], [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], characters' thoughts,&lt;ref name="Dibell 1988 51" /&gt; background details, [[in-universe]] media,&lt;ref name="Morrell 2006 64"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing|first=Jessica Page|last=Morrell |publisher=Writer's Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|page=64|year=2006|isbn=978-1-58297-393-7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the narrator telling a [[backstory]].&lt;ref name="Dibell 1988 51"&gt;{{cite book|title=Plot|first=Ansen|last=Dibell|publisher=Writer’s Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, OH|year= 1988|isbn=0-89879-303-3|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|title=Building Better Plots|first=Robert|last=Kernen|publisher=Writer’s Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, Ohio|page=51|year=1999|isbn=0-89879-903-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of saying "I am a woman", a first person narrator can say "I kept the papers inside my purse." The reader (in most English-speaking cultures) now knows the character is probably female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rachelsimon.com/wwg_exposition_v2.php The Writer's Writing Guide: Exposition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect exposition has always occurred in storytelling incidentally, but is first clearly identified, in the modern literary world, in the writing of [[Rudyard Kipling]]. In his stories set in [[India]] like ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', Kipling was faced with the problem of Western readers not knowing the culture and environment of that land, so he gradually developed the technique of explaining through example. But this was relatively subtle, compared to Kiplings' [[science fiction]] stories, where he used the technique much more obviously and necessarily, to explain an entirely fantastic world unknown to any reader, in his [[Aerial Board of Control]] universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=234 Rudyard Kipling Invented SF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kipling's writing influenced other science fiction writers, most notably the "Dean of Science Fiction", [[Robert A. Heinlein#Writing style|Robert Heinlein]], who became known for his advanced rhetorical and storytelling techniques, including indirect exposition. 

The word ''incluing'' is attributed to fantasy and science fiction author [[Jo Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michelle Bottorff|url=http://www.lshelby.com/rasfcFAQ.html|title=rec.arts.sf.composition Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Lshelby.com|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She defined it as "the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html|title=papersky: Thud: Half a Crown &amp; Incluing|publisher=Papersky.livejournal.com|date= |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Information dump" (or info-dump) is the term given for overt exposition, which writers want to avoid.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=James Scott|title=Write Great Fiction – Plot &amp; Structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL1MCUXmqdcC&amp;pg=PT78|date=22 September 2004|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=978-1-58297-684-6|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;=http://www.screenplayology.com/content-sections/screenplay-form-content/3-3/&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''idiot lecture'', characters tell each other information that needs to be explained for the purpose of the audience, but of which the characters in-universe would already be aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Ashmead|author2=Darrell Schweitzer|author3=George H.

'''Forensic art''' is any [[art]] used in [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or [[legal process|legal proceedings]]. Forensic art is used to assist law enforcement with the visual aspects of a case, often using witness descriptions and video footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forensicfaces.weebly.com/what-is-forensic-art.html|title=What is Forensic Art? - Forensic Faces Institute|website=forensicfaces.weebly.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a highly specialised field that covers a wide range of artistic skills, such as [[Facial composite|composite drawing]], crime scene sketching, [[image modification]] and identification, courtroom drawings, demonstrative evidence, and postmortem and facial approximation aids. It is rare for a forensic artist to specialise in more than one of these skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiai.org/disciplines/art/history.php|title=History of the I.A.I. Forensic Art Discipline|website=www.theiai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a breakdown of different skills and what they involve:
* &lt;u&gt;'''Composite Drawing:'''&lt;/u&gt; the main objective is to help investigators generate leads based on physical descriptions. This is usually drawn by hand; an artist who is trained in interviewing victims and witnesses uses the information provided to draw what is described.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/article/2004/12/forensic-art-defined-and-explained|title=Forensic Art Defined and Explained|date=2004-12-01|work=Forensic Magazine|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composite art produces a single, graphic image that is designed to be a likeness or similarity of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-artist/|title=Forensic Artist Job Description, Education Requirements and Salary Expectations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Image Modification:&lt;/u&gt;''' this is used to change and enhance a photograph in order to help an investigator and/or trial attorney. Examples of this include age progression/regression (see below),&lt;ref name="p1698608879"&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1698608879&lt;/ref&gt; and the clarifying of images, such as from CCTV footage, to identify an individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Image Identification:&lt;/u&gt;''' this is the recording a person's distinguishing features for future reference. Investigators can use this tool to identify suspects who attempts to change their appearance to evade capture, as well as in the study of cold cases in which individuals may have changed their appearance since the event.&lt;ref name="p1698608879" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Crime Scene Sketching:&lt;/u&gt;''' the drawing of a crime scene; in the sketch, an investigator includes measurements and dimensions to aid in displaying the layout of the scene. This helps support the information shown in photographs of the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evidencemagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=184|title=Evidence Technology Magazine – Documenting the Crime Scene|last=MAYO|first=KRISTI|website=www.evidencemagazine.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Demonstrative Evidence:&lt;/u&gt;''' any visible, physical evidence used in legal proceedings. These are used to demonstrate aspects of the case, reconstruct an event, and illustrate what happened. There are two categories of demonstrative evidence; court displays and investigative aids.&lt;ref name="p1698608879" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Postmortem Drawing:&lt;/u&gt;''' when an artist either looks at a deceased person's photograph or their remains to help identify who the person is and what they looked like prior to their death. This helps most in cases where the body is too damaged by an accident or decomposition.&lt;ref name="p1698608879" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Age Progression/Regression&lt;/u&gt;''': useful to determine what a person's appeearance before or after a period of time. This is most commonly used in missing persons cases or during cold cases when investigators need an idea of what an individual looked like years prior to or following the investigation.
* '''&lt;u&gt;Forensic Sculpture&lt;/u&gt;''': this is used to create three-dimensional models, usually using the skull of the victims. Other features are added such as fake eyes and wigs to add realism. This process can also inform the investigators of certain characteristics of the victim - such as age, race, and gender - through a detailed knowledge of the intricacies of skeletal structure and other corresponding features such as dental records. It is later photograph and used like postmortem and composite drawings. However, because forensic sculpture relies heavily on assumptions made by the artist, it is not considered a legally recognised technique for positive identification, and is thus used in an advisory capacity only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Helmer et al. Assessment of the Reliability of Facial Reconstruction|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Collaboration:'''&lt;/u&gt; forensic artists, anthropologists and other professions are used to help determine the age, sex, and race of an identified skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/lab/forensic-science-communications/fsc/jan2001/taister.htm|title=Book Review of Forensic Art and Illustration (by Taylor), by Taister (Forensic Science Communications, January 2001)|last=Taister|first=Karen T. Taylor, Taylor, Michael A. Taister,|work=FBI|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many forensic artists do the job as a collateral duty to their "regular" job in law enforcement, such as police officer, crime scene tech, etc. Such forensic artists perform their work while on a fixed salary and are not additionally compensated for artistic duties. There are few full-time forensic artist jobs available. Most full-time artists work in large cities, or in state or federal agencies. "Freelancing" in forensic art is a difficult career path, as ties to law enforcement are a necessary part of the job, and agencies have limited budgets to pay outside contractors.

The skill of '''facial approximation''' is closely associated and related to [[forensic anthropology]] in that an artist specializes in the reconstruction of the remains of a human body. Generally this discipline focuses on the human face for identification purposes. The forensic artist can create a facial approximation in a number of ways to include 2D ([[drawing]]s), 3D ([[sculpture]]s) and other methods using new computer technology. Forensic artists generally can add greater character and make their subjects come back to "life".

== Methods of Manual 3d construction ==
* Anthropometric was a method developed by [[Wilton M. Krogman]] in 1946 .&lt;ref name="ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=110682508&amp;site=ehost-livepose-methods.html|title=What is Anthropometric Measurement? - Tools, Purpose &amp; Methods – Video &amp; Lesson Transcript |website=study.com|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Facial muscles are recorded by a highly trained professional. This job is particularly tedious, which is why most do not use this method.
* Computerized 3d forensic facial reconstruction- manual model clay techniques are used within this method. Computer systems vary, in that some computerized systems used 3D animation software to model the face onto the skull, while other systems use a virtual sculpture system with Haptic feedback&lt;ref name="ebscohost.com" /&gt;
* Haptic Feedback- The ability to feel the surface of the skull during analysis and also provide important skeletal details for facial reconstruction such as muscle attachment strength, position of eye, position of malar tubercle etc.&lt;ref name="ebscohost.com" /&gt;

== Face model creation ==
When creating a face model, the forensic artist looks at whether the person is masculine or feminine, as well as their skin tone, age, wrinkles, freckles, the shadow of the beard, and attractiveness. There are three segments that they examine: 
* Face shape: round, narrow, heart shape, high/low cheeks, high/low chin, double chin, the distance between lips and nose.
* Eyes: round, upwards/downwards, the distance of eyeballs, eye color, thin/thick eyebrows, high/low arch brow, distance between both eyebrows, distance between eyebrows and eyes.
* Hair: the 3D models have not been programmed to be used with hair, therefore, hair cannot be used the same way as facial attributes. A profile and frontal image of a person is used where 5 to 15 different key features of each hairstyle are selected. These different hairstyles features are from a database used by these professionals. The styles are put into the system where the algorithm automatically estimates the structure of the face. The system is also able to depict different shade of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=23414201&amp;site=ehost-live|title=EBSCOhost Login|website=search.ebscohost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Becoming a Forensic Artist ==
To qualify for a professional certification for forensic arts - such as the Forensic Art Certification, which is provided through the [https://www.theiai.org/certifications/artist/index.php International Association for Identification] - applicants can focus on one or more of the three available categories of professional designation: composite imaging, facial reconstruction, and image enhancement/age progression,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and must: 
* have at least 80 hours of IAI-approved forensic art training&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-artist/|title=Forensic Artist Job Description, Education Requirements and Salary Expectations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have at least 40 hours of related workshops, lectures, and short program training
* have at least 2 years of experience as forensic arts
* provide at least 30 forensic art examples that include age progressions, composites, and reconstructions
* have a portfolio that demonstrates their forensic art techniques (must include at least 10 forensic art images that were prepared for law enforcement investigation cases)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-artist/|title=Forensic Artist Job Description, Education Requirements, and Salary Expectations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greta Zimmer Friedman''' (born '''Grete Zimmer'''; June 5, 1924&amp;nbsp;– September 8, 2016) was an Austrian-born American who was photographed being kissed by a stranger, a Navy [[sailor]], in the iconic ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]]'' photograph of 1945 by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life magazine]]'' photographer [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/11/greta-zimmer-friedman-dies-kissed-sailor-world-war/|title=Greta Zimmer Friedman dies; kissed sailor in World War II iconic photo|last=|first=|date=September 11, 2016|website=The Washington Times|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely misattributed as being a photograph of a nurse, she was actually a dental assistant with a similar uniform.

==Early life and education==
[[File:1939 Passport.jpg|thumb|1939 passport issued by the government of Austria for "Grete Sara Zimmer," the middle name added by national socialist decree]]

She was born Grete Zimmer on June 5, 1924 to a Jewish family in [[Wiener Neustadt]], Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/nyregion/greta-friedman-who-claimed-to-be-the-nurse-in-a-famous-v-j-day-photo-dies-at-92.html|title=Greta Friedman, Who Claimed to Be the Nurse in a Famous V-J Day Photo, Dies at 92|last=Rosenberg|first=Eli|date=September 10, 2016|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 15, Zimmer emigrated from Nazi-controlled Austria in 1939 with her younger sisters Josefin (Fini) and Bella; as Americans, Josefin became Josephine (Jo), while Grete and Bella traded the last letter of each name to become Greta and Belle. The eldest Zimmer sister Lily emigrated to Palestine, took the name Tirza, and remained in Israel after fighting in the 1948 War of Independence. Their parents, Max and Ida, unable to leave Europe, died in concentration camps during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2012/06/17/the-true-story-behind-the-iconic-v-j-day-sailor-and-nurse-smooch/|title=The true story behind the iconic V-J Day sailor and ‘nurse’ smooch|last=Callahan|first=Maureen|date=June 17, 2012|website=New York Post|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zimmer attended Queens Vocational High School, the Central High School of Needle Trades and the Harlem Evening High School. Supporting herself as a dental assistant, she then took classes at the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] (FIT) and studied costuming with the New School of Social Research's [[Dramatic Workshop]], led by [[Erwin Piscator]]. Later, while living in New York in the 1940s and 1950s, she variously worked in toy design and doll clothing, as well as early television with the [[Bil Baird]] puppets, and summer theater at the Camp [[Tamiment]] Playhouse. 

==''V-J Day in Times Square''==
On VJ Day, August 14, 1945, Friedman had left work at the dentists' office dressed in her uniform and was celebrating the end of World War II in [[Times Square]] when a stranger dressed in a Navy sailor's uniform grabbed her and kissed her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Photographer [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]], who was in Times Square documenting the celebration, captured the moment with his [[Leica Camera|Leica]]. The resulting photograph, ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]]'', was first published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1945 with the caption, "In New York's Times Square a white-clad girl clutches her purse and skirt as an uninhibited sailor plants his lips squarely on hers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/greta-friedman-woman-in-times-square-kiss-photo-dead-at-92-w438994|title=Greta Friedman, Woman in Iconic Times Square Kiss Photo, Dead at 92|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=|website=Rolling Stone|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Eisenstaedt took the photo, he failed to get any personal information from his subjects leaving their identities unknown for decades. In the ensuing years, many women claimed to be the woman in the photo. Friedman eventually saw the photo again the 1960s and instantly recognized herself. She wrote to ''Life'' magazine and provided additional photos to verify her identity.
''Life'' editors did not contact her until 1980 when, after researching and analysis, confirmed that Friedman was the woman in the photograph.&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lewis |first1=Danny |title=The Woman in the Iconic V-J Day Kiss Photo Died at 92, Here’s Her Story |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/woman-iconic-v-j-photo-died-age-92-heres-her-story-180960435/ |website=Smithsonian.com |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |accessdate=August 27, 2018 |date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''V-J Day in Times Square'' went on to become an iconic photo that was generally viewed
as a celebratory and romantic photograph, Friedman had mixed feelings about it.&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt; "It wasn’t my choice to be kissed," Friedman stated in a 2005 interview with the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="consent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.42863/transcript?ID=sr0001|title=Interview Transcript: Greta Zimmer Friedman: Veterans History Project (Library of Congress)|last=Redmond|first=Patricia|date=August 23, 2005|website=American Memory|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The guy just came over and grabbed!" she said, adding, "That man was very strong.

==Synopsis==
Owen Suskind was a boy of considerable promise, until he's diagnosed with autism at the age of 3. As Owen withdrew into his silent state, his parents almost lost hope that he would find some way to meaningfully interact with his world. However, that way was found through animated films, especially ones by Walt Disney Pictures, which provided Owen a way to understand the world through its stories to the point of creating his own and grew obsessed with despite also owning some non-Disney movies, too. This film covers the life of Owen and how he manages to become as functional as possible with the help of Disney and his family to the point of having his own life. However, Owen soon learns as well that there is more to real life than what Disney can illustrate in animation even as his family prepares itself for an uncertain future with him. He gains and loses Emily who was his girlfriend because he got into her personal space according to her.

Roger refers to it as "the day I made the lawyers cry" after the end of the presentation. The films selected for the film were "100% Suskind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/life-animated-director-secured-rights-classic-disney-characters/|title='Life, Animated' Director on How They Secured the Rights to Use Classic Disney Characters|date=15 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 94% approval rating based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Life, Animated offers a heartwarming look at one family's journey, and a fascinating message that's more than enough to outweigh its unanswered questions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/life_animated/|title=Life, Animated (2016)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 75 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/life-animated/|title=Life, Animated|work=Metacritic|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s critic Lanre Bakare praised the film and said, "It's a beguiling mix of animated storytelling and narration that doesn't flinch from exploring the emotional highs and lows that accompany a life with autism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Animated review – how Disney films helped a boy with autism|url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/29/life-animated-review-how-disney-films-helped-a-boy-with-autism|last=Bakare |first=Lanre|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=January 29, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]] of ''[[LA Times]]'' lauded the film and said, "[Williams] spent two years on this project, and the trust everyone involved placed in him allowed for an emotional honesty that is ''Life, Animated''{{'}}s greatest strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Life, Animated' follows an autistic boy's astonishing journey back to the world with the help of Disney movies|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-life-animated-review-20160627-snap-story.html|last=Turan|first=Kenneth |publisher=''LA Times''|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Justin Chang wrote, "This latest film from [[Roger Ross Williams]] ("God Loves Uganda") teems with insights into how children's fantasy can and can't bridge a developmental gap, but works on an even more basic, emotional level as a warm testament to a family's love and resilience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Review: 'Life, Animated'|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/life-animated-review-1201699114/|last=Chang|first=Justin|publisher=''Variety''|date=February 6, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Duane Byrge called it "a documentary gem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Life, Animated': Sundance Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/life-animated-sundance-review-859879|last=Byrge|first=Duane|publisher=''The Hollywood Reporter''|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' positively reviewed the series and said, "''Life, Animated'' makes fascinating points, about the power of cinema, about meeting our loved ones where they are and, as Ron says, about who gets to decide what constitutes a meaningful life"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Life, Animated': A young man's obsession with Disney helps him navigate autism |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/life-animated-a-young-mans-obsession-with-disney-helps-him-navigate-autism/2016/07/07/7852a6c4-3e0d-11e6-80bc-d06711fd2125_story.html |last=Hornaday|first=Ann|publisher=''The Washington Post''|date=July 7, 2016| accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s chief film critic [[Peter Travers]] said, "In no way does Owen's story claim to be a cure-all. Instead of false hope, it offers up possibility, the chance of a stimulus that might get past the blocks of developmental disorder. That's more than encouraging. Life, Animated is truly inspirational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Animated A young autistic man connects to the world through Disney movies in this inspiring doc|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/life-animated-20160628|last=Travers|first=Peter|publisher= ''The Rolling Stone''|date=Jul 1, 2016| accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', [[Noel Murray]] said, "On the list of Disney-related 2016 releases about child-rearing and handicaps, this one goes just above "Finding Dory." What it lacks in wacky hijinks, it makes up in hard truths."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A love of Disney helps an autistic adult understand the world in Life, Animated|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/love-disney-helps-autistic-adult-understand-world--238829| last=Murray |first =Noel |publisher=''The A.V. Club''|date=June 29, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing for ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'' film critic Sheila O'Malley wrote, "Powerful and emotional, without being manipulative. It is deeply inspiring, without trying to be. It is honest about Owen's struggles, and the struggles of his family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Animated, Review|url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/life-animated-2016| last= O'Malley |first=Sheila|publisher=''RogerEbert.com''|date=Jul 1, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s, Joe McGovern also lauded the series saying, "The Suskinds' humongous hearts are obviously in the right place and their openness is to be admired and encouraged - even if a book, more than a movie, remains the better venue to fairly and honestly tell Owen's extraordinary story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Animated, EW Review |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/06/30/life-animated-ew-review/|last=McGovern|first=Joe |publisher=''Entertainment Weekly''|date=June 30, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle Smith of ''[[New York Post]]'' explained, "''Life, Animated'' oversimplifies the situation, contriving to use endless clips from Disney movies to make a case that movie magic really can better people's lives. Unfortunately, by the end of the movie it's clear that Disney can't help Owen negotiate sex, breakups or many other challenges he faces as an adult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disney helps an autistic boy navigate life in this new doc|url=https://nypost.com/2016/06/30/disney-helps-an-autistic-boy-navigate-life-in-this-new-doc/|last=Smith|first=Kyle|publisher=''New York Post''|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publications however were more critical towards the film. In a lukewarm review of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' David Parkinson wrote, "A touch twee at times, but the use of classic and original animation is admirable, while Owen emerges as the king of sidekicks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Animated Empie Review|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/life-animated/review/|last=Parkinson|first=David|publisher=''Empire'' |date=December 12, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said, "Owen has made immense progress, to which Life, Animated is a stirring tribute, yet it leaves a trail of questions unanswered or unasked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Cafe Society" and "Life, Animated" Reviews|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/cafe-society-and-life-animated-reviews|last=Lane|first=Anthony|publisher=''The New Yorker'' |date=July 4, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}s Jeannette Catsoulis quipped, "Belaboring the cartoon connection, the director leaves the family struggles that enrich Mr. Suskind's 2014 book of the same title stubbornly veiled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: In 'Life, Animated,' a Bound Mind Finds Freedom|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/movies/review-life-animated.html|last=Catsoulis |first=Jeannette |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a less enthusiastic review for ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' Clayton Dillard stated, "It never addresses Disney's wholly manufactured stranglehold on turning adolescent desire into a consumerist impulse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Review: Life, Animated |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/life-animated|last=Clayton|first=Dillard|publisher=''Slant Magazine'' |date=June 27, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3926">This is a list of American artist printmaking societies and '''[[Printmaking society|print clubs]]''' in chronological order of their founding. Note: The purpose of this timeline is to focus on the organization of artist printmakers into societies, and not to focus on clubs of collectors. The distinction between "society" and "club" is not necessarily reflected in the name of the organization nor in the inclusion of an organization in this list.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4168">[[Book store|Booksellers]] use standard terms to describe the condition of the used [[book]]s that they sell. The set of terms below were proposed in 1949 by [[AB Bookman's Weekly]]. They were adopted by the bookselling community and are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Chernofsky 1991 p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollowell 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/rarebooks/bookbasics.html#condition |title=Rare books basics |publisher=Powell's City of Books |accessdate=October 11, 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027043550/http://www.powells.com/rarebooks/bookbasics.html#condition |archivedate=October 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*&lt;span id=As New&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''As New''' is self-explanatory. It means that the book is in the state that it should have been in when it left the publisher. This is the equivalent of [[Mint condition]] in [[numismatics]].
*&lt;span id=Fine&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''Fine''' (F or FN) is As New but allowing for the normal effects of time on an unused book that has been protected. A fine book shows no damage.
*&lt;span id=Very Good&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''Very Good''' (VG) describes a book that is worn but untorn. For many collectors this is the minimum acceptable condition for all but the rarest items. Any defects must be noted.
*&lt;span id=Good&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''Good''' (G) describes the condition of an average used worn book that is complete. Any defects must be noted.
*&lt;span id=Good&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''Fair''' shows wear and tear but all the text pages and illustrations or maps are present. It may lack endpapers, half-title, and even the title page. All defects must be noted.
*&lt;span id=Good&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''Poor''' describes a book that has the complete text but is so damaged that it is only of interest to a buyer who seeks a reading copy.  If the damage renders the text illegible then the book is not even ''poor''.
*&lt;span id=Ex-library&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''Ex-library''' copies must always be designated as such ''no matter what the condition of the book''.
*&lt;span id=Book Club&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''Book Club''' copies must always be designated as such ''no matter what the condition of the book''.
*&lt;span id=Binding Copy&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''Binding Copy''' describes a book in which the pages or leaves are perfect, but the binding is very bad, loose, off or non-existent.

In all cases, the lack of a dust jacket should be noted if the book was issued with one. The same applies to other possible accessories, such as inlays (like [[errata]] lists, cards, photo prints, &lt;!-- rarely seen, but existed: --&gt;[[Printed circuit board|PCB]]s), foldouts (like maps), media (like [[diskette]]s, [[CD]]s, [[DVD]]s) etc. There is no standard term for books in a condition below poor. Their normal fate is to be discarded or to be broken into individual pages if these have any value.

== After the Internet begins ==

With the advent of the internet AB Bookman's Weekly magazine declined and its place was taken by the internet listing services starting with [[Alibris|Interloc]] in 1994. These services, for their own purposes, have made  modifications to this list. [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] adds the terms "acceptable", for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161242#CSCG | title=Amazon book conditions | accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magnet Hill''' is a "Cyclops [[gravity hill|hill]]" located near [[Leh|Leh]] in [[Ladakh]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eureka4you.com/magnetichillworldwide/Leh-JK.htm|title=Magnetic Hill Leh, Jammu &amp; Kashmir|access-date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout of the area and surrounding slopes create the appearance of a hill. The hill road is actually a downhill road. Objects and cars on the hill road may appear to roll uphill in defiance of gravity when they are, in fact, rolling downhill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NOTHING MAGNETIC ABOUT MAGNETIC HILL|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/others/sci-tech/Nothing-magnetic-about-Magnetic-Hill/articleshow/48299466.cms|date=31 July 2015|access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other two such magnetic hills are in [[Gujarat]]. One is near [[Bhuj]] ([[Kalo Dungar|Kalo dungar]] - the black hills) and other at [[Tulsishyam|Tulsi Shyam]].

He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the U.S. and Canada before moving to the [[University of Toronto]] in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life.

== Life and career ==
Herbert Marshall McLuhan was born on July 21, 1911, in [[Edmonton]], Alberta, to Elsie Naomi ([[married and maiden names|née]] Hall) and Herbert Ernest McLuhan, both born in Canada. His brother Maurice was born two years later. "Marshall" was his maternal grandmother's surname. His mother was a [[Baptist]] school teacher who later became an actress; his father was a [[Methodism|Methodist]] and had a real estate business in Edmonton. That business failed when [[World War I]] broke out, and McLuhan's father enlisted in the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian army]]. After a year of service, he contracted [[influenza]] and remained in Canada, away from the front lines. After his discharge from the army in 1915, the McLuhan family moved to [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, where Marshall grew up and went to school, attending [[Kelvin High School|Kelvin Technical School]] before enrolling in the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Manitoba, McLuhan explored his conflicted relationship with religion and turned to literature to "gratify his soul's hunger for truth and beauty,"&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edan, Tina (2003). [http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/1977/1/MQ77929.pdf "St Marshall, Mass and the Media: Catholicism, Media Theory and Marshall McLuhan"], p. 10. Retrieved 2010-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; later referring to this stage as [[agnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edan (2003), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; After studying for one year as an engineering student, he changed majors and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (1933), winning a University Gold Medal in Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (1997), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p.32&lt;/ref&gt; He took an [[Master of Arts|MA]] (1934) in [[English studies|English]] from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1934. He had long desired to pursue graduate studies in [[England]] and was accepted to the [[University of Cambridge]], having failed to secure a [[Rhodes scholarship]] to [[Oxford University|Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

He had already earned a BA and an MA degree at Manitoba, but Cambridge required him to enroll as an undergraduate "affiliated" student, with one year's credit towards a three-year bachelor's degree, before entering any doctoral studies.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 40; McLuhan later commented  "One advantage we Westerners have is that we're under no illusion we've had an education. That's why I started at the bottom again." Marchand (1990), p 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in the autumn of 1934, where he studied under [[I. A. Richards]] and [[F. R. Leavis]] and was influenced by [[New Criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reflection years afterward, he credited the faculty there with influencing the direction of his later work because of their emphasis on the ''training of perception'' and such concepts as Richards' notion of ''[[I. A. Richards#Feedforward|feedforward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, pp. 37–47.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies formed an important precursor to his later ideas on technological forms.&lt;ref name="LAC"&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/innis-mcluhan/ Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; He received the required bachelor's degree from Cambridge in 1936&lt;ref name="Gordon, p. 94"&gt;Gordon, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and entered their graduate program. Later, he returned from England to take a job as a teaching assistant at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] that he held for the 1936–37 academic year, being unable to find a suitable job in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

While studying the [[trivium]] at Cambridge, he took the first steps toward his eventual conversion to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt; founded on his reading of [[G. K. Chesterton]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis H. Lapham, Introduction to ''Understanding Media'' (First MIT Press Edition), p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, he wrote to his mother: "[H]ad I not encountered Chesterton, I would have remained agnostic for many years at least."&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. "Letter to Elsie McLuhan", September 5, 1935. Molinaro ''et alia'' (1987), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of March 1937,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p.74, gives the date as March 25; Marchand (1990), p.44, gives it as March 30.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan completed what was a slow but total conversion process, when he was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church. After consulting a minister, his father accepted the decision to convert. His mother, however, felt that his conversion would hurt his career and was inconsolable.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1990), pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan was devout throughout his life, but his religion remained a private matter.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1990), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a lifelong interest in the number three&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., the trivium, the [[Trinity]]) and sometimes said that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] provided intellectual guidance for him.&lt;ref&gt;Associates speculated about his intellectual connection to the Virgin Mary, one saying, "He had a direct connection with the Blessed Virgin Mary.... He alluded to it very briefly once, almost fearfully, in a please-don't-laugh-at-me tone. He didn't say, 'I know this because the Blessed Virgin Mary told me,' but it was clear from what he said that one of the reasons he was so sure about certain things was that the Virgin had certified his understanding of them." (cited in Marchand, p. 51).&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of his career, he taught in Roman Catholic institutions of higher education. From 1937 to 1944, he taught English at [[Saint Louis University]] (with an interruption from 1939–40 when he returned to Cambridge). There he taught courses on [[Shakespeare]]&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and tutored and befriended [[Walter J. Ong]], who went on to write his PhD dissertation on a topic that McLuhan had called to his attention, and who also became a well-known authority on communication and technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

McLuhan met Corinne Lewis in St. Louis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fitterman |first=Lisa |title=She was Marshall McLuhan's great love ardent defender, supporter and critic |work=Globe and Mail |date=2008-04-19 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080419.OBMCLUHAN19//TPStory/Obituaries |accessdate=2008-06-29 |location=Toronto |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205144146/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080419.OBMCLUHAN19/TPStory/Obituaries |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a teacher and aspiring actress from [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and they were married on August 4, 1939. They spent 1939–40 in Cambridge, where he completed his master's degree (awarded in January 1940)&lt;ref name="Gordon, p. 94" /&gt; and began to work on his doctoral dissertation on [[Thomas Nashe]] and the verbal arts. While the McLuhans were in England, [[World War II|war]] had broken out in Europe. For this reason, he obtained permission to complete and submit his dissertation from the United States, without having to return to Cambridge for an oral defence. In 1940, the McLuhans returned to Saint Louis University, where he continued teaching and they started a family. He was awarded a Ph.D. in December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  He next taught at [[Assumption University (Windsor)|Assumption College]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]] from 1944 to 1946, then moved to [[Toronto]] in 1946 where he joined the faculty of [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]], a Catholic college of the [[University of Toronto]]. [[Hugh Kenner]] was one of his students and Canadian economist and communications scholar [[Harold Innis]] was a university colleague who had a strong influence on his work.  McLuhan wrote in 1964: "I am pleased to think of my own book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of [[writing]] then of [[printing]]."&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. (2005) ''Marshall McLuhan Unbound.'' Corte Madera, CA : Gingko Press v. 8, p. 8. This is a reprint of McLuhan's introduction to the 1964 edition of Innis's book ''The Bias of Communication'' first published in 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, McLuhan began the Communication and Culture seminars at the University of Toronto, funded by the [[Ford Foundation]]. As his reputation grew, he received a growing number of offers from other universities and, to keep him, the university created the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology|Centre for Culture and Technology]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;  He published his first major work during this period: ''[[The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man|The Mechanical Bride]]'' (1951). The work was an examination of the effect of advertising on society and culture. He and [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund Carpenter]] also produced an important journal called ''Explorations'' throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Prins and Bishop 2002&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan and Carpenter have been characterized as the [[Toronto School of communication theory]], together with [[Harold Innis]], [[Eric A. Havelock]], and [[Northrop Frye]]. During this time, McLuhan supervised the doctoral thesis of modernist writer [[Sheila Watson (writer)|Sheila Watson]] on the subject of [[Wyndham Lewis]]. He remained at the University of Toronto through 1979, spending much of this time as head of his Centre for Culture and Technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

McLuhan was named to the [[Albert Schweitzer]] Chair in Humanities at [[Fordham University]] in the Bronx for one year (1967–68).&lt;ref&gt;During the time at Fordham University, his son [[Eric McLuhan]] conducted what came to be known as the [[Fordham Experiment]] about the different effects of "light-on" versus "light-through" media.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Fordham, he was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour, and it was treated successfully. He returned to Toronto where he taught at the University of Toronto for the rest of his life and lived in [[Wychwood Park]], a bucolic enclave on a hill overlooking the downtown where [[Anatol Rapoport]] was his neighbour.  In 1970, he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OCC|2180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the [[University of Dallas]] hosted him from April to May, appointing him to the McDermott Chair.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan (n.d.). [https://www.marshallmcluhan.com/biography/ "Marshall Who?"]. Retrieved 2018-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall and Corinne McLuhan had six children: [[Eric McLuhan|Eric]], twins Mary and Teresa, Stephanie, Elizabeth, and Michael. The associated costs of a large family eventually drove him to advertising work and accepting frequent consulting and speaking engagements for large corporations, IBM and AT&amp;T among them.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;  [[Woody Allen]]'s Oscar-winning motion picture ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977) featured McLuhan in a cameo as himself; a pompous academic arguing with Allen in a cinema queue is silenced by McLuhan suddenly appearing and saying, "You know nothing of my work."  This was one of McLuhan's most frequent statements to and about those who disagreed with him.&lt;ref&gt;''University of Toronto Bulletin'', 1979; Martin Friedland, ''The University of Toronto: A History'', University of Toronto Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1979, he suffered a stroke which affected his ability to speak. The University of Toronto's School of Graduate Studies tried to close his research centre shortly thereafter, but was deterred by substantial protests, most notably by Woody Allen. He never fully recovered from the stroke and died in his sleep on December 31, 1980.&lt;ref name=nytimesobituary&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitman|first=Alden|title=Marshall McLuhan, Author, Dies; Declared 'Medium Is the Message'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/02/home/mcluhan-obit.html|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major works ==
During his years at [[Saint Louis University]] (1937–1944), McLuhan worked concurrently on two projects: his doctoral [[doctoral thesis|dissertation]] and the manuscript that was eventually published in 1951 as the book ''The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man'', which included only a representative selection of the materials that McLuhan had prepared for it.

McLuhan's 1942 Cambridge University doctoral dissertation surveys the history of the verbal arts ([[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]]—collectively known as the [[trivium]]) from the time of [[Cicero]] down to the time of [[Thomas Nashe]].&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's doctoral dissertation from 1942 was published by [[Gingko Press]] in March 2006. Gingko Press also plans to publish the complete manuscript of items and essays that McLuhan prepared, only a selection of which were published in his book. With the publication of these two books a more complete picture of McLuhan's arguments and aims is likely to emerge.&lt;/ref&gt; In his later publications, McLuhan at times uses the Latin concept of the ''trivium'' to outline an orderly and systematic picture of certain periods in the history of Western culture. McLuhan suggests that the [[Late Middle Ages]], for instance, were characterized by the heavy emphasis on the formal study of logic. The key development that led to the [[Renaissance]] was not the rediscovery of ancient texts but a shift in emphasis from the formal study of logic to rhetoric and grammar. Modern life is characterized by the re-emergence of grammar as its most salient feature—a trend McLuhan felt was exemplified by the [[New Criticism]] of Richards and Leavis.&lt;ref&gt;For a nuanced account of McLuhan's thought regarding Richards and Leavis, see McLuhan's "Poetic and Rhetorical Exegesis: The Case for Leavis against Richards and Empson" in the ''Sewanee Review'', volume 52, number 2 (1944): 266–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Mechanical Bride'', McLuhan turned his attention to analysing and commenting on numerous examples of persuasion in contemporary [[popular culture]]. This followed naturally from his earlier work as both dialectic and rhetoric in the classical trivium aimed at persuasion. At this point his focus shifted dramatically, turning inward to study the influence of [[mass media|communication media]] independent of their content. His famous [[aphorism]] "[[the medium is the message]]" (elaborated in his 1964 book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'') calls attention to this intrinsic effect of communications media.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "the medium is the message" may be better understood in light of [[Bernard Lonergan]]'s further articulation of related ideas: at the empirical level of [[consciousness]], the medium is the message, whereas at the intelligent and rational levels of consciousness, the content is the message. This sentence uses Lonergan's terminology from ''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding'' to clarify the meaning of McLuhan's statement that "the medium is the message"; McLuhan read this when it was first published in 1957 and found "much sense" in it—in his letter of September 21, 1957, to his former student and friend, Walter J. Ong, S.J., McLuhan says, "Find much sense in Bern. Lonergan's ''Insight''" (''Letters of Marshall McLuhan'', 1987: 251). Lonergan's ''Insight'' is an extended guide to "making the inward turn": attending ever more carefully to one's own consciousness, reflecting on it ever more carefully, and monitoring one's articulations ever more carefully.  When McLuhan declares that he is more interested in [[percept]]s than [[concept]]s, he is declaring in effect that he is more interested in what Lonergan refers to as the empirical level of consciousness than in what Lonergan refers to as the intelligent level of consciousness in which concepts are formed, which Lonergan distinguishes from the rational level of consciousness in which the adequacy of concepts and of predications is adjudicated. This inward turn to attending to percepts and to the cultural conditioning of the empirical level of consciousness through the effect of communication media sets him apart from more outward-oriented studies of sociological influences and the outward presentation of self carried out by [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Peter L. Berger|Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann|Luckmann]], [[Kenneth Burke]], Hugh Duncan, and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan also started the journal ''Explorations'' with anthropologist [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund "Ted" Carpenter]]. In a letter to [[Walter Ong]] dated May 31, 1953, McLuhan reported that he had received a two-year grant of $43,000 from the Ford Foundation to carry out a communication project at the University of Toronto involving faculty from different disciplines, which led to the creation of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Plummer | first=Kevin | date=May 3, 2014 | title=Historicist: ''Explorations'' at the Vanguard of Communications Studies |  work=[[Torontoist]] | url=http://torontoist.com/2014/05/historicist-explorations-at-the-vanguard-of-communications-studies/ | access-date=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Fordham lecture in 1999, [[Tom Wolfe]] suggested that a major under-acknowledged influence on McLuhan's work is the Jesuit philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] whose ideas anticipated those of McLuhan, especially the evolution of the human mind into the "[[noosphere]]".&lt;ref name="TWolfe"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzBPmRPa7ls | title = Tom Wolfe on Media, Advertising, Technology (1999) | accessdate = 23 April 2017 | last = Wolfe | first = Tom | date = December 2015 | publisher = C-SPAN | quote = 45m}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, McLuhan warns against outright dismissing or whole-heartedly accepting de Chardin's observations early on in his second published book ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (p.&amp;nbsp;32): "This externalization of our senses creates what de Chardin calls the 'noosphere' or a technological brain for the world. Instead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as in an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and super-imposed co-existence."

In his private life, McLuhan wrote to friends saying: "I am not a fan of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The idea that anything is better because it comes later is surely borrowed from pre-electronic technologies." Further, McLuhan noted to a Catholic collaborator: "The idea of a Cosmic thrust in one direction ... is surely one of the lamest semantic fallacies ever bred by the word ‘evolution’ .... That development should have any direction at all is inconceivable except to the highly literate community."&lt;ref name="AChrystall"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://mro.massey.ac.nz/handle/10179/778 | title = The New American Vortex (2007)| accessdate = 24 Jun 2018 | last = Chrystall | first = Andrew | date = December 2007 | publisher = Massey University | quote = 467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Mechanical Bride'' (1951) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
McLuhan's first book, ''[[The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man]]'' (1951), is a pioneering study in the field now known as [[popular culture]]. His interest in the critical study of popular culture was influenced by the 1933 book ''Culture and Environment'' by [[F. R. Leavis]] and Denys Thompson, and the title ''The Mechanical Bride'' is derived from a piece by the [[Dada]]ist artist, [[Marcel Duchamp]].

Like his 1962 book ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', ''The Mechanical Bride'' is composed of a number of short essays that can be read in any order—what he styled the "mosaic approach" to writing a book. Each essay begins with a newspaper or magazine article or an advertisement, followed by McLuhan's analysis thereof. The analyses bear on aesthetic considerations as well as on the implications behind the imagery and text. McLuhan chose the ads and articles included in his book not only to draw attention to their symbolism and their implications for the corporate entities that created and disseminated them, but also to mull over what such advertising implies about the wider society at which it is aimed.

=== ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (1962) ===
McLuhan's ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy|The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man]]'' (written in 1961, first published in Canada by [[University of Toronto Press]] in 1962) is a pioneering study in the fields of [[orality|oral culture]], [[print culture]], [[cultural studies]], and [[media ecology]].

Throughout the book, McLuhan takes pains to reveal how [[communication technology]] ([[alphabet]]ic writing, the [[printing press]], and the [[electronic media]]) affects [[cognitive]] organization, which in turn has profound ramifications for social organization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...[I]f a new technology extends one or more of our senses outside us into the social world, then new ratios among all of our senses will occur in that particular culture. It is comparable to what happens when a new note is added to a melody. And when the sense ratios alter in any culture then what had appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque, and what had been vague or opaque will become translucent.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' 1962, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Movable type ====
His episodic history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic tribal humankind to the [[Electronics|electronic age]]. According to McLuhan, the invention of [[movable type]] greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means [[phonemic orthography]]. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic [[alphabet]] from [[logographic]]/logogramic writing systems, like [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] or [[ideograms]].)

Print culture, ushered in by the [[Gutenberg press]] in the middle of the fifteenth century, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting with approval an observation on the nature of the printed word from ''Prints and Visual Communication'' by [[William Ivins]], McLuhan remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background. [...] The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, "formal" causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' pp. 124–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main concept of McLuhan's argument (later elaborated upon in ''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'') &lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt;is that new technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits ("visual homogenizing of experience"), which in turn affects social interactions ("fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook"). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the [[Modern age|Modern]] period in the [[Western world]]: [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[Protestantism]], [[capitalism]] and [[nationalism]]. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology's principle of "segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification."&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Global Village ====
In the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called "electronic interdependence": when [[electronic media]] replaces [[visual culture]] with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a "tribal base." McLuhan's coinage for this new social organization is the ''[[global village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "global village"  specifically as such. According to McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a ''Wake'' scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term. &lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_2art2.htm |publisher=''McLuhan Studies'' (issue 2) |title=The source of the term 'global village' |author=Eric McLuhan |year=1996 |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', but McLuhan himself was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of tending towards a vast [[Alexandrian library]] the world has become a [[computer]], an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of [[science fiction]]. And as our senses have gone outside us, [[Authoritarianism|Big Brother]] goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the [[Western world]] a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Key to McLuhan's argument is the idea that technology has no ''per se'' moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual's and, by extension, a society's self-conception and realization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than [[manuscript]] culture could ever do. Print is the technology of [[individualism]]. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. "But", someone says, "we didn't know it would happen." Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The moral [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of technology's effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter seventeenth century with the modern concern for the "end of the book". If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that "there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies".&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the [[World Wide Web]] was invented almost thirty years after ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', and ten years after his death, McLuhan prophesied the web technology seen today as early as 1962:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The next medium, whatever it is—it may be the extension of consciousness—will include television as  its content, not as its environment, and will transform television into an art form. A computer as a research and communication instrument could enhance retrieval, obsolesce mass library organization, retrieve the individual's encyclopedic function and flip into a private line to speedily tailored data of a saleable kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Getto |first=Erica |url=http://www.wnyc.org/articles/features/2011/jul/15/celebrating-marshall-mcluhans-legacy/ |title=The Medium is the Massage: Celebrating Marshall McLuhan's Legacy |publisher=WNYC.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-23 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, McLuhan coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term "[[surfing]]" to refer to rapid, irregular and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements like "[[Heidegger]] surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as [[Descartes]] rode the mechanical wave." [[Paul Levinson]]'s 1999 book ''Digital McLuhan'' explores the ways that McLuhan's work can be better understood through the lens of the digital revolution.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Levinson | url=http://www.cyberchimp.co.uk/U75102/levinson.htm#ch3 |first=Paul|last=Levinson |title=Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |ISBN=0-415-19251-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan frequently quoted [[Walter Ong]]'s ''Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue'' (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''. Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in ''America''.&lt;ref&gt;''America'' 107 (Sept. 15, 1962): 743, 747.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' as "a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 8 (1967): 838.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan himself said of the book, "I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [''The Gutenberg Galaxy'']. It seems to me a book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of ''Understanding Media'' [the 1960 NAEB report] that I'm doing now." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' won Canada's highest literary award, the [[Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction|Governor-General's Award for Non-Fiction]], in 1962.  The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan's colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, [[Northrop Frye]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Understanding Media'' (1964) ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Medeasfhsdl.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Book cover ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man'' by Marshall McLuhan, 1964. It is the source of the phrase [[The medium is the message]].]] --&gt;

McLuhan's most widely known work, ''[[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964), is a pioneering study in media theory. Dismayed by the way people approached and used new media such as television, McLuhan famously argued that in the modern world "we live mythically and integrally ... but continue to think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of the pre-electric age."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1964), 4&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan proposed that [[Mass media|media]] themselves, not the content they carry, should be the focus of study—popularly quoted as "the medium is the message". McLuhan's insight was that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not by the content delivered over the medium, but by the characteristics of the medium itself. McLuhan pointed to the [[light bulb]] as a clear demonstration of this concept. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, he postulated that content had little effect on society—in other words, it did not matter if television broadcasts children's shows or violent programming, to illustrate one example—the effect of television on society would be identical.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book could be reread at will, but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it.

==== {{anchor|Hot and cool media}}"Hot" and "cool" media ====
In the first part of ''Understanding Media,'' McLuhan also stated that different media invite different degrees of participation on the part of a person who chooses to consume a medium. Some media, like the movies, were "hot"—that is, they enhance one single [[sense]], in this case [[Visual perception|vision]], in such a manner that a person does not need to exert much effort in filling in the details of a movie image. McLuhan contrasted this with "cool" TV, which he claimed requires more effort on the part of the viewer to determine meaning, and [[comics]], which due to their minimal presentation of visual detail require a high degree of effort to fill in details that the cartoonist may have intended to portray. A movie is thus said by McLuhan to be "hot", intensifying one single sense "high definition", demanding a viewer's attention, and a comic book to be "cool" and "low definition", requiring much more conscious participation by the reader to extract value.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Any hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one, as a lecture makes for less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than a dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot media usually, but not always, provide complete involvement without considerable stimulus. For example, print occupies visual space, uses visual senses, but can immerse its reader. Hot media favour analytical precision, quantitative analysis and sequential ordering, as they are usually sequential, linear and logical. They emphasize one sense (for example, of sight or sound) over the others. For this reason, hot media also include [[radio]], as well as [[film]], the [[lecture]], and [[photography]].

Cool media, on the other hand, are usually, but not always, those that provide little involvement with substantial stimulus. They require more active participation on the part of the user, including the perception of abstract patterning and simultaneous comprehension of all parts. Therefore, according to McLuhan cool media include [[television]], as well as the [[seminar]] and [[cartoons]]. McLuhan describes the term "cool media" as emerging from jazz and popular music and, in this context, is used to mean "detached."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-74-342-1818/people/mcluhan/clip4 |title=CBC Archives |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Cool medium incorporates increased involvement but decreased description while hot medium is the opposite, decreased involvement and increased description. In other words, a society that appears to be actively participating in the streaming of content but not considering the effects of the tool is not allowing an "extension of ourselves." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The Playboy Interview|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|date=March 1969|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept appears to force media into binary categories. However, McLuhan's hot and cool exist on a continuum: they are more correctly measured on a scale than as dichotomous terms.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

==== Critiques of ''Understanding Media'' ====
Some theorists have attacked McLuhan’s definition and treatment of the word "medium" for being too simplistic.  [[Umberto Eco]], for instance, contends that McLuhan’s medium conflates channels, codes, and messages under the overarching term of the medium, confusing the vehicle, internal code, and content of a given message in his framework.&lt;ref name="Debray"&gt;{{cite web|last=Debray|first=Regis|title=Media Manifestos|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Debray-MediaManifestos1.pdf|publisher=Columbia University Press|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Media Manifestos'', [[Régis Debray]] also takes issue with McLuhan’s envisioning of the medium.  Like Eco, he too is ill at ease with this reductionist approach, summarizing its ramifications as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The list of objections could be and has been lengthened indefinitely: confusing technology itself with its use of the media makes of the media an abstract, undifferentiated force and produces its image in an imaginary "public" for mass consumption; the magical naivete of supposed causalities turns the media into a catch-all and contagious "mana"; apocalyptic millenarianism invents the figure of a homo mass-mediaticus without ties to historical and social context, and so on.&lt;ref name="Debray" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, when ''Wired'' interviewed him in 1995, Debray stated that he views McLuhan "more as a poet than a historian, a master of intellectual collage rather than a systematic analyst ...  McLuhan overemphasizes the technology behind cultural change at the expense of the usage that the messages and codes make of that technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joscelyne|first=Andrew|title=Debray on Technology|url=http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdebray1.htm|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dwight Macdonald]], in turn, reproached McLuhan for his focus on television and for his "aphoristic" style of prose, which he believes left ''Understanding Media'' filled with "contradictions, non-sequiturs, facts that are distorted and facts that are not facts, exaggerations, and chronic rhetorical vagueness." &lt;ref name="Mullen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullen|first=Megan|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw: Marshall McLuhan’s Understanding Media|url=http://www.historyoftechnology.org/eTC/v47no2/mullen.html|accessdate=2 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105045526/http://www.historyoftechnology.org/eTC/v47no2/mullen.html|archivedate=5 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Brian Winston]]’s ''Misunderstanding Media'', published in 1986, chides McLuhan for what he sees as his [[technological determinism|technologically deterministic]] stances.&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt;  [[Raymond Williams]] and [[James W. Carey]] further this point of contention, claiming:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The work of McLuhan was a particular culmination of an aesthetic theory which became, negatively, a social theory [...] It is an apparently sophisticated technological determinism which has the significant effect of indicating a social and cultural determinism [...] If the medium – whether print or television – is the cause, of all other causes, all that men ordinarily see as history is at once reduced to effects. (Williams 1990, 126/7)&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David Carr states that there has been a long line of "academics who have made a career out of deconstructing McLuhan’s effort to define the modern media ecosystem," whether it be due to what they see as McLuhan’s ignorance toward sociohistorical context or the style of his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|title=Marshall McLuhan: Media Savant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/books/review/Carr-t.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2 November 2011|work=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some critics have taken issue with McLuhan’s writing style and mode of argument, McLuhan himself urged readers to think of his work as "probes" or "mosaics" offering a toolkit approach to thinking about the media. His eclectic writing style has also been praised for its postmodern sensibilities&lt;ref&gt;Paul Grossweiler, ''The Method is the Message: Rethinking McLuhan through Critical Theory'' (Montreal: Black Rose, 1998), 155-81&lt;/ref&gt; and suitability for virtual space.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levinson, ''Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium'' (New York: Routledge,1999), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Medium Is the Massage:&lt;!-- "MASSAGE" IS CORRECT, EDITORS, PLEASE NOTE: "The Medium is the MASSAGE" is the correct title. Please DO NOT change "Massage" to "Message" here --&gt; An Inventory of Effects'' (1967) ===
''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'', published in 1967, was McLuhan's best seller,&lt;ref name="wired saint"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/saint.marshal.html?pg=1&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= |title=The Wisdom of Saint Marshall, the Holy Fool |last=Wolf |first=Gary |date=January 1996 |work=Wired 4.01 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "eventually selling nearly a million copies worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Initiated by [[Quentin Fiore]],&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  McLuhan adopted the term "massage" to denote the effect each medium has on the human [[sensorium]], taking inventory of the "effects" of numerous media in terms of how they "massage" the sensorium.&lt;ref&gt;According to McLuhan biographer W. Terrence Gordon, "by the time it appeared in 1967, McLuhan no doubt recognized that his original saying had become a cliché and welcomed the opportunity to throw it back on the compost heap of language to recycle and revitalize it.  But the new title is more than McLuhan indulging his insatiable taste for puns, more than a clever fusion of self-mockery and self-rescue—the subtitle is 'An Inventory of Effects,' underscoring the lesson compressed into the original saying." (Gordon, p. 175.)

However, the FAQ section on the website maintained by McLuhan's estate says that this interpretation is incomplete and makes its own leap of logic as to why McLuhan left it as is. "Why is the title of the book ''The Medium Is the Massage'' and not ''The Medium is the Message''? Actually, the title was a mistake. When the book came back from the typesetter's, it had on the cover 'Massage' as it still does. The title was supposed to have read ''The Medium is the Message'' but the typesetter had made an error. When McLuhan saw the typo he exclaimed, 'Leave it alone! It's great, and right on target!' Now there are possible four readings for the last word of the title, all of them accurate: ''Message'' and ''Mess Age'', ''Massage'' and ''Mass Age''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiore, at the time a prominent graphic designer and communications consultant, set about composing the visual illustration of these effects which were compiled by Jerome Agel. Near the beginning of the book, Fiore adopted a pattern in which an image demonstrating a media effect was presented with a textual synopsis on the facing page.  The reader experiences a repeated shifting of analytic registers—from "reading" typographic print to "scanning" photographic facsimiles—reinforcing McLuhan's overarching argument in this book: namely, that each medium produces a different "massage" or "effect" on the human sensorium.

In ''The Medium Is the Massage'',&lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt; McLuhan also rehashed the argument—which first appeared in the Prologue to 1962's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''—that all media are "extensions" of our human senses, bodies and minds.

Finally, McLuhan described key points of change in how man has viewed the world and how these views were changed by the adoption of new media. "The technique of invention was the discovery of the nineteenth [century]", brought on by the adoption of fixed points of view and [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] by typography, while "[t]he technique of the [[suspension of judgement|suspended judgment]] is the discovery of the twentieth century", brought on by the [[bard]] abilities of radio, movies and television.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The past went that-a-way. When faced with a totally new situation we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to the flavor of the most recent past. We look at the present through a [[rear-view mirror]]. We march backward into the future. Suburbia lives imaginatively in [[Bonanza]]-land.&lt;ref&gt;''The Medium is the Massage'', pp 74,5&lt;/ref&gt;

An audio recording version of McLuhan's famous work was made by Columbia Records. The recording consists of a pastiche of statements made by McLuhan ''interrupted'' by other speakers, including people speaking in various [[phonation]]s and [[falsetto]]s, discordant sounds and 1960s incidental music in what could be considered a deliberate attempt to translate the disconnected images seen on TV into an audio format, resulting in the prevention of a connected stream of conscious thought. Various audio recording techniques and statements are used to illustrate the relationship between spoken, literary speech and the characteristics of electronic audio media.  McLuhan biographer Philip Marchand called the recording "the 1967 equivalent of a McLuhan video."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"I wouldn't be seen dead with a living work of art."—'Old man' speaking
:"Drop this jiggery-pokery and talk straight turkey."—'Middle aged man' speaking

=== ''War and Peace in the Global Village'' (1968) ===
McLuhan used [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', an inspiration for this study of war throughout history, as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future.

Joyce's ''Wake'' is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram which reveals a cyclic pattern for the whole history of man through its '''Ten Thunders'''. Each "thunder" below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement he likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced. In order to glean the most understanding out of each, the reader must break the portmanteau into separate words (and many of these are themselves [[portmanteau]]s of words taken from multiple languages other than English) and speak them aloud for the spoken effect of each word. There is much dispute over what each portmanteau truly denotes.

McLuhan claims that the ten thunders in ''Wake'' represent different stages in the history of man:&lt;ref&gt;''War and Peace in the Global Village'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Thunder 1: Paleolithic to Neolithic.'' Speech. Split of East/West. From herding to harnessing animals.
*''Thunder 2: Clothing as weaponry.'' Enclosure of private parts. First social aggression.
*''Thunder 3: Specialism.'' Centralism via wheel, transport, cities: civil life.
*''Thunder 4: Markets and truck gardens.'' Patterns of nature submitted to greed and power.
*''Thunder 5: Printing.'' Distortion and translation of human patterns and postures and pastors.
*''Thunder 6: Industrial Revolution.'' Extreme development of print process and individualism.
*''Thunder 7: Tribal man again.'' All choractors end up separate, private man. Return of choric.
*''Thunder 8: Movies.'' Pop art, pop Kulch via tribal radio. Wedding of sight and sound.
*''Thunder 9: Car and Plane.'' Both centralizing and decentralizing at once create cities in crisis. Speed and death.
*''Thunder 10: Television.'' Back to tribal involvement in tribal mood-mud. The last thunder is a turbulent, muddy wake, and murk of non-visual, tactile man.

=== ''From Cliché to Archetype'' (1970) ===
In his 1970 book, ''From Cliché to Archetype'', McLuhan, collaborating with [[Canadian poetry|Canadian poet]] [[Wilfred Watson]],&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/wilfred-watson/ |title=Watson, Wilfred |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=14 March 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202212727/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008487 |archivedate=2 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; approached the various implications of the verbal [[cliché]] and of the [[archetype]].  One major facet in McLuhan's overall framework introduced in this book that is seldom noticed is the provision of a new term that actually succeeds the global village; the ''global theater''.

In McLuhan's terms, a cliché is a "normal" action, phrase, etc. which becomes so often used that we are "anesthetized" to its effects.

An example of this given by McLuhan is [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s play ''[[The Bald Soprano]]'', whose dialogue consists entirely of phrases Ionesco pulled from an [[Assimil]] language book. "Ionesco originally put all these idiomatic English clichés into literary French which presented the English in the most absurd aspect possible."&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan's ''archetype'' "is a quoted extension, medium, technology or environment." "Environment" would also include the kinds of "awareness" and cognitive shifts brought upon people by it, not totally unlike the psychological context [[Carl Jung]] described.

McLuhan also posits that there is a factor of interplay between the cliché and the archetype, or a "doubleness":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Another theme of the Wake [''[[Finnegans Wake]]''] that helps in the understanding of the paradoxical shift from cliché to archetype is 'past time are pastimes.' The dominant technologies of one age become the games and pastimes of a later age. In the 20th century, the number of 'past times' that are simultaneously available is so vast as to create cultural anarchy. When all the cultures of the world are simultaneously present, the work of the artist in the elucidation of form takes on new scope and new urgency. Most men are pushed into the artist's role. The artist cannot dispense with the principle of 'doubleness' or 'interplay' because this type of [[hendiadys]] dialogue is essential to the very structure of consciousness, awareness, and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McLuhan relates the cliché-to-archetype process to the [[Theatre of the Absurd|Theater of the Absurd]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pascal, in the seventeenth century, tells us that the heart has many reasons of which the head knows nothing. The Theater of the Absurd is essentially a communicating to the head of some of the silent languages of the heart which in two or three hundred years it has tried to forget all about. In the seventeenth century world the languages of the heart were pushed down into the unconscious by the dominant print cliché.&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "languages of the heart", or what McLuhan would otherwise define as oral culture, were thus made archetype by means of the printing press, and turned into cliché.

The satellite medium, McLuhan states, encloses the Earth in a man-made environment, which "ends 'Nature' and turns the globe into a repertory theater to be programmed."&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; All previous environments (book, newspaper, radio, etc.) and their artifacts are retrieved under these conditions ("past times are pastimes"). McLuhan thereby meshes this into the term ''global theater''. It serves as an update to his older concept of the global village, which, in its own definitions, can be said to be subsumed into the overall condition described by that of the global theater.

=== ''The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st Century'' (1989) ===
In his 1989 posthumous book, ''The Global Village'', McLuhan, collaborating with [[Bruce R. Powers]], provided a strong conceptual framework for understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated with the rise of a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the [[Shannon–Weaver model]]. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic with the advent of the global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow"&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.

Reading, writing, and hierarchical ordering are associated with the left brain, as are the linear concept of time and phonetic literacy. The left brain is the locus of analysis, classification, and rationality. The right brain is the locus of the spatial, tactile, and musical. "Comprehensive awareness" results when the two sides of the brain are in true balance. Visual Space is associated with the simplified worldview of Euclidean geometry, the intuitive three dimensions useful for the architecture of buildings and the surveying of land. It is too rational and has no grasp of the acoustic. Acoustic Space is multisensory.

McLuhan writes about robotism in the context of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of thinking about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and the novels of [[Philip K. Dick]]. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, ''The Chrysanthemum and the Sword'', an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: "Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.

==== Beyond existing communication models ====
"All Western scientific models of communication are—like the Shannon–Weaver model—linear, sequential, and logical as a reflection of the late medieval emphasis on the Greek notion of efficient causality."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan and Powers criticize the Shannon-Weaver model of communication as emblematic of left-hemisphere bias and linearity, descended from a print-era perversion of Aristotle's notion of efficient causality.

A third term of ''The Global Village'' that McLuhan and Powers develop at length is The Tetrad. McLuhan had begun development on the Tetrad as early as 1974.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's Laws of the Media, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The tetrad an analogical, simultaneous four-fold pattern of transformation. "At full maturity the tetrad reveals the metaphoric structure of the artifact as having two figures and two grounds in dynamic and analogical relationship to each other." &lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the camera focused on the Earth by the Apollo 8 astronauts, the tetrad reveals figure (Moon) and ground (Earth) simultaneously. The right-brain hemisphere thinking is the capability of being in many places at the same time. Electricity is acoustic. It is simultaneously everywhere. The Tetrad, with its fourfold Möbius topological structure of enhancement, reversal, retrieval and obsolescence, is mobilized by McLuhan and Powers to illuminate the media or technological inventions of cash money, the compass, the computer, the database, the satellite, and the global media network.

== Key concepts ==

=== Tetrad of media effects ===
{{Main|Tetrad of media effects}}

In ''Laws of Media'' (1988), published posthumously by his son [[Eric McLuhan|Eric]], McLuhan summarized his ideas about [[media studies|media]] in a concise tetrad of media effects. The tetrad is a means of examining the effects on society of any technology (i.e., any medium) by dividing its effects into four categories and displaying them simultaneously. McLuhan designed the tetrad as a pedagogical tool, phrasing his laws as questions with which to consider any medium:

*What does the medium enhance?
*What does the medium make obsolete?
*What does the medium retrieve that had been obsolesced earlier?
*What does the medium flip into when pushed to extremes?

The laws of the tetrad exist simultaneously, not successively or chronologically, and allow the questioner to explore the "grammar and syntax" of the "language" of media. McLuhan departs from his mentor [[Harold Innis]] in suggesting that a medium "overheats", or reverses into an opposing form, when taken to its extreme.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

Visually, a tetrad can be depicted as four diamonds forming an X, with the name of a medium in the centre. The two diamonds on the left of a tetrad are the ''Enhancement'' and ''Retrieval'' qualities of the medium, both ''Figure'' qualities. The two diamonds on the right of a tetrad are the ''Obsolescence'' and ''Reversal'' qualities, both ''Ground'' qualities.&lt;ref name="EL"&gt;{{cite book |last=McLuhan |first=Eric |title=Electric language: understanding the present |publisher=Stoddart |year=1998 |isbn=0-7737-5972-7}}, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|right|thumb|250px|A blank tetrad diagram]]

Using the example of radio:

* Enhancement (figure): What the medium amplifies or intensifies. ''Radio amplifies news and music via sound.''
* Obsolescence (ground): What the medium drives out of prominence. ''Radio reduces the importance of print and the visual.''
* Retrieval (figure): What the medium recovers which was previously lost. ''Radio returns the spoken word to the forefront.''
* Reversal (ground): What the medium does when pushed to its limits. ''Acoustic radio flips into audio-visual TV.''

=== Figure and ground ===
{{Main|Figure and ground (media)}}

McLuhan adapted the [[Gestalt psychology]] idea of a ''figure and a ground'', which underpins the meaning of "The medium is the message".&lt;!--"message" is correct here--&gt; He used this concept to explain how a form of communications technology, the medium  or ''figure'', necessarily operates through its context, or ''ground''.

McLuhan believed that in order to grasp fully the effect of a new technology, one must examine figure (medium) and ground (context) together, since neither is completely intelligible without the other. McLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to the technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in their turn, further affect society and individuals.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

All technologies have embedded within them their own assumptions about [[Time- and space-bias|time and space]]. The message which the medium conveys can only be understood if the medium and the environment in which the medium is used—and which, simultaneously, it effectively creates—are analysed together. He believed that an examination of the figure-ground relationship can offer a critical commentary on culture and society.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:Marshall McLuhan Way Toronto.jpg|thumb|A portion of Toronto's St. Joseph Street is co-named Marshall McLuhan Way]]
After the publication of ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan received an astonishing amount of publicity, making him perhaps the most publicized English teacher in the twentieth century and arguably the most controversial.{{According to whom|date=January 2013}} This publicity began with the work of two California advertising executives, [[Howard Gossage]] and Gerald Feigen who used personal funds to fund their practice of "genius scouting."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Marchand, pp. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Randall (1994). ''Where the Suckers Moon: The Life and Death of an Advertising Campaign''. NY: Vintage Books, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Much enamoured with McLuhan's work, Feigen and Gossage arranged for McLuhan to meet with editors of several major New York magazines in May 1965 at the Lombardy Hotel in New York. Philip Marchand reports that, as a direct consequence of these meetings, McLuhan was offered the use of an office in the headquarters of both ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'', any time he needed it.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In August 1965, Feigen and Gossage held what they called a "McLuhan festival" in the offices of Gossage's advertising agency in San Francisco. During this "festival", McLuhan met with advertising executives, members of the mayor's office, and editors from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine. More significant was the presence at the festival of [[Tom Wolfe]], who wrote about McLuhan in a subsequent article, "What If He Is Right?", published in ''[[New York Magazine]]'' and Wolfe's own ''[[The Pump House Gang]]''. According to Feigen and Gossage, their work had only a moderate effect on McLuhan's eventual celebrity: they claimed that their work only "probably speeded up the recognition of [McLuhan's] genius by about six months."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, pp. 182–184.&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, McLuhan soon became a fixture of media discourse. ''Newsweek'' magazine did a cover story on him; articles appeared in ''Life Magazine'', ''Harper's'', ''Fortune'', ''Esquire'', and others. Cartoons about him appeared in ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="wired saint" /&gt;  In 1969, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine published a lengthy interview with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Playboy Interview: Marshall McLuhan |date=March 1969 |work=Playboy |pages=26–27, 45, 55–56, 61, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a running gag on the popular sketch comedy ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'', the "poet" [[Henry Gibson]] would randomly say, "Marshall McLuhan, what are you doin'?"&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan was credited with coining the phrase ''[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]'' by its popularizer, [[Timothy Leary]], in the 1960s. In a 1988 interview with [[Neil Strauss]], Leary stated that slogan was "given to him" by McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary said McLuhan "was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that’s a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.'"&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Neil. ''Everybody Loves You When You're Dead: Journeys into Fame and Madness.'' New York: HarperCollins, 2011, p. 337–38&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime and afterward, McLuhan heavily influenced [[cultural criticism|cultural critics]], thinkers, and media theorists such as [[Neil Postman]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[William Irwin Thompson]], [[Paul Levinson]], [[Douglas Rushkoff]], [[Jaron Lanier]], [[Hugh Kenner]], and [[John David Ebert]], as well as political leaders such as [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-69-342-1826/life_society/mcluhan/clip8 |title=It's cool not to shave – Marshall McLuhan, the Man and his Message – CBC Archives |accessdate=2007-07-02 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Jerry Brown]]. [[Andy Warhol]] was paraphrasing McLuhan with his now famous "[[15 minutes of fame]]" quote. When asked in the 1970s for a way to sedate violences in [[Angola]], he suggested a massive spread of TV devices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Luttazzi]], interview at [[RAI Radio1]] show ''[http://www.radio.rai.it/radio1/radiounomusica/stereonotte.cfm Stereonotte] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629015942/http://www.radio.rai.it/radio1/radiounomusica/stereonotte.cfm |date=2007-06-29 }}'', July 01 2007 2:00 am. Quote: "McLuhan era uno che al premier canadese che si interrogava su un modo per sedare dei disordini in Angola, McLuhan disse, negli anni 70, 'riempite la nazione di apparecchi televisivi'; ed è quello che venne fatto; e la rivoluzione in Angola cessò." {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The character "Brian O'Blivion" in [[David Cronenberg]]'s 1983 film [[Videodrome]] is a "media oracle" based on McLuhan.&lt;ref&gt;Lamberti, Elena. ''Marshall McLuhan's Mosaic: Probing the Literary Origins of Media Studies.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, McLuhan was named as the "patron saint" of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired Magazine'']] and a quote of his appeared on the masthead{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} for the first ten years of its publication.&lt;ref name="wired channel" /&gt; He is mentioned by name in a [[Peter Gabriel]]-penned lyric in the song "Broadway Melody of 1974".  This song appears on the [[concept album]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', from [[progressive rock]] band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]].  The lyric is:  "Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin' head buried in the sand."  McLuhan is also jokingly referred to during an episode of ''[[The Sopranos]]'' entitled "[[House Arrest (The Sopranos episode)|House Arrest]]". Despite his death in 1980, someone claiming to be McLuhan was posting on a ''Wired'' mailing list in 1996. The information this individual provided convinced one writer for ''Wired'' that "if the poster was not McLuhan himself, it was a bot programmed with an eerie command of McLuhan's life and inimitable perspective."&lt;ref name="wired channel"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/channeling.html |title=Channeling McLuhan |last=Wolf |first=Gary |date=January 1996 |work=Wired 4.01 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new centre known as the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology]], formed soon after his death in 1980, was the successor to McLuhan's Centre for Culture and Technology at the [[University of Toronto]]. Since 1994, it has been part of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information]] and in 2008 the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology incorporated in the Coach House Institute. The first director was literacy scholar and [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education|OISE]] Professor David R. Olsen. From 1983 until 2008, the McLuhan Program was under the direction of Dr. [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] who was McLuhan's student and translator. From 2008 through 2015 Professor Dominique Scheffel-Dunand of [[York University]] served Director of the Program.
In 2011 at the time of his centenary the Coach House Institute established a Marshall McLuhan Centenary Fellowship program in his honor, and each year appoints up to four fellows for a maximum of two years. In May 2016 the Coach House Institute was renamed the McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology; its Interim Director was [[Seamus Ross]] (2015–16). Sarah Sharma, an Associate Professor of Media Theory from the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) and the Faculty of Information (St. George), began a five-year term as director of the Coach House (2017- ). Professor Sharma's research and teaching focuses on feminist approaches to technology, including issues related to temporality and media. Professor Sharma's thematic for the 2017-2018 Monday Night Seminars at the McLuhan Centre is MsUnderstanding Media which extends and introduces feminist approaches to technology to McLuhan's formulations of technology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/|title=Prof. Sarah Sharma Appointed Director of McLuhan Centre - McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|date=2016-12-13|work=McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114202736/http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/#|archive-date=2017-11-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conception of a '''maternal impression''' rests on the belief that a powerful mental (or sometimes physical) influence working on the mother's mind may produce an impression, either general or definite, on the child she is carrying.&lt;ref&gt;Havelock Ellis, ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', vol. 5 p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  The child might be said to be "marked" as a result.

==Medicine==
Maternal impression, according to a [[obsolete scientific theory|long-discredited]] [[medicine|medical]] theory, was a phenomenon that explained the existence of [[birth defect]]s and congenital disorders. The theory stated that an [[emotion]]al [[stimulation|stimulus]] experienced by a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman could influence the development of the [[fetus]]. For example, it was sometimes supposed that the mother of the [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]] was frightened by an [[elephant]] during her pregnancy, thus "imprinting" the memory of the elephant onto the gestating fetus. Mental problems, such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[clinical depression|depression]], were believed to be a manifestation of similar disordered feelings in the mother. For instance, a pregnant woman who experienced great [[sadness]] might imprint depressive tendencies onto the fetus in her womb.

The theory of maternal impression was largely abandoned by the 20th century, with the development of modern [[genetics|genetic theory]].

==Folklore==
In [[folklore]], maternal imprinting, or '''Versehen'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} (a [[German language|German]] noun meaning "inadvertance" or as a verb "to provide") as it is usually called, is the belief that a sudden fear of some object or animal in a pregnant woman can cause her child to bear the mark of it.

[[Oswald Spengler]] understood maternal imprinting to be a folkloric understanding of what he called "blood feeling" or the formation of a group aesthetic of a bodily ideal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is called the ''Versehen'' of a pregnant woman is only a particular and not very important instance of the workings of a very deep and powerful formative principle inherent in all that is of the race side. It is a matter of common observation that elderly married people become strangely like one another, although probably Science with its measuring instruments would "prove" the exact opposite. It is impossible to exaggerate the formative power of this living pulse, this strong inward feeling for the perfection of one's own type. The feeling for race-beauty—so opposite to the conscious taste of ripe urbans for intellectual-individual traits of beauty—is immensely strong in primitive men, and for that very reason never emerges into their consciousness. But such a feeling is race-forming. It undoubtedly molded the warrior- and hero-type of a nomad tribe more and definitely on ''one bodily ideal'', so that it would have been quite unambiguous to speak of the race-figure of Romans or Ostrogoths.&lt;ref&gt;Spengler, Oswald, The Decline of the West, Knopf, NYC, 1928, vol. 2 p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] also comments at length about the phenomenon of ''postpartum'' maternal impression in bears, i.e., the folk belief that newborn bears must be licked and molded into bear-shape by their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny Natural History VIII:126&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donovan Michael Sullivan''' ({{zh|t=蘇立文|p=Sū Lìwén}}; 29 October 1916 – 28 September 2013) was a Canadian-born British art historian and collector, and one of the major Western pioneers in the field of modern [[History of Chinese art|Chinese art history]] and criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/michaelsullivan |title=Professor Michael Sullivan, 1916 – 2013 |publisher=Oxford University |date=2013-09-28 |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/oct/25/michael-sullivan |title=Michael Sullivan obituary |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2013-10-25 |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan was born in Toronto, Canada, and moved to England at the age of three. He was the youngest of five children of Alan Sullivan (pen name Sinclair Murray), a Canadian mining engineer turned novelist and his wife Elisabeth (née Hees).&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Sullivan was a graduate of Rugby School and graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] in architecture in 1939. He was in China from 1940–1946 with the International and Chinese Red Cross followed by teaching and doing museum work in [[Chengdu]], where he met and married Wu Huan (Khoan), a biologist who gave up her career to work with him.

He received a PhD from [[Harvard University]] (1952) and a post-doctoral [[Bollingen Fellowship]]. He subsequently taught in the University of Singapore, and returned to London in the 1960s to teach at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]. Then he became Christensen Professor of Chinese art in the Department of Art at [[Stanford University]] from 1966 to 1984, before moving to the [[University of Oxford]] as a Fellow by Special Election at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520255692 The Arts of China, Fifth Edition, Revised and Expanded]&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in [[Oxford, England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520075566 Art and Artists of Twentieth-Century China]&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at the [[University of Oxford]] for 1973–74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoa.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/hoa/documents/pdf/Oxford_Slade_Professors.pdf |title=Oxford Slade Professors, 1870–present |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2012 |accessdate=27 January 2015 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213123228/http://www.hoa.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/hoa/documents/pdf/Oxford_Slade_Professors.pdf |archivedate=13 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan was a major art collector who owned more than 400 works of art, including paintings by Chinese masters [[Qi Baishi]], [[Zhang Daqian]], and [[Wu Guanzhong]]. His was one of the world's most significant collections of modern Chinese art. He bequeathed his collection to the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford, which has a gallery dedicated to Sullivan and his wife Khoan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25362579 |title=Ashmolean acquires major Chinese art collection |newspaper=BBC |date=13 December 2013 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cemetery Montparnasse for Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|[[Montparnasse cemetery]] and [[Tour Montparnasse]].]]
'''Montparnasse''' ({{IPA-fr|mɔ̃paʁnas}})(&lt;small&gt;French&lt;/small&gt; {{Audio-IPA|Musée du Montparnasse.ogg|}}) is an area of Paris, France, on the [[Rive Gauche|left bank]] of the river [[Seine]], centred at the crossroads of the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] and the Rue de Rennes, between the Rue de Rennes and boulevard Raspail. Montparnasse has been part of Paris {{citation needed span|since 1669|date=November 2017}} .

The area also gives its name to:

* [[Gare Montparnasse]]: trains to [[Brittany]], [[TGV]] to [[Rennes]], [[Tours]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Le Mans]]; rebuilt as a modern TGV station;
* The large [[Montparnasse - Bienvenüe (Paris Métro)|Montparnasse – Bienvenüe]] [[Paris Métro|métro]] station;
* [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]: the Montparnasse Cemetery, where [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Man Ray]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Serge Gainsbourg]] or [[Susan Sontag]] are buried among other celebrities;
* [[Tour Montparnasse]], a lone skyscraper.

The [[Pasteur Institute]] is located in the area. Beneath the ground are tunnels of the [[Catacombs of Paris]].

Students in the 17th century who came to recite poetry in the hilly neighbourhood nicknamed it after "[[Mount Parnassus]]", home to the nine [[Muses]] of arts and sciences in [[Greek mythology]].

The hill was levelled to construct the Boulevard Montparnasse in the 18th century. During the [[French Revolution]] many dance halls and [[cabaret]]s opened their doors.

The area is also known for cafés and bars, such as the [[Brittany|Breton]] restaurants specialising in [[crêpe]]s (thin pancakes) located a few blocks from the Gare Montparnasse.

In the 18th century, students recited poems at the foot of an artificial hillock of rock rubble from the catacombs, a near-by network of underground galleries. Ironically, they decided to baptize this mound "Mount Parnassus", named after the one celebrated by Greek poets. In early 20th century, many Bretons driven out of their region by poverty arrived by train at Montparnasse station, the heart of the district, and settled near-by.&lt;ref name=ParisDigest&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/montparnasse.htm |title=Montparnasse |author= |year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Montparnasse became famous in the 1920s, referred to as ''les Années Folles'' (the Crazy Years), and the 1930s as the heart of intellectual and artistic life in Paris. From 1910 to the start of [[World War II]], Paris' artistic circles migrated to Montparnasse as alternative to the [[Montmartre]] district which had been the intellectual breeding ground for the previous generation of artists. The Paris of [[Émile Zola|Zola]], [[Manet]], [[Anatole France|France]], [[Degas]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], a group that had assembled more on the basis of status affinity than actual artistic tastes, indulging in the refinements of [[Dandyism]], was at the opposite end of the economic, social, and political spectrum from the gritty, tough-talking, die-hard, emigrant artists that peopled Montparnasse.

Virtually penniless painters, sculptors, writers, poets and composers came from around the world to thrive in the creative atmosphere and for the cheap rent at artist communes such as [[La Ruche]]. Living without running water, in damp, unheated "studios", seldom free of rats, many sold their works for a few francs just to buy food. [[Jean Cocteau]] once said that poverty was a luxury in Montparnasse. First promoted by art dealers such as [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], today works by those artists sell for millions of euros.

In post-[[World War I]] Paris, Montparnasse was a euphoric meeting ground for the artistic world. [[Fernand Léger]] wrote of that period:  "man…relaxes and recaptures his taste for life, his frenzy to dance, to ''spend money''…an explosion of ''life-force fills the world''." &lt;ref&gt;Woodhead, Lindy, "War Paint: Madame Rubenstein and Miss Elizabeth Arden, Their Lives, Their Times, Their Rivalry," Wiley, 2004, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; They came to Montparnasse from all over the globe, from Europe, including Russia, [[Hungary]] and [[Ukraine]], from the United States, Canada, [[Mexico]], [[Central America|Central]] and South America, and from as far away as Japan. [[Manuel Ortiz de Zárate]], [[Camilo Mori]] and others made their way from [[Chile]] where the profound innovations in art spawned the formation of the [[Grupo Montparnasse]] in [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]. A few of the other artists who gathered in Montparnasse were [[Jacob Macznik]]&lt;ref&gt;Montparnasse Déporté: Artisti Europei de Parigi al Lager; published by Elede, 2007, under the auspices of the Musée du Montparnasse, the City of Turin, and the Region of Piemonte (Italy)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Undzere Farpainikte Kinstler, Hersh Fenster, Imprimerie Abècé, Paris, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Ossip Zadkine]], [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio Gonzalez]], [[Moise Kisling]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Erik Satie]], [[Marios Varvoglis]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Nina Hamnett]], [[Jean Rhys]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Michel Kikoine]], [[Pinchus Kremegne]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Ford Madox Ford]], [[Toño Salazar]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Suzanne Duchamp]]-Crotti, [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Paul Fort]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Federico Cantú]], [[Angel Zarraga]], [[Marie Vorobieff|Marevna]], [[Tsuguharu Foujita]], [[Marie Vassilieff]], [[Léon-Paul Fargue]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[René Iché]], [[André Breton]], [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[Pascin]], [[Nils Dardel]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Emil Cioran]], [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]], [[Endre Ady]] poet and journalist, [[Joan Miró]], [[Hilaire Hiler]] and, in his declining years, [[Edgar Degas]].

[[File:La Rotonde-2.jpg|thumb|left|La Rotonde at night 2007]]

Montparnasse was a community where creativity was embraced with all its oddities, each new arrival welcomed unreservedly by its existing members. When [[Tsuguharu Foujita]] arrived from Japan in 1913 not knowing a soul, he met Soutine, Modigliani, Pascin and Léger virtually the same night and within a week became friends with Juan Gris, Picasso and Matisse. In 1914, when the English painter [[Nina Hamnett]] arrived in Montparnasse, on her first evening the smiling man at the next table at ''La Rotonde'' graciously introduced himself as "Modigliani, painter and Jew". They became good friends, Hamnett later recounting how she once borrowed a jersey and corduroy trousers from Modigliani, then went to ''La Rotonde'' and danced in the street all night.

Between 1921 and 1924, the number of Americans in Paris swelled from 6,000 to 30,000. While most of the artistic community gathered here were struggling to eke out an existence, well-heeled American socialites such as [[Peggy Guggenheim]], and [[Edith Wharton]] from New York City, [[Harry Crosby]] from [[Boston]] and [[Beatrice Wood]] from San Francisco were caught in the fever of creativity. [[Robert McAlmon]], and [[Maria Jolas|Maria]] and [[Eugene Jolas]] came to Paris and published their literary magazine ''[[Transition (literary journal)|Transition]]''. Harry Crosby and his wife [[Caresse Crosby|Caresse]] would establish the [[Mary Phelps Jacob|Black Sun Press]] in Paris in 1927, publishing works by such future luminaries as [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[James Joyce]], [[Kay Boyle]], [[Hart Crane]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Dorothy Parker]] and others. As well, [[Bill Bird]] published through his ''Three Mountains Press'' until British heiress [[Nancy Cunard]] took it over.

[[File:LaCloseriedesLilas.jpg|thumb|right|Cafés rented tables to poor artists for hours at a stretch. Several, including La Closerie des Lilas, remain in business today.]]

The cafés and bars of Montparnasse were a meeting place where ideas were hatched and mulled over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse's night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. In Montparnasse's heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés ''[[Le Dôme Café|Le Dôme]]'', ''La Closerie des Lilas'', ''[[Café de la Rotonde|La Rotonde]]'', ''Le Select'', and ''La Coupole''—all of which are still in business— were the places where starving artists could occupy a table all evening for a few ''centimes''. If they fell asleep, the waiters were instructed not to wake them. Arguments were common, some fuelled by intellect, others by alcohol, and if there were fights, and there often were, the police were never summoned. If you couldn't pay your bill, people such as La Rotonde's proprietor, [[Victor Libion]], would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, there were times when the café's walls were littered with a collection of artworks, that today would make the curators of the world's greatest museums drool with envy.

There were many areas where the great artists congregated, one of them being near Le Dôme at no. 10 rue Delambre called the [[Dingo Bar]]. It was the hang-out of artists and expatriate Americans and the place where Canadian writer [[Morley Callaghan]] came with his friend [[Ernest Hemingway]], both still unpublished writers, and met the already-established [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]. When [[Man Ray]]'s friend and [[Dadaism|Dadaist]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], left for New York City, Man Ray set up his first studio at l'Hôtel des Ecoles at no. 15 rue Delambre. This is where his career as a photographer began, and where [[James Joyce]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Jean Cocteau]] and the others filed in and posed in black and white.

The ''rue de la Gaité'' in Montparnasse was the site of many of the great [[music-hall]] theatres, in particular the famous "[[Bobino]]".
[[Image:ClubBobino.jpg|upright|left|frame|Great artists performed at the Bobino Nightclub.]]

On their stages, using then-popular single name pseudonyms or one birth name only, [[Marie-Louise Damien|Damia]], [[Alice Prin|Kiki]], [[Félix Mayol|Mayol]] and [[Georges Guibourg|Georgius]], sang and performed to packed houses. And here too, [[Les Six]] was formed, creating music based on the ideas of [[Erik Satie]] and [[Jean Cocteau]].

The poet [[Max Jacob]] said he came to Montparnasse to "sin disgracefully", but [[Marc Chagall]] summed it up differently when he explained why he had gone to Montparnasse: "I aspired to see with my own eyes what I had heard of from so far away: this revolution of the eye, this rotation of colours, which spontaneously and astutely merge with one another in a flow of conceived lines. That could not be seen in my town. The sun of Art then shone only on Paris."

While the area attracted people who came to live and work in the creative, [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] environment, it also became home for political exiles such as [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Porfirio Diaz]], and [[Simon Petlyura]]. But, World War II forced the dispersal of the artistic society, and after the war Montparnasse never regained its splendour. Wealthy socialites like [[Peggy Guggenheim]], an art collector who married artist [[Max Ernst]], lived in the elegant section of Paris but frequented the studios of Montparnasse, acquiring pieces that would come to be recognized as masterpieces that now hang in the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection|Peggy Guggenheim Museum]] in Venice, Italy.

The [[Musée du Montparnasse]] opened in 1998 at 21 [[Avenue du Maine]] and closed in 2015. Although operating with a tiny city grant, the museum was a non-profit operation.

'''Nahum Tate''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|.|əm|_|ˈ|t|eɪ|t}} {{respell|NAY|əm|_|TAYT}}; 1652 – 30 July 1715) was an Irish [[poet]], [[hymnist]] and [[lyricist]], who became [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|England's poet laureate]] in 1692.  Tate is best known for ''[[The History of King Lear]]'', his 1681 [[literary adaptation|adaptation]] of Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]''.

==Life==
Nahum Tate was born in [[Dublin]] and came from a family of [[Puritan]] clerics. He was the son of [[Faithful Teate]], an Irish cleric&lt;ref name="life1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/nutter/hymnwriters.Tate_Nah.html%0A%09 |title=hymnwriters |access-date=13 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104075549/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/nutter/hymnwriters.Tate_Nah.html |archive-date=4 January 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who had been rector of [[Castleterra]], [[Ballyhaise]], until his house was burnt and his family attacked after he had passed on information to the government about plans for the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]].

After living at the provost's lodgings in [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Faithful Teate moved to England. He was the [[incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] at [[Greenwich|East Greenwich]] around 1650, and "preacher of the gospel" at [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]] from 1654 to 1658. He had returned to Dublin by 1660. He published a poem on the Trinity entitled ''Ter Tria'',&lt;ref&gt;''Ter Tria, or the Doctrine of the Three Sacred Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; Principal Graces, Faith, Hope, and Love; Main Duties, Prayer, Hearing, and Meditation''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some sermons, two of which he dedicated to [[Oliver Cromwell|Oliver]] and [[Henry Cromwell]].&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Tate, Nahum|first=Henry Leigh|last=Bennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nahum Teate followed his father to Trinity College, Dublin in 1668, and graduated BA in 1672. By 1676 he had moved to London and was writing for a living. The following year he had adopted the spelling "Tate", which would remain until his death. He died in 1715, in Southwark, London, England.&lt;ref name="nndb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/448/000098154/|title=Nahum Tate|work=nndb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[St George the Martyr, Southwark]] on 1 August 1715 as 'of next to the Prince Eugene, Mint'.{{clarify|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.co.uk/Browse/View.aspx?dbid=1624&amp;path=Southwark.St+George+the+Martyr.1695-1732.237|title=Pay as you go|work=ancestry.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:LearTate.jpg|thumb|Cover of [[The History of King Lear|Tate's version of ''King Lear'']]]]
Tate published a volume of poems in London in 1677, and became a regular writer for the stage. ''Brutus of Alba, or The Enchanted Lovers'' (1678), a tragedy dealing with [[Dido]] and [[Aeneas]], was dedicated to [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset]];&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; it was later adapted as the libretto for [[Henry Purcell]]'s opera ''[[Dido and Æneas|Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1688 or earlier).&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt; ''The Loyal General'', with a prologue by [[John Dryden|Dryden]], played at the [[Dorset Garden Theatre]] in 1680.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Tate then turned to making a series of adaptations of Elizabethan dramas. His version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' altered the names of the characters, and changed the text so that every scene, to use his own words, was "full of respect to Majesty and the dignity of courts"; but in spite of these precautions ''The Sicilian Usurper'' (1681), as his rewrite was called, was suppressed on the third performance on account of a possible political interpretation.&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt; In 1681 [[Thomas Betterton]] played Tate's version of ''[[King Lear]]'',&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; which entirely omitted the Fool, and [[Happy ending|ended happily]] in marriage between [[Cordelia (King Lear)|Cordelia]] and Edgar.&lt;ref name="kl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/tatelear.html|title=Nahum Tate, King Lear|work=rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Though [[Joseph Addison]] protested at this mutilation of Shakespeare, [[Samuel Johnson]] defended the poetic justice of Tate's adaptation.)&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'' became ''The Ingratitude of a Commonwealth'', played at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1682. Tate's [[farce]] ''Duke and no Duke'' (first printed 1685, but acted earlier at the Theatre Royal) imitated Sir [[Aston Cockayne]]'s ''Trappolin suppos'd a Prince''. His ''Cuckold's Haven'' (performed 1685 at the Theatre Royal) was derived from [[George Chapman|Chapman]] and [[John Marston (poet)|Marston]]'s ''[[Eastward Hoe|Eastward Ho]]''. ''The Island Princess, or the Generous Portugals'' (1687) was adapted from [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]. ''Injur'd Love, or the Cruel Husband'' (1707), altered from [[John Webster|Webster]]'s ''[[The White Devil]]'', seems never to have been acted.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1682 Tate collaborated with [[John Dryden]] to complete the second half of his epic poem ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]''.&lt;ref name="aba"&gt;{{cite web| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060502081228/http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/737.html |url=http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/737.html Absalom | archivedate= 2006-05-02 |title= Absalom and Achitophel: The Second Part |quote= The success of ''Absalom and Achitophel'' was so great that Dryden was pressed by several persons to continue his satirical commentary upon the times. This he declined to do but he engaged his friend Nahum Tate (1652–1715), the poet and dramatist, to write a second part to ''Absalom and Achitophel''. He supervised and revised the whole poem and added the verses characterizing Thomas Shadwell and Elkanah Settle as Og and Doeg.|year= 2005| author= Ian Lancashire |work= Representative Poetry Online| publisher=[[University of Toronto Libraries]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tate wrote the [[libretto]] for [[Henry Purcell]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''; its first known performance was in 1689. He also wrote the text for Purcell's Birthday Ode ''[[Come Ye Sons of Art]]'' in 1694. Tate also translated ''Syphilis sive Morbus Gallicus'', [[Girolamo Fracastoro]]'s [[Latin]] [[pastoral]] poem on the subject of the disease of [[syphilis]], into English [[heroic couplet]]s.

Tate's name is also connected with the famous ''[[Tate and Brady|New Version of the Psalms of David]]'' (1696), for which he collaborated with [[Nicholas Brady (poet)|Nicholas Brady]]. Some items such as "As pants the hart" ([[Psalm 42]]) rise above the general level, and are said to be Tate's work.&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt; A supplement was licensed in 1703 which included the [[Christmas carol]] "[[While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks]]", one of a number of hymns by Tate.

His poems were sharply criticised by [[Alexander Pope]] in ''[[The Dunciad]]''.

Of his numerous poems the most original is ''Panacea, a poem on Tea'' (1700). In spite of his consistent [[Toryism]], he succeeded [[Thomas Shadwell|Shadwell]] as [[poet laureate]] in 1692. He died within the precincts of the Mint, [[Southwark]], where he had taken refuge from his creditors, in 1715.&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt;

==Modern stagings==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
In 1985, the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] of New York City staged Tate's ''[[The History of King Lear|History of King Lear]]'' in its original form, "happy ending" and all, directed by W. Stuart McDowell at [[The Shakespeare Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow. "Tate's ''Lear'' at Riverside", ''The New York Times'', 5 April 1985, and Howard Kissel. "''King Lear'' for Optimists", ''Women's Wear Daily'', 22 March 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; This included removing the Fool altogether, adding a [[confidante]] for Cordelia, named Arante, as well as an "abduction" scene of Cordelia on the heath. The play concluded with multiple happy endings: for Lear and Kent, and Cordelia and Edgar, who presumably wed after the play's conclusion. Musical interludes were sung by cast members during the act breaks, accompanied by a [[harpsichord]] in the [[orchestra pit]].

'''New Classical architecture''' is a contemporary movement in architecture that continues the practice of [[Classical architecture|classical]] and [[Vernacular architecture|traditional architecture]]. The design and construction of buildings in these traditions is continuous throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, even as [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and other post-classical theories of architecture have been more dominant. Since New Classical architecture is not an [[architectural style]] and can appear in [[Outline of classical architecture#Classical architectural styles|various forms]], contemporary classical buildings might be also, although not correctly, be described with the terms '''Traditionalism''', '''[[Neo-Historism]]''' (or [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]]/[[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalism]]), or simply '''[[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical Architecture]],''' implying the continuation of a specific historical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html|title=Neo-classicist Architecture.

== Development ==
[[File:Böttcherstraße4.jpg|thumb|1920s regionalist architecture: [[Böttcherstraße]], [[Bremen]], Germany]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Historicism (art)|historicism]] and [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] were still dominant styles in [[Germany]]. The [[Austria]]n architect [[Adolf Loos]] criticized his time's architecture as too "grandiloquent" and "opulent", and longed for a complete abandonment of architectural [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] in his 1910 essay ''[[Ornament and Crime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Loos, A.|year=1908|title=Ornament and Crime|location=Innsbruck, reprint Vienna, 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the first major [[Modern architecture|modernist]] movements like [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]] and [[Bauhaus]] gained momentum in [[Germany]], the desire to continue and develop [[Outline of classical architecture|classical styles]] sprouted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Banham, Reyner|year=1960|title=Theory and Design in the First Machine Age - Characteristic attitudes and themes of European artists and architects 1900-1930|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1904 until around 1955 the ''[[:de:Heimatschutzarchitektur|Heimatschutz style]]'' prospered in Germany, which focused on [[vernacular architecture|vernacular]] traditions and can be roughly translated to ''cultural protection style''. Examples of this early new classical style are the [[Hamburg Museum]], the [[Prinzipalmarkt]] in [[Münster]] and the market square of [[Freudenstadt]]. After heavy Allied bombing of Germany in [[World War II]], architects such as [[:de:Adolf Abel|Adolf Abel]], [[Roderich Fick]], [[:de:Konstanty Gutschow|Konstanty Gutschow]], [[Werner March]], [[Paul Schmitthenner]], [[Julius Schulte-Frohlinde]], and [[Rudolf Wolters]] assisted in the postwar rebuilding of destroyed German cities using Heimatschutz and other traditional design methods. 

In Britain, architect [[Raymond Erith]] continued to design classical houses into the late 1960s and early 1970s. [[Quinlan Terry]], a New Classical Architect who continues to practice, was an employee, later a partner and now the successor of the late [[Raymond Erith]]. In the late 1970s several young architects in Europe began challenging modernist proposals in architecture and planning. To broadcast them, [[Leon Krier]] and [[Maurice Culot]] founded the ''Archives d'Architecture Moderne'' in [[Brussels]] and began publishing texts and counterprojects to modernist proposals in architecture and planning.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Krier and Maurice Culot, "Counterprojets: Prefaces," (Brussels: Archives d'Architecture Moderne, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; It received a boost from the sponsorship of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], especially with [[The Prince's Foundation for Building Community]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Prince of Wales, "A Vision of Britain: A Personal View of Architecture," (New York: Doubleday, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

With the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture, several PhD programs in schools of architecture arose in order to differentiate themselves from art history PhD programs, where architectural historians had previously trained. In the US, [[MIT]] and [[Cornell]] were the first, created in the mid-1970s, followed by [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Among the founders of new architectural history programs were [[Bruno Zevi]] at the Institute for the History of Architecture in Venice, Stanford Anderson and Henry Millon at MIT, Alexander Tzonis at the [[Architectural Association]], Anthony Vidler at Princeton, [[Manfredo Tafuri]] at the University of Venice, [[Kenneth Frampton]] at [[Columbia University]], and Werner Oechslin and Kurt Forster at [[ETH Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]], "The Disciplinary Dislocations of Architectural History," ''Journal of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]]'' 58/3 (September 1999), p. 489. See also other articles in that issue by Eve Blau, Stanford Anderson, Alina Payne, Daniel Bluestone, Jeon-Louis Cohen and others.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of these programs was paralleled by the hiring, in the 1970s, of professionally trained historians by schools of architecture: Margaret Crawford (with a PhD from U.C.L.A) at [[Southern California Institute of Architecture|SCI-Arc]]; Elisabeth Grossman (PhD, Brown University) at [[Rhode Island School of Design]]; Christian Otto&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning|Cornell University Dept. of Architecture website]]{{cite web |url=http://www.aap.cornell.edu/arch/faculty/faculty-profile.cfm?customel_datapageid_7102=18513 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630235627/http://aap.cornell.edu/arch/faculty/faculty-profile.cfm?customel_datapageid_7102=18513 |archivedate=2013-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (PhD, Columbia University) at [[Cornell University]]; Richard Chafee (PhD, Courtauld Institute) at [[Roger Williams University]]; and Howard Burns (M.A. Kings College) at [[Harvard]].

In these years [[postmodern architecture]] developed a critique of modernist architectural aesthetics.&lt;ref name=McAlester&gt;{{cite book|last=McAlester|first=Virginia Savage|title=A Field Guide to American Houses|year=2013|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=978-1-4000-4359-0|pages=664–665, 668–669}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among them were certain influential postmodernist architects such as [[Charles Moore (architect)|Charles Moore]], [[Robert Venturi]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Venturi, "Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture," (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Graves]],  who used classical elements as ironic motifs in order to criticize modernism's sterility. A broad spectrum of more than two dozen architects, theorists, and historians presented other alternatives to modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Papadakis and Harriet Watson, eds., "New Classicism: Omnibus Volume," (London: Academy Editions, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were several serious New Classical architects who saw classicism as a legitimate mode of architectural expression, several of whom would later become Driehaus Prize Laureates, including some such as [[Thomas Beeby]] and [[Robert A.M.

Alongside these academic and scholarly developments, a populist and professional manifestation of new classicism has existed and continues to develop. The 1963 demolition of [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]]'s [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Pennsylvania Railroad Station]] in [[New York City]] provoked the formation of [[Classical America]] and its regional chapters, led by [[Henry Hope Reed, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/on-the-town/how-henry-hope-reed-saved-architecture/17877/|title=How Henry Hope Reed Saved Architecture|author=|date=|website=The New York Sun|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020164252/http://www.nysun.com/on-the-town/how-henry-hope-reed-saved-architecture/17877|archivedate=20 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classical America advocated the appreciation of classically inspired buildings and for the practice of contemporary classical and traditional design by teaching architects to draw the classical orders, hosting walking tours, educational events, conferences and publishing The Classical America Series in Art and Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicist.org/publications-and-bookshop/classical-america-series-in-art-and-architecture/|title=Books - Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Art|author=|date=|website=www.classicist.org|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620084212/http://www.classicist.org/publications-and-bookshop/classical-america-series-in-art-and-architecture/|archivedate=20 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the then-named Institute of Classical Architecture merged with Classical America to form the Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Classical America (now the [[Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Art]]).

[[File:Jakriborg20150722-2.JPG|thumb|New urbanist, sustainable town [[Jakriborg]] (Sweden), using traditional and classical architecture motifs]]
Fundamental tenets of the New Classicism include that it is not limited to [[neoclassical architecture]]; and that "classical" is not a style in itself, but a way of elevating the art of building to the art of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;An important clarion call was that of Demetri Porphyrios, "Classicism is not a Style," in "Architectural Design" vol. 52, no. 5/6, 1982, and reprinted various places.&lt;/ref&gt;  A classical building uses imitation to express its tectonic truth, which is not the same as the facts of its construction, and finds its beauty not in originality and style but in the handling of the traditional forms that have always been its vehicles. Classical buildings also always account for the differences between the public and the private realms in addressing the urban and rural conditions where they are built. New classical architects also emphasize the awareness of [[sustainability]], the aim is to create long-lasting, well-crafted buildings of great quality, with an efficient use of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-68iZSeOVg New Classical Architecture and 10 years of the Driehaus Prize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804032843/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-68iZSeOVg |date=2016-08-04 }}, [[Notre Dame School of Architecture]] (Video)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nocturne: Blue and Gold – Old Battersea Bridge''''' is a painting by the [[United States|American]] artist [[James McNeill Whistler]], now held in the collections of [[Tate Britain]]. It was painted around 1872–5.

This painting is of the old wooden [[Battersea Bridge]] across the [[River Thames]] before it was replaced by the modern bridge. [[Chelsea Old Church]] to the left (on the north bank of the river) and the then recently built [[Albert Bridge, London|Albert Bridge]] to the right, with fireworks above, can be seen in the distance. The picture is an evening view and is full of atmospheric effect. The bridge is painted taller than it actually was for added effect. [[Hokusai]], a favorite artist of Whistler's from [[Japan]], produced a similar picture of a tall wooden bridge with fireworks.

The painting was presented to the [[Tate Gallery]] by the [[The Art Fund|National Art Collections Fund]] in 1905.

Whistler's ''Nocturne'' series, of which this painting was a part, achieved notoriety in 1877, when influential critic [[John Ruskin]] visited an exhibition of the series at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. He wrote of the exhibition that Whistler was "asking two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face". Whistler sued for libel, the case reaching the courts in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Steiner|first=Wendy|date=January 1993|title=A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin|journal=Art in America|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552/|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge in the case, one Baron Huddleston, caused laughter in the court when he (apparently sincerely) asked Whistler "Which part of the picture is the bridge?" &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Whistler|first=James|date=1890|title=The Gentle Art of Making Enemies|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxgEAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case ended with Whistler awarded token damages of one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]].{{sfn|Cookson|2006|p=122}}

In 1905, ''Nocturne: Blue and Gold'' became the first significant acquisition by the newly formed [[National Art Collections Fund]], and now hangs in [[Tate Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Moore|first=Susan|date=2003-11-01|title=Guardian of the nation's treasures|newspaper=The Spectator|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nurzhol Boulevard''' (Kazakh: бульвар «Нұржол» Bulvar Nurzhol, formerly known as «сулы-нулы бульвар» Green Water Boulevard) is the national boulevard of [[Kazakhstan]], a pedestrian area in the new business and administrative centre on the left bank of [[Ishim river]], in the capital, [[Astana]].  The Boulevard is one of the main attractions of the city and country.&lt;ref&gt; Kazakhstan - Page 99 Paul Brummell - 2012 "On the east side of the square, as Nurzhol Boulevard continues its eastward march, is the fountain composition ... Around the [[Ak Orda]] At the east end of Nurzhol Boulevard are two tall conical buildings, faced in a covering of reflective gold. North and south of these a large, curving, wall-like building, which houses various government ministries and agencies, essentially serves to enclose the space to its east, up to the bank of the River Ishim beyond."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Central Asia - Page 176 Bradley Mayhew, Greg Bloom, Paul Clammer - 2010 "Back on Nurzhol bulvar &lt;/ref&gt; Both Nurzhol Boulevard and the layout of the city were designed by renowned architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]]. The boulevard runs from the President's residence [[Ak Orda]] to the marquee shaped [[Khan Shatyr Entertainment Center]] (Хан Шатыр).&lt;!--Please fix this sloppy text: In large part Boulevard is a three-level structure. At the lower level parking lot located at 400 cars. On average, the second level there are shops, points of the service sector and public catering, exhibition halls, offices and other public institutions. On the upper level paved pedestrian area with the proper paths, flower beds, lawns, trees, benches, fountains, small architectural forms. In six areas (zones "green house") conical atria top-level form of light "wells" of natural light, around which are arranged interlevel ladders and winter gardens. In some places, the second level of indoor galleries and passages leading to surrounding buildings.--&gt;
 
Along the boulevard there is a row of buildings designed by well-known domestic and foreign architects, including the city's most recognisable structure, the [[Bayterek]]. &lt;!--More sloppy text to fix: We are building the boulevard government agencies, including the Government of the RK, RK Senate, the Majilis of the RK, the Supreme Court of the RK, House of Ministries, the Ministry of Defense, the MFA, the Ministry of Transport and Communications, JSC "NC" KazMunayGas "JSC" NC "Kazakhstan Temir Joly," The State Archive of the RK, the National Library of RK, as well as residential complexes, office buildings, shopping and entertainment center "Keruen."--&gt;

== Approaches ==
Through actions of [[tactical media]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://zararah.net/blog/2015/03/15/digital-rights-play-parody/ Zara Rahman: Claiming back digital rights through play and subversion]&lt;/ref&gt; the Peng Collective wants to inspire other activists and civil society organisations to be more courageous in their campaigning methods. "Let's learn from our enemies," one of their members says in an interview. "If you look at the economics of corporations, their state of mind is: 'let's look at every possible gray area of laws and use them.' And NGOs just don't do that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilisationlab.org/google-nest-parody-pushes-limits-of-ngo-tactics/ Mobilisation Lab: Google Nest parody pushes limits of NGO tactics]&lt;/ref&gt; They are known for wearing animal masks as sign of biological appropriation whenever they are on stage and to break the law "whenever necessary for the greater good. And yes, the arts can be a greater good."

== Projects ==

=== googlenest ===

They got international media attention, when they held a presentation called "Your data, our future" in the Name of [[Google]] at Europe's largest tech conference [[re:publica]] in 2014. All presented products were designed to gather more data from the consumers, claiming that this is in their best interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcocreate.com/3030418/how-activists-fooled-the-internet-with-these-convincing-new-google-nest-products Fast Company: How Activists Fooled The Internet With These Convincing New Google Nest Products]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/05/07/google-nest-spoof-by-german-activists-promises-eerie-data-driven-future/ Forbes Magazine: Google Nest Spoof By German Activists Promises Eerie, Data-Driven Future]&lt;/ref&gt; After Google threatened them to take down their parody website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/google-nest-parody-taken-down-2014-5?IR=T Business Insider: Google Got A Parody Site That Made Fun Of Its Privacy Policies To Take Everything Down]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) supported them legally:

{{quote|Unfortunately, Google's skin was not thick enough to withstand this relatively gently ribbing. The company wrote a polite note to the collective, expressing their sincere respect for political commentary—but nonetheless demanding that Peng! revise the site and assign the domain name to Google. Note to Google: polite trademark bullying is still bullying.

EFF responded to Google on Peng's behalf, explaining what should be obvious: the site was pure noncommercial political commentary. Trademark owners should not and cannot punish activists simply because they happen to use trademarks in the course of that kind of commentary.|''Corynne Mcsherry in an EFF letter to Google: Parody Is Not Trademark Infringement''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dear-google-parody-not-trademark-infringement]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Slamshell ===
Invited as fake persona to a conference of the oil company [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], they created an oil spill on stage instead of the expected presentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/14/shell-berlin-science-slam-video_n_4440676.html Shell's Berlin 'Science Slam' Event Reportedly Disrupted By Anti-Drilling Activists (Huffington Post)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/151440-oil-spill-nigeria-activists-prank-shell-hijack-science-slam-berlin-slamshell.html Premium Times Nigeria: Activists prank Shell, hijack “Science Slam” in Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt; The evening was a public relations event organized by [[Burson Marsteller]] in Berlin, where one member of the Collective could enter the stage because he claimed to have created a car that is cleaning the air.

=== Cooperation with the Yes Men and Pussy Riot ===
In 2015, the group infiltrated the [[Cinema for Peace]] Gala in Berlin with a fake polar bear and [[The Yes Men]] to go on stage and insist that divestment from fossil fuels is helping more against climate change than charity projects. [[Pussy Riot]], who was invited as speaker to the [[Charity (practice)|charity]] gala came to support them, when the organizers of the event tried to silence them with security guards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taz.de/Cinema-for-Peace-Eklat-naechste-Runde-/!156929/ German article about the event in the newspaper taz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apologytonatalieportman.com/ Letter of apology to Natalie Portman for hijacking her stage and the video of the evening]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zero Trollerance ===
In May 2015, they developed a bot script that scans [[Twitter]] for abusive and sexist language. Once detected, plenty of automated Twitter profiles would reply to those tweets with an invitation to a self-help program for trolls to become [[feminist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/11535405/How-do-you-stop-Twitter-trolls-Unleash-a-robot-swarm-to-troll-them-ba Daily Telegraph Article "How do you stop Twitter trolls? Unleash a robot swarm to troll them back"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelexit ===
In September 2015, the Peng Collective staged an association named [[Intelexit]] helping anyone working for [[Intelligence agency|secret services]] to quit their jobs and transition to civil life, be it for ethical or psychological reasons. A spokesman of the British secret service [[GCHQ]] responded to the launch of the association, that GCHQ doesn't actually do anything illegal or immoral, and that staff can report any concerns they do have to managers or to GCHQ's own counselors. Furthermore, they responded to the Intelexits critique of their lack of ethical standards that the GCHQ "has several formal lines of accountability and a culture and ethos of high ethical standards among our workforce." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2015/09/campaign-help-surveillance-agents-quit-nsa-gchq/ Wired US article "This New Campaign Wants To Help Surveillance Agents Quit NSA or GCHQ"]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the launch of the campaign, they rallied with an advertising trucks and mobile billboards in front of several secret services workplaces around the world like the German BND, the GCHQ Headquarters in the UK, the US military bases in Germany [[Dagger Complex]] and [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne]] and the [[NSA]]'s Headquarters in the USA, Maryland, where they also drove to the employees lunch place [http://cafejoe.homestead.com/ Café Joe]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/30/these-german-artists-tried-to-convince-nsa-employees-to-quit/?postshare=8101443594963254 Washington Post article "These German artists tried to persuade NSA employees to quit"]&lt;/ref&gt; They also performed an [[Airborne leaflet propaganda|airborne leaflet operation]] over the [[Dagger Complex]] with a drone advertising for the exit program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theintercept.com/2015/10/05/drone-flies-over-nsa-complex-in-germany-dropping-pamphlets/ The Intercept article "Drone Flies Over NSA Complex in Germany, Dropping Leaflets"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelexit now operates phone booth installations in arts and journalists venues where participants can call up secret service employees such as the [[FBI]], [[NSA]], [[CIA]] and private subcontractors like [[Trovicor]] or [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] in the USA, but also officers from Germany, France, Canada and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2016/03/15/peng-le-collectif-qui-veut-aider-les-espions-a-raccrocher_4883226_4408996.html Le Monde article about the Call a Spy launch]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation invites people to set up the call installation all over the world to create an ongoing dialogue between civil society and the intelligence community.

=== Artikel 26 ===
In Schwenke (Halver), Peng! had founded a fictitious CDU local association, which appealed to party leader Angela Merkel to campaign against the export of small arms in the next legislative period. This appeal was also reported in international media. Later the communication guerrilla action was confirmed by Peng!

In the same week, Peng! started an alleged recall of small arms from the manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch by sending letters to US arms dealers on its behalf. The web pages of Heckler &amp; Koch in the USA and Germany were then provided for several days with the news that they had been the victims of a hacker attack and fake news.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mic.com/articles/176439/anonymous-art-collective-trolls-hundreds-of-heckler-and-kochs-us-gun-vendors-with-bogus-recall-prank#.ocoh91DVr Mic article about the weapon prank]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same week, the group released a video documenting how they awarded a peace prize for the arms industry and how Thyssen Krupp Marine Systems only left shortly before the alleged award ceremony.

As part of this series of actions, Peng! published five legislative proposals for the renewal of the War Weapons Control Act and for the "Rescue of Article 26 GG".

=== Deutschland Geht Klauen ===
With this Campaign PENG called people to snatch goods in supermarkets and to pay unions of the producers in the global south instead. They created an online-system with which it is possible to do so through their website, seemingly an online-shop. You can thus pay eight unions fighting for the rights of the workers while PENG is fighting for the introduction of a law in Germany with which you can take German companies accountable for the violation of human rights abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://deutschlandgehtklauen.de/en Deutschlandgehtklauen website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mask.ID ===
PENG created a photo-booth in which you could create portraits that contain your own face and from someone else by morphing them together. The technology was based on neural networks by OpenAI and megapixels by Adam Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/PengBerlin/status/1043529657168089088 Tweet from Peng revealing the sources]&lt;/ref&gt; They themselves created a German passport that contained both one member from their team and [[Federica Mogherini]]. They also sent five passports to co-artists in Libya with whom they morphed the faces to let them enter Europa as both real and symbolic gesture of civil disobedience against the border regime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pa9vyb/peng-collective-artists-hack-german-passport article by Motherboard, "German Art Activists Get Passport Using Digitally Altered Photo of Two Women Merged Together" Oct 9 2018, 6:09pm]&lt;/ref&gt;. The photo booth was further shown in Vienna and Munich on art exhibitions.

=== Civil Financial Regulation Office ===
On the [[Athens Biennale]] 2018 named "ANTI", Peng contributed by installing a call center with six Greek employees payed by German tax money on minimum wage who are calling the [[Financial_regulation | financial regulation institutions]] for six weeks. They ask tem questions that are being posted on their website and try to get them to explain the logic of financial argumentation in understandable language. &lt;ref&gt;[https://cfro.eu Project Website]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''The Prophet Daniel''''' is one of the seven [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]'s painted by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] master [[Michelangelo]] (c. 1542–1545) on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. The [[Sistine Chapel]] is in [[Vatican Palace]], in the [[Vatican City]].

This particular [[fresco]] figure is painted second on the right from the side of the [[High Altar]]. Unlike many other paintings of the period, this portrayal makes no reference to the most famous event from [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]'s life, that is his time [[Daniel in the lions' den|in the den of the lions]]. Instead, Michelangelo shows Daniel reading a great book, which is held up by a muscular figure from below.

[[File:Hokusai rokurokubi.jpg|thumb|"Rokurokubi" from the [[Hokusai Manga]] by [[Katsushika Hokusai]]]]
The '''rokurokubi''' (ろくろ首, 轆轤首) is a type of Japanese ''[[yōkai]]'' (apparition). They look almost completely like humans, with one major difference. There are two types of Rokurokubi: one whose neck stretches, and one whose head comes off and flies around freely (''nukekubi''). The Rokurokubi appear in classical ''[[kaidan]]'' (spirit tales) and in [[yōkai]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=村上健司 編著|title=日本妖怪大事典|year=2005|publisher=角川書店|series=Kwai books|isbn=978-4-04-883926-6|pages=356頁}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested, however, that the idea of rokurokubi may have been created purely for entertainment purposes rather than originating from any folk beliefs or legends.&lt;ref name="今野1981"&gt;{{Harvnb|今野|1981|pp=86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''rokurokubi'' may have derived from the word ''rokuro'' which refers to a [[potter's wheel]]&lt;ref name="井之口他1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|井之口他|1988|p=520}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a [[water well]]'s [[pulley]] (since it elongates).&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=%E3%82%8D%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8D&amp;dtype=0&amp;dname=0na&amp;stye=0&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=21930619691100 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124182016/http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8 |archivedate=2007-01-24 |df= }} Yahoo Japan, ヤフー株式会社 Accessed 22 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="多田2000"&gt;{{Harvnb|多田|2000|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an [[umbrella]] handle (which also elongates).&lt;ref name="井之口他1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=阿部主計|title=妖怪学入門|year=2004|publisher=雄山閣|isbn=978-4-639-01866-7|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ShokokuHyaku Rokurokubi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Wechizen no Kofuchuu Rokurokubi no Koto'' (ゑちぜんの国府中ろくろ首の事) from the ''[[Shokoku Hyaku Monogatari]]'' (諸国百物語)&lt;ref name="篠塚訳著2006" /&gt;]]
The nukekubi are rokurokubi whose heads come off and float about. These were the first rokurokubi, whereas the other kind came afterwards.&lt;ref name="篠塚訳著2006"&gt;{{Harvnb|篠塚訳著|2006|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nukekubi sometimes perform bad deeds such as attacking at night and drinking their victims' blood. It's theorized that the nukekubi has a weakness when it is sleeping and the head is floating around: if the body moves, then the head cannot be re-united to the body.&lt;ref name="柴田2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|柴田|2005|pp=30–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical literature about rokurokubi describe tales of people witnessing and encountering floating heads at night time.&lt;ref name="柴田2005" /&gt;

Sometimes, the action of the head separating from the body is seen as the soul wandering away from the body i. e. somnambulism. For example, in the ''Sorori Monogatari'' (曾呂利物語, 1663 CE), in the chapter, ''A Woman's Wild Thoughts Wandering Around'' (女の妄念迷ひ歩く事, ''Onna no Mōnen Mayoiaruku Koto'') the head separating from the body interpreted to be the woman's soul wandering while asleep. In the same book, a man saw a nukekubi that changed into a chick and a woman's head, so he took his sword and chased the head. The head fled into a home, and people said that they heard a voice from inside say, "I had a scary dream. I was chased by a man with a sword. I ran away all the way back home, and then I woke up."&lt;ref name="高田編1989" /&gt; (refer to picture).

A similar story appears in Shokoku Hyaku Monogatari (諸国百物語, 1677 CE), which drew a lot of inspiration from the Sorori Monogatari. In ''About Rokurokubi in the Province of Echizen'' (ゑちぜんの国府中ろくろ首の事, ''Echizen no Kuni Fuchū Rokurokubi no Koto''), there's the story of a man who chases a nukekubi (who was a woman's soul detached from her body) all the way home. It's said that the woman had been shamed by a crime she has committed, so as a result, she left her husband, shaved her hair, and committed suicide.&lt;ref name="篠塚訳著2006" /&gt;

''Hokusō Sadan'' (北窻瑣談, 1910 CE) is an [[Edo period]] essay by Tachibana Nankei (橘春暉). Here too, it was interpreted to be an illness resulting in a detaching soul. The story goes: in the first year of [[Kansei]], in [[Echigo Province]] (now [[Fukui Prefecture]]), there was a house maidservant whose head rolled off the pillow while she was asleep, detached from the body. Later in the story, it was explained that it was not really the head, but rather the soul making the appearance of a head.{{Sfn|柴田|2008|pp=704-705}}

In ''Kokon Hyaku Monogatari Hyōban'' (古今百物語評判, 1686 CE), a book of ghost stories that explains yōkai tales by [[Yamaoka Genrin]], there is a chapter called ''How Priest Zetsugan saw Rokurokubi in Higo'' (絶岸和尚肥後にて轆轤首を見給ふ事, ''Zetsugan Oshō Higo nite Rokurokubi wo Mitamou Koto''). In [[Higo Province]] (now [[Kumamoto Prefecture]]), the head of an innkeeper's wife leaves her body and floats in the air. It returned to normal the next day, but there was a line around her neck. The author made references to examples from Chinese books, and then commented, "as these kinds of things were often seen in South-East Asia, not just limited to the creation of the heaven and earth, it is difficult to fathom them with ordinary common sense such as the idea that octopi do not have eyes, and as these things are unheard of in the capital, everything strange is in faraway lands."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=山岡元隣|editor=山岡元恕編 太刀川清校訂|title=続百物語怪談集成|year=1993|publisher=国書刊行会|series=叢書江戸文庫|isbn=978-4-336-03527-1|pages=12–13|chapter=古今百物語評判}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, there is a story which tells of a woman in the village of Tawa, [[Nagao, Kagawa|Nagao]], [[Ōkawa District, Kagawa|Ōkawa District]], [[Kagawa Prefecture]] (now [[Sanuki, Kagawa|Sanuki]]) who is a rokurokubi and has a ring-like bruise around her neck.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt;

In the ''Churyō Manroku'' (中陵漫録) is a tale which describes a "Rokurokubi Village" in the recesses of [[Mount Yoshino]] where all the residents, even children, wore scarves to cover a line around their necks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=佐藤成裕|editor=早川純三郎編輯代表|title=日本随筆大成|year=1976|publisher=吉川弘文館|volume=第3期 3|isbn=978-4-642-08580-9|page=354|chapter=中陵漫録}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Kasshi Yawa'' (甲子夜話, ca. 1821 CE) by [[Matsura Seizan]] is a story which tells of a woman in [[Hitachi Province]] who has a terminal illness. A peddler has told her husband that the liver of a white dog will cure her. The husband kills the pet dog and gives his wife the dog's liver as a medicant. The woman is cured but her next born daughter is a rokurokobi. When the  roukorkobi's head detached and flew in the air, the white dog appeared, bit the head and killed the rokurokobi.&lt;ref name="笹間1994"&gt;{{Harvnb|笹間|1994|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although rokurokubi and nukekubi are usually female, in ''Shousai Hikki'' (蕉斎筆記), an [[Edo period]] tale, there is a nukekubi that is male. A priest is sleeping in his temple when a head appeared and approached his chest. He grabs it and throws it away and it left. In the morning, the manservant asks to take leave, and when asked why, the manservant asks, "did a head come visit last night?" The priest answered yes, the manservant then explained that "I have the nukekubi illness, and I fear it will interfere with my work too much from now on." The manservant went away to his home in [[Shimōsa Province]] where this "illness" was thought to be common.{{Sfn|柴田|2008|p=702}}

In the essay ''Mimibukuro'' by [[Negishi Shizumori]], a woman who was rumored to be a rokurokubi is married but manages to lives well since the rumor was nothing more than a rumor. She was not actually a rokurokubi so she achieved a happy ending, which is unusual for tales about rokurokubi because bad fortune almost always results when the true identity of a rokurokubi is discovered.&lt;ref name="柴田2005" /&gt;

In the [[Edo period]] encyclopedia, ''[[Wakan Sansai Zue]]'' Rokuokubi like creatures from Chinese lore are described. They are written as 飛頭蛮 meaning ''flying head barbarians''. They use their ears like wings and they eat insects. The ones from China and Japan were believed to be foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=稲田篤信・田中直日編|editor=高田衛監修|title=鳥山石燕 画図百鬼夜行|year=1992|publisher=国書刊行会|isbn=978-4-336-03386-4|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreigner nukekubi also appears in ''[[Rokurokubi (folktale)|Rokurokubi]]'' by [[Lafcadio Hearn]]. In his story, the spirits masquerade as a family of woodcutters from the city who kill and eat travellers.

== Rokurokubi whose necks extend ==
[[File:SekienRokurokubi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rokurokubi (飛頭蛮) from the ''[[Gazu Hyakki Yagyō]]'' by [[Sekiyama Torien]]. What is depicted here is not a neck, but actually a string that connects the head to the body.&lt;ref name=kotowari386/&gt;]]
[[File:Ikku Rokurokubi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rokuroubi from ''Rekkoku Kaidan Kikigaki Zōshi'' (列国怪談聞書帖) by [[Jippensha Ikku]]&lt;ref name="ikku"&gt;{{Cite book|author=十返舎一九|editor=棚橋正博校訂|title=十返舎一九集|year=1997|publisher=国書刊行会|series=叢書江戸文庫|isbn=978-4-336-03543-1|pages=246–248|chapter=列国怪談聞書帖}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Starting in the [[Edo period]], tales were written about people's necks stretching when they were asleep. Examples of these tales are ''Buya Zokuda'' (武野俗談), ''Kanden Kōhitsu'' (閑田耕筆) and ''Yasō Kidan'' (夜窓鬼談).

It's thought that the idea of an extending neck originated from people misinterpreting visual depictions of nukekubi, the earlier kind of rokurokubi. There was the idea that nukekubi had a string attaching the head to the body, and when this string was depicted in visual depictions, people misinterpted this string as an elongated neck.&lt;ref name=kotowari386&gt;{{cite book &lt;!--| 和書--&gt; | author=京極夏彦 | title=妖怪の理 妖怪の檻 | publisher=角川書店 | series=怪 BOOKS | year=2007 | chapter=妖怪の形について | pages=386 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Kasshi Yawa'' (甲子夜話), there is a tale which tells of a female servant with a pale face who is suspected to be a rokurokubi. One night, her master checks on her while she is sleeping and sees something like steam gradually rise from her chest. The steam becomes thick and obscures her head and then suddenly it appears as though her neck has risen up and stretched. Perhaps due to being surprised from seeing her master, the girl stirs, turns over and her neck returned to normal. This servant had a pale face, but otherwise looked completely normal, but despite this, she was fired and in fact has had trouble staying in any job, always being fired shortly after being employed.{{Sfn|柴田|2008|pp=700-701}} For the soul to leave the body and create the shape of a neck, as seen in this story and the before mentioned Hokusō Sadan, is sometimes interpreted to be "[[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]" in [[parapsychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=多田克己|title=幻想世界の住人たち|year=1990|publisher=新紀元社|series=[[Truth In Fantasy]]|volume=IV|isbn=978-4-915146-44-2|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late [[Edo period]] ''[[yomihon]]'' (illustrated novel), ''Rekkoku Kaidan Kikigaki Zōshi'' (列国怪談聞書帖) by [[Jippensha Ikku]] the author suggests the elongated necks of rokurokubi originate in the spiritual principle, ''[[karma]]''. In Ikku's work, ''Kaishin'', a monk from [[Enshū]] and a woman called Oyotsu elope together. However, when Oyatsu collapsed from an illness, they ran out of money, so he killed her. When Kaishin eventually returned to secular life, he slept with a girl he met at an inn. When they sleep together, the girl's neck stretched and her face becomes that of Oyotsu, who then told him about her resentment. Kaishin felt regretful his actions and proceeded to tell Oyatsu's father everything. The girl's father then told Kaishin that he has also killed a woman before. He stole her money and with it, he opened his inn. He had a daughter was born soon after who, due to karma, became a rokurokubi. Kaishin then reentered the priesthood. He built a grave for Oyotsu, said to be the Rokurokubi no Tsuka (Rokurokubi Mound), which told the story to future generations.&lt;ref name="ikku" /&gt;

In some stories, rokurokubi are not a yōkai, but rather people who have an affliction that affects the body. For example, the [[Edo period]] author [[Ban Kōkei]] in his work "Kanden Kōhitsu" told a tale of a [[geisha]] at the [[Yoshiwara]] brothel whose neck would elongate in her sleep. It stated that her neck stretched to due her "heart becoming loose"{{Sfn|柴田|2008|pp=701-702}}

== Oral tradition ==
Rokurokobi are also appear in the [[oral tradition]] of Japanese myths. For example, there is a myth about an old highway between the villages of Iwa and [[Akechi, Gifu|Akechi]] in [[Gifu Prefecture]] where it is said that a snake shapeshifted into a rokurokubi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=鈴木孝司他編|title=旧静波村の民俗 岐阜県恵那郡明智町旧静波村|year=1971|publisher=東洋大学 民俗研究会|id=ncid: BA5494848X|page=191|chapter=口承文芸}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is a myth from the oral tradition of Koikubo area of [[Iida, Nagano|Iida]], [[Nagano Prefecture]] where it is said a rokurokubi appeared in someone's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=巻山圭一|editor=所三男他編纂|title=長野県史|year=1989|publisher=長野県|volume=民俗編 2巻3号|id=ncid: BN00168252|page=100|chapter=家・屋敷に出る妖怪}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bunka]] period, a [[kaidan]] story became popular, where there was a prostitute whose neck would smoothly stretch and would lick the oil of paper lanterns when she slept with guests, showing how rokurokubi were spoken of as things that women would transform into or an illness that they would be afflicted with. In this period, rokurokubi were also popular in [[freak show]]s.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt; The ''Shohō Kenbunroku'' (諸方見聞録) records a freak show in 1810 (Bunka 7) in Edo, now [[Tokyo]] where a male rokurokubi with an elongated neck appeared.&lt;ref name="笹間1994" /&gt;

Tales of rokurokubi appeared even in the early [[Meiji period|Meiji]] period. There was a tale of how a merchant and his wife from Shibaya town, [[Ibaraki, Osaka|Ibaraki]], [[Osaka Prefecture]] who witnessed their daughter's neck stretch every night. Despite their supplications in [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]], their daughter did not get better, and eventually the whole town came to know about it. The couple couldn't bear it anymore, so they left, leaving no clues as to where they went.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=岡市二洲|date=September 1933|title=怪談茨木附近|journal=郷土研究上方|volume=3巻|issue=33号|page=34|id=NCID: AN00045163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magic shows ==
The rokurokubi is also a kind of Japanese [[magic (illusion)|magic show tricks]] using curtains and life sized dolls without heads. It's reported that a doll without a head wearing a [[kimono]] in [[seiza]] is put in front of the curtain. There's a rope behind the curtain and a female performer connected to it who shows only her face. As she stands and squats, the fake neck would stretches and contracts, as if it were a rokurokubi.

Explanations and pictures about what's behind this trick were written in magazines of the [[Meiji period]] (1800s), giving a date for how early these shows first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;富田昭次 『絵はがきで見る日本近代』 青弓社 2005年 {{ISBN|4-7872-2016-0}} p.131 滑稽新聞 社発行の雑誌「絵葉書世界」（雑誌とは言っているが、絵葉書 の画集）の中に「見せ物の内幕」と題し、ろくろ首の仕掛けを暴く絵がある。絵師は、なべぞとあり、切手 を貼る所には、驚いている少年が描かれている&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time period when mystery phenomena were vigorously exposed by the scientifically minded, so for magic tricks to be revealed is fitting with the zeitgeist.

In the [[Taishō period|Taishō]] period, there were businesses arranging rokurokubi to appear in show tents in festivals and fairs at temples and shrines, and they were quite popular.&lt;ref name="笹間1994" /&gt;

== Similar tales from other nations ==
The type of rokurokubi whose necks separate from the rest of the body is said to have derived from stories of the Chinese yōkai, the ''[[hitōban]]'' (飛頭蛮) a yōkai whose head separates from the body and floats about.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt; Like the rokurokobi, the hitoban has a line around its neck.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt; Chinese stories also tell of a yōkai called a ''rakutō'' (落頭) whose head comes off and floats about while the torso remains at rest on the futon. There is a tale that in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, an [[Eastern Wu]] general, [[Zhu Huan]] employed a female servant who was a rakutō. It's said that she used its ears like wings. Another tale relates that in the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] era, there was a clan from the south called ''rakutōmin'' (落頭民) who could fly around in only their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=水木しげる|title=カラー版 続妖怪画談|year=1993|publisher=岩波書店|series=岩波新書|isbn=978-4-004-30288-9|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are legends of creatures including [[Palasik]], [[Kuyang]], and [[Leyak|Leak]] from Indonesia,  [[Penanggalan]] in Malaysia, and [[Krasue]] in Thailand. The heads of these creatures would separate from the body and float about with the [[entrails]] attached.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt;

The [[Chonchon]] is a mythical creature of South America which takes the form of a human head flying around in the air, sucking the life out of people.

The [[Manananggal]] is a creature of Philippines mythology. This female monster is slightly different since its whole body from the waist up detaches and grows giant bat-like wings.

The yōkai researcher, Tada Katsumi states that these stories arrived in Japan in the [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] to [[Azuchi–Momoyama period|Azuchi-Momoyama]] periods, when there was still trade with southern China and Southeast Asia. In the [[Edo period]], when Japan adopted an [[Sakoku|isolationist policy]] an original Japanese yōkai, the ''rokurokubi'' evolved.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt;

The '''''Rouen Cathedral''''' series was painted in the 1890s by French [[impressionist]] [[Claude Monet]]. The paintings in the series each capture the façade of the [[Rouen Cathedral]] at different times of the day and year, and reflect changes in its appearance under different lighting conditions.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kleiner |first1=Fred S. |title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective |date=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=0495573647 |page=656 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK_jTggtYl8C&amp;dq=Rouen+Cathedral+Monet&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=3 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
The ''Rouen Cathedral'' paintings, more than thirty in all, were made in 1892 and 1893 in [[Rouen]], [[Normandy]], then reworked in Monet’s studio in 1894. Monet rented spaces in Rouen across the street from the cathedral as his temporary studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pissarro |first1=Joachim |title=Monet's cathedral : Rouen, 1892-1894 |date=1990 |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |isbn=9780394588711 |edition= 1st American }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 he selected what he considered to be the twenty best paintings from the series for display at his Paris dealer’s gallery and sold eight of them before the exhibition was over. [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] visited the exhibition and praised the series highly.

Historically, the series was well-timed. In the early 1890s, France was seeing a revival of interest in Catholicism and the subject of one of its major cathedrals was well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Colour and Light: Fifty Impressionist and Post-Impressionist Works at the National Museum of Wales|first=Ann|last=Sumner|year=2005|page=86|publisher=National Museum of Wales|location=Cardiff|isbn=0-7200-0551-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from its religious significance, Rouen Cathedral &amp;ndash;built in the [[French Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]&amp;ndash; could be seen as representing all that was best in French history and culture, given that it was a style of architecture that was admired and adopted by many European countries during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Paul Hayes |last2=Monet |first2=Claude |last3=Boston |first3=Museum of Fine Arts |title=Monet in the '90s: The Series Paintings |date=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300049137 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ojp0NUShY4YC&amp;dq=Rouen+Cathedral+Monet&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=3 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting Light==
When Monet painted the ''Rouen Cathedral'' series, he had long since been impressed with the way light imparts to a subject a distinctly different character at different times of the day and the year and as atmospheric conditions change. For Monet, the effects of light on a subject became as important as the subject itself. His ''Series Paintings'', in which he painted many views of the same subject under different lighting conditions, are an attempt to illustrate the importance of light in our perception of a subject at a given time and place.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Robert Pelfrey, in ''Art and Mass Media'' wrote:

::By focusing on the same subject through a whole series of paintings, Monet was able to concentrate on recording visual sensations themselves. The subjects did not change, but the visual sensations – due to changing conditions of light – changed constantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall-Pelfrey |first1=Robert H. Pelfrey with Mary |title=Art and mass media |date=1985 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=978-0060451127 |page=166 |edition= 1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cathedral series was not Monet's first series of paintings of a single subject, but it was his most exhaustive. The subject matter was a change, however, for prior to this series, Monet had painted mostly landscapes. The cathedral allowed him to highlight the paradox between a seemingly permanent, solid structure and the ever-changing light which constantly plays with our perception of it. There were calls for the state to buy the entire series and exhibit them as a whole, but these calls were not heeded and the series was divided.

==Technique==
Painting the cathedral was a challenging task, even for Monet. Michael Howard, in his ''Encyclopedia of Impressionism'' writes:

::As always, the pictures gave him intense difficulties, which threw him into despair. He had vivid nightmares of the cathedral in various colors – pink, blue and yellow – falling upon him… [Monet wrote:] ‘Things don’t advance very steadily, primarily because each day I discover something I hadn’t seen the day before… In the end, I am trying to do the impossible.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howard |first1=Michael |title=Encyclopedia of impressionism |date=1997 |publisher=Thunder Bay Press |location=San Diego, Calif. |isbn=978-1571450333 |page=224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monet found that the thing he had set out to paint &amp;ndash; light &amp;ndash; was, because of its ever-changing nature and its extreme subtlety, an almost impossible thing to capture. He was assisted, however, by his ability to capture the essence of a scene quickly, then finish it later using a sketch combined with his memory of the scene. For these paintings, he used thick layers of richly textured paint, expressive of the intricate nature of the subject. Paul Hayes Tucker, in ''Claude Monet: Life and Art'' writes:

::Monet’s sensitivity to the natural effects he observed are just one factor that make these pictures so remarkable; the way he manipulates his medium contributes to their majesty as well. For the surfaces of these canvases are literally encrusted with paint that Monet built up layer upon layer like the masonry of the façade itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Paul Hayes |title=Claude Monet: Life and Art |date=1995 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300062982 |page=155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subtle interweaving of colors, the keen perception of the artist and the  use of texture all serve to create a series of shimmering images in light and color&amp;ndash;masterpieces worthy of the grandeur of their subject matter.

The '''Skagen Painters''' ({{lang-da|'''Skagensmalerne'''}}) were a group of Scandinavian artists who gathered in the village of [[Skagen]], the northernmost part of [[Denmark]], from the late 1870s until the turn of the century. Skagen was a summer destination whose scenery and quality of light attracted northern artists to paint ''[[en plein air]]'', emulating the French [[Impressionist]]s—though members of the Skagen colony were also influenced by [[realism (arts)|Realist]] movements such as the [[Barbizon school]]. They broke away from the rather rigid traditions of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]], espousing the latest trends that they had learned in [[Paris]]. Among the group were [[Anna Ancher|Anna]] and [[Michael Ancher]], [[Peder Severin Krøyer]], [[Holger Drachmann]], [[Karl Madsen]], [[Laurits Tuxen]], [[Marie Triepcke Krøyer Alfvén|Marie Krøyer]], [[Carl Locher]], [[Viggo Johansen]] and [[Thorvald Niss]] from Denmark, [[Oscar Björck]] and [[Johan Krouthén]] from Sweden, and [[Christian Krohg]] and [[Eilif Peterssen]] from Norway. The group gathered together regularly at the [[Brøndums Hotel|Brøndums Inn]].

Skagen, in the very north of [[Jutland]], was the largest fishing community in Denmark, with more than half of its population so engaged. Among the locals, fishermen were by far the most common subject for the Skagen painters. Skagen's long beaches were exploited in the group's landscapes; P.S. Krøyer, one of the best-known of the Skagen painters, was inspired by the light of the evening "[[Blue hour|Blue hour]]", which made the water and sky seem to optically merge. This is captured in one of his most famous paintings, ''[[Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife]]'' (1899). Although the painters had their own individual styles without any requirement to adhere to a common approach or manifest, one of their common interests was to paint scenes of their own social gatherings, playing cards, celebrating or simply eating together.

Michael Ancher drew attention to the attractions of the area when his ''[[Will He Round the Point?]]'' (1885) was purchased by [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]]. He married Anna Brøndum, the only member of the group from Skagen, who became a pioneering female artist at a time when women were not permitted to study at Denmark's Royal Academy. Today the [[Skagens Museum]], founded in the dining room at Brøndum's Hotel in October 1908, hosts many of their works of art, some 1,800 pieces in total. Many of the paintings have been digitized under the [[Google Art Project]] and are accessible online. Related exhibitions continue to be held; in 2008, the [[Arken Museum of Modern Art]] in Copenhagen presented "The Skagen Painters—In a New Light", and in 2013, the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]] in Washington, D.C. presented "A World Apart: Anna Ancher and the Skagen Art Colony".

==History==
[[File:Brøndums Hotel 1891-92.jpg|thumb|right|Dining room in Brøndums Hotel (ca. 1891) showing some of the group and the panel of their portraits]]

The first notable artist to paint in [[Skagen]] was [[Martinus Rørbye]] (1803–1848), one of the central figures of the [[Danish Golden Age|Golden Age of Danish Painting]]. His first visit was in 1833 but he returned towards the end of his life in 1847 and 1848. He is remembered in particular for his ''[[Men of Skagen on a Summer Evening in Fair Weather]]'' painted in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisWeilbach.do?kunstnerId=1049&amp;wsektion=alle|title=Martinus Rørbye|publisher=''Kunstindekx Danmark &amp; Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon''|language=Danish|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another marine painter, [[Vilhelm Melbye]] (1824–1882), visited Skagen in 1848, painting his [[:File:Vilhelm Melbye Udsigt over Skagen 1848-crop.jpg|''View over Skagen'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Vilhelm_Melbye|title=Vilhelm Melbye|publisher= ''Den Store Danske''|language=Danish|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karl Madsen, the painter [[Johan Peter Raadsig|Peter Raadsig]] (1806–1882) also visited the town on several occasions between 1862 and 1870, painting the dunes and the fishermen.&lt;ref name="Svanholm2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Svanholm|first=Lise|title=Skagenleksikon: malerne, modellerne, værkerne og stederne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gx11wFWqMSUC&amp;pg=PA27|year=2003|publisher=Gyldendal A/S|isbn=978-87-02-01947-6|pages=27, 47, 57–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian Blache]] (1838–1920), another marine painter, first visited Skagen in 1869 when he painted his [[:File:Blache Det grå fyr 1869.jpg|''Grey Lighthouse'']]. It was as a result of his influence that the poet and dramatist Holger Drachmann first visited the town in 1871.&lt;ref name="Svanholm2003"/&gt;

In the 1860s and 1870s, despite evolving trends in Europe, especially in Paris, embracing Realism and Impressionism, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts refused to change their approach, insisting their students should continue to paint in the preferred styles of Historicism and Neoclassicism.{{Sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=32}} Among those who were increasingly frustrated by this approach were Michael Ancher, Karl Madsen and Viggo Johansen who in the early 1870s were studying at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen. Madsen, who had already visited Skagen in 1871 while staying with his uncle in nearby [[Frederikshavn]], invited Ancher to join him there in 1874, to paint the local fishermen.{{Sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=54}} He became a friend of the Brøndum family who had a shop with a bar which was soon extended to become [[Brøndums Hotel|''Brøndums Gastgiveri'']], a [[guest house (lodging)|guest house]]. He was invited to their 15-year-old daughter Anna's [[confirmation]] and showed an immediate interest in her. The following year, he returned to Skagen with both Madsen and Viggo Johansen who had been strongly influenced by French Impressionism. In particular, Johansen began to paint open-air scenes combining Impressionism with Realism.&lt;ref name="Sandby"/&gt;

[[File:The Apostle (Carl Locher).jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl Locher]], ''Mail Coach on Skagen Beach'' (c. 1890)]]
In 1876 and especially in 1877, several other artists spent the summer in Skagen, using the Brøndums' house for accommodation and their frequent gatherings. Michael Ancher made Skagen his new home. He became engaged to Anna Brøndum in 1878 and married her in 1880. Their home then became a focal point for the artists, especially after King Christian IX bought Ancher's painting ''Will He Round the Point?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/samlingen/vaerkerne/michael-ancher/pynten/ |title=Michael Ancher: Vil han klare pynten? – Ca. 1880|publisher= Skagens Museum|language=Danish|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Ancher first took a serious interest in painting after the artists began to stay in her family's inn, leaving their paintings to dry in their rooms when they left for the day. She studied them carefully and in 1875 attended [[Vilhelm Kyhn]]'s art school in Copenhagen. She was later influenced by Christian Krohg who taught her the art of painting people in their everyday lives and making full use of colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/293/origin/170/ |title=Elisabeth Fabritius, "Anna Ancher"|publisher= ''Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon''|language=Danish|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krohg first came to Skagen in the summer of 1878, encouraged by Georg Brandes whom he had met in Berlin. He brought many of the latest international art trends with him, influencing the other members of the group. His encounters with the local population also exerted a strong influence on his own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/index.php?id=120 |title=Christian Krohg og Skagen|publisher=Skagens Museum|language=Danish|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ved Frokosten Krøyer 1883.jpg|thumb|P.S. Krøyer: ''Artists at Lunch'' (1883)]]
In 1882, the Anchers travelled abroad. While they were in [[Vienna]], they met P.S. Krøyer who informed them he would also be going to Skagen that year, despite the fact that Ancher was apparently not too keen to have him there. Krøyer, who had enjoyed close contacts with several Impressionist artists in [[Paris]], immediately became the central member and unofficial leader of the artists' colony. In 1883, he created the "Evening Academy" where the artists gathered to paint and discuss each other's work, often enjoying champagne.&lt;ref&gt;Alba Schwartz, "Skagen – Den nye Tid i Oplevelser og Indtryk", Skagens Museum, 1992, pp 117–120. {{ISBN|978-87-983631-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, the German painter [[Fritz Stoltenberg]] took photographs of the artists celebrating in the Anchers' garden, just after the couple had moved into their new home. One of these photos in particular inspired Krøyer to paint ''[[Hip, Hip, Hurrah!]]'', which took him four years to complete.&lt;ref name="Sandby"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/hip-hip-hurray/|title=Hip, Hip, Hurray!|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, the railway's arrival in Skagen not only led to the expansion of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists as they could no longer find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Mona Jensen (editor), "Danske kunstnerkolonier. Skagen. Fyn. Bornholm", Aarhus Kunstmuseums Forlag, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen continued to paint in Skagen until well into the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Two core members of the group, Drachmann and Krøyer, died in 1908 and 1909, bringing the traditional gatherings of the group to an end. There were nevertheless other painters, sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen painters, who continued to visit the area. They included [[Jørgen Aabye]], [[Tupsy Clement|Tupsy]] and [[Gad Frederik Clement]], [[Ella Heide]], [[Ludvig Karsten]], [[Frederik Lange]] and [[Johannes Wilhjelm]], some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later. [[Skagens Museum]] has a number of their works in its collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/kulturarv/museer/dokumenter/arbejdsplaner/Skagens_Museum.pdf|title=Skagens Museum: Insamling|publisher=Kulturarv.dk|language=Danish|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another notable artist who visited Skagen from 1906 was [[J.F. Willumsen]] who painted ''Children Bathing on Skagen Beach'' in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/udstillinger/tidligere-udstillinger/salon/willumsens-billede/|title=J.F. Willumsen: Badende børn på Skagen strand. 1909|publisher=Skagens Museum|language=Danish|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family relationships==
[[File:Marie krøyer p.s. krøyer.jpg|thumb|right|Marie Krøyer painted by her husband, P.S. Krøyer (1890)]]
The Skagen painters quickly began to form a close-knit community as relationships grew between the artists and the young women from the area. In 1880, Michael Ancher married Anna Brøndum from the guest house, Viggo Johansen married Martha Møller, Anna's cousin, and Karl Madsen married Helene Christensen, a schoolteacher. The [[Michael and Anna Ancher House|house]] the Anchers moved into in 1884 became a focus for the artists' colony, especially as the couple lived there all the year round. When their daughter [[Helga Ancher|Helga]] (the little girl in ''Hip, Hip, Hurrah!'') died in 1964, she left the house to a foundation which soon turned it into a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anchershus.dk/|title=Michael og Anna Anchers Hus / Saxilds Gaard|publisher= Anchershus.dk|language=Danish|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Johansens acquired a large family between 1881 and 1886: Ellen Henriette (daughter of Henriette, Martha's sister, who died during childbirth), Lars, Fritz, Gerda and Bodil. They can be seen dancing around the Christmas tree in Johansen's painting [[:File:Johansen Viggo - Radosne Boże Narodzenie.jpg|''Merry Christmas'']].{{sfn|Svanholm|2006|p=62}}

Another key figure in Skagen, P.S. Krøyer, married Marie Triepcke after falling in love with her in Paris in 1888.{{Sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=259}} The daughter of a prosperous German loomery engineer, she was said to be the most beautiful woman in Copenhagen. However, as the years went by, Krøyer's health began to deteriorate and Marie was increasingly unhappy with their marriage. The marriage finally ended in a divorce in 1905 when Marie became pregnant after an affair with the composer [[Hugo Alfvén]] whom she then married. Krøyer died in Skagen four years later, apparently as a result of mental illness.{{Sfn|Svanholm|2004|pp= 30–43}}

In 1901, after the death of his first wife Ursule, Laurits Tuxen married Frederikke Treschow, a Norwegian, and shortly afterwards purchased Madam Bendsen's house in Skagen where first Viggo and Martha Johansen and later Marie and P.S. Krøyer had stayed in the 1880s. He converted it into a stately summer residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensiden.dk/asp/page.asp?id=2 |title=Madam Bendsens gård|publisher=Skagen i gamle dage|language=Danish|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Michael Ancher and Laurits Tuxen died in 1927,{{sfn|Norman|1977|p=31}}{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=274}} Anna Ancher and Viggo Johansen in 1935.{{Sfn|Gaze|2013|p=154}}{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=96}}

==Members of the group==

The principal Danish painters included Karl Madsen, Laurits Tuxen, Marie Krøyer, Carl Locher, Viggo Johansen, Thorvald Niss, and most notably, Anna and Michael Ancher and Peder Severin Krøyer. There were also painters from the rest of Scandinavia including Oscar Björck and Johan Krouthén from Sweden and Christian Krohg and Eilif Peterssen from Norway. The gatherings in Skagen were not restricted to painters. The Danish writers [[Georg Brandes]], Holger Drachmann and [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] and the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén were also members of the group.&lt;ref name="Sandby"&gt;Vibeke Sandby, Pernille and Jens Agerholm, "Skagens trofaste veninde", Agenholm, 2000. {{Da icon}} {{ISBN|87-987939-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other artists also joined the Skagen Painters for shorter periods.

===Anna Ancher===
[[File:Michael Ancher, Anna Ancher.jpg|thumb|120px| [[Michael Ancher|Ancher]]'s ''Anna Ancher'' (1902)]] 
The only member of the group born in Skagen, Anna Ancher (1859–1935), was the daughter of Erik Brøndum, the owner of the grocery shop and guest house which later became Brøndums Hotel. Inspired by the artists who stayed there, she received her first lessons from Karl Madsen, Viggo Johansen and Michael Ancher. From 1875, she spent several winters in Copenhagen at Vilhelm Kyhn's school for women painters.&lt;ref name=smaa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/anna-ancher/|title=Anna Ancher (1859–1935) |publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=8 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of her portraits of family and friends as well as her skills as a colourist, she is considered to be one of Denmark's finest artists although her talents were not fully appreciated until after her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Anna_Kirstine_Ancher?highlight=anna%20ancher|title=Anna Ancher|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=9 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her works depict scenes from the home, children and women and religious life in Skagen. She now stands out as a pioneer at a time when women were not expected to become artists and were not admitted to the Royal Danish Academy.&lt;ref name=smaa/&gt; Unlike her husband, she adopted a style of Realism, inspired above all by Christian Krohg. Commenting on her ''[[:File:Anna Ancher - A blind woman in her room - Google Art Project.jpg|Blind Woman]]'' (1882) in which the face is illuminated in an otherwise dark portrait, Madsen pointed out that she was the first Danish artist to depict a sunbeam.{{Sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=69}} Her most cherished works include [[:File:Anna Ancher Pigen i koekkenet 1883-86.jpg|''Girl in the Kitchen'']] (1886), ''[[Sunlight in the Blue Room]]'' (1891) and [[:File:Mission Meeting at Fyrbakken in Skagen.jpg|''A Mission Meeting'']] (1903).

===Michael Ancher===

Michael Ancher (1849–1927), originally from the island of [[Bornholm]], was invited to Skagen in 1874 by his friend Karl Madsen with whom he was studying at the Academy. In 1880, he married Anna Brøndum and settled in Skagen. He achieved his artistic breakthrough in 1879 with the painting ''Will he Round the Point?'' which was bought by Christian IX. Several other works by Ancher depict Skagen's heroic fishermen and their dramatic experiences at sea, combining Realism and with classical composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisWeilbach.do?kunstnerId=133&amp;wsektion=alle|title=Michael Ancher|publisher=''Kunstindeks Danmark &amp; Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon''|accessdate=4 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/michael-ancher/|title=Michael Ancher (1849–1927)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=4 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key works include ''[[:File:Redningsbåden køres gennem klitterne.jpg|The Lifeboat is Carried Through The Dunes]]'' (1883), [[:File:Mandskabet reddet (Michael Ancher).jpg|''The Crew Are Saved'']] (1894) and [[:File:Ancher02 den druknede.jpg|''The Drowned Man'']] (1896). He also painted portraits and landscapes, especially of Skagen's Østerby district. Many of his paintings can be seen in Skagens Museum.

===P.S. Krøyer===
[[File:P S Krøyer 1897 - Selvportræt.jpg|thumb|120px|P.S. Krøyer: Self-portrait (1899)]]

Born in [[Stavanger]], Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909) came to Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer, finally settling there after marrying Marie Triepcke in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/ps-kroeyer/|title=P.S.

In Skagen, he became one of the central and most enthusiastic members of the group of painters, creating masterpieces emphasizing the special effects of the local light in his beach scenes while painting several memorable works recording the lively gatherings of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Peder_Severin_Kr%C3%B8yer?highlight=p.s.%20kr%C3%B8yer|title=P.S.

===Viggo Johansen===
[[File:Johansen viggo-self portrait with palette in hand and wife martha.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Viggo Johansen: ''Self-portrait with wife Martha'' (c. 1895)]]
Viggo Johansen (1851–1935), who had studied at the Royal Academy with Michael Ancher (also without graduating), first went to Skagen in 1875. An active member of the group, he married Anna Ancher's cousin Martha Møller in 1880. From 1885, he exhibited in Paris where he was inspired by [[Claude Monet]]. His paintings took on lighter tones as he had noted the absence of black in the works of the French artists and considered his own earlier works too dark by comparison.{{Sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=99}} Monet's use of colour is reflected in his painting [[:File:Christian bindslev er syg.jpg|''Christian Bindslev is ill'']] (1890).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Viggo_Johansen|title=Viggo Johansen|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=8 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work displays stronger contrasts than his earlier paintings, depicting the red-bearded Christian looking out towards the light at the foot of his bed where the flaming gold and white sunlight streams down onto the little blue cupboard on the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Maler/Viggo_Johansen|title=Viggo Johansen|publisher=''Dansk Biografisk Leksikon|accessdate=9 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works he painted in Skagen are [[:File:Viggo Johansen - Kitchen interior.

Krøyer in 1891, Johansen's relationship with the Anchers was strained and he and his family did not visit Skagen for several years but finally returned in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/viggo-johansen/|title=Viggo Johansen (1851–1935)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=8 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, he became a professor at the Royal Academy where he was director from 1911 to 1914.&lt;ref name=dblvj/&gt;

===Carl Locher===
[[File:P.S. Krøyer - Carl Locher - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|120px|P.S. Krøyer: ''Carl Locher'' (1885)]]
Somewhat forgotten today, Carl Locher (1851–1915) was one of the earlier visitors to Skagen. Holgen Drachmann, who had taught him before he attended the Royal Academy, persuaded him to go there in 1872.&lt;ref name=smcl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/carl-locher/|title=Carl Locher (1851–1915)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=9 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially interested in [[marine painting]], Locher adopted a realist impressionistic approach, influenced by the time he spent with [[Léon Bonnat]] in Paris during the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Carl_Locher|title=Carl Locher|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=9 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stickler for perfection, especially in his drawings, his works cover the transition from sailing ships to steamships and from the original Skagen to the evolving tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/faglitteratur_boger/ECE1239717/skagensmaler-var-for-perfekt-til-at-blive-kendt/|title=Skagensmaler var for perfekt til at blive kendt|author=Henrik Holm|publisher=''Politiken''|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=9 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings include [[:File:Carl Locher - Fishing cutters in the moonlit night - Google Art Project.jpg|''Fishing Cutters in the Moonlit Night'']], 1888, [[:File:Carl Locher - The lightship at Skagen Reef - Google Art Project.jpg|''The Lightship at Skagen Reef'']] (1892)  and above all [[:File:The Apostle (Carl Locher).jpg|''The Mail Coach'']] (c. 1890) which depicts the horse-drawn carriage which until the railway reached Skagen in 1890 was the way travellers arrived there from Frederikshavn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-art-works/carl-locher/the-mail-coach/#c2271|title=Carl Locher: The mail coach - 1885|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=9 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Locher built a house overlooking the beach at Skagen Østerby where he painted until he died of heart trouble in 1913.&lt;ref name=smcl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Maler/Carl_Locher|title=Carl Locher|publisher=''Dansk Biografisk Leksikon''|accessdate=9 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laurits Tuxen===
[[File:Laurits Tuxen - Self-portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Laurits Tuxen: self-portrait (1911)]]

Born and raised in Copenhagen, Laurits Tuxen (1853–1927) studied at the Royal Danish Academy together with P.S. Krøyer where he was considered to be one of the best painters. In 1875, he began to study in Paris in Léon Bonnat's studio with whom he also worked in subsequent years. His ''Suzanna i Badet'' (1878), first painted in Paris, was warmly received in the Copenhagen spring exhibition in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Maler/L._Tuxen|title=Laurits Tuxen|publisher=''Dansk Biografisk Leksikon''|accessdate=9 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first visited Skagen in 1870 but after a few more visits in the 1870s, did not return until 1901. After his first wife died of tuberculosis, he married the Norwegian Frederikke Treschow and bought a house in Skagen.

===Christian Krohg===
[[File:P.S. Krøyer - Christian Krohg - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|120px|P.S. Krøyer: ''Christian Krohg'' (1888)]]

The Norwegian Christian Krohg (1852–1925) first visited Skagen with Frits Thaulow in 1879.&lt;ref name=dsdck&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Kunstnere%2c_udland/Kunstnere%2c_nordiske_uden_danske/Christian_Krohg|title=Christian Krohg|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=10 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important figures in Norwegian art, he first studied law but his interest in art was triggered by his friendship with fellow student Eilif Peterssen. He attended [[Johan Fredrik Eckersberg|J.F. Eckersberg]]'s painting school in Christiania (now Oslo) before moving to [[Karlsruhe]] and Berlin where he studied under [[Karl Gussow]], specializing in figure painting in the new idiom of Realism. In Berlin, he also developed a friendship with Georg Brandes. In 1879 he returned to Christiania before travelling to Skagen where he achieved his artistic breakthrough, attracted by the simple lives of the local fishermen. Depicting a fisherman at sea, his [[:File:Christian Krohg - Babord litt.jpg|''Babord litt'']] (1879) is considered to be one of his early masterpieces.&lt;ref name=nblck/&gt; His association with Ancher, Krøyer and the other members of the colony had a marked effect on his style as can be seen in the works he painted on returning to Norway.&lt;ref name=nblck&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbl.snl.no/Christian_Krohg_-_2|title=Christian Krohg - 2|publisher=Norsk Biografisk Leksikon|accessdate=10 August 2014 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to Paris in 1881–82, where was influenced by [[Édouard Manet]] and the Impressionist movement.&lt;ref name=dsdck/&gt; His experience of French art can be seen in several of his later Skagen paintings, including [[:File:C Krohg-Trett.jpg|''Tired'']] (1885) and [[:File:Christian Krohg - Braiding her Hair - Google Art Project.jpg|''Braiding Her Hair'']] (1888) in which the mother and child unusually have their backs facing the observer.{{Sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=81}} His lighter palette with bold brushstrokes and contrasting tones of blue, red and green give the painting a deeper texture.&lt;ref name=nblck/&gt;

===Marie Krøyer===
[[File:MarieKroyer-selfportrait.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Marie Krøyer: Self-portrait (c. 1900)]]
Marie Krøyer née Triepcke (1867–1940) came from a well-to-do German family living in Copenhagen. From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after training privately she went to Paris to continue her studies. It was there, in early 1889, that she met Krøyer who immediately fell madly in love with her. Although he was 16 years her senior, the couple married that summer. In 1891, they settled in Skagen, giving Krøyer ample opportunity to paint portraits of Marie, both indoors and especially on the beach. The summers Krøyer spent together with his wife in the 1890s were clearly a source of inspiration for him, especially as Marie had a strong sense of beauty herself, often quoting [[Keats]]' "[[Ode on a Grecian Urn|Beauty is truth, truth beauty]]".{{Sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=132}} 
As a result of the periods of mental illness Krøyer experienced from 1900, the marriage fell apart. In 1912, she married Hugo Alfvén who had also been taken by her beauty. It is believed Marie was reluctant to paint after meeting Krøyer whom she looked up to as a far more competent artist. A few of her works have nevertheless survived, including ''[[:File:Interioer med syende pige.jpg|Interior with Girl Sewing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/170/bio/546/|title=Marie Krøyer (1867–1940)|author=Lise Svanholm|publisher=''Dansk kvindebiografisk leksikon''|accessdate=9 September 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisWeilbach.do?kunstnerId=3784&amp;wsektion=alle|title=Marie Krøyer|publisher=Kunstindeks Danmark &amp; Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon|accessdate=9 September 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by the [[Modern Breakthrough]] movement led by Georg Brandes, the early painters were attracted by Skagen's village community, its seascapes and culture, all far removed from the effects of industrialization on city life. 
They all recognized the special light they encountered in Skagen, a combination of its location in the far north of Denmark and, by some accounts, the effects of sand in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altomhistorie.dk/artikler/skagensmalerne/|title=Skagensmalerne|publisher=Alt om Historie|accessdate=12 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Their painting styles evolved from the formal [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] approach of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy]] in Copenhagen to embrace the evolving European trends in Realism and Impressionism, including the ''plein air'' approach adopted by the Barbizon School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nmwa.org/sites/default/files/shared/anna_ancher_press_release_final.pdf|title=A World Apart: Anna Ancher and the Skagen Art Colony|publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts|date=12 December 201|accessdate=12 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bfpn/hd_bfpn.htm|title=The Barbizon School: French Painters of Nature|publisher=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|accessdate=21 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists were especially attracted by the opportunities for painting ''[[en plein air]]'', focusing on the activities of the local fishermen and their modest cottages. In the absence of any rules within the colony, the painters freely developed their individual styles. Nevertheless, one of the interests they shared was to paint scenes of their own social gatherings, whether playing cards, celebrating or simply eating together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/|title=Collection|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=12 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arken.dk/media%281548,1030%29|title=Skagensmalerne|publisher=Arken|accessdate=13 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By adopting the plein-air approach, the painters were able to create their works in the open, immediately capturing the special effects of light and colour on their subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/plein-air-painting/#c2004|title=Plein air painting|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=12 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishermen were considered an especially interesting group in view of their dangerous work and their heroic behaviour. [[Lars Kruse]], depicted by Michael Ancher, was famous for his success in rescuing a number of sailors who would otherwise have drowned. P.S. Krøyer's works were less dramatic, depicting fishermen pulling their nets in after a day at sea. While some of the paintings portrayed authentic occurrences, the artists often paid the fishermen to act as models, supplementing their modest incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-fishermen-scene/#c2008|title=The fishermen scene|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=12 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krøyer's works also included scenes of walks on the beach, romantic evenings in the moonlight and portraits of his wife Marie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/skoleservice/undervisningsmateriale/storvaerk-paa-skagen/ps-kroeyer/|title=P.S. Krøyer|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=13 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time went by, Krøyer increasingly painted "moods", works which depicted the special atmosphere of the "Blue Hour" which developed in the evening as the sky merged with the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/exhibitions/former-exhibitions/the-blue-hour/|title=Den Blaa Time|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=20 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his landscapes and family portraits, Laurits Tuxen is remembered for painting the flowers in his garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/samlingen/kunstnerne/laurits-tuxen/|title=Laurits Tuxen (1853–1927)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=13 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Ancher's paintings, on the other hand, focused on interiors of the home, including women and children, in a more abstract style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/skoleservice/undervisningsmateriale/storvaerk-paa-skagen/ps-kroeyer/|title=Anna Ancher|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=13 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ann-berit.dk/5.klasse/praktiske%20gris/Skagensmalerne.pdf|title=Skagensmalerne|publisher=ann-berit.dk |accessdate=13 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skagens Museum==
{{Main|Skagens Museum}}
[[File:Skagens museum.jpg|thumb|left|Skagens Museum located in the old garden of Brøndums Hotel]]
Skagens Museum was founded in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel in October 1908.{{Sfn|Svanholm|2006|p=230}} Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, [[Degn Brøndum]], proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and Anna Ancher's brother, and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen were elected to form the first board of governors. After P.S. Krøyer's death in 1909, his house in Skagen Plantation was used as a museum. In 1919, Degn Brøndum donated the old hotel's garden to Skagens Museum as a site for a new building. Work started in 1926 and was completed in September 1928 when the new museum was officially opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/index.php?id=75|title=Museets historie|language=Danish|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor, architect Jacob Blegvad, who also planned the later extension to the museum inaugurated in 1989. In 1997, the museum administration moved into the Technical School. Today Skagens Museum has more than 1,800 works of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/index.php?id=7&amp;L=2 "Skagens Museum"], Retrieved 19 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the museum's paintings have been digitized under the [[Google Art Project]] and are accessible online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/skagens-museum?projectId=art-project&amp;hl=en "Skagens Museum"], Google Art Project.

(film)|Hip Hip Hurra!]]'' by the Swedish director [[Kjell Grede]], inspired by Krøyer's famous painting.&lt;ref name="QvistBagh2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Qvist|first1=Per Olov|last2=Bagh|first2=Peter von|title=Guide to the Cinema of Sweden and Finland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rnpoR8VMUNoC&amp;pg=PA78|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30377-7|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the film ''[[The Passion of Marie]]'', directed by [[Bille August]], covered Marie's increasingly difficult relationship with her husband P.S. Krøyer. The film is based on the book ''Balladen om Marie'' by Anastassia Arnold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kino.dk/film/m/ma/marie-kroeyer|title=Marie Krøyer|publisher=Kino.dk|language=Danish|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Anastassia|title=Balladen om Marie: en biografi om Marie Krøyer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0xockgw4uQC|year=2010|publisher=Rosinante|isbn=978-87-638-1229-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==

There have been a number of exhibitions of the Skagen Painters in recent years. In 2008, the [[Arken Museum of Modern Art]] in Copenhagen presented "The Skagen Painters — In a New Light", contrasting the paintings depicting the artists with those of the fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arken.dk/content/us/art/exhibitions/past_exhibitions/2008|title=Past Exhibitions: 2008|publisher=Arken|accessdate=16 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Hirschsprung Collection|Hirschsprung Museum]] in Copenhagen succeeded in arranging the largest exhibition of Krøyer's work titled : "Krøyer—i internationalt lys" (Krøyer—in international light), with works from museums and private collections in France, Germany, the United States and Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/udstilling/den-hidtil-stoerste-kroeyer-udstilling-aabner-i-koebenhavn#what:Udstilling|title=Den hidtil største Krøyer-udstilling åbner i København|publisher=AOK|date=15 November 2011|accessdate=16 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]] in Washington, D.C. presented "A World Apart: Anna Ancher and the Skagen Art Colony" in 2013. It was the largest exhibition of Anna Ancher's paintings ever held in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nmwa.org/exhibitions/world-apart|title=A World Apart|publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts|accessdate=16 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Skagens Museum, which frequently presents new aspects of the work of the Skagen Painters, concentrated its efforts on "Laurits Tuxen—colour, countryside and crown", presenting many works held in private collections illustrating the artist's involvement in establishing Kunstnernes Studieskole (The Artists' School of Study) in Copenhagen as well as his work as a court painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/exhibitions/|title=Laurits Tuxen — colour, countryside and crown: Skagens Museum - 3 May - 14.

A major exhibition of paintings by the Skagen Painters titled ''Michael Ancher – P.S. Krøyer: Venner og Rivaler'' (Friends and Rivals) is to be held at [[Arken Museum of Modern Art|Arken]], Copenhagen from 27 September 2014 to 12 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arken.dk/content/dk/kunst/udstillinger/kommende_udstillinger|title=Kommende udstillinger|publisher=Arken|accessdate=28 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''slide chart''' is a hand-held device, usually of paper, cardboard, or plastic, for conducting simple calculations or looking up information.
A circular slide chart is sometimes referred to as a wheel chart or [[volvelle]].

Unlike other hand-held mechanical calculating devices such as [[slide rules]] and [[addiator]]s, which have been replaced by electronic calculators and computer software, wheel charts and slide charts have survived to the present time. There are a number of companies who design and manufacture these devices.

Unlike the general-purpose mechanical calculators, slide charts are usually devoted to carrying out a particular specialized calculation, or displaying information on a single product or a particular process. For example, the "CurveEasy" wheel chart displays information related to spherical geometry calculations and the Prestolog calculator is used for cost/profit calculations.  Another example of a wheel chart is the [[planisphere]], which shows the location of stars in the sky for a given location, date, and time.

Slide charts are often associated with particular sports, political campaigns or commercial companies. For example, a pharmaceutical company may create wheel charts printed with their company name and product information for distribution to medical practitioners.

Slide charts are common collectables.

A '''strophe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|r|oʊ|f|iː}}) is a poetic term originally referring to the first part of the [[ode]] in [[Ancient Greek tragedy]], followed by the [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]]. The term has been extended to also mean a structural division of a poem containing [[stanza]]s of varying line length. Strophic poetry is to be contrasted with poems composed line-by-line non-stanzaically, such as Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poems]] or English [[blank verse]], to which the term ''[[stichic]]'' applies.

In its original Greek setting, "strophe, antistrophe and epode were a kind of [[stanza]] framed only for the music," as [[John Milton]] wrote in the preface to ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', with the strophe chanted by a [[Greek chorus]] as it moved from right to left across the scene.

==Etymology==
Strophe (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:στροφή|στροφή]], "turn, bend, twist") is a concept in [[poetry|versification]] which properly means a turn, as from one [[Foot (prosody)|foot]] to another, or from one side of a chorus to the other.

==Poetic structure==
In a more general sense, the strophe is a pair of [[stanza]]s of alternating form on which the structure of a given poem is based, with the strophe usually being identical with the stanza in modern poetry and its arrangement and recurrence of rhymes giving it its character. But the Greeks called a combination of verse-periods a system, giving the name "strophe" to such a system only when it was repeated once or more in unmodified form.

A simple form of Greek strophe is the Sapphic strophe. Like all Greek verse, it is composed of alternating long and short syllables (symbolized by '''—''' for long, '''u''' for short and '''x''' for either long or short) in this case arranged in the following manner:&lt;ref&gt;William S. Annis. Introduction to Greek Meter. Aoidoi.org January 2006. [http://www.aoidoi.org/articles/meter/intro.pdf. Page 11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''— u — x — u u — u — —'''

'''— u — x — u u — u — —'''

'''— u — x — u u — u — x — u u — —'''

Far more complex forms are found in the odes of [[Pindar]] and the choral sections of [[Greek drama]].

In choral poetry, it is common to find the strophe followed by a metrically identical [[antistrophe]], which may – in Pindar and other [[epinician]] poets – be followed in turn by a metrically dissimilar [[epode]],&lt;ref&gt;Edwin D. Floyd. "Some more or less technical observations on Greek rhythm." class material for University of Pittsburgh: Classics 1130. http://www.pitt.edu/~edfloyd/Class1130/strophe.html accessed January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; creating an ''AAB'' form.

==Origins and development==
It is said that [[Archilochus of Paros|Archilochus]] first created the strophe by binding together systems of two or three lines. But it was the [[Greece|Greek]] ode-writers who introduced the practice of strophe-writing on a large scale, and the art was attributed to [[Stesichorus]], although it is likely that earlier poets were acquainted with it. The arrangement of an [[ode]] in a splendid and consistent artifice of strophe, [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] was carried to its height by [[Pindar]].

==Variant forms==
With the development of Greek [[Meter (poetry)|prosody]], various peculiar strophe-forms came into general acceptance, and were made celebrated by the frequency with which leading poets employed them. Among these were the ''Sapphic,'' the ''Elegiac,'' the ''Alcaic,'' and the ''Asclepiadean'' strophe, all of them prominent in Greek and Latin verse. The briefest and the most ancient strophe is the ''dactylic distych,'' which consists of two verses of the same class of rhythm, the second producing a melodic counterpart to the first.

==Reproductions==
The forms in modern English verse which reproduce most exactly the impression aimed at by the ancient odestrophe are the elaborate rhymed stanzas of such poems as [[John Keats|Keats]]' ''[[wikisource:Ode to a Nightingale|Ode to a Nightingale]]'' or [[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[wikisource:The Scholar-Gipsy|The Scholar-Gipsy]]''.

A strophic form of poetry called [[Muwashshah]] developed in [[Andalucia]] as early as the 9th century C.E, which then spread to North Africa and the Middle East. Muwashshah was typically in classical Arabic, with the refrain sometimes in the local dialect.

==Contemporary usage==
The term strophe is used in modern and post-modern criticism, to indicate "long non-isomorphic units".&lt;ref&gt;Page 1360, Entry 'STROPHE', The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics: Fourth Edition, edited by Stephen Cushman, Clare Cavanagh, Jahan Ramazani, Paul Rouzer&lt;/ref&gt; The term "stanza [is used] for more regular ones" (ibid). This appropriation of the ancient term is useful, as contemporary poetry is a frequent turns (the original meaning of Strophe), and it avoids relying upon the invention of new terminology such as 'word clumps'.

[[Image:BuscotParkSaloonView.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View of the Saloon at Buscot Park showing two of the major panels – ''The Garden Court'' and ''The Rose Bower'' – in their context between the adjoining panels]]
'''''The Legend of Briar Rose''''' is the title of a series of paintings by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]] which were completed between 1885 and 1890. The four original paintings – '''''The Briar Wood''''', '''''The Council Chamber''''', '''''The Garden Court''''' and '''''The Rose Bower''''' – and an additional ten adjoining panels, are located at [[Buscot Park]] in [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]].

The four major panels were first exhibited at Agnew's Gallery in [[Bond Street]], [[London]] in 1890. They were acquired by [[Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon|Alexander Henderson]], later to become the Lord Faringdon, for Buscot Park. When Burne-Jones visited the house and saw the paintings in their new setting he decided to extend the frames of each of the four paintings and fill in the gaps with joining panels which continued the rose motif from the main paintings.

==Major panels==
Each major panel measures 49 by 98¼ inches but the ten joining panels vary in width. The paintings do not tell a sequential story but record the same moment in each location.

===''The Briar Wood''===
[[Image:Briar Wood Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Briar Wood'',]]
The painting depicts the discovery of the sleeping soldiers by a Knight. In their slumber they have become completed entwined by the barbed thorns of the [[Rosa rubiginosa|Briar rose]].

Running beneath each of the major panels is an inscription of a poem by [[William Morris]], under ''The Briar Wood'' the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The fateful slumber floats and flows&lt;br&gt;
About the tangle of the rose;&lt;br&gt;
But lo! the fated hand and heart&lt;br&gt;
To rend the slumberous curse apart!" &lt;ref name="vic"&gt;[http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/gallery/buscot_park.htm Buscot Park, Faringdon, Oxfordshire. The Home of The Briar Rose. The Most Complete Cycle of Paintings by Edward Burne-Jones] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504110126/http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/gallery/buscot_park.htm |date=2007-05-04 }} at Victorian Art in Britain.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Council Chamber''===
[[Image:The Council Chamber Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The Council Chamber'']]
The painting shows the scene in the Council chamber. The members of the council sleep, as does the King who is slumped on his throne. Under the draped curtains and through the window further soldiers can be seen sleeping.

Under ''The Council Chamber'', the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The threat of war, the hope of peace,&lt;br&gt;
The Kingdoms peril and increase&lt;br&gt;
Sleep on, and bide the latter day&lt;br&gt;
When Fate shall take her chain away." &lt;ref name="vic"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The Garden Court''===
[[Image:The Garden Court Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Garden Court'']]
The painting shows the weavers having fallen asleep at their [[loom]]. The walls of the castle form the backdrop to the painting as do arches of roses. 

Under ''The Garden Court'', the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The maiden pleasance of the land&lt;br&gt;
Knoweth no stir of voice or hand,&lt;br&gt;
No cup the sleeping waters fill,&lt;br&gt;
The restless shuttle lieth still." &lt;ref name="vic"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The Rose Bower''===
[[Image:The Rose Bower Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The Rose Bower'']]
The sleeping beauty lies on her bed surrounded by her slumbering attendants. The rose is seen encircling the drapery in the background

Under ''The Rose Bower'', the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here lies the hoarded love, the key&lt;br&gt;
To all the treasure that shall be;&lt;br&gt;
Come fated hand the gift to take&lt;br&gt;
And smite this sleeping world awake." &lt;ref name="vic"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Subject==
The paintings depict a moment in the story of "[[Sleeping Beauty]]", the title of the series coming from the version presented by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in their collection of 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Grimms' Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/stories/littlebriarose.html "Little Briar-Rose"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related works==
Burne-Jones created two other series of paintings on the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buscot-park.com/gallery/pic_035.html Paintings at Buscot page 3]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Small Briar Rose series|''Small Briar Rose'' series]] was completed before the Buscot Park series. All three paintings –  ''The Briar Wood, The Council Chamber, The Rose Bower'' – are now in the [[Ponce Museum of Art|Museo de Arte de Ponce]], Puerto Rico.
*The [[Third Briar Rose series]] was completed after the Buscot Park series. The three paintings have been split between three collections. ''The Garden Court'' is in [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]], ''The Council Chamber'' is in the [[Delaware Art Museum]], Wilmington and ''The Rose Bower'' is in the [[Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery|Hugh Lane Gallery of Modern Art]], Dublin.

'''The Plastic Club''' is an arts organization located in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Founded in 1897, the Plastic Club is one of the oldest art clubs in the United States. It is located on the 200 block of Camac Street, the "Little Street of Clubs" that was a cultural destination in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hiddencityphila.org/2014/03/little-clubs-on-a-wooden-street/|title=Little Clubs On A Wooden Street {{!}} Hidden City Philadelphia|website=hiddencityphila.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, the club's membership also includes men.&lt;ref name=HSP /&gt;

==History==
The Plastic Club was founded by art educator [[Emily Sartain]]. It was founded as an arts organization for women to promote collaboration and members' works, partly in response to the [[Philadelphia Sketch Club]], an exclusively male arts club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Hook|first=Bailey|date=2009-01-01|title=The Early Career of Violet Oakley, Illustrator|jstor=40605220|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=30|issue=1|pages=29–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first President was the etcher [[Blanche Dillaye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Croly|first1=Jane Cunningham|title=The History of the Women's Club Movement in America|date=1898|publisher=Henry G.

{{blockquote|All passes. Art alone&lt;br /&gt;Enduring stays to us;&lt;br /&gt;The Bust outlasts the throne,—&lt;br /&gt;The Coin, Tiberius&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruedig|first1=Reagan Baydoun|title=The Plastic Club of Philadelphia: A Site Management Study and Building Analysis|date=2007|page=4|url=http://www.plasticclub.org/Thesis-Revised.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Womendesignersof00ston 0053.jpg|left|thumb|430x430px|Insignia of The Plastics Club]]
The Plastic Club insignia was designed by [[Elisabeth Hallowell Saunders|Elisabeth M. Halloway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/womendesignersof00ston/page/36?q=Elisabeth+M.+Hallowell|title=Women designers of book-plates|last=Stone|first=Wilbur Macey|publisher=Randolph R. Beam|year=1902|isbn=|location=|pages=36|lccn=21001867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club offered art classes, social events, and exhibitions. Its annual masquerade party was called "the Rabbit."&lt;ref name=HSP&gt;[https://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaid3106plasticclub.pdf ''The Plastic Club.''] The Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

Early members included [[Elenore Abbott|Elenore Plaisted Abbott]], Paula Himmelsbach Balano, [[Cecilia Beaux]], [[Fern Coppedge]], [[Elizabeth Shippen Green]], [[Charlotte Harding]], [[Frances Tipton Hunter]], [[Violet Oakley]], [[Emily Sartain|Emily]] and Harriet Sartain, [[Jessie Willcox Smith]], and [[Alice Barber Stephens]], many of whom had been students of [[Howard Pyle]].&lt;ref name=HSP /&gt;&lt;ref name="May" /&gt; When the fall exhibition was held in 1898, the works of Pyle's former students—[[Elizabeth Fearne Bonsall]], Elizabeth Shippen Green, Jessie Willcox Smith, Charlotte Harding, Violet Oakley, and Angela De Cora—were singled out.&lt;ref name="May" /&gt;

In 1918, the club was involved in the founding of the Philadelphia School of Occupational Therapy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/loc.ark:/13960/t3ws95r99|title=Philadelphia in the world war, 1914-1919.|date=1922-01-01|publisher=New York :}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the connection between [[occupational therapy]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in the United States between the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="peloquin2005"&gt;Peloquin, S.

In 1991 the organization opened its membership to include men. During the 1990s the club also sought to attract art students, offering free membership to two recent graduates a year.&lt;ref name="HSP" /&gt;

The Plastic Club building at 247 South Camac Street was added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruedig|first1=Reagan Baydoun|title=The Plastic Club of Philadelphia: A Site Management Study and Building Analysis|date=2007|page=9|url=http://www.plasticclub.org/Thesis-Revised.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vernacular painting in China''' is a realistic, folk depiction of scenes from everyday domestic life.

The term is often applied to paintings that were frequently displayed in [[Qing dynasty|High Qing China]] during the New Year and birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Michael G.|date=2010|title=Pictures for Use and Pleasure: Vernacular Painting in High Qing China (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/479044|journal=China Review International|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=299–303|doi=10.1353/cri.2010.0072|issn=1527-9367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2010 book ''Pictures for Use and Pleasure'', art historian [[James Cahill (art historian)|James Cahill]] defines the term as "a great body of painting, created over the centuries by studio artists working in the cities, artists who produced pictures as required for diverse everyday domestic and other uses."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pictures for use and pleasure : vernacular painting in high Qing China|last=Cahill|first=James|date=2010|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520258570|location=Berkeley|oclc=449860109}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|3}} These paintings were often created on silk,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhmaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA274|title=The Qing Dynasty and Traditional Chinese Culture|last=Smith|first=Richard J.|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442221949|location=|pages=274|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pieces created for women were known for depicting "a range of topics not dealt with in literati painting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Chinese Art|last=Murck|first=Alfreda|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118885215|editor-last=Powers|editor-first=rtin J.|pages=455–473|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118885215.ch22|editor-last2=Tsiang|editor-first2=Katherine R.|chapter = Words in Chinese Painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings revealed Chinese life and the workings of Chinese society, Vernacular paintings were frequently created by master artists with only small prestige in city studios. They also differed from other paintings made during the era in that they were seen as functional and frequently lacked inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWu-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT872|title=A Companion to Chinese Art|last=Powers|first=Martin J.|last2=Tsiang|first2=Katherine R.|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118885208|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the culture of the time "professed to despise functionalism."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3-4}} As Chinese connoiseurs preferred paintings where the artist's brushwork skill, as well as their feelings and temperament, showed in the art, these paintings were seen as lesser in value and considered to be irrelevant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some of the elements in Vernacular Paintings, such as the use of paintings for celebrations and life events such as weddings and birthdays, would later be co-opted by some of the more elite art styles such as Shanghai painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pESTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|title=Art Worlds: Artists, Images, and Audiences in Late Nineteenth-Century Shanghai|last=Wue|first=Roberta|date=2014|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=9789888208463|location=|pages=54|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
