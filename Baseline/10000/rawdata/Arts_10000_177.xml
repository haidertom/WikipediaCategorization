'''Achaemenid architecture''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: معماری هخامنشیان) includes all architectural achievements of the [[Achaemenid]] [[Persian people|Persians]] manifesting in construction of spectacular cities used for governance and inhabitation ([[Persepolis]], [[Susa]], [[Ecbatana]]), temples made for worship and social gatherings (such as [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] temples), and [[mausoleums]] erected in honor of fallen kings (such as the burial tomb of [[Cyrus the Great]]). The quintessential feature of Persian architecture was its eclectic nature with elements of Assyrian, Egyptian, Median and Asiatic Greek all incorporated, yet producing a unique Persian identity seen in the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to study architecture|author =Charles Henry Caffin|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|year=1917|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnoWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achaemenid architecture is academically classified under [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]] in terms of its style and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dictionary of Iranian Traditional Architectural Terms (Persian: فرهنگ واژه‌های معماری سنتی ایران) |author=Fallah'far, Sa'id |publisher=Kamyab Publications |year=2010 |pages=44 |isbn=978-964-350-316-1 |url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2010342544 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713082632/http://lccn.loc.gov/2010342544 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achaemenid architectural heritage, beginning with the expansion of the empire around 550 B.C.E., was a period of artistic growth that left an extraordinary architectural legacy ranging from Cyrus the Great's solemn tomb in [[Pasargadae]] to the splendid structures of the opulent city of [[Persepolis]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Architecture|author =Marco Bussagli|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2005|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fMfCkY6-9joC&amp;pg=PA211|isbn=9781845110895}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the [[Sassanid empire|second Persian Empire]], the [[Sassanid dynasty]] (224–624 C.E.), revived Achaemenid tradition by construction of temples dedicated to fire, and monumental palaces.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

Perhaps the most striking extant structures to date are the ruins of [[Persepolis]], a once opulent city established by the Achaemenid king, [[Darius the Great]] for governmental and ceremonial functions, and also acting as one of the empire's four capitals. Persepolis, would take 100 years to complete and would finally be ransacked and burnt by the troops of [[Alexander the Great]] in 330 B.C.E.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient cities: the archaeology of urban life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome|author =Charles Gates|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=186|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8aLb5pnm1j4C&amp;pg=PA186|isbn=9780415121828}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar architectural infrastructures were also erected at [[Susa]] and [[Ecbatana]] by Darius the Great, serving similar functions as [[Persepolis]], such as reception of foreign dignitaries and delegates, performance of imperial ceremonies and duties, and also housing the kings.

==Pasargadae==

===Mausoleum of Cyrus the Great===

Despite having ruled over much of the ancient world, Cyrus the Great would design a tomb that depicts extreme simplicity and modesty when compared to those of other ancient kings and rulers. The simplicity of the structure has a powerful effect on the viewer, since aside from a few cyma moldings below the roof and a small rosette above its small entrance, there are no other stylistic distractions.&lt;ref name=ronald&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arts of Persia|author =Ronald W. Ferrier|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1989|pages=27–8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G2Qkf0h2Pj4C&amp;pg=PA27|isbn =0300039875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structural details====
After his death, Cyrus the Great's remains were interred in his capital city of [[Pasargadae]], where today his [[limestone]] tomb (built around 540–530 B.C.E.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|title=Pasargadae|author =UNESCO World Heritage Centre|year=2006|accessdate=December 26, 2010|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1106}}&lt;/ref&gt;) still exists. The translated ancient accounts give a vivid description of the tomb both geometrically and aesthetically; The tomb's geometric shape has changed little over the years, still maintaining a large stone of quadrangular form at the base (forty five feet by forty two feet&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite book|title=The palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored: an essay on ancient Assyrian and Persian architecture, Volume 5|author =James Fergusson|publisher=J. Murray|year=1851|pages=214–216 &amp; 206–209 (Zoroaster Cube: pp. 206) |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Us0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA215}}&lt;/ref&gt;), followed by a pyramidal succession of seven, irregular smaller rectangular stones (possibly as a reference to the seven planets&lt;ref name=james/&gt; of the [[solar system]]) reaching a height of eighteen feet, until the structure is curtailed by a rectangularly formed cubical edifice with a small opening or window on the side, where the slenderest man can barely squeeze through.&lt;ref name=Cleveland&gt;{{cite book|author =((Grk.) Lucius Flavius Arrianus) (En.) Arrian – (trans.) Charles Dexter Cleveland|title=A compendium of classical literature:comprising choice extracts translated from Greek and Roman writers, with biographical sketches|year=1861|publisher=Biddle|pages=313|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SaU1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof of the edifice and indeed the structure, is an elongated limestone [[pediment]].&lt;ref name=james/&gt;

The edifice, or the "small house" is a rectangular, elongated cube that lies directly on top of the pyramidal stone steps, and is {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m|spell=in}} in width, {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m|spell=in}} in height, and {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=Aedeen&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeologica: The World's Most Significant Sites and Cultural Treasures|author =Aedeen Cremin|publisher=frances lincoln Ltd|year=2007|pages=227–29|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A0llBlzF6UgC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227|isbn=9780711228221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inside of the edifice is occupied by a small chamber a few feet in width and height, and around ten feet deep. It was inside this chamber where the bed and coffin of Cyrus the Great would have been situated.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The edifice has a pediment roof possessing the same length and width dimensions as the edifice itself. Around the tomb were a series of columns, the original structure which they supported is no longer present.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; [[Arrian]]'s direct testimony indicates that Cyrus the Great was indeed buried in the chamber inside the edifice, as he describes Alexander seeing it during his visit to Pasargadae, but it is also a possibility that the body of Cyrus the Great had been interred below the structure, and that the tomb seen on the top is in fact a [[cenotaph]] or a false tomb.

There was originally a golden [[coffin]] inside the mausoleum, resting on a table with golden supports, inside of which the body of Cyrus the Great was interred. Upon his resting place, was a covering of tapestry and drapes made from the best available Babylonian materials, using fine Median workmanship; below his bed was a fine red carpet, covering the narrow rectangular base of his tomb.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;

====History====
Translated Greek accounts describe the tomb as having been placed in the fertile Pasargadae gardens, surrounded by trees and ornamental shrubs, with a group of Achaemenian protectors (the "[[Magi]]"), stationed nearby to protect the edifice from theft or damage.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Persia past and present|author =Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson|year=1906|publisher=The Macmillan Company|pages=278|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7pdCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magi were a group of on-site Zoroastrian observers, located in their separate but attached structure possibly a [[caravanserai]], paid and cared for by the Achaemenid state (by some accounts they received a salary of daily bread and flour, and one sheep payment a day&lt;ref name=james/&gt;). The magi were placed in charge of maintenance and also prevention of theft. Years later, in the ensuing chaos created by [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasion of Persia and loss of a centralized authority directing and caring for the Magi, Cyrus the Great's tomb was broken into and most of its luxuries were looted. When Alexander reached the tomb, he was horrified by the manner in which the tomb was treated, and questioned the Magi and put them to court.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt; On some accounts, Alexander's decision to put the Magi on trial was more about his attempt to undermine their influence and his show of power in his newly conquered empire, than a concern for Cyrus's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Monthly review|author1=Ralph Griffiths |author2=George Edward Griffiths |publisher=Printers Street, London|year=1816|pages=509|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hogCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Alexander the Great ordered [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia]] to improve the tomb's condition and restore its interior.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;

The tomb was originally ornamented with an inscription that, according to [[Strabo]] (and other ancient sources), stated:&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

{{quote|O man! I am Cyrus the Great, who gave the Persians an empire and was the king of Asia. Grudge me not therefore this monument.}}

The edifice has survived the test of time for some 2,500 years. After the Arab invasion into Persia and collapse of the [[Sassanid Empire]], Arab armies wanted to destroy this historical artifact, on the basis that it was not in congruence to their Islamic tenets, but quick thinking on the part of the local Persians prevented this disaster. The Persians renamed the tomb, and presented it to the invading army as the tomb of King [[Solomon]]'s mother. It is likely that the inscription was lost at this time.&lt;ref name=elliot&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran|author1=Andrew Burke |author2=Mark Elliot |publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2008|pages=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] (Shah of Iran), the last official monarch of Persia, during his [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] paid significant homage to the Achaemenid kings and specially Cyrus the Great. Just as Alexander the Great before him, the Shah of Iran wanted to appeal to Cyrus's legacy to legitimize his own rule by extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =James D. Cockcroft|title=Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiIEFLxZaJwC|isbn=9781555468477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah of Iran however was generally interested in protection of imperial historical artifacts.

After the [[Iranian revolution]], the tomb of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos and vandalism propagated by the Islamic revolutionary hardliners who equated Persian imperial historical artifacts with the late Shah of Iran. There are allegations of the tomb being in danger of damage from the construction of the [[Sivand Dam]] on river Polvar (located in the province of [[Fars Province|Pars]]) and water related damage, but there is no official acknowledgement of this claim. [[United Nations]] recognizes the tomb of Cyrus the Great and Pasargadae as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] site.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;

Scholars agree that it was Darius the Great who initiated the construction and expansion of the Persepolis project, however German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld|Ernst E. Herzfeld]], believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site for the construction, although it ultimately came down to Darius the Great to finish the construction and create its impressive buildings. Excavations on behalf of the Oriental Institute of [[Chicago University]], headed by Herzfeld in 1931 and later cooperation by Eric F. Schmidt in 1933 led to some of the most impressive uncovering of Achaemenid artifacts, palaces, and structures. Herzfeld felt that the site of Persepolis was made for special ceremonies and was meant to convey the power of the Achaemenid empire to its subject nations.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

On some accounts, Persepolis was never officially finished as its existence was cut short by Alexander the Great, who in a fit of anger, ordered the burning of the city in 330 B.C.E. Started originally by Darius the Great a century earlier, the structure was constantly changing, receiving upgrades from subsequent Persian monarchs, and undergoing renovation to maintain its impressive façade. After the burning of the city, Persepolis was deserted and it was relatively lost to history until the excavations of Herzfeld, Schmidt, and the Chicago team uncovered it in the 1930s. This great historical artifact is unfortunately at serious risk of "irreparable damage"&lt;ref name=book/&gt; from neglect, the elements, and vandalism.

Persepolis was by no means the only large scale Achaemenid project, as [[Susa]] also hosted [[Palace of Darius in Susa|a similar structure]] initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, that history is able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, and the fact that it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire.&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt; Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son [[Xerxes the Great]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]] as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion.

During the time of [[Shah of Iran]], the structure enjoyed protection and coverage as Mohammad Reza Shah appeased to its royal and national symbolism. During this time period many western politicians, poets, artists, and writers were gravitated to Iran, and Persepolis, either as a function of the political relations with the Iranian monarchy or to report on, or visit the ruins. Such figures include the procession of international dignitaries attending the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] held by Shah, as well as individual visits by such figures as [[Heinrich Lübke]] of Germany, and [[Ralph Graves (writer)|Ralph Graves]] of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. In an article in ``Life`` in 1971, Graves describes his experience at Persepolis in the following way:

{{quote|When you see Persepolis for the first time as I did, facing Marvdasht, you are likely to be disappointed but once inside the ruins themselves you are overwhelmed by the still-proud soaring columns, and by the quality and the fresh state of the bas-relief carvings which are certainly among the finest in the history of the world’s art. But mostly you are transfixed by the sudden realization that all this happened 24 centuries ago, and that people from every nation in the known world of the time had stood in the same place and felt the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A stunning setting for a 2500th anniversary|author =Ralph Graves|publisher=Life magazine|date=October 15, 1971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Pasargades winged man.jpg|left|thumb|The four winged guardian figure of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], with four wings, a two horned crown, and a royal Elamite clothing]]
Perhaps one of the most memorable remaining architectural and artistic works is the bas-relief of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae. This is a bas-relief cut upon a stone slab depicting a figure or a guardian man, most likely a resemblance of Cyrus himself, possessing four wings shown in an [[Assyria]]n style, dressed in [[Elam]]ite traditional clothing, assuming a pose and figure of an [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god, and wearing a crown that has two horns, in what resembles an ''[[Ovis longipes palaeoaegyptiacus]].'' The structure originally had an upper stone slab that in three different languages, ([[Old Persian]], [[Elamite]], [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]]) declared, "I, (am) Cyrus the king, an Achaemenid."&lt;ref name=ilya&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge history of Iran: The Median and Achaemenian periods, Volume 2|author = Ilya Gershevitch|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|pages=392–398|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kMLKgzj5afMC&amp;pg=PA392|isbn = 9780521200912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This carved in limestone writing was in place when [[Robert Ker Porter|Sir Robert Ker Poter]] described the piece in 1818 but, at some point has been lost.

[[David Stronach]] has suggested that there were originally four such figures, set against doorways to the Palace of Cyrus in Pasargadae.&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; That this bas-relief has such an eclectic styling with elements of [[ancient egypt|Egyptian]], [[Elam]]ite, and [[Assyria]]n, reflects "..'the oecumenical attitude of the Achaemenian kings, who from the time of Cyrus, onward adopted a liberal policy of tolerance and conciliation toward the various religions embraced within their empire'..."&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; It would therefore depict the eclectic nature of Achaemenid life from policies of the kings to their choice of architecture.

[[Herodotus]], recounts that Cyrus saw in his sleep the oldest son of Hystaspes, [Darius the Great] with wings upon his shoulders, shadowing with the one wing Asia, and with the other wing Europe.&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; Noted [[Iranologist]], [[Ilya Gershevitch]] explains this statement by Herodotus and its connection with the four winged figure in the following way:&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt;

{{quote|Herodotus, therefore as I surmise, may have known of the close connection, between this type of winged figure, and the image of the Iranian majesty, which he associated with a dream prognosticating, the king's death, before his last, fatal campaign across the Oxus.}}

This relief sculpture, in a sense depicts the eclectic inclusion of various art forms by the Achaemenids, yet their ability to create a new synthetic form that is uniquely Persian in style, and heavily dependent on the contributions of their subject states. After all, that is what distinguishes Achaemenid architecture from those of other kingdoms. It is its originality in context of fusion and inclusion of existing styles, in such a way as to create awe-inspiring structures.

[[File:Perspolis.jpg|thumb|right|A well-preserved [[Persian column]] showing the details of the capital of the columns in [[Persepolis]]]]

[[Persepolis]] is the Latinized version of the Old Persian name, "Parsa" literally meaning the "city of Persians." Another spectacular achievement of the Achaemenids, Persepolis became one of the four capitals of the empire. Initiated by [[Darius the Great]] around 518 B.C.E., it would grow to become a center for ceremonial and cultural festivities, a center for dignitaries and visitors to pay homage to the king, a private residence for the Persian kings, a place for [[satraps]] to bring gifts for the king in the Spring during the festival of [[Nowruz]], as well as a place of governance and ordinance.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; Persepolis's prestige and grand riches were well known in the ancient world, and it was best described by the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] as "the richest city under the sun".&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt;

===Structural details===
Today the archaeological remnants of this once opulent city are about 70 kilometers northeast of the modern Iranian city of [[Shiraz]], in the [[Fārs Province|Pars]] province, in southwestern [[Iran]]. Persepolis is a wide, elevated complex 40 feet high, 100 feet wide, and a third of a mile long,&lt;ref name=book/&gt; composed of multiple halls, corridors, a wide terrace, and a special, double, symmetrical stairway that would provide access to the top of the terrace.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; The stairway would delineate [[relief]] scenes of various motifs of daily life or nature, including some that were literal as well as metaphorical; Some scenes would show natural acts such as a lion attacking its prey but bear symbolism of spring and the [[Nowruz]] festival. Other scenes would depict, subjects from all states of the empire presenting gifts to the king, as well as scenes depicting royal guards, or scenes of social interactions between the guards or the dignitaries.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; This stairway is sometimes referred to as "All countries."&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

The structure was constructed from various halls and complexes that included, hall of [[Apadana]] (the largest hall with 36 columns), "Tachar" (the private chamber of Darius the Great), "Hadish" (added later on as a private chamber for king [[Xerxes the Great]]), the "Talar-i-Takht" also known as the 100-columned hall serving as the throne hall for general meeting with the king, "Darvazeh-i-Mellal" (the gate of all nations), the "khazaneh" (the royal treasury), a hall/palace complex later on developed by [[Artaxerxes III]], Tripylon (council hall), and the "rock cut tombs of the kings" or [[Naqsh-e Rustam]].&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

The most impressive hall in the complex is the [[Apadana]] hall, occupying an area of about 109 square meters with 36 [[Persian column]]s, each more than 19 m tall. Each column is [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]], with a square base (except a few in the [[porticos]]), and an elaborate [[capital (column)|capital]] with two animals supporting the roof. The structure was originally closed off from the elements by mud-brick walls over 5 meters thick and over 20 meters.&lt;ref name=stronach&gt;{{cite web|title=APADANA|author1=R. Schmitt |author2=D. Stronach |publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica|date=December 15, 1986|accessdate=Jan 23, 2011|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/apadana}}&lt;/ref&gt; The columns have a composite capital depicting addorsed bulls or creatures. Those columns in the porticoes not only would possess a circular base, but would also have an ornate capital after the end of the fluting, only to be curtailed by detailed addorsed bulls, supporting the roof.&lt;ref name=stronach/&gt;

Apadana's relief is also unique in that it delineates the presence and power of the king. Known as "Treasure reliefs" the depicted scenes on Apadana stress the continuity of the kingdom through Darius the Great, and stress his presence throughout the empire, as well as depict his army of Persian [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|immortals]]. Perhaps this was Darius's attempt to create a symbol of the assured continuity of his line. Apadana hall and the adjacent structures in the complex are believed to have been designed to host large number of people. In fact, halls of Persepolis could at any one time host some ten thousand visitors easily with the king and the royal staff seated appropriately.&lt;ref name=stronach/&gt;

The grandeur of Persepolis is in its architectural details, its impressive, tall, and upright columns, in its skilfully crafted reliefs depicting people from all walks of life, and from all corners of the empire, and most importantly in its historical importance as both a political and a social center of Achaemenid royal life.

===Engineering===
[[Persepolis Administrative Archives|Persepolis Fortifications]] (PF) Tablets, dating to between 509 and 494 B.C.E. are ancient Persian documents that describe many aspects of construction and maintenance of the Persepolis.&lt;ref name=george/&gt; The tablets are important because they highlight two important aspects of the Achaemenid life and the construction of Persepolis: Firstly, that the structure was created by workers, who were paid rations or wages, and secondly the structure had an intricate system of engineering involving weight bearing and architectural elements, and most notably an irrigation system composed of a system of closed pipes and open aqueducts. The following text from ''PF 1224'', delineates both points:

{{quote|32 BAN (9.7 litres) of grain...the high priest at Persepolis... received and gave (it as) bonus to post-partum Greek women at Persepolis, irrigation (workers), whose apportionment are set...."&lt;ref name=george&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of Hellenic studies|author1=George Boys-Stones |author2=Barbara Graziosi |author3=Phiroze Vasunia |publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2009|pages=42–47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cIDDR1WD9iEC&amp;pg=PA42|isbn=9780199286140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Water technologies====
The runoff and sewer network of Persepolis are among the most complex in the ancient world. Persepolis is constructed on the foot of a mountain (Rahmat Mountain), with an elevated terrace that is partially man made and partially part of the mountain complex. As Persepolis was in essence an important cultural center often used by the beginning of the spring during the festival of [[Nowruz]] it enjoyed great precipitation and water runoffs from the molten ice and snow. The sewer network assumed great importance at this critical time as it was meant to both handle the water flow downward from higher areas as well as manage the inhabitant’s sewage runoffs, and their water needs.&lt;ref name=Mays&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Water Technologies|author1=L. Mays |author2=M. Moradi-Jalal et. al |publisher=Springer|year=2010|pages=95–100|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AEzOzSZEAToC&amp;pg=PA94|isbn=9789048186327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to prevent flooding, the Achaemenids used two engineering techniques to divert molten snow and mountain runoff: The first strategy was to collect the runoff in a reservoir that was a well with a square opening with dimensions of 4.2 m for the square opening, and a depth of 60 m, allowing a volume of 554 cubic meters, or 554,000 liters, (60 x 4.2 x 4.2) of runoff to be collected. The water would be diverted toward the reservoir via multiple masonry gutters strategically located around the structure. The second strategy was to divert water away from the structure, should the reservoirs be filled to capacity; this system used a 180 m long conduit, with 7 m width, and 2.6 m depth located just west of the site.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

The water system however was far more complex than just the reservoirs and the water conduits and involved a very sophisticated ancient system of closed pipes and irrigation. The irrigation was divided into five zones, two serving north part of the structure and three the southern part. Amazingly the irrigation system was designed to be harmonious with the structure so that at places there were central drainage canals in the center of the columns and small draining holes and conduits on each floor that would take the water out of roof, each floor, and the sewage portals into an underground sewage network and away from the structure.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

The five zones (I–V) all possessed a runoff capacity of 260 L/s (liter/second) which is certainly more than the amount needed for handling mountain runoff indicating that the system was also used for water supply to the inhabitants, sewage management, and even irrigation of the gardens around the structure.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Structural technologies====
In order for such a massive structure to have functioned properly it meant that the weight of the roof, columns and indeed the terrace had to be distributed evenly. Construction at the base of the mountain offered some structural support. The ceiling material was a composite application of wood and stone decreasing its overall weight. Extensive use of stone in Persepolis, not only guaranteed its structural integrity for the duration of its use but also meant that its remains lasted longer than the mud-bricks of [[Palace of Darius in Susa|Susa palaces]].

===History===
Scholars agree that it was Darius the Great who initiated the construction and expansion of the Persepolis project, however German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld|Ernst E. Herzfeld]], believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site for the construction, although it ultimately came down to Darius the Great to finish the construction and create its impressive buildings. Excavations on behalf of the Oriental Institute of [[Chicago University]], headed by Herzfeld in 1931 and later cooperation by Eric F. Schmidt in 1933 led to some of the most impressive uncovering of Achaemenid artifacts, palaces, and structures. Herzfeld felt that the site of Persepolis was made for special ceremonies and was meant to convey the power of the Achaemenid empire to its subject nations.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

On some accounts, Persepolis was never officially finished as its existence was cut short by Alexander the Great, who in a fit of anger, ordered the burning of the city in 330 B.C.E. Started originally by Darius the Great a century earlier, the structure was constantly changing, receiving upgrades from subsequent Persian monarchs, and undergoing renovation to maintain its impressive façade. After the burning of the city, Persepolis was deserted and it was relatively lost to history until the excavations of Herzfeld, Schmidt, and the Chicago team uncovered it in the 1930s. This great historical artifact is unfortunately at serious risk of "irreparable damage"&lt;ref name=book/&gt; from neglect, the elements, and vandalism.

Persepolis was by no means the only large scale Achaemenid project, as [[Susa]] also hosted a similar structure initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, that history is able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, and the fact that it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire.&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt; Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son [[Xerxes the Great]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]] as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion.

During the time of [[Shah of Iran]], the structure enjoyed protection and coverage as Mohammad Reza Shah appeased to its royal and national symbolism. During this time period many western politicians, poets, artists, and writers were gravitated to Iran, and Persepolis, either as a function of the political relations with the Iranian monarchy or to report on, or visit the ruins. Such figures include the procession of international dignitaries attending the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] held by Shah, as well as individual visits by such figures as [[Heinrich Lübke]] of Germany, and [[Ralph Graves (writer)|Ralph Graves]] of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. In an article in ``Life`` in 1971, Graves describes his experience at Persepolis in the following way:

{{quote|When you see Persepolis for the first time as I did, facing Marvdasht, you are likely to be disappointed but once inside the ruins themselves you are overwhelmed by the still-proud soaring columns, and by the quality and the fresh state of the bas-relief carvings which are certainly among the finest in the history of the world’s art. But mostly you are transfixed by the sudden realization that all this happened 24 centuries ago, and that people from every nation in the known world of the time had stood in the same place and felt the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A stunning setting for a 2500th anniversary|author =Ralph Graves|publisher=Life magazine|date=October 15, 1971|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AUAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Vandalism===
Throughout history there have been instances of neglect or vandalism in Persepolis. The most notable historical figure to vandalize this structure was [[Alexander the Great]], who after entering Persepolis in 330 B.C.E. called it the "most hateful city in Asia" and allowed his Macedonian troops to pillage it.&lt;ref name=Laura&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander the conqueror: the epic story of the warrior king, Volume 2003|author =Laura Foreman|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2004|pages=152|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rVEa4nzLkT4C&amp;pg=PA152|isbn =9780306812934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this stern hatred, Alexander also admired the Persians as is obvious through his respect for [[Cyrus the Great]], and his act of giving a dignified burial to [[Darius III]]. Years later upon revisiting the city he had burnt, Alexander would regret his action. [[Plutarch]] depicts the paradoxical nature of Alexander when he recounts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of [[Xerxes the Great]] as if it were a live person:

{{quote|Shall I pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led against Greece, or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alexander the Great: The Invisible Enemy: A Biography |first=John Maxwell |last=O'Brien |publisher=Psychology Press |date=1994 |page=104 |isbn=978-0-415-10617-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In retrospect, it must be understood that despite his momentary lapse of judgment and his role as having been the single most significant figure to bring an end to Persepolis, Alexander is not by any means the only. Many individuals in the following centuries would damage Persepolis including thieves and vandals during the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid era]]. When the Arab armies invaded in the seventh century, they took to causing civil disturbances, religious persecution of Persians, and burning of the books. That no clear record of their vandalism remains to date, is most likely due to their destruction of books and historical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Zoroastrian faith: tradition and modern research|author =Solomon Alexander Nigosian|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=1993|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uspf6eDDvjAC&amp;pg=PA47|isbn =9780773511446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial era, and in WWII, the structure would also suffer vandalism at the hands of the Allies. Natural causes such as earthquakes and winds have also contributed to the overall demise of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Persian Earthquakes|author1=N. N. Ambraseys |author2=C. P. Melville |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|pages=198|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1JkfKub5vakC&amp;pg=PA198|isbn=9780521021876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first French excavation in Susa carried out by the Dieulafoys and the looting and the destruction of Persian antiquities by the so-called archeologists had a deep impact on the site. Jane Dieulafoy writes in her diary:

{{quote| Yesterday I was gazing at the huge stone cow found recently; it weighs around 12,000 kilos! It is impossible to move such an enormous mass. I couldn't control my anger. I took a hammer and started striking the stone beast. I gave it some ferocious blows. The head of the pillar burst open like ripe fruit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}}}

Even to date the structure is not safe from destruction and vandalism. After the Iranian revolution, a group of fundamentalists serving [[Khomeini]], including his right-hand man [[Sadegh Khalkhali]], tried to bulldoze both the renown Persian poet, [[Tomb of Ferdowsi|Ferdowsi's tomb]], and Persepolis, but they were stopped by the provisional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Epic of Iran|author =Reza Aslan|publisher=New York Times|date=April 30, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/books/review/30aslan.html?pagewanted=print|accessdate=Jan 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery below highlights only some of these unfortunate acts of vandalism mostly by foreign visitors from the late 1800s to mid-1900s. Currently the structure is at high risk of "irreparable damage."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

===Virtual reconstruction===
French archaeologist, Egyptologist, and historian [[Charles Chipiez]] (1835–1901) has created some of the most advanced virtual drawings of what [[Persepolis]] would have looked like as a metropolis of the Persian Empire. The following mini-gallery depicts his virtual recreations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of art in Persia|author1=Georges Perrot |author2=Charles Chipiez |publisher=Chapman and Hall, limited|year=1892|pages=336–43 &amp; others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SU9TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA314-IA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first image on the left is a view of the "Talar-i-Takht" or the 100 columns hall of Persepolis. Note on the far left portion of the image, the famous "[[lamassu]]" (or chimeric man, lion, eagle beast) greeting the visitors (look below for a picture of a lamassu). Chipiez's drawings delineate his technical prowess and attention to details.

The second picture from the left, is Chipiez's drawing of the columns, their [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] ornation, and roof structure of the palace of Darius in Persepolis, also known as "Tachar." Note the adorsed bull details, as well as the use of wood in construction of the roof. This explains why the palace caught fire when Alexander the Great, set it aflame.

The third picture from the left, is a more detailed, technical drawing of the "Talar-i-Takht" or the 100 column hall. Note the layering of the roof, the detailing on the edges of the roof, the window structures, and the technical detailing of the construction poles.

The last picture, on the right, is a panoramic view of the outside of the palace of Darius the Great in Persepolis. Details of the Persepolis reliefs are depicted as one can note the symbolic scenes of lions attacking bulls, accompanied by two groups of Persian soldiers protecting (symbolically in this case) the infrastructure above.

[[Susa]] was an ancient city (5500 B.C.E) even by the time of the Achaemenids. Susa became a part of the Achaemenid Empire in 539 B.C.E., and was expanded upon by Darius the Great with construction of Palace of Darius, and later development of palace of [[Artaxerxes II]]. The palace had a unique Apadana, resembling the one in Persepolis, except this hall was much larger than its Persepolis counterpart covering some 9,200 square meters.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Cyrus the Great chose Susa as a site for one of his fortifications creating a wall there that was significantly taller than older walls made by the Elamites. This choice might have been to facilitate the trade from [[Persian Gulf]] northward.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; What remains in way of structure from this once active capital, are five archaeological mounds, today located in modern Shush, in southwestern Iran, scattered over 250 hectares.&lt;ref name=man&gt;{{cite book|title=Eerdmans dictionary of the Bible|author1=David Noel Freedman |author2=Allen C.

===Structural details===
Darius's design of his palace in Susa would resemble Persepolis structurally and aesthetically but would incorporate more of a local flair. The structure hosted a large hall of throne or ''Apadana'' similar to the [[Apadana]] of the Persepolis. This Susa version of Apadana would be composed of three [[porticoes]] at right angles to each other, one of which was closed in all three sides by the walls, and only open in its southward direction. The palace was decorated with reliefs in enameled terra-cotta of lions walking.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Intricate scenes depicting archers of king Darius would decorate the walls, as well as motifs of nature such as double-bulls, unicorns, [[fasciae]] curling into volutes, and palms disposed as a flower or a bell. The archers in particular depict a unique symbiosis of Persian, Ionian and Greek artistry of the time probably reflecting the origin of the artists who were originally hired by Darius the Great, and their personal reflections on the finished work.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Perhaps the most striking terra-cotta relief is that of the [[griffin]], depicting a winged creature resembling a lion with wings of an eagle (picture not shown here). The terra-cotta brick reliefs were decorated with lively dye colorations often giving them a lifelike quality.

===History===
Architecturally, the palace of Darius in Susa, was the epitome of the Persian architecture at the height of the empire's growth. Originally erected by Darius, and extensively renovated and modified by [[Artaxerxes II]], it was meant to reflect the same opulence and prestige as Persepolis. This was Darius the Great's attempt to decorate his summer capital of Susa and to show case its glory. French archaeologist [[Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy]] discovered the remnants of the palace of Darius, among the ruins of Susa producing the artifacts of this once magnificent structure now at display in the [[Louvre]] museum, France. He also wrote a series of architectural observations known as "''L'Art antique de la Perse''" which made a significant impression on the art community as to the intricacy of the Achaemenid architecture.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Art|author = Giulio Carotti|publisher=Duckworth &amp; Co|year=1908|pages=94–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-JLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dieulafoy and his wife Jane, made significant contributions in way of excavation, Susa remains were noted by many observers years before and were in fact officially noted by [[William Loftus|William K. Loftus]] in 1852.&lt;ref name=man/&gt;

Susa was a wealthy city by the time Alexander the Great invaded it, and it is said that he required 10,000 camels and 20,000 donkeys to carry away the treasures.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; For the most part the architectural wealth of Susa lies in its palaces, and ceremonial structures most of which have been eroded away by time or wear and tear. Today the most important remnants of the Achaemenid contribution to the architecture of ancient Susa are found in remnants of the Palace of Darius the Great in the original excavation site, or hosted in foreign nations' museums as Persian artifacts. Today the archaeological remains of the structure remain exposed to the elements, wear and tear, and human activity, and it seems that remains of Susa would be forever lost to the humankind, except perhaps for few selected pieces on display at the Louvre or foreign nations' museums.

Below are a few selected photos from the palace of Darius. The photo on the far left depicts the famous Archers' relief from the palace of Darius, from Susa. The second picture from the right, is a two-dimensional "[[lamassu]]" a mythical creature with wings of an eagle, head of a man, and body of a lion. The picture in the middle, is of the base of a column from the palace of Darius in Susa, inscribing in its rim, in three languages (Babylonian, Elamite, and Old Persian), that Darius, is the "great king of kings."

==Naqsh-e Rustam==
[[File:Naghsh-e rostam, Irán, 2016-09-24, DD 20-24 PAN.jpg|thumb|900 px|center|&lt;center&gt;A panorama of the [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] mountain complex&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[Naqsh-e Rustam]] is an archaeological site located about 6 kilometers to the northwest of [[Persepolis]] in Marvdasht region in the Fars province of Iran.&lt;ref name=garthwaite&gt;{{cite book|title=The Persians|author =Gene Ralph Garthwaite|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2005|pages=51–55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FqzrZ3b8aakC&amp;pg=PA51|isbn=9781405144001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nash-e Rustam acts as a [[necropolis]] for the Achaemenid kings, but is a significant historical entity in that it also housed ancient [[Elamite]] relief, as well as later relief by the [[Sassanid empire|Sassanid]] kings. Naqsh-e Rustam is not the actual name of this massive structure, but is the [[New Persian]] compound word composed of "Naqsh" meaning "face", or "facade", and "[[Rostam|Rustam]]" referring to the hero of the Persian epic [[Shahnameh]]. The [[Elamite]]s, [[Achaemenid]]s, and the [[Sassanid]]s lived centuries before the drafting of the Shahnameh by the Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]], and therefore the name is a misnomer, the result of the great amnesia of Persians about their ancient past, that settled over them after being conquered by the Arabs.&lt;ref name=paul&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Zarathustra: Across Iran and Central Asia to Find the World's First Prophet|author =Paul Kriwaczek|publisher=Random House, Inc|year=2004|pages=88–90|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YQ_yENnMpKQC&amp;pg=PA88|isbn=9780307426352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name therefore is a retrospective creation, due to lack of historical documents and lack of any inclusive knowledge of its origin. In ancient Persia, this structure would overlook the now long gone city of [[Istakhr]] easily accessible from Persepolis. Istakhr had a religious role as it was the place where Achaemenids held their reverence of the water goddess [[Anahita]]. The structure is carved into a native limestone rock mountain, and houses the burial chambers of [[Darius the Great]], [[Xerxes I]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]], all Achaemenid monarchs of Persia. There is also an incomplete tomb, as only its lower cruciform arm is carved out of the rock, while the rest is unfinished. It is speculated to belong to king [[Darius III]].&lt;ref name=garthwaite/&gt;&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

The kings were interred behind a facade and [[rock relief]], that would resemble an accurate depiction of the king's own palace and its structural details. The accuracy of the facade and its association with the actual structure of the kings' palaces is so close that they almost produce a view of how the structures would have looked before time reduced them to remains; Tomb of Darius the Great, for instance mirrors his palace in [[Persepolis]], the "Tachar" even in scale and dimensions.&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

The tombs are carved into the mountain's side, in form of a cross ([[Old Persian]]: ''chalipa''), depressed into the mountain's [[limestone]] background, and elevated from the ground. The relief which is found in the depressed cruciform is that which depicts the respective king's palace, and also depicts on its roof, the relief figure of the king praying, to [[Ahuramazda]] or what most believe is a reference to the [[Zoroastrian]] icon, [[Faravahar]].&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

One of the enigmatic features of the complex is a cubical, stone structure standing 12.5 meters tall, and around 7 meters wide, called the "[[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]]" translating to the "Cube of [[Zoroaster]]" believed to have been constructed during the Acahemenid era and modified and changed during the Sassanid era. The structure is cubical in base, with blind impressions on the side resembling windows, and a ruined staircase leading to a small door in the front leading to a completely empty interior.&lt;ref name=garthwaite/&gt;&lt;ref name=paul/&gt; There are varied speculations as to its function discussed below.

The structure also once housed an ancient Elamite relief which has been almost entirely replaced by the Sassanid reliefs. Today but a figure of a man remains of the Elamite contribution to this mountain. The later Sassanids, also created their own historical signature on the structure, called the [[Naqsh-e Rajab]]. Though numerous and very detailed, the study of the [[Sassanid architecture|Sassanid architectural]] achievements sheds light on some of the architectural achievements during the second Persian empire's reign.

===Ka'ba-ye Zartosht===
[[File:Tour nagsh-e-rostam iran.jpg|thumb|left|A close up view of the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]] ("Cube of Zoroaster") showing the stairs, the narrow opening, and the blind windows. Note its placement in a depression, as well as the unique rectangular markings on the façade]]
[[File:Old Achaemenian temple at Pasargades.jpg|right|thumb|"Zendan-i-Soleiman" or ''Jail of Solomon'' in [[Pasargadae]]. Note the incredible resemblance between this structure and the "Cube of Zoroaster" (shown left) down to the details of the façade]]
This enigmatic structure stands erect around 12.5 meters tall (~ 35 feet), with a linear, cubical shape and a square base (~ 22 feet in sides),&lt;ref name=james/&gt; constructed in what is essentially a dug out rectangular depression, having on all but one of its sides, four rectangular depressions resembling blind windows, and multiple minute rectangular depressions in the façade interdispersed among the blind windows as well as the side housing the staircase. The staircase leads to a small door (5 feet by 6 feet in dimensions) opening to an interior apartment of about 12 feet square.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The structure's roof houses a minimal [[entablature]] of a repeating square pattern.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The entire structure is posited on a raised stone platform that is composed of a few stone slabs, in a sequentially smaller yet in a concentric, pyramidally shaped succession. This structure is enigmatic, both in its aesthetic choice seen in its rather odd design, and façade, as well as its location, and supposed function.

From one perspective, its proximity to the kings' tombs, and its simple design, is by some scholars thought to indicate that the cube was a Zoroastrian temple, and the Naqsh-e Rustam was more than a mere place for grieving of the deceased kings, but a grand festive center where crowds would gather on festive days to observe the king pray to [[Ahuramazda]], and bask in the structure's magnitude while praying to Ahuramazda.&lt;ref name=paul/&gt; This would certainly be logical as the city was also adjacent to [[Istakhr]], a major religious and cultural center. The concept of the temple being used as a fire sanctuary, is however not likely because there is no general ventilation for smoke and gasses, and also that it differs so drastically, architecturally and aesthetically from other well known contemporary temple sites in [[Fars province|Pars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pasargadae: the oldest imperial capital|author =Ali Sami|publisher=Musavi Printing Office|year=1956|pages=90–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjUbAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curiously the design although unique, is not the only one of its kind. Located not far away from the Cube of Zoroaster, there exists in [[Pasargadae]], even to date, remnants of a structure that is very similar in its square shape and design to the "''Cube of Zoroaster''", called "''Zendan-i-Suleiman''."&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The name "Zendan-i-Suleiman,"  is a compound word composed of the words, "Zendan" which is Persian for "jail", and "Suleiman" which is a local Persian dialect name of the King [[Solomon]], translating to ''"Jail of Solomon."'' Structurally both "Jail of Solomon" and "Cube of Zoroaster" have the same cubic shape, and even resemble each other in the most minute of details, including facade, and dimensions. The name "Jail of Solomon" is of course a misnomer since Solomon never did erect this structure. The term must have come as a result of a Persian tactic advised by local Persians, to protect both [[Cyrus the Great]]'s [[Tomb of Cyrus|tomb]], and the surrounding structures including this temple, from invading Arabs' destruction, by calling the mausoleum, the "tomb of Solomon's mother" and the temple in Pasargadae, the "Jail of Solomon."&lt;ref name=elliot/&gt;

Just like the "Cube of Zoroaster", the function of the "Solomon's Jail" is not well understood. There are theories about the structures being used as a depository of objects of dynastic or religious importance as well as theories of it being a temple of fire.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; It should also be noted, that the structures as they exist today are not simply the work of the Achaemenid architects and have been modified, and improved by the Sassanids, who also used them for their festive, and political needs.

==Behistun inscription==

Carved high in [[Mount Behistun]] of [[Kermanshah]], one can find the Behistun inscription, a text etched into the stone of the mountain describing the manner in which Darius became the king of Persia, after the previous ruler ([[Cambyses II]]), and how he overthrew the [[magus]] usurper of the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The journal of sacred literature and Biblical record, Volume 3|author1=John Kitto |author2=Henry Burgess |author3=Benjamin Harris Cowper |publisher=A. Heylin|year=1856|pages=183–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qHUtAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this inscription Darius also details his [[satraps]] and delineates his position as the king and emperor of the Persian empire.

Architecturally speaking, the Behistun inscription is a massive project, that entailed cutting into the rough edge of the mountain in order to create [[bas-relief]] figures as seen in the pictures above. The Behistun mountain, rises up to some 1700 feet as part of the [[Zagros]] mountain chains in [[Iran]]. The mountain's location is ideal being close to both [[Ecbatana]] and [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The bas-relief itself is located some 300 feet above the base of the mountain. The figures represent two of the king's soldiers, the king himself standing over a fallen usurper and captives of several nations possibly dissidents, or co-conspirators. The inscription itself is written in [[cuneiform]] character in [[Old Persian]], [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]], and [[Medes|Median]].&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of the world from the earliest records to the present time: ancient history, Volume 1|author =Philip Smith|publisher=[[D. Appleton &amp; Company|D. Appleton]] |year=1865|page=298|url=https://books.google.com/?id=elAPAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription is interpreted and deciphered with the help of many intellectuals and scholars, but the [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Sir Henry Rawlinson]] is credited as being most critical in the process of deciphering the piece.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Part of why the understanding of the text is so vivid today is owed to Darius the Great himself, for he wrote the message of the inscription in three language, and so allowed the modern scholars to decipher one language and follow through the other two, since the message was essentially similar in all three forms. In this sense, the Behistun inscription is not only a significant architectural work, but also a significant linguistic tool, as important to the old world understanding of [[ancient Persia]] and its languages, as [[Rosetta Stone]] is to understanding [[ancient Egypt]] and its languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Darius the Great|author =J. Poolos|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2008|pages=38–9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K0EZK08VGXEC&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influences==
Elements of the Achaemenid style can be seen in contemporary [[Iranian architecture]]. Buildings built by the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], in particular, show extensive influence of Achaemenid architecture and art.

[[File:NASA High Flyers Alphabet Activity Book.pdf|thumb|Example of an activity book. ]]
An '''activity book''' is a type of [[book]], generally aimed at [[children]], which contains [[interactive]] content such as [[game]]s, [[puzzles]], [[quiz]]zes, pictures to colour and other elements which involve [[writing]] or [[drawing]] in the book itself. The book may, or may not, have a loose [[narrative]] or contain other non-interactive elements structured around the interactive elements. Activity books may be made for [[entertainment]], [[education]] or a mixture of both.

Specific types of activity books include [[colouring book]]s and [[puzzle book]]s. A book is normally referred to as an activity book if it combines a variety of interactive elements and does not fall neatly into one of these more specific categories.

== Examples ==
Activity books are typically centred around a particular theme. This may be a generic theme, e.g. dinosaurs, or based on a toy, television show, book, or game. 

For example, the [[Where's Wally?]] series of books (known as Where's Waldo? in the USA) by [[Martin Handford]] consists of both [[Puzzle book|puzzle books]], wherein the reader must search for characters hidden in pictures, and activity books such as ''[[Where's Waldo?: The Ultimate Fun Book]]'', which include a wider range of games and activities as well as puzzles. In 2018, [[Nintendo]] announced its intention to publish activity books based on its trademarked characters and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nintendo-childrens-activity-books-random-house/|title=Who says print is dead?

[[File:Beograd Dom Omladine.JPG|thumb|upright|250px|Dom omladine Beograda in April 2007, before reconstruction.]]

'''Belgrade Youth Center''' ({{lang-sr|Dom omladine Beograda}}; DOB), is a [[cultural center]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], dedicated primarily to [[youth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=202291|title = Belgrade Youth Center|work = City of Belgrade|accessdate = 4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

At the corner of the ''Dečanska'' and ''Makedonska'' streets, where the youth center is today, was the location of the ''[[kafana]]'' "Ginić". One of the most popular kafanas in Belgrade in its heyday, it was a gathering point of the journalists and reporters from the [[Politika]] daily, which was located nearby. The [[satirical magazine]] ''{{ill|Ošišani Jež|sr}}'' ("shaved hedgehog") was founded in the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Goran Vesić | title = Прва европска кафана - у Београду | trans-title = First European kafana - in Belgrade | newspaper = Politika | page = 12 | language = Serbian | date = 14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

DOB organizes numerous programs in the area of [[contemporary art]] and [[culture]], as well as educational-debate programs: around a thousand different programs per year, visited by over 180,000 youths.{{fact|date=August 2014}} It aims to encompass all art forms: [[prose]], [[poetry]], [[music]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[visual arts]], [[new media]] and others.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

The Center was founded in 1964&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=202291|title=Belgrade Youth Center|last=|first=|date=|website=beograd.rs|publisher=|access-date=|work=|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the auspices of the Secretariate of Culture of the [[Assembly of the City of Belgrade]].{{fact|date=August 2014}} The Assembly provides the main funds for the center.

Belgrade Youth Center functions as a platform for promoting new artists, ideas and initiatives.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Additionally, Belgrade Youth Center is a meeting point for domestic and foreign artists. DOB is a member of local, regional and international cultural networks.

== Organization ==

DOB's activities are organized in five centers:{{fact|date=August 2014}}

* Center of Music Development,
* Center of Visual Arts and Multimedia,
* Center of Education and Interactive Communication,
* Center of Publishing, and
* Laboratory of Initiatives – ''Art &amp; creativity unlimited''.

== Venue ==

Dom omladine is located in the center of Belgrade, near the [[Republic Square (Belgrade)|Republic Square]]. For its programs, it maintains:{{fact|date=August 2014}}

* Big hall (520 sitting places or 1200 standing places),
* Americana Hall (300 sitting places or 800 standing places),
* Club (100 sitting places or 300 standing places),
* Art Gallery,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
* Debate room (60 sitting places), and

Separate from this building, DOB also has the Magacin on Kraljevića Marka Street, a former [[warehouse]] near the city center with over 5,000 square meters of available space.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

The building was fully renovated in the early 2010s and re-opened on 12 March 2011. The edifice has several valuable works of arts. They include the monumental façade mosaic by Lazar Vozarević, a {{convert|7|by|9|m|abbr=on}} painting of [[Mića Popović]] and semi-precious brown stones, gift from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Lj.Perović | title = Rođendan obnovljenog Doma omladine | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = | language = Serbian | date = 13 March 2012 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the façade, there is also a sculpture "Sun" by [[Dušan Džamonja]].&lt;ref name=majstori/&gt;

== Plateau of Milan Mladenović ==

In 2011 the area in front of the DOB was named a Plateau of [[Milan Mladenović]], in honor of the late [[frontman]] of [[Ekatarina Velika|EKV]] who died in 1994 at the age of 36. Since 2013, the short wall in front of the building has been turned into an open stage during summers. A reconstruction of the plateau, which would include granite slabs sidewalks and [[avenue (landscape)|avenue]] was announced in August 2017.&lt;ref name=majstori&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Daliborka Mučibabić | title = Majstori na Platou Milana Mladenovića | newspaper = Politika | pages = 17 | language = Serbian | date = 8 August 2017 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; First phase, which included the paving with the granite slabs and planting an avenue (consisting of [[birch]] and [[liquidambar]] trees) was finished by November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Dejan Aleksić | title = Nikao novi drvored na platou kod DOB-a| trans-title = New avenue planted on the plateau at the DOB | newspaper = Politika | page = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 18 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banning of ''Birth Control'' was upheld by the [[New York Court of Appeals]] on the grounds that a film on [[family planning]] may be censored "in the interest of morality, decency, and public safety and welfare."&lt;ref&gt;[https://casetext.com/case/message-photo-play-co-inc-v-bell ''Message Photo-Play Co., Inc.

'''Booth Mansion''' is a former [[town house]] at 28–34 Watergate Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.

==History==

In 1700 [[George Booth, 2nd Earl of Warrington|George Booth]] rebuilt two medieval houses as his town house.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;{{citation | last =Ward | first =Simon | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Chester: A History |edition= | publisher =Phillimore | year = 2009 | location =Chichester | pages = 74–75| isbn =978-1-86077-499-7 | postscript =&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He built a frontage in [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style,&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{Citation | last = Morriss| first = Richard| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 1993| title = The Buildings of Chester| publication-place = Dover| place = | publisher = Alan Sutton|  page = 97 | isbn = 0-7509-0255-8| postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; but behind this much of the medieval fabric was retained.  The frontage was angled into the street so that the house could be seen better from [[Chester Cross (junction)|Chester Cross]]; however as a result of this he was fined £10 for encroaching into the street.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;  In the 1740s and 1750s the building was used as the [[assembly room]]s for the town's social functions.&lt;ref name=vch&gt;{{Citation | last = Thacker| first = A.

==Architecture==

At a time when buildings elsewhere in the town had enclosed their portion of the [[Chester Rows|Rows]], the architect designing the frontage of Booth Mansion retained its section of the Row.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;  The frontage is built in brick with stone [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]]; it has eight [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and two storeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hartwell | first = Clare |last2 = Hyde | first2 = Matthew |last3 = Hubbard | first3 = Edward | author3-link=Edward Hubbard | last4 =Pevsner | first4 =Nikolaus | author4-link =Nikolaus Pevsner | series= The Buildings of England| title = Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| year =2011| origyear=1971| location =New Haven and London| pages = 264–265| isbn =978-0-300-17043-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Behind the frontage is medieval stonework and timber; the roof is of grey slates.  At the street ([[undercroft]]) level are shop fronts and doorways between nine stone [[Pier (architecture)|piers]].  At the Row level, overlooking the street, are three piers and six [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] [[column]]s. In the storey above the row are eight tall windows, each with four leaded lights, above which is a [[string course]].  The top storey has eight six-light [[sash window]]s.  Above these is a [[cornice]] and, from the roof, four [[gable]]d [[dormer]]s with two-pane [[casement window]]s protrude.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===
In the undercroft is a medieval stone [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] and a wooden [[joist]] which has been dated by [[dendrochronology]] to 1260–80.  At the level of the Row, a 13th-century oak doorway remains from the medieval hall.  In the storey above the Row is the 18th-century assembly room which measures 16m by 10m and stretches across the full width of the building.  The room is panelled and has a fireplace against the east wall.  Elsewhere the medieval details of rooms has been obscured by modern additions.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

The '''Buchmann-Mehta School of Music''' (BMSM) is an institute of higher education in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. The school is a part of the Faculty of the Arts at [[Tel Aviv University]] and is operated in collaboration with the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]] (IPO). The school is named after Jewish philanthropist [[Joseph Buchmann]] from [[Frankfurt]] and conductor [[Zubin Mehta]], Music Director of the IPO. Maestro Mehta is the honorary president of the school and conducts its symphony orchestra regularly in Israel and on tours abroad. The BMSM mission is to train elite young musicians in the realms of performance, composition and research in music and prepare them for professional careers in these fields. The BMSM's orchestral training program is an integral part of the school and aims to educate orchestral musicians to ensure the artistic future of the IPO and other orchestras in Israel.

==History==
The Buchmann-Mehta School of Music was founded in 2005 as a partnership between Tel-Aviv University, the largest and most comprehensive university in Israel, and the IPO, the country`s most prominent music institution. The school's foundation was made possible by the donation of Dr.hc Josef Buchmann and conductor Zubin Mehta, who has been actively involved in the school since its inception. The first head of the school and one of its founders was pianist and pedagogue Prof. [[Tomer Lev]]. In 2009 he was succeeded by conductor and bassoonist Prof. [[Zeev Dorman]], who had served as the IPO's principal [[bassoon]] player as well as chairman of the orchestra's executive board for nearly 25 years. In August 2015 Prof. Lev resumed his post as head of the BMSM.

==The Samuel Rubin Israel Academy of Music (1945-2005)==
Although inaugurated as late as 2005, the school's roots go back to 1945, when it was originally established as the [[Israel Academy of Music]] by senior members of the IPO, who had fled Europe on the brink of [[World War II]]. In 1966 it was merged into the newly formed Tel Aviv University and in 1972 became a cornerstone for the university's [[Yolanda and David Katz Faculty of the Arts]].
The heads of the historical Academy were among the founding fathers of the music world in Israel: violist and composer [[Ödön Pártos]], pianist and conductor [[Arie Vardi]], composers [[Yehezkel Braun]], [[Yitzhack Sadai]] and [[Joseph Dorfman]], violinist [[Yair Kless]] and composers [[Ami Maayani]] and [[Noam Sheriff]].

==Structure and activities==
The school is currently composed of the performance department in its various instrumental tracks, the composition and conducting department, the musicology department and the orchestral training program of the IPO. The School is located in the Ramat-Aviv campus of TAU as a unit of the Katz Faculty of the Arts. The BMSM maintains a wide spectrum of performance ensembles, including a full symphony orchestra, an oratorio choir, a chamber choir, an opera ensemble, a contemporary music ensemble, a piano ensemble ([[Multipiano|MultiPiano]]) and some 50 other chamber ensembles. 

The school building houses two concert halls (Clairmont Hall and Targ Hall) and a well-equipped recording studio. Some 200 concerts, lectures and master classes are held annually, many of these under the BMSM subscription concert series named after the late [[Yehiel Ben-Zvi]], former Vice-President of Tel Aviv University. These events attract more than 2,000 regular subscribers a year as well as numerous visitors, making the BMSM one of the busiest music centers in the country.

[[File:Plan of Pompeii with Casa del Menandro marked.svg|thumb|Plan of Pompeii with the Casa del Menandro highlighted in red]]
The '''Casa del Menandro''' ('''House of Menander''') is a house in [[Pompeii]], [[Italy]].  It is located in Region I, Insula 10, Entrance 4 (I.10.4). It covers an area of about {{Convert|1800|m2|ft2}}. The house was excavated between November 1926 and June 1932.&lt;ref name="STOA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/projects/ph/house?id=9|title=Casa del Menandro|website=www.stoa.org|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership of the house==

Della Corte thought the owner could be Quintus Poppaeus Sabinus due to a seal and a graffito in the entrance corridor mentioning 'Quintus' and other graffiti in the house referring to 'Sabinus'.&lt;ref name="STOA"/&gt;

The nationality of the owner is more in dispute than their economic status.  [[Pompeii]]’s Mediterranean climate enticed many [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to invest in holiday [[villa]]s there, so it is possible that the owner at the time of [[Vesuvius]]’ eruption in 79 AD was a wealthy tourist, not a local.&lt;ref name="PlanetWare"&gt;[http://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/pompeii-pompei-i-cm-pp.htm No Author Listed, House of Menander, Tourist Attractions in Pompeii, Italy 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art, architecture, and graffiti ==

===Fresco===

[[Image:Pompeii - Casa del Menandro - Menander.jpg|left|thumb|The fresco of [[Menander]] from which the house takes its name]]

The estate is referred to as “The House of Menander” because there is a well-preserved [[fresco]] of the ancient Greek Dramatist [[Menander]] in a small room off the [[peristyle]]. Some speculate the painting is not actually of Menander but rather of the owner of the house or another person reading works by Menander.

The house included other frescoes, including one depicting the death of [[Laocoon]].

=== Classical style and Hellenism ===

The large [[columns]] in the [[peristyle]] of the Casa del Menandro are representative of the [[Doric style]] of architecture, an offshoot of the [[Classical Style]], which also stems from [[Greece]].  The emphasis on Greek culture in Pompeian architecture is not surprising since Greek sailors had been using the port as a trading post before the [[Oscans]] founded the city in the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="ClassicalArchitecture"&gt;Roberts, Adam, Classical Architecture. London, Penguin Books. 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peristyle"&gt;Curran, Leo, Pompeii: House of Pansa: Atrium and Peristyle, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graffiti===
Numerous examples of [[Roman graffiti]] can be observed on the exterior walls of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pompeiana.org/Resources/Ancient/Graffiti%20from%20Pompeii.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184129/http://www.pompeiana.org/resources/ancient/graffiti%20from%20pompeii.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural center develops visual arts and literature via shows and conferences about renowned artists, poets and writers. It also develops artists, poets and writers whose work is less well known or debuting publicly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scandiccicultura.eu/biblioteca-e-archivio-storico/scandicci-sul-web/190-organizzazioni-culturali.html Scandicci Cultural Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literary.it/occhio/dati/guidi/al_centro_d.html Al Centro d'Arte Modigliani] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231908/http://www.literary.it/occhio/dati/guidi/al_centro_d.html |date=October 4, 2013 }} Literary event;

==Membership==
The membership is approximately 100 poets, painters and authors as well as cultural advocates and sympathizers. Most of the membership is residents of Florence, Scandicci and other Tuscan towns, with some from other Italian regions and some foreign international members.

Some of the artists contribute to events and hold elections to nominate honorary members of various fields based on their talent and cultural  development of our activities.

==Artistic alliances==
Modigliani Art Center conducts artistic and cultural activities. It sometimes program events with outside collaboration that involves the works by artists, poets and writers who are not also members of the art association. The center's international artistic and cultural collaborations for over 30 years have been involved with the cities of [[Paris]], [[Moscow]] and [[London]].  Some of these activities are organized to support the values of human cultural solidarity and Peace.

The Center is active in reviving the custom of twinning between the cities.  They received an invitation from French artists and the "Twinning Council" of [[Pantin]] (Paris), France and inaugurated their XXXIV Year Salon of Painting with the Pantin art association "Les Amis des Arts" (''Friends of Art'').

==Events==
The Modigliani Art Center organizes several artistic and cultural activities yearly.  The events are exhibitions and reviews of contemporary [[fine art]], [[poetry]] readings, and conference presentations of books including poetry, essays, and novels. A lecture series offers debate and discussion on literary themes, contemporary history, art criticism and art history.

These activities are predominantly organized in Scandicci, Florence and in other Tuscan towns, but have been held in other Italian regions as well as internationally.

'''''Child with a Dove''''' (''L'enfant au pigeon'', sometimes described as ''Child Holding a Dove'') is a painting by the Spanish artist [[Pablo Picasso]], made in 1901 at the start of his [[blue period]]. It was on public display in England for many years before its sale in 2012.

==Background==
Picasso was 20 years old in 1901, and struggling to make his mark at the start of his artistic career.  He returned for a second spell in Paris, to prepare for a joint exhibition in the summer with [[Francisco Iturrino]] at [[Ambroise Vollard]]'s gallery.  Towards the end of the year, Picasso moved away from the rapid [[impressionist]]ic brushwork that had won him praise towards a flatter, [[abstract art|abstracted]] presentation, with blocks of colour outlined in black, typical of his blue period.

==Painting==
The painting depicts a small child, probably a girl, with short ginger hair wearing a white gown tied at the waist with a blue sash.  The subject stands holding a white dove in two hands, beside a ball with brightly coloured segments like a [[colour wheel]].  The background is painted flatly, an abstracted blue sky and green grass. It measures {{convert|28.75|in|cm}} by {{convert|21.25|in|cm}}.

The work can be read as a picture of the innocence of childhood; as an essay in abstraction, with shapes simplified and superfluous details left out; or as a commentary on [[colour theory]], with large blocks of colour - orange hair set against blue sky, and white dress set against green grass.  It is thickly painted, perhaps concealing an earlier work underneath.  The potential sentimentality of the subject matter is avoided by the use of bright colours.

==History==
The painting was acquired by French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. It was bought in 1924 by a Mrs RA Workman from the Alexander Reid Gallery in Glasgow, but she sold it to [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]] in 1928. On his death in 1947, he bequeathed it to Christabel McLaren, Lady Aberconway, wife of [[Henry McLaren, 2nd Baron Aberconway]]. After the death of Lady Aberconway, the family loaned the painting to the [[National Gallery]] from 1974 to 2010, and it was also displayed at exhibitions at the [[Courtauld Gallery]] and the [[Tate Gallery]]. It has been described by [[Arts Council England]] as "probably the most famous work by Picasso in a UK collection".

In 2012 the painting was sold in a private sale brokered by auction house [[Christie's]] on behalf of the Aberconway family. The price was reported as £50 million.&lt;ref name="BBCApr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22123607|title=Picasso's £50 m Child With A Dove Set to Leave the UK|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=April 12, 2013|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government imposed a temporary export ban which expired in December 2012 because no British institution was able to match the purchase price to acquire the work. It was displayed at an exhibition of Picasso's works from 1901 at the Courtauld Galley until May 2013, and was expected to be exported when the Courtauld exhibition closed in May 2013. In April 2013 it was reported by ''[[Le Figaro]]'' that the buyer was the [[Qatar Museums Authority]].&lt;ref name="BBCApr"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8284">The '''dance and theatre of Laos''' (nattakam Lao, Lao: ນາດຕະກັມລາວ {{IPA-lo|nâːt táʔ kam láːw|}}) is the primary [[drama]]tic art form of [[Laos]]' majority ethnic group, the Lao people. It is shared with the ethnic Lao that inhabit the [[Isan]] region of Thailand as well. There are mainly two types of dances (or dance-dramas), the classical dances performed in the royal courts and the folk dances now associated with [[morlam]].&lt;ref name="Laos. 2001"&gt;''Laos.'' (2001). Rubin, D., Pong C. S., Caturvedi, R., ''et al'' (ed.) ''World encyclopedia of contemporary theatre: Asia/Pacific.'' (Vol. III). New York, NY: Routlegde.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow puppetry, although not associated with dance, is an important part of Lao theatrical traditions. Various dance-drama troupes, mostly operating out of [[Louang Phrabang]] and [[Vientiane]], continue to teach the old classical court dances and more [[Khmer people|Khmer]]-influenced dramas and folk dances, respectively.&lt;ref name="Laos. 2001"/&gt;

==Classical dance and theatre==
The dance-dramas of Laos were originally only performed for the royal court. The dance-dramas and musical accompaniment are all very similar to those of Thai and [[Khmer classical dance|Cambodian]] classical dances. Lao legends of the first ruler of Lan Xang say that in addition to a large army of Khmer soldiers, he was also accompanied by many female dancers from the court of Angkor.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, N. (2007). ''Vietnam, cambodia, laos and the greater mekong.'' Oakland, California: Lonely Planet Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most dance dramas depict scenes from the [[Phra Lak Phra Lam|Phra Lak Phra Ram]] (ພຣະລັກພຣະຣາມ {{IPA-lo|pʰāʔ lāk pʰāʔ láːm|}}), or the Lao [[Ramayana]] and the ''Sadok'' (ຊາດົກ {{IPA|[sáː dók]}}), or [[Jataka]]. Other scenes come from legends, historical epics such as [[Sang Sinxay|Sin Xay]] , stories from local or Hindu mythology, or adaptations of stories from surrounding nations. Lao classical dance has two main forms, khone and lakhone. Each is accompanied by Lao classical music.

[[File:Lao New Year, dancers.jpg|250px|thumb|Masked dancers about to perform a ''khon'' dance-drama based on the Phra Lak Phra Ram.]]
''Khon'' (ໂຂນ {{IPA|[kʰǒːn]}}) is the most stylised of the [[Lao people|Lao]] dance-dramas, with troupes of male and female dancers in elaborate costumes and masks performing very graceful movements demonstrating their great flexibility, and very common dance-drama form for the Phra Lak Phra Ram. Each dancer plays a character in the drama, although most of the narration comes from a singing [[choir|chorus]] to the side. Lakhone (ລະຄອນ {{IPA|[lāʔ kʰɔ́ːn]}}) dances are usually only performed by females, but male lakhone dancers are not unknown. Instead of each dancer portraying an individual character, such as the ''Khon'' dance-dramas, the dancers mimic the scene and events together. There is more variety of dance-dramas performed in the Lakhon tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, J. R. (1993). ''The cambridge guide to asian theatre.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although lacking in dance, ''nang taloung'' or shadow puppets (ໜັງຕະລຸງ {{IPA|[nǎŋ táʔ lúŋ]}}) are an important part of Lao theatrical traditions. An adaptation of the traditional Malay [[wayang]] shadow puppets, but there are numerous puppeteers instead of one puppet master. Shadow puppet plays are based on similar themes and stories as the other classical dramas, but can be accompanied by either classical music or [[morlam]] instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;B., Rachel, Lam, M. B., Cullen, A. ''et al'' (2007). ''World and its peoples: eastern and southern asia.'' Tarrytown, NY: Marshall Cavendish Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lam lao==
{{main|morlam}}

[[File:Lao morlam musiciens.jpg|right|thumb|A khene player and Lao dancers at a morlam performance in France.]]
Lam Lao (ລຳລາວ) or [[morlam]] (ໝໍລຳ {{IPA|[mɔ̌ː lám]}}) is the general descriptor for Lao folk music, which at its most basic level consists of the singer/story-teller and the khene (ແຄນ {{IPA|[kʰɛ́ːn]}}). In Isan, both terms are interchangeable, but in Laos, ''morlam'' only refers to the singer. Troupes travel around like [[minstrels]] performing at various locales. There are many regional styles, depending on the local tone contours and preferred instrumentation and melodies.&lt;ref name="Rachel, Lam 2007"&gt;B., Rachel, Lam, M. B., Cullen, A. et al (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The music that accompanies a lam lao performance may also include various types of [[percussion]], fiddles, lutes, xylophones, or oboes as well as some that are more characteristic of classical ensembles. Lyrics are drawn from old [[poetry]], classical stories, or improvised according to the complicated [[tonality|tonal]] rhyming patterns of the verse and can range from topics as serious as religious sermons and Jataka tales to sometimes bawdy verses about love and sex.&lt;ref name="Rachel, Lam 2007"/&gt;

Although the performances themselves are not necessarily theatrical, the closest being the exchanges of witty repartées in alternating verses or songs between a male and a female morlam who pretend to fall in love before departing or friends who try to outwit each other. The songs are interspersed with dance numbers, comedic routines, ham acting, and teasing between the performers and the audience.&lt;ref name="Brandon, J. R. 1993"&gt;Brandon, J. R. (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk dance===
[[File:Yasothondancers01.JPG|thumb|250px|A folk dance in the [[Rocket Festival]] parade in Yasothorn, Thailand. The Lao of Isan have preserved Lao cultural traditions, including [[morlam]] and folk music.]] 
Lao folk dances (ຟ້ອນລຳພື້ນເມືອງ {{IPA-lo|fɔ̂ːn lám pʰɯ̂ːn mɯ́əŋ|}}) are numerous and varied, much like lam lao. In fact, most ''lam'' also have an associated [[folk dance]]. And Other popular dances include the southern ''lam Tang Vai'' (ລຳຕັງຫວາຽ {{IPA|[lám taŋ wǎːj]}}) and ''Lam Saravane'' (ລຳສາຣະວັນ {{IPA|[lám sǎː lā ván]}}).&lt;ref&gt;Lao cultural profile. (2008, February 26). Retrieved from http://www.culturalprofiles.net/laos/Directories/Laos_Cultural_Profile/-54.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular folk dance, however, is the ''lam vong'' (ລຳວົງ {{IPA|[lám wóŋ]}}). It is the national dance of Laos, and versions of it exist throughout the Lao-speaking region and even Cambodia, where it is known as [[ramvong]]. A slow and graceful couples dance, the men form an inner circle and the women an outer circle, with couples dancing around each other while moving in their respective circles.  It is a common feature of [[weddings]], celebrations, and other social events.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, S. and Koh, M. (2008). ''Cultures of the world: laos.'' Tarrytown, NY: Marshall Cavendish Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lam luang (likay lao)===
A truly theatrical derivative of [[morlam]], it is believed to have developed when the morlam began to dress up and act out various characters from the sung repertoire of oral traditions, myths and legends.it is better known as Lam Luang (ລຳເຣື່ອງ {{IPA|[lám lɯ̄əŋ]}}) or ''sung story.'' Stories range from traditional to lewd, serious to bawdy, and are drawn from a diverse range of sources, such as the traditional stories and [[Jataka]] tales to even development projects and community concerns. Music can be classical, morlam, or even modern, and costumes also run the gamut depending on the needs of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Clewley, J. (2001). 'Laos: beyond our khaen.' ''World music: latin and north america, caribbean, india, asia and pacific.'' (II ed.) Broughton, S., Duane, O., McConnachie, J. (ed.) New York, NY: Penguin Putnam.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common to Lam Luang theatre performances are stock characters common to all stories. These include the hero (ພຣະເອກ {{IPA|[pʰāʔ ʔȅːk]}}), the heroine (ນາງເອກ {{IPA|[náːŋ ʔȅːk]}}), king father, queen mother, clown, villain (ຜູ້ຮ້າຽ {{IPA|[pʰȕː hâːj]}}), and supernatural forces such as gods, demons, spirits, or [[ogres]].&lt;ref name="Brandon, J.

'''''Drive-Thru''''' is a 2007 American [[horror film|horror]] [[black comedy]] film, directed by Brendan Cowles and Shane Kuhn, starring [[Leighton Meester]] and [[Nicholas D'Agosto]]. It is set in [[Orange County, California]] and involves an [[evil clown]] as a [[serial killer]]. The film was released [[direct-to-video]] on May 29, 2007.

==Plot==
{{Plot|film|date=November 2017}}
Brandon Meeks (Edward DeRuiter), Tony (Haven Lamoureux) and their girlfriends, Brittany (Jessica Landon) and Tiffany (Nicole Cavazos) arrive at the fast food restaurant "Hella Burger". Upon placing an order at the drive-thru, the group are introduced to the restaurant's mascot, Horny the Clown (voiced by Gordon Clapp) via intercom. The group is continuously insulted after Brandon mouths off to him, causing a furious Tony to enter.  He searches the restaurant and hears a commotion coming from the kitchen. After looking around in the walk-in cooler, Horny suddenly jumps out and attacks him across the room before dunking him face first in the deep fryer. Brandon soon enters, only to find Tony dead in the deep fryer with his face burnt off, much to his horror. He is then attacked and murdered by Horny with a [[Cleaver (knife)|meat cleaver]]. Horny then proceeds outside and brutally murders Brittany and Tiffany when they discover the bodies of their boyfriends in the backseat.

Meanwhile, Mackenzie ([[Leighton Meester]]) is having a house party with her boyfriend Fisher ([[Nicholas D'Agosto]]), and friends Val (Sita Young), Van ([[Penn Badgley]]) and Starfire ([[Rachael Bella]]). The group find a [[ouija board]] and decide to ask it what their future will hold, to which the ouija board spells out "N1KLPL8", a message that is unclear until the next day when the group see a news bulletin, showing the message is the license plate on Brandon's car. The following day at school, Val is ambushed by Horny in the locker room. Mackenzie complains that someone stole her camera at the party, but after school the janitor, Eddie ([[Sean Whalen]]), gives her the camera.

Mackenzie stays behind to develop the photos, and discovers that they show the deaths of the four murdered teenagers. Horny chases Mackenzie into the gymnasium, where she finds Val's head has been placed in a modified microwave, that when turned on causes her head to explode. Horny chases Mackenzie throughout the school, where she finds Lenny has been hanged, before bumping into a police officer, who fails to find any bodies. Mackenzie is taken down to the police station with her mom, Marcia ([[Melora Hardin]]) and dad, Bill ([[Paul Ganus]]) to be questioned by Detective Brenda Chase ([[Lola Glaudini]]) and Detective Dwayne Crockers ([[Larry Joe Campbell]]). The two detectives don't believe Mackenzie's story, but do suspect Lenny as the killer.

The next day, the detectives visit Jack Benjamin (John Gilbert), the owner of Hella Burger, who proves to be no help in solving the case. That night, Mackenzie and Fisher get ready to work at a carnival's haunted house. As they work, they have an argument with Chad ([[Tyler King]]) and Tina (Maliabeth Johnson), before they go into the ride. Suddenly, the lights are switched off and Chad is decapitated, before Tina is stabbed to death by Horny. Mackenzie and Starfire enter the haunted house after it breaks down. They find Fisher in a state of shock after witnessing the murders.

Mackenzie goes to visit Fisher in the hospital with Marcia. Mackenzie becomes annoyed with Marcia as she believes she is hiding something from her, as all the murdered teenagers are the children of her old high-school friends. Detective Chase overhears this and questions Tina's father, Bert ([[Robert Curtis Brown]]).

As Mackenzie arrives home, Marcia tells her that when she was young, she and her friends accidentally murdered Archie Benjamin (Van De La Plante), Jack Benjamin's son, on his 18th birthday at Hella Burger, and now his vengeful spirit has returned from the dead to get revenge. Mackenzie and Fisher are next attacked, resulting in Mackenzie being knocked unconscious and Fisher being cornered. Fisher manages to unmask Horny, who makes Fisher's eyes go bloody red after making eye contact with him before hurling him through a window. Meanwhile, Detective Chase and Detective Crockers come to the house and find Jack Benjamin behind his own bed, trying to hide from Archie.

Mackenzie wakes up in Hella Burger, tied to a chair with her mouth gagged with duct tape and surrounded by her murdered friends. A birthday cake is in front of her, as it is now her 18th birthday. Horny appears and reveals his murderous plan before dousing her with gasoline and holds a lit candle close to her face, about to repeat what Marcia did to him years ago just as Marcia herself arrives in time to save her daughter. Marcia shoots the clown in the mouth but with no effect. He reemerges and pins Marcia to the floor. Mackenzie drinks a bottle of whiskey she had earlier. Horny torments her with another candle while cackling at her face to face, unaware that Mackenzie has whiskey in her mouth. She defeats him by spraying whiskey onto the flame, setting him on fire. Mackenzie and Marcia escape as Horny burns to death.

Mackenzie and Marcia rush to the hospital to see Fisher whose eyes are still bloodshot, revealing that Archie has possessed Fisher's body. Mackenzie goes in to see him only to find the window wide open and his discarded clothes thrown outside on the ground, implying that the nightmare is not over.  Detective Crockers places an order at the drive thru and Horny jumps onto the hood of his patrol car to kill him through the windshield.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2014}}
''Popcorn Pictures'' gave the film a negative review, writing, "Really hard to sit through despite the promise of a killer clown, ''Drive Thru'' is eighty-three minutes of pure fast food junk. Like a fast food burger, it may look good when you pick it up but as soon as you take your first bite, you realize you’ve made a horrible mistake and all you’ve got left is an ultimately fatty concoction of things that are bad for your health."&lt;ref name="ppreview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drive-Thru (2007)|url=http://www.popcornpictures.co.uk/drive-thru-2007/|website=Popcorn Pictures.co.uk|publisher=Popcorn Pictures|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dread Central]] panned the film calling the film's dialogue "painfully bad" and criticized the film's ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Condit|first1=Jon|title=Drive Thru (DVD) - Dread Central|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/4686/drive-thru-dvd/|website=Dread Central.com|publisher=Jon Condit|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[DVD Talk]] called it "routine slice and dice dreariness", criticizing its inadequate humor, "callous characterization", and lack of actual scares.&lt;ref name="dvdtalkrev"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibron|first1=Bill|title=Drive Thru : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/28165/drive-thru/|website=DVD Talk.com|publisher=Bill Gibron|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fires''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Feux'''}}) is a 1936 prose book by the French writer [[Marguerite Yourcenar]]. It consists of aphorisms, prose poetry and fragmentary diary entries alluding to a love story.

==Reception==
Stephen Koch reviewed the book for ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1981, and described it as an "unwritten novel", a type of fragmentary book he compared to works by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Colette]], [[Cyril Connolly]], and [[Roland Barthes]]: "These books insist - on everypage - that they are not novels. They refuse to be novels. Yet through their fragmented alternatives, we still can glimpse the novels they refuse to be - tales otherwise untellable, masked and revealed - for reasons ranging from discretion to despair to a certain visionary breathlessness. ... The unwritten novel among the fantasies and aphorisms of ''Fires'' is a classic tale."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Koch|first=Stephen|date=1981-10-04|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/04/books/flights-of-a-polymath-s-fancy.html|title=Flights of a Polymath's Fancy|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual conference ==
In 2017, the Folk Art Society of America celebrates its 30th conference. The conferences are open to all who register. They include a symposium, a benefit art auction, studio tours, home tours, and museum visits. Local museums usually plan an exhibition to coincide with the occurrence of the Society's conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=One Hundred Miles: The 100th Anniversary of Miles Carpenter|date=1989|publisher=The MIles B.

A scholarship to attend the conference is given to a graduate student of folk art.

== ''Folk Art Messenger'' ==
The ''Folk Art Messenger'' is a journal that includes a variety of articles from writers on topics important to the folk art and self-taught art world including articles about folk artists, auctions, exhibitions, fairs, collectors and book reviews, as well as artists' obituaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Claire|first1=Jean-Claude|title=Calendar of Events|journal=Bulletin De L’Association Les Amis De Francois Ozenda|date=October 1993|volume=50|pages=97–98|language=French|issn=1164-3331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is known for its inclusive approach, focusing on the artists' struggles and successes, rather than hotly debated issues like what to call this type of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maizels|first1=John|title=Raw Creation Outsider Art and Beyond|date=1996|publisher=Phaidon Press Limited|location=London|isbn=0-7148-3149-2|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the first ''Messenger'' was a black-and-white, 6-page fold out, but began to be published in color in 1997 with the 38th issue. Currently, the 40-page magazine carries no advertising and is the only American publication of its type published three time a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sellen|first1=Betty-Carol|title=Self Taught, Outsider, and Folk Art A Guide to American Artists, Locations and Resources|date=2016|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.

While the Folk Art Messenger focuses mainly on American artists, the two have much in common and previously referenced each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folk Art Messenger|url=https://rawvision.com/search/rawvision/messenger|publisher=Raw Vision|access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folk art environments ==
A folk art environment is a large-scale work of art created by a folk or self-taught artist. These works are identified and recorded by [[Saving and Preserving Arts and Cultural Environments]], a non profit arts organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an Art Environment?|url=http://www.spacesarchives.org/about/what-is-an-art-environment/|publisher=SPACES|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Folk Art Society has awarded 12 plaques of recognition to various folk art environments. The plaque from FASA identifies the site as worthy of preservation and protection. Recipients of this plaque include the [[Watts Towers]], [[Howard Finster]]'s Paradise Garden, the [[Miles B. Carpenter House|Miles B. Carpenter Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Miles B. Carpenter Museum|url=http://milesbcarpentermuseum.com/History_Of_The_Miles_B_Carpenter_Museum.shtml|publisher=Miles B. Carpenter Folk Art Museum|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village]].

Bottle Village, located in [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley, Calif.]] was created by folk artist Tressa Prisbrey beginning in 1956. Following her death in 1988, the future of the village was uncertain. Many residents of the area found the site to be garish and wanted it demolished, however recognition from the Folk Art Society of America as well as the state's historic landmark program prevented its  destruction after it was damaged in the Simi Valley earthquake in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Catania|first1=Sara|title=Weathered Work of Folk Art May Face Demolition : Simi Valley: Whimsical collection of structures may be leveled unless shored up. Some want Bottle Village saved; others say it's an eyesore.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-03/local/me-8069_1_bottle-village|access-date=3 March 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=3 January 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The Folk Art Society was founded in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, Va]] and held its first conference in the city as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Halle Saint Pierre|author2=Martine Lusardy|author3=John Maizels|title=Raw Vision 25 Ans d’Art Brut|date=2013|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the organization strives to span the nation and now holds conferences throughout the US, the headquarters remain in Richmond since the founding except for a brief interlude. In 2014, the Society became a part of Longwood University, renamed the Folk Art Society of America at Longwood Center for the Visual Arts or FASA@LCVA. The FASA office and archives were moved to [[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville, Va]] for two years as a part of this transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lohmann|first1=Bill|title=Folk Art Society Transferring to Longwood University|url=http://www.richmond.com/entertainment/folk-art-society-transferring-to-longwood-university/article_23931272-6e49-58d9-869c-c28fa0fcfd6d.html|access-date=11 March 2017|publisher=Richmond Times Dispatch|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this relationship was later discontinued and the Society returned to Richmond in March 2016. Currently the Society is in the process of turning its archives over to the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, Va., and will be working with Lee Shepard, the Vice President for Collections, in order to create a permanent archive that will be digitized and available for scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Staff: E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2830">'''Gruppe 33''' (English: Group 33) was an [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] collective of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artists founded in [[Basel]].

== History ==
“Group 33” was founded on the same day [[Nazism|Nazis]] began [[Nazi book burnings|burning books]] en masse, 10 May 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraft|first=Martin|date=1983|title=50 Jahre “Gruppe 33”|url=|journal=Die Zeitschrift der Kultur|volume=|pages=72-74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed by 15 artists out of a shared [[Political Ideology|political ideology]] in conjunction with a growing resistance to Nazi influence in the border town of Basel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ticinarte.ch/index.php/id-1933-die-33er-in-basel-regt-sich-kuenstlerischer-widerstand.html|title=ticinARTE - ticinarte.ch|website=www.ticinarte.ch|language=de|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members also opposed the dominance of older conservative artists who controlled the Society of Swiss Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (German: ''Gesellschaft Schweizerischer Maler, Bildhauer und Architekten'', or GSMBA).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christ|first=Dorothea|date=1983|title=Die Bedeutung der Gruppe 33|url=|journal=Basler Stadtbuch|volume=|pages=31-41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective was mostly made up of artists and architects from many different disciplines, but also included poets, musicians, actors, and writers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Their work was varied in expression as well as medium, incorporating [[avant-garde]], [[surrealism]], [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]], and [[New Objectivity (architecture)|New Objectivity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Over the course of several decades, 38 artists came to be associated with Gruppe 33. It continued to serve as a network emerging expressions and artistic movements. The group was officially dissolved in 1970.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1983, a retrospective of the group’s work was held at the [[Kunsthalle Basel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=In harter Zeit gegen den Strom|last=Halder-Zwez|first=Annelise|date=18 July 1983|work=Aargauer Tagblatt|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19609">'''Hack''' is a term used primarily in [[stand-up comedy]], but also [[sketch comedy]], [[improv comedy]], and [[comedy writing]] to refer to a joke or premise for a joke that is considered obvious, has been frequently used by [[comedian]]s in the past, and/or is blatantly copied from its original author.  Alternatively, it may refer to a [[comedian]] or performance group that uses hack material or similarly unoriginal devices in their act.  Since comedians and people who work with comedians are typically exposed to many more jokes than the general public, they may recognize a topic, joke or performer as hack before the general public does; as a result, even performers who do well on stage may be considered hacks by their peers.

The word "hack" is derived from the British term "hackneyed" meaning, "over used and thus cheapened, or trite".&lt;ref name="stasonhack"&gt;"http://stason.org/TULARC/art/hack-stand-up-comedy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally a performer will be one of the first to develop a joke about a specific topic, and later on others will follow suit to excess.  This renders the topic "hack" to new performers, but is not considered a detriment to the originator of the material.

Reusing humor can also be [[joke thievery]] if it is taken without permission from another specific comedian.

==History==
From the [[Borscht Belt|Catskill]] and [[Vaudeville]] beginnings of [[stand-up comedy]], hacking was common&lt;ref name="radartake_3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_3.php |title=From The Magazine : Radar Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122182110/http://radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_3.php |archive-date=2009-01-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade.

In the late fifties and early sixties, [[Will Jordan]] perfected a caricature performance of [[Ed Sullivan]] (incorporating mispronouncing the word "show" as "shoe") that became the basis for all other impersonators that followed.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;  Soon after, [[Jackie Mason]], [[Rich Little]] and others began adapting Jordan's caricature to their own acts. This resulted in many of Jordan's shows being canceled due to other performers doing his bit two weeks previous to his shows at the same venue.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt; [[John Byner]], in turn, developed his own, oft-imitated, version of Jordan's caricature that [[George Carlin]] cited as being set up with the words, "Now you know!"

In the sixties, comedy took a turn for the more personal. Comics like [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Richard Pryor]], and George Carlin were no longer regurgitating joke after joke, but instead were offering insight to their own lives from a comedic point of view. As a result, jokes and persona were largely unique to the performer. Hacking proved more difficult, but also more offensive to the writer.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

In the seventies joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The eighties and nineties saw the popularity of stand-up comedy continue to increase. With the advent of pay-cable networks, comics were afforded the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft wherein the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.

For many years, [[Denis Leary]] had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1992 album ''No Cure For Cancer'', he felt Leary had stolen his act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution | author=Kevin Booth and Michael Bertin | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 | title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | author=Joe Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | year=2005 | accessdate=2006-10-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903194637/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 |archivedate = September 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= Rogan |first=Joe |work= Playboy Magazine |date= October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksfaq"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |title= Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions |author= Tim McIntire |year=1998 |publisher= BillHicks.com |archivedate= 2006-03-20 |accessdate=2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from [[pancreatic cancer]], an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; "Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer").&lt;ref name="hicksfaq" /&gt;

Also in the nineties, began a nearly universal hack of an impression of [[Bill Cosby]], the style of which was first unveiled by [[Eddie Murphy]] in his concert ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw|Raw]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/19/movies/eddie-murphy-raw.html | title='Eddie Murphy Raw'  | author=Janet Maslin | publisher=New York Times | year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent times have seen public rivalries between comics over the subject of hacking. [[Louis CK]] has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with [[Dane Cook]] over three bits on Cook's album, ''Retaliation'' that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on CK's album ''Live in Houston''. This claim is further complicated by both artists having performed bits on naming kids that strongly resemble "My Real Name", a bit from [[Steve Martin]]'s album, ''A Wild and Crazy Guy''.&lt;ref name="dead frog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Todd |url=http://www.dead-frog.com/blog/entry/steal_this_joke_louis_ck_vs_dane_cook_vs_steve_martin/ |title=Steal this Joke: Louis C.K. vs. Dane Cook vs. Steve Martin &amp;#124; Dead-Frog - A Comedy Blog |publisher=Dead-Frog |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=August 2010}}

[[Joe Rogan]], by contrast has been very open in accusing [[Carlos Mencia]] of hacking.&lt;ref name="monstersandcritics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/news/article_1265383.php/Joe_Rogan_confronts_Carlos_Mencia_at_Comedy_Store |title=Joe Rogan confronts Carlos Mencia at Comedy Store - People |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Italian comic and satirist Daniele Luttazzi was accused of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as [[George Carlin]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Robert Schimmel]].&lt;ref name="rep_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2010/06/09/news/luttazzi-secopia-4703064/ |title=La Rete contro Luttazzi: "Copia" I dubbi dei fan, il tam-tam cresce - Repubblica.it |accessdate=2010-06-09 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html|title=Luttazzi copia - Parte 1|accessdate=2010-06-11|work=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612084318/http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html|archive-date=2010-06-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But five years before those charges, Luttazzi himself told about his scheme on his personal blog: he wrote that he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against [[La7]] broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show "Decameron", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. La7 shall pay Luttazzi 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/12_marzo_10/satira-tv-luttazzi-vince-causa-contro-la-7-franco_69183226-6a83-11e1-8b63-010bde402ef9.shtml |title= Luttazzi vince la causa contro La7 |date= 10 March 2012 |accessdate= 10 March 2012 |publisher= corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi calls his ruse "the Lenny Bruce trick" after a similar trick played by his hero, Lenny Bruce. Luttazzi asked his readers to find out the original jokes. He awards a prize to anyone who finds a "nugget", i.e. a reference to famous jokes: he calls the game "treasure hunt".&lt;ref name="blo_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/144|title=Caccia al tesoro|accessdate=2005-10-24 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi also calls the charges "naive", explaining why those jokes are not "plagiarized", but "calqued", which is a fair use of original material. He uses a joke by Emo Philips to prove that the meaning of a joke depends on its context.&lt;ref name="blo_lut2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/811|title=Tecnica della diffamazione moderna|accessdate=2010-10-15 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi's blog lists all the comedians and writers quoted in his works.&lt;ref name="blo_lut3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/324|title=Caccia al tesoro|accessdate=2007-12-11 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, one of the contestants on the talent quest television program ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'' was Jordan Paris, whose act was stand-up comedy. His act went well, the judges were impressed, and he made it through to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, G 2011, '[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/comedy/australias-got-plagiarism-ripoff-comic-exposed-20110526-1f50v.html Australia's Got Plagiarism: rip-off comic exposed]', ''Brisbane Times'' 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians [[Lee Mack]] and [[Geoff Keith]]. The television network eventually decided to give him a chance to redeem himself and he was allowed to compete in the semi-final, provided he use his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well - "I just sacked my two writers - Copy and Paste" - had been done in 2009 by comedian [[Jeffrey Ross]], about [[Brad Garrett]], at a roast of [[Joan Rivers]]. Ross had said, "This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste."&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, D 2011, [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/oops-he-did-it-again-ripoff-comic-plunders-joke-about-plagiarism-20110629-1gq1d.html 'Oops. He did it again: Rip-off comic plunders joke about plagiarism'], ''Brisbane Times'', 29 June 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Blogger and comedian [[Troy Holm]] was ridiculed on the [[social networking]] site [[Facebook]]&lt;ref name="facebook1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Occupy-Troy-Holm/217011661714006 |title=Occupy Troy Holm |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for stealing jokes and stories from comedian [[Doug Stanhope]] and posting them to his Blog from 2010, [[plagiarism|claiming them as his own work]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701002315/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html |archive-date=2012-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including Stanhope's "Fuck someone uglier than you" routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103154727/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |archive-date=2012-01-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found on Stanhope's Acid Bootleg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Doug+Stanhope/ACID+Bootleg |title=ACID Bootleg – Doug Stanhope – Listen and discover music at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doug Stanhope |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko_%28album%29 |title=Sicko (album) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}} nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701001921/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html |archive-date=2012-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the "Occupy Troy Holm" Movement.&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;  Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that "To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that ''isn't'' mine?"&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;

==Hacking in the media==
Hacking is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often entire premises in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.

[[Dick Cavett]] and [[Woody Allen]] often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other.

Allen's jokes and topics were regularly stolen by the highly successful [[television]] show, ''[[Laugh In]]''.&lt;ref name="Cavett interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheckymagazine.com/cavett.htm |title=SHECKY! Interview: DICK CAVETT! |publisher=Sheckymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved extremely painful to Allen.

Several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including "[[Missionary: Impossible]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]", and "[[The Italian Bob]]" have poked fun at ''Family Guy'', implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from ''The Simpsons''. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771 | title = Interview: Matt Groening | accessdate = 2006-12-12 | author = Nathan Rabin | date = 2006-04-26 | work = The A.V. Club | publisher = Onion Inc. | quote = The rivalry is very affectionate...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familyguy.tktv.net/news.html |title=Timeline at familyguy.tktv.net|quote=You know, it's funny. Matt Groening and I actually have a great relationship...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recourse and consequences==
There is, historically, very little [[legal recourse]] taken in cases of hacking. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. [[W. C. Fields]] reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a hack comic's legs broken.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

Typically, the repercussions of hacking are limited to personal animosity. On this issue, it sometimes appears that the offended comics are alone in their concern. For example, on February 10, 2007 at the [[Comedy Store]] in Los Angeles, Joe Rogan argued on-stage with Carlos Mencia, accusing him of hacking other comedians' work. According to Rogan's account, he had just finished his act and introduced the next performer, [[Ari Shaffir]], as a comedian who opens for "Carlos Men-steal-ia".&lt;ref name="rogan-video"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=53945 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407105943/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=53945 |archive-date=2007-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mencia took offense and walked on the stage. The Comedy Store later cancelled Rogan's shows and suggested he "take a break" from the Comedy Store, which was then followed by Rogan's manager (who also manages Mencia) dropping Rogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070215/ENTERTAIN/70215009 |title=Joe Rogan and Carlos Mencia face off at comedy club |accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire incident was filmed as part of Rogan's internet reality show, ''JoeShow''. It was then made available to watch or download at numerous websites, including Rogan's.&lt;ref name="rogan-video"/&gt;

Joe Rogan said, "People take plagiarism so seriously in all other forms of media, whether it's music, newspapers, books, but with comedy, it's like, 'You're on your own, fucker.'"&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

The [[internet]], however, has opened up a new medium for "outing" a hack. Websites like [[YouTube]] allow users to upload videos and share them with others. This has made it much easier to show evidence of joke thievery in a public forum.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In January 2012, Troy Holm, an amateur Comic, stole several jokes from [[Doug Stanhope]] and posted them to his [[blog]] under the guise of having written them, himself. Stanhope discovered the blog and tipped-off his fans who then deluged Holms blog with negative and berating comments. The blog has since been taken down.&lt;ref name="Laughspin Stanhope"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laughspin.com/2012/01/04/comedian-blatantly-steals-doug-stanhopes-material-fans-revolt |title=Comedian blatantly steals Doug Stanhope’s material, fans revolt |publisher=Laughspin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roadrunner Records Stanhope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Records |first=Roadrunner |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Doug-Stanhope-Punishes-A-Plagiarist-23921.aspx |title=Doug Stanhope Punishes A Plagiarist |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Rosenthal]] and [[Steve Silberberg]] have published a ''Guide to Hack'' to help new comics avoid hacking,&lt;ref name="stason hack"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stas Bekman: stas (at) stason.org |url=http://stason.org/TULARC/art/hack-stand-up-comedy/ |title=The Complete Guide To Hack Stand-Up Comedy |publisher=Stason.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which references (and gives credit to) an earlier work on the same subject by [[Andy Kindler]] called, ''The Hacks Handbook: A Starter Kit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nathansmart.com/akhh.pdf |title=Handbook |website=www.nathansmart.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kindler national lampoon"&gt;NATIONAL LAMPOON February 1991 pp. 34-36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|''Birthday Book Printing'', the fourth of the six [[Walk of Ideas]] sculptures displayed in [[Berlin]] during 2006, represents a pile of modern [[codex]] books.]]

The '''history of books''' starts with the [[History of writing|development of writing]], and various other inventions such as [[paper]] and [[printing]], and continues through to the modern day business of [[book printing]]. The earliest history of books actually predates what would conventionally be called "books" today and begins with tablets, scrolls, and sheets of [[papyrus]]. Then hand-bound, expensive, and elaborate books known as [[codices]] appeared. These gave way to [[printing press|press-printed]] volumes and eventually lead to the mass printed tomes prevalent today. Contemporary books may even have no physical presence with the advent of the [[e-book]]. The book also became more accessible to the disabled with the advent of [[Braille]] and spoken books.

== Clay tablets ==
[[File:Tablet describing goddess Inanna's battle with the mountain Ebih, Sumerian - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC07117.JPG|thumb|[[Sumer]]ian [[clay tablet]], currently housed in the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] at the [[University of Chicago]], inscribed with the text of the poem ''[[Inanna#Justice myths|Inanna and Ebih]]'' by the priestess [[Enheduanna]], the first author whose name is known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberta Binkley|title=Rhetoric before and beyond the Greeks|year=2004|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791460993|pages=47|chapter=Reading the Ancient Figure of Enheduanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Clay tablets were used in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 3rd millennium BC. The calamus, an instrument in the form of a triangle, was used to make characters in moist clay. People used to use fire to dry the tablets out. At [[Nineveh]], over 20,000 tablets were found, dating from the 7th century BC; this was the archive and library of the kings of [[Assyria]], who had workshops of copyists and conservationists at their disposal. This presupposes a degree of organization with respect to books, consideration given to conservation, classification, etc. Tablets were used right up until the 19th century in various parts of the world, including Germany, Chile, Philippines and the Saharan Desert.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/books/early/|title=Early Writing|website=www.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuneiform and Sumerian Writing ===
Writing originated as a form of record keeping in Sumer during the fourth millennium BCE with the advent of cuneiform. Many clay tablets have been found that show cuneiform writing used to record legal contracts, create lists of assets, and eventually to record Sumerian literature and myths. Scribal schools have been found by archaeologists from as early as the second millennium BCE where students were taught the art of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papyrus ==
{{Main|Papyrus}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian Papyrus]]

After extracting the marrow from the stems of '''Papyrus reed''', a series of steps (humidification, pressing, drying, gluing, and cutting) produced media of variable quality, the best being used for sacred writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/papyrology-collection/how-ancient-papyrus-was-made|title=How Ancient Papyrus Was Made {{!}} U-M Library|website=www.lib.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Egypt]], papyrus was used as a medium for writing surfaces, maybe as early as from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], but first evidence is from the account books of King [[Neferirkare Kakai]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty]] (about 2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books. The Book Arts from Antiquity to the Renaissance''. American Library Association / The British Library 1991, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; A calamus, the stem of a reed sharpened to a point, or bird feathers were used for writing. The script of Egyptian [[scribes]] was called [[hieratic]], or sacerdotal writing; it is not [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], but a simplified form more adapted to manuscript writing (hieroglyphs usually being engraved or painted). Egyptians exported papyrus to other Mediterranean civilizations including Greece and Rome where it was used until parchment was developed.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papyrus]] books were in the form of a [[scroll]] of several sheets pasted together, for a total length of 10 meters or more.  Some books, such as the history of the reign of [[Ramses III]], were over 40 meters long. Books rolled out horizontally; the text occupied one side, and was divided into columns. The title was indicated by a label attached to the cylinder containing the book. Many papyrus texts come from tombs, where prayers and sacred texts were deposited (such as the [[Book of the Dead]], from the early 2nd millennium BC).

== East Asia ==
[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|upright|A Chinese bamboo book]]

Before the introduction of books, writing on [[Oracle bone|bone]], shells, [[Bamboo and wooden slips|wood]] and [[silk]] was prevalent in [[China]] long before the 2nd century BC, until [[paper]] was invented in China around the 1st century AD. China's first recognizable books, called jiance or jiandu, were made of rolls of thin split and dried bamboo bound together with hemp, silk, or leather.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 18&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the process using the bark of the blackberry bush to create paper is attributed to [[Cai Lun|Ts'ai Lun]] (the cousin of Kar-Shun), but it may be older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipst.gatech.edu/amp/collection/museum_invention_paper.htm|title=Invention of Paper|website=www.ipst.gatech.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texts were reproduced by [[woodblock printing]]; the diffusion of Buddhist texts was a main impetus to large-scale production. The format of the book evolved with intermediate stages of scrolls folded [[concertina]]-style, scrolls bound at one edge ("butterfly books") and so on.

Although there is no exact date known, between 618 and 907 AD–The period of the Tang Dynasty–the first printing of books started in China.&lt;ref name=mcd&gt;{{cite book|last=McDermott|first=Joseph P.|title=A social history of the Chinese book: Books and literati culture in late imperial China|year=2006|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-962-209-782-7|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancientpages.com/2017/09/25/ancient-romans-invented-first-bound-book/|title=Ancient Romans Invented The First Bound Book {{!}} Ancient Pages|date=2017-09-25|work=Ancient Pages|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant printed book is a work of the [[Diamond Sutra]] and dates back to 868 AD, during the Tang Dynasty.&lt;ref name=mcd /&gt; The Diamond Sutra was printed by method of [[woodblock printing]], a strenuous method in which the text to be printed would be carved into a woodblock's surface, essentially to be used to stamp the words onto the writing surface medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture/chapter/3-2-history-of-books/|title=3.2 History of Books {{!}} Understanding Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass Communication|website=open.lib.umn.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodblock printing was a common process for the reproduction of already handwritten texts during the earliest stages of book printing. This process was incredibly time-consuming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/invention-woodblock-printing-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279|title=The Invention of Woodblock Printing in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|work=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Education|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the meticulous and time-consuming process that woodblock printing was, [[Bi Sheng]], a key contributor to the history of printing, invented the process of [[Movable type|movable type printing]] (1041-1048 AD).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/invention-woodblock-printing-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279|title=The Invention of Woodblock Printing in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|work=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Education|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/movableprt.shtml|title=The Invention of Movable Type|last=Lee|first=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y.|website=www.silk-road.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bi Sheng developed a printing process in which written text could be copied with the use of formed character types, the earliest types being made of [[ceramic]] or clay material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The method of movable type printing would later become improved by [[Johannes Gutenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|title=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|website=www.historyguide.org|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-columbian codices of the Americas ==
[[File:Dresden codex, page 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dresden Codex]] (page 49)]]

In Mesoamerica, information was recorded on long strips of paper, agave fibers, or animal hides, which were then folded and protected by wooden covers.  These were thought to have existed since the time of the Classical Period between the 3rd and 8th centuries, CE.  Many of these codices were thought to contain astrological information, religious calendars, knowledge about the gods, genealogies of the rulers, cartographic information, and tribute collection.  Many of these codices were stored in temples but were ultimately destroyed by the Spanish explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Suarez, M.E. &amp; Wooudhuysen, H.R. (2013). The book: A global history. Oxford, Oxford University Press. Pages 656–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the only completely deciphered pre-Columbian writing system is the [[Maya script]].  The Maya, along with [[Mesoamerican writing systems|several]] other cultures in [[Mesoamerica]], constructed concertina-style books written on [[Amate]] paper. Nearly all Mayan texts were [[Diego de Landa|destroyed]] by the Spanish during colonization on cultural and religious grounds.  One of the few surviving examples is the [[Dresden Codex]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/pt/item/11621/ |title = O Códice de Dresden |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1200–1250 |accessdate = 2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although only the Maya have been shown to have a writing system capable of conveying any concept that can be conveyed via speech (at about the same level as the modern [[Japanese writing system]]), other [[Mesoamerican]] cultures had more rudimentary [[Ideogram|ideographical writing systems]] which were contained in similar concertina-style books, one such example being the [[Aztec codices]].

=== Florentine Codex ===
There are more than 2,000 illustrations drawn by native artists that represent this era. Bernardino de Sahagun tells the story of Aztec people’s lives and their natural history. The Florentine Codex speaks about the culture religious cosmology and ritual practices, society, economics, and natural history of the Aztec people. The manuscript are arranged in both the Nahuatl language and in Spanish. The English translation of the complete Nahuatl text of all twelve volumes of the Florentine Codex took ten years. Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble had a decade of long work but made it an important contribution to Mesoamerican ethnohistory. Years later, in 1979, the Mexican government published a full-color volume  of the Florentine Codex. Now, since 2012, it is available digitally and fully accessible to those interested in Mexican and Aztec History.

The Florentine Codex is a 16th century ethnographic research study brought about by the Spanish Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun. The codex itself was actually named ''La Historia Universal de las Cosas de Nueva España.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/516552.|title=Project MUSE|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernardino de Sahagun worked on this project from 1545 up until his death in 1590. The Florentine Codex consist of twelve books. It is 2400 pages long but divided into the twelve books by categories such as; The Gods, Ceremonies, Omens, and other cultural aspects of Aztec people.

== Wax tablets ==
[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002b.jpg|thumb|right|Woman holding wax tablets in the form of the [[codex]]. Wall painting from [[Pompeii]], before 79 AD.]]

Romans used wax-coated wooden tablets or ''pugillares'' upon which they could write and erase by using a [[stylus]]. One end of the stylus was pointed, and the other was spherical. Usually these tablets were used for everyday purposes (accounting, notes) and for teaching writing to children, according to the methods discussed by [[Quintilian]] in his ''Institutio Oratoria'' X Chapter 3. Several of these tablets could be assembled in a form similar to a [[codex]]. Also the etymology of the word codex (block of wood) suggest that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press 2003 [reprint], p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parchment ==
{{Main|Parchment}}

Parchment progressively replaced [[papyrus]].  Legend attributes its invention to [[Eumenes II]], the king of [[Pergamon]], from which comes the name "pergamineum," which became "parchment."  Its production began around the 3rd century BC.  Made using the skins of animals (sheep, cattle, donkey, antelope, etc.), parchment proved to be easier to conserve over time; it was more solid, and allowed one to erase text.  It was a very expensive medium because of the rarity of material and the time required to produce a document. [[Vellum]] is the finest quality of parchment.

=== Greece and Rome ===
The scroll of [[papyrus]] is called "volumen" in Latin, a word which signifies "circular movement," "roll," "spiral," "whirlpool," "revolution" (similar, perhaps, to the modern English interpretation of "swirl") and finally "a roll of writing paper, a rolled manuscript, or a book."
In the 7th century [[Isidore of Seville]] explains the relation between codex, book and scroll in his ''Etymologiae'' (VI.13) as this:
{{cquote|A codex is composed of many books (''librorum''); a book is of one scroll (''voluminis''). It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (''caudex'') of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches.}}

=== Description ===
The scroll is rolled around two vertical wooden axes.  This design allows only sequential usage; one is obliged to read the text in the order in which it is written, and it is impossible to place a marker in order to directly access a precise point in the text.  It is comparable to modern video cassettes.  Moreover, the reader must use both hands to hold on to the vertical wooden rolls and therefore cannot read and write at the same time.  The only volumen in common usage today is the Jewish [[Torah]].

=== Book culture ===
The authors of [[ancient history|Antiquity]] had no rights concerning their published works; there were neither authors' nor publishing rights.  Anyone could have a text recopied, and even alter its contents.  Scribes earned money and authors earned mostly glory, unless a patron provided cash; a book made its author famous.  This followed the traditional conception of the culture: an author stuck to several models, which he imitated and attempted to improve.  The status of the author was not regarded as absolutely personal.

From a political and religious point of view, books were censored very early: the works of [[Protagoras]] were burned because he was a proponent of [[agnosticism]] and argued that one could not know whether or not the gods existed. Generally, cultural conflicts led to important periods of book destruction: in 303, the emperor [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of Christian texts.  Some [[Christians]] later burned libraries, and especially heretical or non-canonical Christian texts.  These practices are found throughout human history but have ended in many nations today.  A few nations today still greatly censor and even burn books.

But there also exists a less visible but nonetheless effective form of censorship when books are reserved for the elite; the book was not originally a medium for expressive liberty.  It may serve to confirm the values of a political system, as during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]], who skillfully surrounded himself with great authors.  This is a good ancient example of the control of the media by a political power.  However, private and public censorship have continued into the modern era, albeit in various forms.

=== Proliferation and conservation of books in Greece ===
Little information concerning books in Ancient [[Greece]] survives.  Several vases (6th and 5th centuries BC) bear images of volumina.  There was undoubtedly no extensive trade in books, but there existed several sites devoted to the sale of books.

The spread of books, and attention to their cataloging and conservation, as well as literary criticism developed during the [[Hellenistic]] period with the creation of large libraries in response to the desire for knowledge exemplified by [[Aristotle]].  These libraries were undoubtedly also built as demonstrations of political prestige:
* The [[Library of Alexandria]], a library created by [[Ptolemy I|Ptolemy Soter]] and set up by [[Demetrius Phalereus]] (Demetrius of Phaleron). It contained 500,900 volumes (in the ''Museion'' section) and 40,000 at the Serapis temple (''Serapeion''). All books in the luggage of visitors to Egypt were inspected, and could be held for copying. The Museion was partially destroyed in 47 BC.
* The Library at [[Pergamon]], founded by [[Attalus I]]; it contained 200,000 volumes which were moved to the Serapeion by [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]], after the destruction of the Museion. The Serapeion was partially destroyed in 391, and the last books disappeared in 641 CE following the [[Arab]] conquest.
* The Library at [[Athens]], the ''Ptolemaion'', which gained importance following the destruction of the [[Library at Alexandria]] ; the [[Library of Pantainos]], around 100 CE; the library of [[Hadrian]], in 132 CE.
* The Library at [[Rhodes]], a library that rivaled the [[Library of Alexandria]].
* The Library at [[Antioch]], a public library of which [[Euphorion of Chalcis]] was the director near the end of the 3rd century.

The libraries had copyist workshops, and the general organisation of books allowed for the following:
* Conservation of an example of each text
* Translation (the [[Septuagint]] [[Bible]], for example)
* Literary criticisms in order to establish reference texts for the copy (example : ''[[The Iliad]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]'')
* A catalog of books
* The copy itself, which allowed books to be disseminated

=== Book production in Rome ===
Book production developed in [[Rome]] in the 1st century BC with Latin literature that had been influenced by the Greek. Conservative estimates places the number of potential readers in Imperial Rome at around 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|title=Scrolling Down the Ages|last=Beard|first=Mary|date=April 16, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629200012/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|archive-date=June 29, 2017|dead-url=|quote=Imperial Rome had a population of at least a million. Using a conservative estimate of literacy levels, there would have been more than 100,000 readers in the city.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This diffusion primarily concerned circles of literary individuals.  [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]] was the editor of his friend [[Cicero]].  However, the book business progressively extended itself through the [[Roman Empire]]; for example, there were bookstores in [[Lyon]].  The spread of the book was aided by the extension of the Empire, which implied the imposition of the [[Latin]] tongue on a great number of people (in Spain, Africa, etc.).

[[Library|Libraries]] were private or created at the behest of an individual. [[Julius Caesar]], for example, wanted to establish one in Rome, proving that libraries were signs of political prestige.

In the year 377, there were 28 libraries in Rome, and it is known that there were many smaller libraries in other cities. Despite the great distribution of books, scientists do not have a complete picture as to the literary scene in antiquity as thousands of books have been lost through time.

== Paper ==
{{Main|History of paper}}

Papermaking has traditionally been traced to China about AD 105, when [[Cai Lun]], an official attached to the Imperial court during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD), created a sheet of paper using [[mulberry]] and other [[bast fibre]]s along with [[fishnets]], old rags, and [[hemp]] waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2007-11-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While paper used for wrapping and padding was used in China since the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt;  paper used as a writing medium only became widespread by the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 1"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century in China, sheets of paper were beginning to be used for [[toilet paper]] as well.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;123&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD) paper was folded and sewn into square [[tea bag|bags]] to preserve the flavor of tea.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt; The [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) that followed was the first government to issue [[banknote|paper currency]].

An important development was the mechanization of paper manufacture by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] papermakers. The introduction of water-powered [[paper mill]]s, the first certain evidence of which dates to the 11th century in Córdoba, Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400.

Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of [[parchment]] and then falling further.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400.

== Middle Ages ==
{{Main|Manuscript culture|Illuminated manuscript}}
[[File:Codex Manesse Ulrich von Singenberg.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[codex Manesse]]'', a book from the Middle Ages]]

By the end of antiquity, between the 2nd and 4th centuries, the [[scroll]] was replaced by the [[codex]]. The book was no longer a continuous roll, but a collection of sheets attached at the back.  It became possible to access a precise point in the text quickly.  The codex is equally easy to rest on a table, which permits the reader to take notes while he or she is reading.  The codex form improved with the separation of words, capital letters, and punctuation, which permitted silent reading.  Tables of contents and indices facilitated direct access to information.  This form was so effective that it is still the standard book form, over 1500 years after its appearance.

Paper would progressively replace parchment.  Cheaper to produce, it allowed a greater diffusion of books.

=== Books in monasteries ===
A number of Christian books were destroyed at the order of [[Diocletian]] in 304 AD. During the turbulent periods of the invasions, it was the monasteries that conserved religious texts and certain works of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for the West.  But there would also be important copying centers in [[Byzantium]].

The role of monasteries in the conservation of books is not without some ambiguity:
* Reading was an important activity in the lives of monks, which can be divided into prayer, intellectual work, and manual labor (in the [[Benedictine]] order, for example).  It was therefore necessary to make copies of certain works.  Accordingly, there existed scriptoria (the plural of scriptorium) in many monasteries, where monks copied and decorated manuscripts that had been preserved.
* However, the conservation of books was not exclusively in order to preserve ancient culture; it was especially relevant to understanding religious texts with the aid of ancient knowledge.  Some works were never recopied, having been judged too dangerous for the monks.  Moreover, in need of blank media, the monks scraped off manuscripts, thereby destroying ancient works.  The transmission of knowledge was centered primarily on sacred texts.

=== Copying and conserving books ===
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|An author portrait of [[Jean Miélot]] writing his compilation of the ''Miracles of Our Lady'', one of his many popular works.]]

Despite this ambiguity, monasteries in the West and the Eastern Empire permitted the conservation of a certain number of secular texts, and several libraries were created: for example, [[Cassiodorus]] ('Vivarum' in Calabria, around 550), or [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] in [[Constantinople]].  There were several libraries, but the survival of books often depended on political battles and ideologies, which sometimes entailed massive destruction of books or difficulties in production (for example, the distribution of books during the [[Iconoclasm]] between 730 and 842).  A long list of very old and surviving libraries that now form part of the [[Vatican Archives]] can be found in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].

A very strong example of the early copying and conserving books is that of the [[Quran]]. After Muhammad, his companion Abu Bakr, on the recommendation of Umar Bin Alkhattab, assigned Zayd bin Saabit to compile the first official scripture of the Quran. Zayd collected all the available scriptures of the Quran scripted by different companions of Muhammad during his life. He compiled one scripture and got it verified by all the companions who had memorized the whole book while Muhammad was alive. Then this first official scripture was kept at the house of Hafsa, the wife of the Muhammad. By the time of the third caliph Uthmaan, the Islamic state had spread over a large portion of the known world. He ordered the preparation of the official copies of the first official scripture. The copies were duly verified for accuracy. These copies were sent to each city of the caliphate so that further copies can be made locally with the perfect accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quran#Compilation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To help preserve books and protect them from thieves, librarians would create [[Chained library|chained libraries]]. Chained Libraries were books displayed next to each other to create a tight bond. This eliminated unauthorised removal of books. One of the earliest chained libraries was in England during the 1500s. Popular culture also has examples of chained libraries, such as in [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]] by [[J.K Rowling]].

=== The ''scriptorium'' ===
The scriptorium was the workroom of monk copyists; here, books were copied, decorated, rebound, and conserved.  The armarius directed the work and played the role of librarian.

The role of the copyist was multifaceted: for example, thanks to their work, texts circulated from one monastery to another.  Copies also allowed monks to learn texts and to perfect their religious education.  The relationship with the book thus defined itself according to an intellectual relationship with [[God]].  But if these copies were sometimes made for the monks themselves, there were also copies made on demand.

The task of copying itself had several phases: the preparation of the manuscript in the form of notebooks once the work was complete, the presentation of pages, the copying itself, revision, correction of errors, decoration, and [[bookbinding|binding]].  The book therefore required a variety of competencies, which often made a manuscript a collective effort.

=== Transformation from the literary edition in the 12th century ===

[[File:Sandro Botticelli - The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|The scene in [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[Madonna of the Book]]'' (1480) reflects the presence of books in the houses of richer people in his time.]]
The revival of cities in Europe would change the conditions of book production and extend its influence, and the monastic period of the book would come to an end.  This revival accompanied the intellectual renaissance of the period. The [[Manuscript culture]] outside of the monastery developed in these university-cities in Europe in this time.  It is around the first universities that new structures of production developed: reference manuscripts were used by students and professors for teaching [[theology]] and liberal arts.  The development of commerce and of the bourgeoisie brought with it a demand for specialized and general texts (law, history, novels, etc.).  It is in this period that writing in the common vernacular developed (courtly poetry, novels, etc.).  Commercial scriptoria became common, and the profession of book seller came into being, sometimes dealing internationally.

There is also the creation of royal [[libraries]] as in the case of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] and [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]. Books were also collected in private libraries, which became more common in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The use of paper diffused through Europe in the 14th century.  This material, less expensive than [[parchment]], came from China via the [[Arabs]] in Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries. It was used in particular for ordinary copies, while [[parchment]] was used for luxury editions.

== Printing press ==
{{Main|Printing press}}

The invention of the moveable type on the [[printing press]] by Johann Fust, Peter Schoffer and [[Johannes Gutenberg]] around 1440 marks the entry of the book into the industrial age.  The Western book was no longer a single object, written or reproduced by request.  The publication of a book became an enterprise, requiring capital for its realization and a market for its distribution. The cost of each individual book (in a large edition) was lowered enormously, which in turn increased the distribution of books.  The book in codex form and printed on paper, as we know it today, dates from the 15th century. Books printed before January 1, 1501, are called [[incunable]]s. The spreading of book printing all over Europe occurred relatively quickly, but most books were still printed in [[Latin]]. The spreading of the concept of printing books in the [[vernacular]] was a somewhat slower process.

== Contemporary era ==
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] more books began to pour off European presses, creating an early form of information overload for many readers.  Nowhere was this more the case than in Enlightenment Scotland, where students were exposed to a wide variety of books during their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership|journal=The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland|year=2012|volume=2|pages=297–309|url=https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The demands of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (founded 1804), the [[American Bible Society]] (founded 1816), and other non-denominational publishers for enormously large inexpensive runs of texts led to numerous innovations. The introduction of steam printing presses a little before 1820, closely followed by new steam paper mills, constituted the two most major innovations.  Together, they caused book prices to drop and the number of books to increase considerably.  Numerous bibliographic features, like the positioning and formulation of titles and subtitles, were also affected by this new production method.  New types of documents appeared later in the 19th century:  [[photography]], [[sound recording]] and [[film]].

[[Typewriter]]s and eventually computer based word processors and printers let people print and put together their own documents. [[Desktop publishing]] is common in the 21st century.

Among a series of developments that occurred in the 1990s, the spread of digital multimedia, which encodes texts, images, animations, and sounds in a unique and simple form was notable for the book publishing industry. [[Hypertext]] further improved access to information. Finally, the [[internet]] lowered production and distribution costs.

=== E-books and the future of the book ===
It is difficult to predict the future of the book in an era of fast-paced technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Darnton]], ''The Case for Books: Past, Present and Future'', New York, Public Affairs, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-58648-826-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anxieties about the "death of books" have been expressed throughout the history of the medium, perceived as threatened by competing media such as radio, television, and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8xg8EfQnnAC|title=The Future of the Book|last=Nunberg|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpNtvB4YF2cC|title=This is Not the End of the Book: A Conversation Curated by Jean-Philippe de Tonnac|last=Carrière|first=Jean-Claude|last2=Eco|first2=Umberto|date=2012-05-01|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-955245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views are generally exaggerated, and "dominated by fetishism, fears about the end of humanism and ideas of techno-fundamentalist progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballatore|first=Andrea|last2=Natale|first2=Simone|date=2015-05-18|title=E-readers and the death of the book: Or, new media and the myth of the disappearing medium|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/05/18/1461444815586984|journal=New Media &amp; Society|pages=1461444815586984|doi=10.1177/1461444815586984|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The print book medium has proven to be very resilient and adaptable.

A good deal of reference material, designed for direct access instead of sequential reading, as for example [[encyclopedia]]s, exists less and less in the form of books and increasingly on the web. Leisure reading materials are increasingly published in e-reader formats.

Although electronic books, or e-books, had limited success in the early years, and readers were resistant at the outset, the demand for books in this format has grown dramatically, primarily because of the popularity of e-reader devices and as the number of available titles in this format has increased. Since the [[Amazon Kindle]] was released in 2007, the e-book has become a digital phenomenon and many theorize that it will take over hardback and paper books in future. E-books are much more accessible and easier to buy and it’s also cheaper to purchase an E-Book rather than its physical counterpart due to paper expenses being deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teenink.com/opinion/current_events_politics/article/211256/Are-E-books-Taking-Over-the-Printed-World/|title=Are E-books Taking Over the Printed World? – Teen Politics Essay|website=www.teenink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another important factor in the increasing popularity of the e-reader is its continuous diversification. Many e-readers now support basic operating systems, which facilitate email and other simple functions. The [[iPad]] is the most obvious example of this trend, but even mobile phones can host e-reading software.

== Reading for the blind ==
[[Braille]] is a system of reading and writing through the use of the finger tips. Braille was developed as a system of efficient communication for blind and partially blind alike.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://brailleworks.com/braille-resources/history-of-braille/|title=History of Braille - Braille Works|work=Braille Works|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system consists of sixty-three characters and is read left to right. These characters are made with small raised dots in two columns similar to a modern [[Dominoes|domino piece]] to represent each letter.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Braille-writing-system|title=Braille {{!}} writing system|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers can identify characters with two fingers. Reading speed averages one hundred and twenty-five words per minute and can reach two hundred words per minute.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== The making of Braille ===
Braille was named after its creator [[Louis Braille]] in 1824 in [[France]]. Braille stabbed himself in the eyes at the age of three with his father's leather working tools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Braille spent nine years working on a previous system of communication called [[night writing]] by [[Charles Barbier]]. Braille published his book "procedure for writing words, music, and plainsong in dots", in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nfb.org/1829-braille-book|title=1829 Braille Book|date=2010-10-04|work=National Federation of the Blind|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 France made Braille the "official communication system for blind individuals".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Valentin Haüy]] was the first person to put Braille on paper in the form of a book.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1932 Braille became accepted and used in English speaking countries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1965 the Nemeth Code of Braille Mathematics and Scientific Notation was created. The code was developed to assign symbols to advanced mathematical notations and operations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The system has remained the same, only minor adjustments have been made to it since its creation.

=== Spoken books ===
The spoken book was originally created in the 1930s to provide the blind and visually impaired with a medium to enjoy books. In 1932 the [[American Foundation for the Blind]] created the first recordings of spoken books on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silksoundbooks.com/history-of-audiobooks.html|title=The History of the audiobooks|last=Silksoundbooks|website=www.silksoundbooks.com|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, a British based foundation, [[Royal National Institute of Blind People|Royal National Institute for the Blind]] (RNIB), was the first to deliver talking books to the blind on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each record contained about thirty minutes of audio on both sides, and the records were played on a [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. Spoken books changed mediums in the 1960s with the transition from vinyl records to cassette tapes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/a-short-history-of-the-audiobook-20-years-after-the-first-portable-digital-audio-device|title=A short history of the audiobook, 20 years after the first portable digital audio device|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next progression of spoken books came in the 1980s with the widespread use of compact discs. Compact discs reached more people and made it possible to listen to books in the car.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1995 the term [[audiobook]] became the industry standard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, the internet enabled audiobooks to become more accessible and portable. Audiobooks could now be played in their entirety instead of being split onto multiple disks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Academic discipline==

[[File:Bucheinband.15.Jh.r.Inkunabel.jpg|thumb|right|A 15th-century [[Incunable]]. Notice the blind-tooled cover, corner bosses and clasps.]]
The history of the book as an [[academic discipline]] studies the production, transmission, circulation and dissemination of text from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] to the present day. Its scope includes the book as object, the [[history of ideas]], [[history of religion]], [[bibliography]], [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]], [[archiving|curation]] and the future of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sites.hps.cam.ac.uk/research/hb.html Johns, A. (1998) Research Guide: The History of the Book. Department of History and Philosophy of Science. University of Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
The history of the book came into existence in the latter half of the 20th century. It was fostered by [[William Ivins Jr.]]'s ''Prints and Visual Communication'' (1953) and [[Henri-Jean Martin]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]'s ''L'apparition du livre'' (''The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing, 1450–1800'') in 1958 as well as [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ''Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man'' (1962).  Another notable pioneer in the History of the Book is [[Robert Darnton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=I.R.Willison|url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/8/1/July.pdf|title=The History of the Book as a Field of Study within the Humanities|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Examples of Ibid, from "Justice" by Michael J- Sandel 2013-04-08 20-17.jpg|thumbnail|An example of Ibid. citations in use, from "Justice" by [[Michael J. Sandel]].]]

'''Ibid''' is an abbreviation for the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:ibidem#Latin|ibīdem]]'', meaning "in the same place", commonly used in an [[endnote]], [[footnote]], [[bibliography]] [[citation]], or [[reference#Scholarship|scholarly reference]] to refer to the [[Source text|source]] cited in the preceding note or list item. This is similar to ''[[wikt:idem#Latin|īdem]]'', literally meaning "the same", abbreviated ''Id.'', which is commonly used in [[legal citation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/idem |title=Idem|publisher=thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibid. may also be used in the Harvard (name-date) system for in-text references where there has been a close previous citation from the same source material.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Manual of Style Online, (13.64).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Hart's Rules, Oxford University Press, 2005, p.396&lt;/ref&gt; The previous reference should be immediately visible, e.g. within the same paragraph or page. Some academic publishers now prefer that "ibid." not be italicized, as it is a commonly found term.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/notesforauthors/cambridge_style.doc |title=Style sheet: Cambridge University Press |format=DOC |date=2013 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ibid. is an [[abbreviation]] where the last two letters of the word are omitted, it takes a full stop (period) in both British and American usage.

==Example==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:[1] E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' (New York: Academic, 1997), 23.
:[2] Ibid.
:[3] Ibid., 29.
:[4] A. Alhazred, ''The Necronomicon'' (Petrus de Dacia, 1994).
:[5] Ibid. 1, 34.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Reference 2 is the same as reference 1: E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' on page 23, whereas reference 3 refers to the same work but at a different location, namely page 29. Intervening entries require a reference to the original citation in the form Ibid. &lt;citation #&gt;, as in reference 5.

==Cultural references==

* Ibid. is used in the 1960s play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' by [[Edward Albee]]. Albee uses an unabbreviated ibid{{huh|date=April 2017}} in his stage directions to tell an actor to use the same tone as the previous line.
* In the 1989 book ''Pyramids'' by [[Terry Pratchett]], one of the Ephebian philosophers is called "Ibid".
* In the 1997 movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', the main character, Will Hunting, when arguing for himself in court against the dismissive rebuttals of the prosecuting attorney, cites obscure case law, then follows up by stating "Ibid, your Honour."

'''James Lord Bowes''' (21 June 1834 – 27 October 1899) was a wealthy Liverpool (UK) wool broker, art collector and patron of the arts, author and authority on Japan and its art, and benefactor. In 1888 he was appointed the first foreign-born Japanese Consul in Great Britain, a post he held until his sudden death in 1899 at the age of 65. In 1890, in the grounds of Streatlam Tower,&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia page: Grade II listed buildings in Liverpool-L8&lt;/ref&gt; his home in the Toxteth area of Liverpool, he opened to the public the first dedicated museum of Japanese art in the western world.&lt;ref&gt;Liverpool Mercury, 20 June 1890. Also The Japanese Consul,p95&lt;/ref&gt;
James Lord Bowes was born in Horsforth, Leeds, UK, the youngest of six surviving children of John Bowes (Wool Stapler) and Elizabeth Bowes (née Lord). The family moved to Liverpool sometime between 1840-1845 after the death of John Bowes.  [[File:Portrait of James Lord Bowes circa 1875.png|thumb|alt=Portrait of James Lord Bowes.|James Lord Bowes circa 1875.]]

== History ==
As a young man, Bowes attended the Liverpool Collegiate Institution, a short distance from his home in the Islington area of Liverpool. Upon leaving college, he worked for nearly seven years in a merchant's office gaining useful experience in general merchandising, including the city's well-established cotton trade.&lt;ref&gt;The Japanese Consul,p10.(Family Archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was 22, he joined his brother John who had just set up on his own account as a wool broker. The business prospered and in January 1859 he was made a full partner in the firm of John L. Bowes &amp; Brother, Wool Brokers. In that same year, the business moved to the newly erected Queens Insurance Building in 11 Dale Street and the Bowes family moved house to the more up-market Canning Street. James also travelled to America that year in search of new business opportunities, the first of many overseas trips he was to make in the decades that followed.&lt;ref&gt;The Japanese Consul, p18. (Family archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 James Lord Bowes moved to Streatlam Cottage, set in its own grounds adjacent to [[Strawberry Field]] in Beaconsfield Road, in semi-rural Woolton, some six miles south of Liverpool city centre.&lt;ref&gt;Gore's Directory of Liverpool, 1867, Also The Japanese Consul,p23&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1871 he married Charlotte Vickery Adam, daughter of Mary Adam (née De Bels)(1809-1898) and William Adam (1804-1867) formerly of Lisbon, Portugal. The Adam family were established importers of oranges and soft fruit based in London and Liverpool, William being the manager of their estates in Portugal. Charlotte's brother John Isabel Adam (1857-1919) was also a Wool Broker and worked for John L. Bowes and Brother. James and Charlotte had six children, the last-surviving of whom, Ruth, died in 1967, aged 94 years.

James Lord Bowes immersed himself in the commercial and artistic life of Liverpool – he was several times both Vice President of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce and President of the Liverpool Art Club. In 1872 he commissioned the building of the imposing Streatlam Tower, 5 Princes Road, Liverpool by architect [[George Ashdown Audsley]], with whom he shared a passion for Japanese art, particularly ceramics.  From circa 1867 he had collected Japanese art works of all kinds and organised an exhibition of them in the Liverpool Art Club. Arising from this event he co-authored the Descriptive Catalogue of Japanese Lacquer ware of the Bowes Collection. 1875, and The Keramic Art of Japan. London: Sotheran &amp; Co. 1875, 1881, both with Audsley. Sending a copy of The Keramic Art of Japan to the [[Emperor Meiji]] in 1891 resulted in a reply from the Minister of the Imperial Household, [[Tokudaiji Sanetsune]] / (Sanenori) that the Emperor had sent him, in return, an Imperial gift of two bronze vases.

In 1888 Bowes was appointed the Honorary Japanese Consul at Liverpool, the first such appointment in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Liverpool Mercury, 8 December 1888 Also The Japanese Consul,p82&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he erected a private museum in the grounds of Streatlam Tower which he opened to the public. All the proceeds from this were directed to the benefit of his chosen charities within Liverpool. In April 1891 he hosted a Japanese Fancy Fair in the museum,&lt;ref&gt;Liverpool Reference Library 708/BOW/1&lt;/ref&gt; attracting 20,000 people in six days and raising £5,290 (£580,000 in 2012 values, ref: Safalra.com) for Liverpool charities.&lt;ref&gt;Liverpool Mercury, 22 May 1891&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1891 he was awarded the Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure, fourth class and in February 1897 he received the third class rank of the same award.

=== Death ===
Bowes died of a heart attack on a train en route from London to Liverpool on 27 October 1899 and is buried in [[Toxteth Park Cemetery]] (Smithdown Road) Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;The Liverpool Courier,28 October 1899, also Liverpool Mercury,31 October 1899&lt;/ref&gt; The Bowes Museum of Japanese Art closed following his death. Attempts to find a new home for his extensive collection failed and the contents of the museum were sold at an 11-day public auction in Liverpool in May 1901. Charlotte died in 1923 in Liverpool at the age of 79.

'''Kolam''' is a form of drawing that is drawn by using [[rice]] flour, chalk, chalk powder or rock powder, often using naturally or synthetically colored powders, in Sri Lanka, the [[India]]n states of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]], [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Kerala]] and some parts of [[Goa]], [[Maharashtra]] as well as [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and a few other Asian countries. A Kolam is a geometrical line drawing composed of curved loops, drawn around a grid pattern of dots. In [[South India]] and Sri Lanka, it is widely practised by female [[Hindu]] family members in front of their houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Kolam.htm|title=KOLAM|author=Dr.Gift Siromoney|date= |work= |publisher=Chennai Mathematical Institute|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolams are regionally known by different names in India, ''Raangolee'' in Maharashtra, '' Aripan '' in [[Mithila (India)|Mithila]], ''Hase'' and ''Raongoli'' in Kannada in Karnataka, ''Muggulu'' in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auroville.org/environment/villages/vill_kolam.htm|title=Kolams|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Auroville|accessdate=12 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230060541/http://www.auroville.org/environment/villages/vill_kolam.htm|archivedate=30 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More complex Kolams are drawn and colors are often added during holiday occasions and special events.

==History==
[[File:White stones.JPG|thumb|200px|White stones used to make one type of Kolam flour]]
Kolams are thought to bring prosperity to homes. Every morning in [[Tamil Nadu]], millions of women draw kolams on the ground with white rice flour. Through the day, the drawings get walked on, washed out in the rain, or blown around in the wind; new ones are made the next day. Every morning before sunrise, the floor of the house, or where ever the Kolam may be drawn, is cleaned with water and the muddy floor swept well to create an even surface. The kolams are generally drawn while the surface is still damp so the design will hold better. Even powdered white stone (வெங்கசங்கள் பொடி / மொக்குமாவு) can be used for creating Kolam. Occasionally, [[cow dung]] is also used to wax the floors. In some cultures, cow dung is believed to have antiseptic properties and hence provides a literal threshold of protection for the home. It also provides contrast with the white powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indian-heritage.org/alangaram/kolams/kolams.htm |title=Traditional customs and practices - Kolams|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Indian Heritage|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decoration is not the main purpose of a Kolam. In olden days, kolams were drawn in coarse rice flour, so the [[ants]] would not have to walk too far or too long for a meal. The rice powder also invites birds and other small creatures to eat it, thus welcoming other beings into one's home and everyday life: a daily tribute to harmonious co-existence. It is a sign of invitation to welcome all into the home, not the least of whom is [[Lakshmi]], the Goddess of prosperity and wealth. The patterns range between geometric and mathematical line drawings around a matrix of dots to free form art work and closed shapes. [[Folklore]] has evolved to mandate that the lines must be completed so as to symbolically prevent evil spirits from entering the inside of the shapes, and thus are they prevented from entering the inside of the home.

[[Image:Kolam Indigo Dyed Cloth.jpg|thumb|200px|3x3 symmetry 9 goddesses swastika Kolam with a single cycle by Nagata S, each of which corresponds to one of the nine Devi (Goddesses) of the Vedic system]]
It used to be a matter of pride to be able to draw large complicated patterns without lifting the hand off the floor or standing up in between. The month of ''Margazhi'' was eagerly awaited by young women, who would then showcase their skills by covering the entire width of the road with one big kolam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Kolam’ draws huge crowd|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/01/07/stories/2010010750830200.htm|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=7 January 2010|location=Trichy, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the kolam patterns, many designs are derived from magical motifs and abstract designs blended with philosophic and religious motifs which have been mingled together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Kolam/kola_pattern.htm|title=Kolam-South Indian kolam patterns |author=Dr.Gift Siromoney|date= |work= |publisher=Chennai Mathematical Institute|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motifs may include fish, birds, and other animal images to symbolise the unity of man and beast. The sun, moon and other zodiac symbols were also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pongal festival - Kolam design ideas|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/pongal-festival-kolam-design-ideas/1/168475.html|accessdate=|newspaper=India Today|date=12 January 2012|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Downward pointing triangle represented woman; an upward pointing triangle represented man. A circle represented nature while a square represented culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://devdutt.com/articles/indian-mythology/between-the-rangoli-lines.html|title=Between the Rangoli lines|last=|first=|date=29 Nov 2009|website=Devdutt Pattanaik|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lotus represented the womb. A pentagram represented Venus and the five elements.

The ritual kolam patterns created for special occasions such as weddings often stretch all the way down the street. Many of these created patterns have been passed on from generation to generation, from mothers to daughters.

Seasonal messages like welcome (நல்வரவு) can also be used in Kolam. Volunteering to draw the kolam at the temple is sometimes done when a devotee's wishes are fulfilled. The art of Kolam designs has found its way into the future through social networking sites like Facebook. Many Kolam artists have big fan followings online and are playing a role in making the Kolam art form a key part of South India's contemporary art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://devdutt.com/articles/indian-mythology/between-the-rangoli-lines.html|title=Between the Rangoli lines|last=|first=|date=29 Nov 2009|website=Devdutt Pattanaik|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
For special occasions [[limestone]] and red [[brick]] powder to contrast are also used. Though kolams &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamadia|first1=Roweena|title=Rangoli Kolam- Designs and Samples of Rangoli Kolam|url=http://www.rangolidesigns.net/2014/07/rangoli-kolam-designs.html|website=Rangoli Design|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are usually done with dry rice flour, for longevity, dilute rice paste or even paints are also used. Modern interpretations have accommodated chalk, and more recently [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] stickers.

Though not as flamboyant as its other Indian contemporary, [[Rangoli]], which is extremely colourful, a South Indian Kolam is all about symmetry, precision, and complexity.&lt;ref name="American"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/the-kolam-tradition|title=The Kolam tradition|author=Marcia Ascher|date=January 2002|work= |publisher=American Scientist|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to their complexity, trying to figure out how, exactly, these designs were drawn can be a challenge that some viewers find enjoyable.

==Patterns==
* a pattern in which a stroke (Neli, Kambi, Sikku in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]) runs once around each dot (Pulli), and goes to the beginning point (endless/cycle), as a mostly geometrical figure. The stroke called as Neli from a snaky line. The stroke has Knot (Sikku) structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/2201/22010031.pdf|title=Fundamental Study on Design System of Kolam Pattern|author=K.Yanagisawa, S.Nagata|year=2007|work=Forma Journal|publisher=SciPress|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a pattern using only part of the dot grid. If that is the case, the same pattern or a different pattern fills/uses up the remaining dot grids. Most of the times, these patterns together end up becoming a complex pattern.
* a pattern in which a stroke runs around each dot not completely, but open.
* a pattern in which strokes (Kodu/Kotto) are connected between the dots. Sometimes it represents kinds of objects, flowers, or animals etc.
* a pattern in which dots are set in a radial arrangement, called Lotus.
* a pattern which is drawn in a freestyle and mostly colourized.

==Research==
* The mathematical properties of Kolam are being used in the computer science field.&lt;ref name="American"/&gt; Kolam patterns are studied and algorithms are developed for regenerating kolam designs with different patterns has been done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/2201/22010055.pdf|title=Extended Pasting Scheme for Kolam Pattern Generation|author=T.Robinson|year=2007|work=Forma Journal|publisher=SciPress|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Kolams are used for research in the Computational [[Anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cugr.umaine.edu/db/job/200/the-kolam-project-computational-anthropology-at-tim-waring/|title=The Kolam project|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Center for Undergraduate Research, University of Maine|accessdate=25 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307043023/http://cugr.umaine.edu/db/job/200/the-kolam-project-computational-anthropology-at-tim-waring/|archivedate=7 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* As Kolams have a strong relationship with contemporary art and art history, they are used in the artwork and media field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northampton.edu/Northampton-NOW/The-Mystery-of-Kolam.htm|title=The Mystery of Kolam|author=Adam Atkinson|date=September 2011|work=|publisher=Northampton Community College|accessdate=25 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013012043/http://www.northampton.edu/Northampton-NOW/The-Mystery-of-Kolam.htm|archivedate=13 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kolams are also used to simplify the representation of complex protein structures for easy understanding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/leonardo/v046/46.1.balaji.html Protein Kolam]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">'''Laufás-Edda''' (''Edda Magnúsar Ólafssonar'') is a famous 17th century redaction of the [[Snorra Edda]], which survives in numerous [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] [[manuscript]]s. 

Laufás Edda  was compiled by the Icelandic priest and poet [[Magnús Ólafsson]] (c.1573–1636) on the request of the Icelandic scholar and antiquarian [[Arngrímur Jónsson]]. Magnús began his work at [[Auðkúla]] in 1607 after he had been dismissed from his office as parish minister, and completed his new redaction during the winter of 1608-09. Magnús would later serve as the priest at Laufás parish in Northern Iceland and as a consequence his version of the Edda was falsely referred to as the Laufás Edda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/dbl/12/0391.html ''Magnús Ólafsson'' (Dansk biografisk Lexikon / XII. Bind)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of his efforts was to make a systematic and encyclopedic version of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s [[Prose Edda]]. Laufás Edda is a rearranged redaction of the Snorra Edda. The myths in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' are presented as a series of examples (apologi or dæmisögur) and the [[kenning]]s of ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' are organized alphabetically. The last part, ''[[Háttatal]]'', was not included.

Due to its popularity, the Laufás redaction later became the basis for the first printed Edition of the Snorra Edda, [[Peder Hansen Resen]]'s [[Edda Islandorum]]. Resen's edition was accompanied by a [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Latin]] translation. The Laufás Edda, especially through Resen's edition, became a convenient and popular work of reference for poets and antiquarians, serving as an encyclopedia for researching both myth and poetic language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Clunies Ross]] and Lars Lönnroth, ''The Norse Muse: Report from an International Research Project''  (''Alvíssmál 9. 1999) [http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~alvismal/9muse.pdf 3–28] (pdf), here pp.&amp;nbsp;8–11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mains d’Œuvres''' (Manpower) is a [[not-for-profit arts organization]] based in [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]], a suburb of [[Paris]]. The organization supports contemporary art by coordinating residencies for emerging artists and by programming exhibitions and events.

==History==
Mains d’Œuvres is situated in a refurbished [[Valeo]] car factory, which was used as an employee community and sports center until the company sold the building in 1991. In 1991, four organizations: Usines Ephemeres, TransEuropeHalles network, Vecam and Europe 99, combined to create Mains d'Œuvres. A pioneer of its time, Mains d'Œuvres spearheaded the widespread phenomenon in Europe during the 1990s, which consisted of turning factories into placed dedicated to new, inventive art forms.

A 4000 square metre Mains d’Œuvres arts centre opened in Saint-Ouen in 2001.&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;{{cite news|author=Alice Pfeiffer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/arts/16iht-rartbanlieue.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=Beyond the Paris Limits, a Cutting Edge |work=The New York Times |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Attributing its outlook to [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s [[Difference and Repetition]], Mains d’Œuvres describes itself as, "Sensual and intellectual, specialist and non-specialist...an experimental art space open to everyone." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainsdoeuvres.org/article830.html |title=Visual Arts - Mains d’Œuvres |publisher=Mainsdoeuvres.org |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offering visual and digital arts, music, dance, theater, cinema, lectures and educational events to the public, the organization is supported by the Conseil général de la Seine-Saint-Denis, Ministère de la Culture (France), and the [[Ministère de la Jeunesse et des Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainsdoeuvres.org/rubrique66.html |title=le lieu - Mains d’Œuvres |publisher=Mainsdoeuvres.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Mains d’Œuvres is most recognized for its offerings in the field of music. Concerts, parties, and residency programs establish the organization on an international field. Residencies are open to a wide range of styles such as electronic, rap, and world music. Due to the approach of creating ties between all styles, Mains d’Œuvres offers a venue open to all musical experimentation. Notable musicians who have worked with, or at Main d'Œuvres include: [[Herman Dune]], Etienne Jaumet, [[:fr:Cheveu (groupe)|Cheveu]] and [[:fr:Frustration (groupe)|Frustration]].

==Digital art==
The Craslab is offered by Mains d’Œuvres for members of the public interested in learning and testing real-time interaction technologies. CrasLab tutors offer educative classes focusing on [[open-source hardware]] and [[free software]] to the likes of Freeduino and [[Pure data]]. Consecutively in 2006, 2007, and 2008, Mains d'Œuvres hosted The Mal Au Pixel festival of electronic art and subcultures, presenting original experiences based on interactive and participative works, hybrid performances, concerts and other unexpected encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pixelache.ac/2007/2006-2/pixelache-paris/ |title=Pixelache 2005-2007 » NEWS |publisher=Pixelache.ac |date=2006-04-29 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance==
Mains d’Œuvres offers dance residency programs that are open to projects which are singular in their research as well as in their attempt to (re)question or rethink society and the art of choreography. Two types of choreographic residency-programs exist at Mains d’Œuvres: long term (3 years) and project based (approx. 1 year). Currently, there are four long-term residency and six project-based companies. Yearly, six to eight dance pieces are presented publicly. The dance residency program at Mains d’Œuvres aims to render companies financially &amp; professionally autonomous and publicly acclaimed. Notable past residents include: Cindy Van Acker, Perrine Vally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perrinevalli.fr/html_en/projets_femmeforet.htm |title=Perrine Valli |publisher=Perrinevalli.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and François Laroche Valière.

==Theatre==
Mains d’Œuvres offers a residency program for theatre companies to develop off-mainstream research, different from the classical stage sets. Artists are guided through the whole creation progress. Principally a space for thinking and experimenting theatre, the venue also publicly presents the supported projects in order to bring the artist public and professional recognition. Yearly, up to five companies take part in a two or one-year residency program, and up to six pieces are presented publicly.

==Visual art==
Mains d'Oeuvres has held several exhibitions showcasing artists such as [[Wim Delvoye]], [[Thomas Hirschhorn]], [[Sophie Calle]], [[Jon Bernad]], [[Neil Beloufa]], Pauline Bastard, Ivan Argote, [[Dominique Blais]], Etienne Jaumet, [[Herman Dune]], and Marie Hendriks. Isabelle Le Normand was curator there between 2008 and 2013. Anne Stouvenel took over as curator in 2013.

The '''Mont des Arts''' ([[French language|French]], {{IPA-fr|mɔ̃dɛzaʁ|pron}}) or '''Kunstberg''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]], {{IPA-nl|ˈkɵnzdbɛrx|pron|Nl-Kunstberg.ogg}}), meaning "hill/mount of the arts", is an urban complex and historic site in the centre of [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], including the [[Royal Library of Belgium]], the [[National Archives of Belgium]], the [[Square – Brussels Meeting Centre]], and a public garden.

This site is located between rue Montagne de la Cour/Hofbergstraat and the [[Coudenberg|Coundenberg]] in its 'upper' part, and Boulevard de l'Empereur/Keizerslaan and Place de l'Albertine/Albertinaplein in its 'lower' part. It is served by the [[Brussels Central Station]].

== History ==
The area of the Mont des Arts used to be a densely populated neighbourhood, the ''Quartier Saint Roches/Sint-Rochuswijk''. Between the 15th and the 18th century, the hill on which it was located was known as the ''Montagne de la Cour/Hofberg''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.montdesarts.com/en/History|title=Kunstberg - History|website=www.montdesarts.com|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] had the idea to convert the site into an arts' quarter and bought the whole neighbourhood. Various architects and urban planners were called upon to draw plans of the buildings which were to accommodate all kinds of cultural institutions. After the demolition of the old buildings, the site turned into an ugly urban void because the project lacked sufficient finance. To increase the area's appeal during the [[Brussels International 1910|Brussels International Exposition of 1910]], the king ordered the French landscape architect Pierre Vacherot to design a 'temporary' garden on the hill. It featured a park and a monumental staircase with cascading fountains descending the gentle slope from [[Place Royale (Brussels)|Place Royale]] down to Boulevard de l'Empereur/Keizerslaan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1910, a year after the death of Leopold II, the new park was inaugurated by [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert I]].
[[File:Albertine - 01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Royal Library of Belgium]]]]
[[File:Belgique - Bruxelles - Palais des Congrès - 01.jpg|thumb|[[Square – Brussels Meeting Centre|Congress Palace of Brussels]]]]
Although the garden was conceived as temporary, it became a well-appreciated green area in the heart of the capital, but when the plans for the Mont des Arts came back by the end of the 1930s, this park had to be demolished to create a new square as the centre of the urban renewal project. The project was entrusted jointly to architects Maurice Houyoux and Jules Ghobert. Between 1956 and 1958, the park and its surroundings gave way to massive, severe geometric structures such as the [[Royal Library of Belgium|Royal Royal Library of Belgium]] and the Congress Palace. The new geometric garden on the square was designed by landscape architect René Péchère.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The inauguration took place in 1969.

== Present day ==
The Mont des Arts offers one of Brussels' finest views. From the elevated vantage point, the famous tower of the [[Brussels Town Hall]] in the [[Grand Place]] is clearly visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://visit.brussels/en/place/Mont-des-Arts-Gardens|title=Mont des Arts Gardens|website=visit.brussels|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a sunny day, the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Belgium|Koekelberg Basilica]] and even the [[Atomium]] can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/the-history-of-the-mont-des-arts-in-1-minute/|title=The History Of The Mont des Arts In 1 Minute|last=Poel|first=Nana Van De|work=Culture Trip|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OntheWaytoSchool-Long.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Illustration from [[William J. Long]]'s ''School of the Woods'' (1902), showing an otter teaching her young to swim]]
The '''nature fakers controversy''' was an early 20th-century American literary debate highlighting the conflict between [[science]] and sentiment in popular [[nature writing]]. The debate involved important [[United States|American]] literary, environmental and political figures. Dubbed the "War of the Naturalists" by ''[[The New York Times]]'', it revealed seemingly irreconcilable contemporary views of the natural world: while some nature writers of the day argued as to the veracity of their examples of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] wild animals, others questioned an animal's ability to adapt, learn, teach, and reason.

The controversy arose from a new literary movement, which followed a growth of interest in the natural world beginning in the late 19th century, and in which the natural world was depicted in a compassionate rather than realistic light. Works such as [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]'s ''[[Wild Animals I Have Known]]'' (1898) and [[William J. Long]]'s ''School of the Woods'' (1902) popularized this new genre and emphasized sympathetic and individualistic animal characters. In March 1903, naturalist and writer [[John Burroughs]] published an article entitled "Real and Sham Natural History" in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. Lambasting writers such as Seton, Long, and [[Charles G. D. Roberts]] for their seemingly fantastical representations of wildlife, he also denounced the booming genre of realistic animal fiction as "[[yellow journalism]] of the woods".&lt;ref name="carson71"/&gt; Burroughs' targets responded in defense of their work in various publications, as did their supporters, and the resulting controversy raged in the public press for nearly six years.

The constant publicity given to the debate contributed to a growing distrust of the truthfulness of popular nature writing of the day, and often pitted scientist against writer. The controversy effectively ended when President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] publicly sided with Burroughs, publishing his article "Nature Fakers" in the September 1907 issue of ''[[Everybody's Magazine]]''. Roosevelt popularized the negative colloquialism by which the controversy would later be known to describe one who purposefully fabricates details about the natural world. The definition of the term later expanded to include those who depicted nature with excessive sentimentality.

==Background==
===Nature boom===
A renewed public interest in nature and its promise of aesthetic and recreational enjoyment began in the United States during the late 19th century. The country's first national park, [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], was established in 1872, and by 1900 it had been followed by half a dozen more. Railroads made it easy to get to the parks, and their advertising promoted the wonders of nature that could be seen courtesy of their trains.  Tourists frequented the parks regularly, but there were also numerous opportunities for people to enjoy nature and outdoor recreation closer to home. City parks, such as [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]], became popular destinations because of their accessibility, and camps like the ones owned by the [[YMCA]] were frequented by boys and girls of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilderness]] protection and the [[conservation movement]], led by figures such as [[John Muir]], founder of the [[Sierra Club]], also began to appear at this time. By the turn of the century, those in favor of recreational ideals of nature began to clash with conservationists such as Muir.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, critics and natural scientists became skeptical of what they saw as a growing [[cult]] of nature, which was thought to wrongly champion sentimentality and aesthetics rather than scientific facts.&lt;ref name="Maz113"/&gt; Sympathy for animals and their survival also became a developing thought in the 19th century, due in part to wide acceptance of theories pertaining to organic [[evolution]]. In 1837, [[Charles Darwin]] wrote in his diary that "If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we may be all melted together."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
As the popularity and marketability of the natural world rose during the late 19th century, books dedicated to nature came to be in great demand. One reviewer noted in 1901 that "It is a part of the progress of the day that the [[Nature study]] is coming into prominence in our schemes of education, and, beyond these, is entering into our plans for coveted diversion, yet it is a real surprise that so large and increasing a number of each season's publications are devoted to the purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[literature]] was regularly published in a wide variety of subjects: children's animal books, wilderness novels, nature guides, and travelogues were all immensely popular.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The study of nature quickly became part of the public school curriculum, making nature writing increasingly profitable.&lt;ref name="Maz113"&gt;Mazel, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; As the public's hunger for such imaginative works grew, a new genre in which nature was depicted in a compassionate, rather than realistic, light began to take form.

[[File:Lobo (The King of Currumpaw).jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration of the wolf Lobo and his mate Blanca, by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]]]
The tendency to portray animals as having human traits was not new; [[Aesop]]'s moralistic animal tales were still popular with readers of the day, and inspired such works as [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894). However, one of the features separating the turn-of-the-century animal writers from those before them was the desire to have their animals set an example through their noble, sympathetic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Mighetto, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Sewell]]'s ''[[Black Beauty]]'', for example, told the story of a gentle horse seemingly from the animal's own point of view; after being published in the United States by the American Humane Education Society in 1890, Sewell's book helped further the cause against [[animal cruelty]].&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The budding [[animal welfare]] movement helped establish a climate for wider public support of wildlife conservation, and soon nature writers similarly sought to gain sympathy for wild animals—specifically those who seemingly displayed honorable human traits—by depicting them in a positive light.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; One popular nature writer of the day, [[Mabel Osgood Wright]], told of wolves nobly taking their own lives after losing their mates.&lt;ref&gt;Mighetto, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and illustrator [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] published his first book, the bestselling ''[[Wild Animals I Have Known]]'', in 1898. The first entry in a new genre of realistic wild-animal stories, Seton's collection of short stories quickly became one of the most popular books of its day.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1998), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had considered himself "a naturalist of the usual type, trying merely to accumulate specimens and facts" during his early career, he later began to write factual material "in the form of romantic stories—fiction in the form of presentation, but solid in fact in their basis and their message."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The first story in the collection, "[[Lobo the King of Currumpaw|Lobo, The King of Currumpaw]]" was based upon Seton's experience hunting wolves in the Southwest. It became a classic, setting the tone for his future works that would similarly depict animals—especially predators who were often demonized in literature—as compassionate, individualistic beings.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Seton was reportedly denounced by readers for having killed Lobo, only to write about the experience; however, as biographer Brian Morris stated, the readers' sympathies "are directed, as Seton meant them to be, toward the wild animal, rather than against the teller of the tale".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Seton's intention in writing his stories was to "freely translate" the animals' language into English, as they "have no speech as we understand it".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; The stories were typically prefaced by the author's strong assertion of their accuracy, and ''Wild Animals I Have Known'' marked the nature writer's first emphasis on the perspective of a wild animal. As Canadian poet and author [[Charles G.D. Roberts]] described it, the genre focused on "the personality, individuality, mentality, of an animal, as well as its purely physical characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1998), p. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of controversy (1903)==
==="Real and Sham Natural History"===
Naturalist and writer [[John Burroughs]] (1837–1921) was respected for his numerous nature essays. Known as an outspoken advocate for the conservation movement in the United States, he was later described by his biographer [[Edward J. Renehan, Jr.|Edward Renehan]] as "a literary naturalist with a duty to record his own unique perceptions of the natural world".&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs believed that the nature writer must remain faithful to nature as well as the personal responses to what they witness; he wrote in the introduction to his 1895 book ''Wake-Robin'' that the "literary naturalist does not take liberties with facts; facts are the flora upon which he lives. The more and the fresher the facts the better."&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' published a glowing review of the Reverend [[William J. Long]]'s 1902 work ''School of the Woods: Some Life Studies of Animal Instinct and Animal Training'', Burroughs became incensed. Long had previously published six books, and while Burroughs was not pleased with the clergyman's previous efforts, he believed this particular work was an unacceptable example of nature writing.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Long insisted not only that animals demonstrated unique and individualistic behavior, unpredictable to science, but he also wrote that there was "absolutely no limit to the variety and adaptiveness of Nature, even in a single species."&lt;ref name="kheel95"&gt;Kheel, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs was not the first to take issue with the growing genre that blurred the line between fact and fiction, or the liberties it often took with the natural world; [[Ernest Ingersoll]] also found fault with ''School of the Woods'', stating it "would be an epoch-making book in both zoology and psychology could its statements be established."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that authors such as Long were deliberately misleading the public for financial gain, Burroughs decided to prove that their fantastical depictions of wild animals were not only impossible, but ultimately damaging to the general public's understanding of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kheel, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Burroughs 1909.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Burroughs]] in 1909]]
In March 1903, Burroughs submitted a scathing essay to ''The Atlantic Monthly'' entitled "Real and Sham Natural History"; the editor, Bliss Perry, reportedly found the piece so "ill-natured" and "peevish" that he sent it back to Burroughs for revisions.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs began his article with praise for authors such as Ingersoll, [[Frank M. Chapman]] and [[Florence Merriam Bailey]], all of whom he believed exemplified good nature writing. Championing his own strict adherence to observed fact, Burroughs singled out four books for criticism: Seton's ''Wild Animals I have Known'', Roberts' ''The Kindred of the Wild'', [[William Davenport Hulbert]]'s ''Forest Neighbours'', and Long's ''School of the Woods''.&lt;ref&gt;Maclulich, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he blamed Seton's collection of stories for founding the sentimental animal story genre; he even amended the title of the collection to ''Wild Animals I'' Alone ''Have Known''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Further denouncing Seton's claims that his stories featured events and behaviors he had personally witnessed, Burroughs wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Thompson Seton says in capital letters that his stories are true, and it is this emphatic assertion that makes the judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, they certainly are but true as natural history they as certainly are not&amp;nbsp;... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that I am aware of, that match his.&lt;ref&gt;Mazel, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chief among Burroughs' complaints was Long's questioning of the role of [[instinct]] in [[animal learning]], something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in "Real and Sham Natural History": "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!"&lt;ref&gt;Mazel, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his "book reads like that of a man who has really never been to the woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in ''[[Forest and Stream]]'', or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".&lt;ref&gt;Perez, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the publication of Burroughs' article, ''The Atlantic Monthly'' began receiving responses from readers. Among the many letters written in support for Burroughs' assertions was an article published in the ''Boston Evening Transcript'' in defense of Long's reputation as both a writer and a respected man of the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; Written by fellow clergyman Charles Prescott Daniels, the article, which was titled "Discord in the Forest: John Burroughs vs. William J. Long", suggested that Burroughs left "the reader with a kinder feeling for Mr. Long than for Mr. Burroughs, and [left] him, too, with a suspicion that, after all, the beasts and birds will forgive Mr. Long for having so amiably misrepresented them."&lt;ref name="maz121"&gt;Mazel, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long's response===
Many of the authors Burroughs criticized in his essays chose not to issue direct rebuttals. As [[Jack London]] would later write, they chose to simply "climb a tree and let the cataclysm go by".&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; Seton, who had previously met Burroughs and had a great deal of respect for the elder naturalist, was confident enough in his own reputation so as not to stage a public reply. Other authors wrote to both him and Burroughs in Seton's defense, however; author and editor [[Hamlin Garland]] both wrote to Burroughs and spoke to him personally in this regard, saying that Seton's "stories are based on careful observation."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks after Burroughs' article appeared in ''The Atlantic Monthly'', he and Seton met at a literary dinner given by [[Andrew Carnegie]]; while accounts of the meeting vary, the two men seemed to make amends.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

William J. Long, on the other hand, readily became a publicly vocal enemy of the naturalist after receiving much of Burroughs' initial criticism. A [[Congregationalist]] minister from Massachusetts, Long was an amateur naturalist and avid camper who spent summers hiking in Canada. Shortly after Burroughs published his initial essay, Long was reported to have previously resigned from his parish so as to devote himself to writing and lecturing on nature full-time.&lt;ref name="maz121"/&gt; Rather than be discouraged by Burroughs' criticism—which included the other man calling Long "the worst of these nature-writing offenders"&lt;ref name="carson71"&gt;Carson (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;—within weeks of the publication of "Real and Sham Natural History", Long submitted a stern reply to the ''Boston Evening Transcript''. Two months later, he published a longer article titled "The Modern School of Nature-Study and its Critics" in the ''North American Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WilliamJLong-Orioles.png|left|thumb|Illustration of orioles who have devised a way of gathering thread from a piece of cloth, from Long's ''Way of the Wood Folk'']]
In the latter essay, Long insisted that there was a difference between the study of nature and the study of science; whereas science concerned itself with laws and generalizations, the study of nature was far more complex as it allowed for the recognition of individual life forms.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "The difference between Nature and Science is the difference between a man who loves animals, and so understands them, and the man who studies Zoology; it is the difference between the woman who cherishes her old-fashioned flower-garden and the professor who lectures on Botany in a college class-room."&lt;ref&gt;Mazel, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Long's intention was to divide the old school naturalists (which included Burroughs among its members) from what he saw as the newly formed school, of which he was part, whose members were capable of seeing animals as individuals. Because he wrote personal nature essays, and not scientific reports, Long believed that his readers required from him "not simply eyes and ears and a note-book; but insight, imagination, and, above all, an intense human sympathy, by which alone the inner life of an animal becomes luminous, and without which the living creatures are little better than stuffed specimens".&lt;ref&gt;Maclulich, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

While his explanation was found to be credible by some readers, Long's critics faulted an example he gave of two [[New World oriole|orioles]] he had seen building a nest outside his window.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Intended to prove his thesis about the unpredictable and adaptive nature of wild animals, he wrote of how the pair "plainly deliberated" their elaborate swinging nest that had been made out of three sticks fastened together; when finished, the birds then "tied a single knot at the extreme end" of a dangling string so it would not unravel over time.&lt;ref name="stew92"&gt;Stewart, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs and his allies were again incensed at Long's insistence that what he wrote was based entirely upon fact, and quickly responded with criticism; Burroughs' written reply reportedly proved to be almost too harsh for publication. ''The Atlantic Monthly'' did not wish to escalate the debate, so it was ultimately published by ''[[Century Magazine]]''. Evoking Long's story of the orioles, Burroughs wrote, "After such an example as this, how long will it be before the water-birds will be building little rush cradles for their young or rush boats driven about the ponds and lakes by means of leafy sails, or before Jenny Wren will be living in a log cabin of her own construction?"&lt;ref name="stew92"/&gt;

==Escalation (1903–1904)==
===Animal surgery===
Threatened financially by Burroughs' condemnation, Long's publishers came to their client's defense by distributing a pamphlet defending his positions. In late 1903, Long published a new book titled ''A Little Brother to the Bear''. In the preface, he wrote: "Except where it is plainly stated otherwise, all the incidents and observations have passed under my own eyes and have been confirmed later by other observers&amp;nbsp;... I have simply tried to make all these animals as interesting to the reader as they were to me when I discovered them."&lt;ref name="lut73"/&gt; While ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewed it favorably, pointing out its "close observation and loving attention to the details of wood life", Long's critics were quick to note a number of propositions regarding wildlife. An essay in the book titled "Animal Surgery", in which Long wrote of various animals' ability to treat and mend their own injuries, particularly riled his critics.&lt;ref name="lut73"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He told of how animals such as muskrat, beaver and bear were capable of intentionally bandaging their wounds and stumps of amputated limbs by coating them with materials such as tree resin or clay to keep the injury clean.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The example that received the greatest attention was the story about a "[[American Woodcock|woodcock]] genius" who set his own broken leg and applied a cast to the injury:

[[File:Scolopax Woodcock Genius-Long.png|thumb|right|The "woodcock genius" sets his broken leg with a cast made of clay and straw; illustration by [[Charles Copeland (illustrator)|Charles Copeland]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;At first he took soft clay in his bill from the edge of the water and seemed to be smearing it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Long's theories about animal surgery garnered negative attention from the scientific community as well as the literary; biologist [[William Morton Wheeler]] wrote to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in February 1904 that Long's story was "a series of anecdotes which for rank and impossible humanization of the animal can hardly be surpassed."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists agreed about the dubiousness of Long's claims, and publicly rebuked him for not providing evidence as to his observations in a scientifically-accepted format. Long responded in turn, insisting that "If scientists and [[Comparative psychology|comparative-psychologists]] are honestly looking for new facts in the animal world, I have enough to fill several regular editions of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', every one of which is supported not only by my own personal observation, but by the testimony of other honest men whose word can be taken without hesitation."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; As to the woodcock story, Long provided several accounts from other men who had witnessed as much; an Ohio man, for example, reportedly found upon shooting a similar bird that it "had evidently broken its leg above the knee joint. There was a bandage around it, composed of a hard clay-like substance, interwoven with grass or a woody fiber of some kind. The bone seemed to have been set properly and had knit perfectly." None of Long's witnesses were able to provide specimens for study, however, and ''Science'' followed Long's essay with the note, "We Hope that this discussion will not be carried further."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal psychology===
Ruminating on his previous clashes with Long in regard to an animal's ability to learn behaviors, Burroughs began to focus the ire of his essay-writing on those who upheld the idea of animal psychology. In a series of articles published in ''Century Magazine'', he steadfastly argued that animals functioned on little more than instinct and a very limited ability to learn from experience.&lt;ref name="lut85"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that creatures, unlike humans, are "rational without reason, and wise without understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Although mainly repeating his earlier points, one of Burroughs' essays was accompanied by a cartoon parodying Long's ''School of the Woods''; dubbed "A Lesson in Wisdom", it showed Mother Nature sitting in a field surrounded by five foxes who look on as she reads from a book titled ''The Fox Who Lost His Tail in the Trap''.&lt;ref name="lut85"/&gt;

The belief that animals were intelligent enough to learn and reason, much like a human, was largely born from Darwin's assertion of the evolutionary link between humans and animals. Beginning in the late 19th century and into the early 20th century, the progression from the cause of animal welfare—due to the budding belief that animals could feel pain and suffering—to that of an animal's mental capacity was readily made in popular nature writing.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Long was not the first to write of the learned intelligence of animals. Seton often stressed in his stories the wit of the animals he witnessed, as well as the fact that most of them had been "taught" survival skills by either their mothers or their pack leaders. Other writers supported the idea of animal education: Ernest Ingersoll wrote of "morning lessons" in hunting for nuts, and respected bird watcher [[Olive Thorne Miller]] described several different teaching endeavors, such as a music lesson taught from one mother bird to her chicks. Miller would also suggest, although partly in jest, that even some of the flowers were intelligent.&lt;ref&gt;Mighetto, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy dies down (1904–1905)==
[[File:William j. long.jpg|thumb|Long as depicted by ''The Bookman'' in 1907]]
Largely silent until then, in 1904 both Seton and Roberts made small efforts to defend their brand of nature writing from its critics, mainly Burroughs. In the preface to his new book ''The Watchers of the Trails'', Roberts specifically responded to Burroughs' criticism by carefully pointing out that his stories were "avowedly fiction". However, he continued: "They are, at the same time, true, in that the material of which they are moulded consists of facts".&lt;ref&gt;Maclulich, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, ''Century Magazine'' published Seton's only public response to Burroughs' criticisms, especially those made in the previous year's ''Atlantic Monthly'' article in which the naturalist branded Seton the originator of the faulty genre. Seton's response was in the form of a lighthearted tale about a critic named Little Mucky—obviously meant to parody Burroughs himself—who climbs a hill called Big Periodic, only to throw mud at a newcomer who attracts attention away from him. The moral of the story, Seton wrote, was that "Notoriety is a poisonous substitute for fame."&lt;ref name="lut85"/&gt;

Despite the best efforts of the press, the debate began to die down in late 1904. In December that year, after suffering from ailing eyesight for several years, Long went temporarily blind at the age of 47.&lt;ref name="lut87"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this setback, he continued to write; in early 1905 he began publishing a series of essays in ''[[Harper's Monthly]]'' under the pseudonym Peter Rabbit; told from the point of view of the "author", the essays commented upon the human condition, animal intelligence, and the controversy first begun by Burroughs two years prior. The essays were published a year later in a collection titled ''Brier-Patch Philosophy''. This book included the dedication: "To those who have found Their Own World to be something of a Brier-Patch the Rabbit Dedicates his little book of Cheerful Philosophy."&lt;ref name="lut87"/&gt;

Burroughs continued to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, and a number of his essays dedicated to "sham nature history" were collected in the volume ''Ways of Nature'', published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that "My readers will find this volume quite a departure in certain ways from the tone and spirit of my previous books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every gleam of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, making too much of it, and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' than they really possessed."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mabel Osgood Wright]] weighed in on the debate in a 1905 essay titled "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader on an emotional level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Roberts had largely escaped criticism for his previous work, his novel ''Red Fox'' attracted attention from Burroughs and his allies after its publication in 1906. The work contains stories relating to a single animal, the eponymous Red Fox, who was described by the author as "fairly typical, both in his characteristics and in the experiences that befall him, in spite of the fact that he is stronger and cleverer than the average run of foxes."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs' critique of the book began by expressing his admiration for Roberts' "genius", but again stressed his belief that animals were governed by instinct, rather than instruction or intuition. He pointed to particular passages, such as when the fox escaped a group of hounds by running across the backs of sheep on a field, as disingenuous and misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roosevelt's involvement==
===Pre-1907===
[[File:Theodore Roosevelt by John Singer Sargent, 1903.jpg|thumb|right|[[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s official White House portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1903]]
President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was a well-publicized nature-enthusiast, known for his grand hunting expeditions. While he admired the natural world and the animals who inhabited it, he believed that animals served a singular purpose: to satisfy human needs, especially in the name of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt had been following the debate in newspaper articles and magazines with great interest, and as a result he became a friend and confidant of John Burroughs; shortly after Burroughs' first article condemning popular nature writers as sham naturalists, Roosevelt sent him a letter of support as well as an invitation to travel west in each other's company. In April 1903, Roosevelt and Burroughs explored [[Yellowstone National Park]] and its surrounding areas together.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1905, Roosevelt received a copy of Long's book ''Northern Trails'' from the publisher. Based upon the author's travels in Canada, most of the stories involved a noble, white wolf named Wayeeses. As in other works, Long asserted that "every incident in this wolf's life, from his grasshopper hunting to the cunning caribou chase, and from the den in the rocks to the meeting of wolf and children on the storm-swept barrens, is minutely true in fact, and is based squarely upon my own observations and that of my Indians."&lt;ref name="lut90"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; While Roosevelt reportedly enjoyed a majority of the book—he even read it aloud to his children—he found fault with Long's dramatic description of how a wolf killed caribou by piercing the animal's heart with its teeth. "A terrific rush," Long wrote in ''Northern Trails'', "a quick snap under the stag's chest just behind the fore legs, where the heart lay".&lt;ref name="lut90"/&gt; Drawing upon his own extensive hunting experience, Roosevelt wrote confidentially to the book's publisher about Long's description being "sheer nonsense", concluding that it "is so very unusual" and anatomically impossible that it could not be true.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter, of which he also sent a copy to Burroughs, Roosevelt pointed out the physical difficulty a wolf would have if attempting to kill its prey in such a manner, while also commenting upon the unlikeliness of other wolf stories written by Long.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Burroughs agreed with the President's assertions, and urged him to comment publicly on the subject, although the other man demurred. When Roosevelt published ''Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter'' in October 1905, however, he not only dedicated it to the elder naturalist, but he also made his first public foray in what would become known as the nature fakers controversy: "I wish to express my hearty appreciation of your warfare against the sham nature-writers—those whom you have called 'the yellow journalists of the woods'&amp;nbsp;... You in your own person have illustrated what can be done by the lover of nature who has trained himself to keen observation, who describes accurately what is thus observed, and who, finally, possesses the additional gift of writing with charm and interest."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Nature Fakers"===
After four years of privately denouncing the popular nature writers in letters and conversation, Roosevelt decided to weigh in publicly; while alerting Burroughs that he had finally broken his silence, he wrote: "I know that as President I ought not to do this".&lt;ref&gt;Lutts, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; He had given an interview to journalist Edward B. Clark, who quoted Roosevelt in the article "Roosevelt on the Nature [[Charlatan|Faker]]s" in the June 1907 issue of ''Everybody's Magazine''. Roosevelt not only spoke out against Long, but other authors like [[Jack London]] and Roberts, who wrote what he called "'unnatural' history".&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt popularized the term "nature faker" over Clark's original spelling, and defined it in his essay as "an object of derision to every scientist worthy of the name, to every real lover of the wilderness, to every faunal naturalist, to every true hunter or nature lover. But it is evident that [the nature faker] completely deceives many good people who are wholly ignorant of wild life. Sometimes he draws on his own imagination for his fictions; sometimes he gets them second-hand from irresponsible guides or trappers or Indians."&lt;ref&gt;Mazel, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; He voiced displeasure with and disbelief of London's descriptions of [[dog fighting]] in ''[[White Fang]]'', as well as Long's stories about Wayeeses the wolf taking down prey; Roosevelt was so specific as to debate the depicted outcome of the fights based on the size of the animals involved.&lt;ref name="Lutts"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Long's books in particular were deemed a "genuine crime", especially against the country's children. Fearing that a curriculum including sentimental nature stories would corrupt young children, Roosevelt wrote: "As for the matter of giving these books to children for the purpose of teaching them the facts of natural history—why, it's an outrage."&lt;ref name="kheel95"/&gt;

[[File:Clover-plover-r-w.wood-how-to-tell-the-birds-from-the-flowers.gif|thumb|left|The [[Clover]] and the [[Plover]], from [[Robert Williams Wood]]'s ''How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers'' (1907)]]
Not long after Roosevelt's views were made public, Long responded with vigor, and the resulting publicity started the controversy anew. He began by sending a private letter to the President, which he later released to the press, informing Roosevelt that he would soon regret his "foolish words&amp;nbsp;... With all my soul I regret this necessity and shrink from it, but you have brought it upon yourself."&lt;ref name="Lutts" /&gt; In an interview with ''The New York Times'', Long called Roosevelt "cowardly" and the article "venomous", but his main criticism stemmed from the President's status as a "gamekiller"; Roosevelt, Long claimed, "has no sympathy with any brand of nature study except his own."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; While a number of scientists wrote in support of Roosevelt and his position, Long produced several witnesses to prove his claims; to combat one of Roosevelt's specific complaints, Long provided a statement from "a full-blooded [[Sioux]] Indian" who declared that wolves in the area where Wayeeses was said to live were known to attack prey in the chest. Long also insisted that he himself had come upon the remains of a deer slain in a similar way.&lt;ref name="carson71"/&gt;

Long's most effective tactic against Roosevelt, however, was not to argue biological matters, but to attack the President's motives in becoming involved in such a debate. In reference to Roosevelt's published works describing his hunting expeditions, Long wrote: "I find after carefully reading two of his big books that every time he gets near the heart of a wild thing he invariably puts a bullet through it."&lt;ref name="carson71"/&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' published an article titled "President a Slayer Not Lover of Animals", while the same missive was called "Long Will Combat Roosevelt Until Latter is Whipped" in Philadelphia's ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]''; in it, Long wrote: "Roosevelt is a man who takes savage delight in whooping through the woods killing everything in sight." He continued, "The idea of Mr. Roosevelt assuming the part of a naturalist is absurd. He is a hunter".&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone took the President's involvement in the controversy seriously; he was often included in satirical cartoons of the day, pointing to the superficial and tedious disagreements for which the writers lambasted one another. Writing in the June 8, 1907 issue of the ''Outlook'', editor [[Lyman Abbot]] stated that Roosevelt's desire to become embroiled in such a debate stemmed from his "extraordinary vitality, coupled with his unusual interest in all that concerns human welfare" making "it very difficult for him to keep silence in the presence of anything which he thinks injurious to his fellow-men."&lt;ref&gt;Mazel, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The President's participation in the controversy attested to its magnitude, however; as one observer wrote, "From an insignificant smudge [the issue] has become a roaring blaze and its sparks are kindling throughout the land."&lt;ref&gt;Mighetto, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt did not at first respond to Long's claims, allegedly considering the author "too small game to shoot twice."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, write to Burroughs that he had "no quarrel with Mr. Long for the conclusions he draws from the facts. Our quarrel with him is because he invents the facts."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs proceeded to publicly defend the President against Long's attacks, condemning him and the expert witnesses Long produced to support his claims about the events and behaviors he depicted in his works. Newspapers around the country continuously published interviews with the two naturalists, while comedic depictions of the controversy and its participants were becoming popular with readers.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; One such parody referred to a non-existent book called ''How to Tell the Animals from the Wild Flowers'', including an illustration which depicted an anthropomorphic "[[Dandy]] Lion" with a cane, top hat and monocle.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; This joke inspired a similarly satirical book, which was published under the title ''How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers''; a collection of humorous illustrations and poems by physicist and children's author [[Robert Williams Wood]], the work included pairings of birds and their corresponding flowers, emphasizing their visual similarities. Making a thinly veiled reference to the much publicized controversy surrounding those authors who were now called "nature fakers", the book concludes: "I have freely drawn upon / The works of [[Asa Gray|Gray]] and [[John James Audubon|Audubon]], / Avoiding though the frequent blunders / Of those who study Nature's wonders."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of controversy and aftermath==
Seeing that his initial pronouncement did nothing to quell the controversy surrounding the faults of popular nature writing, Roosevelt finally responded to Long's ongoing criticism in the fall of 1907. His article, which was written under his own name and simply titled "Nature Fakers", was published in the September issue of ''Everybody's Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with a list of nature writers that the President admired and felt best represented the genre (Burroughs, Muir, and Olive Thorne Miller, among others), he soon fell into criticizing the "yellow journalists of the woods" who "can easily believe three impossible things before breakfast; and they do not mind in the least if the impossibilities are mutually contradictory".&lt;ref name="lut130"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; While he focused on the "nature fakers", especially Long, he shifted the focus of his attack to place responsibility not on the authors, but on their publishers and the school boards who regularly accepted their works for reading material. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our quarrel is not with these men, but with those who give them their chance. We who believe in the study of nature feel that a real knowledge and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.&lt;ref name="lut130"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Burroughs, who's a shark on birds
(He classifies 'em by a feather),
Avers that they're devoid of words
And simply cannot talk together.
He gives the nature-fakers fits
Who picture birds in conversation,
And tears their story books to bits
In scientific indignation.

But there's a wren outside my door
That talks whenever I go near him,
And talks so glibly, furthermore,
That I just wish that John could hear him.
Of mornings, when I stroll about,
The while he hymns his glad thanksgiving,
He interrupts himself to shout:
"Hey! Ain't it glorious to be living?"&lt;/poem&gt;

With Roosevelt's final public word on the matter, the controversy began to die down in earnest, although its key players continued to comment on the debate's major points for the next few years. ''The New York Times'' favored the President's position in an editorial titled "The War of the Naturalists", while some still supported Long and his literary efforts. Long was traveling in Maine when Roosevelt's "Nature Fakers" article was published, and did not respond to the criticisms against him with his past vigor. He later wrote that "the only fakir in the whole controversy, in my judgment, is the big fakir at Washington". Long's literary reputation steadily declined, although he continued to write and publish well into the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; For his remaining life, Burroughs continued to write disparagingly about the effect of sentimental animal stories. In his 1908 book ''Leaf And Tendril'', he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A great many intelligent persons tolerate or encourage our fake natural history on the ground that they find it entertaining, and that it interests the school-children in the wild life about them. Is the truth, then, without value for its own sake? What would these good people think of a United States school history that took the same liberties with facts that some of our nature writers do: that, for instance, made Washington take his army over the Delaware in balloons, or in sleighs on the solid ice with bands playing; or that made Lincoln a victim of the Evil Eye; or that portrayed his slayer as a self-sacrificing hero; or that represented the little [[USS Monitor|Monitor]] that eventful day on [[Battle of Hampton Roads|Hampton Roads]] as diving under the [[USS Merrimack (1855)|Merrimac]] and tossing it ashore on its beak?

The nature fakers take just this kind of liberties with the facts of our natural history. The young reader finds it entertaining, no doubt, but is this sufficient justification?&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, John. (1908). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LIU0AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=burroughs+leaf+and+tendril&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B75ZAVwSL0&amp;sig=bWTTL37q76kDJe1dBXWMd3XzyMc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZSPaS5WLL5GE9AS91uFM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Leaf and Tendril]''. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company. pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also in 1908, Jack London broke his silence on his condemnation during the controversy by publishing an essay in ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' entitled "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President "[[anthropocentrism|homocentric]]" and "amateur".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E2DC133EE233A25752C3A96E9C946997D6CF London Answers Roosevelt; Revives the Nature Faker Dispute&amp;nbsp;– Calls President an Amateur]". ''The New York Times''. August 31, 1908. Retrieved April 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He further wrote: "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which it seemed to me several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/Revolution/animals.html Revolution and Other Essays: The Other Animals]". The Jack London Online Collection. Retrieved April 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoping to establish his credentials once and for all as an expert field naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton spent several years of the controversy working diligently on his two-volume work ''Life-Histories of Northern Animals'', which was published in 1909. After an enlarged edition of the book was published as ''Lives of Game Animals'', Seton was ironically awarded the Burroughs Medal in 1927, a prize named after the venerable naturalist who had once so criticized Seton's work.&lt;ref&gt;Maclulich, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the term "nature faker" began to take on a new meaning; rather than describing someone who purposefully told false stories about animals, it became synonymous with those who overly sentimentalized the natural world. In 1910, journalist and writer [[Richard Harding Davis]] published a short story titled "The Nature Faker" in ''Collier's Weekly'', which used the negative colloquialism to refer to the lead character, Herrick, a hapless nature sentimentalist.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Animation pioneer [[John R. Bray]] also showcased this new definition of "nature faker" while satirizing Roosevelt&lt;ref&gt;Beckerman, Howard. (2003). ''Animation: The Whole Story''. New York: Allworth Communications, Inc. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; in two silent cartoons called "Colonel Heeza Liar, Nature Faker" (1915 and 1924).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Paramount_Pictures/Bray_Productions/Paramount_Pictograph/Colonel_Heeza_Liar/index.html Colonel Heeza Liar Cartoon Information]". The Big Cartoon Database. Retrieved April 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy had far-reaching effects in literary and scientific circles, and marked the only time that a President of the United States weighed in as a "literary and cultural critic—specifically, as an ecocritic."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Though blind naturalist and author [[Clarence Hawkes]] deemed the literary debate "a veritable tempest in the teapot", after the controversy had died down, he came to believe "if I ever make a bad break in regard to my natural history statements that I was doomed."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; The author Ralph H. Lutts wrote in his 1990 work ''The Nature Fakers: Wildlife, Science &amp; Sentiment'', the nature fakers controversy "was far more than a clash over the accuracy of animal stories or the question of whether animals can reason"; rather, the debate signified the changing sensibilities of writers and readers at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13113">'''New Criticism''' was a [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] movement in [[literary theory]] that dominated [[American literature|American]] [[literary criticism]] in the middle decades of the 20th century. It emphasized [[close reading]], particularly of [[poetry]], to discover how a work of literature functioned as a self-contained, self-referential aesthetic object. The movement derived its name from [[John Crowe Ransom]]'s 1941 book ''The New Criticism''.

The work of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] scholar [[I. A. Richards]], especially his  ''Practical Criticism'' and ''The Meaning of Meaning'', which offered what was claimed to be an empirical scientific approach, were important to the development of New Critical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Steven. ''Texts and Contexts: Writing about Literature with Critical Theory''. Addison-Wesley, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Also very influential were the [[T. S. Eliot#Literary Criticism|critical essays]] of [[T. S. Eliot]], such as "[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]" and "[[Hamlet and His Problems]]", in which Eliot developed his notion of the "[[objective correlative]]". Eliot's evaluative judgments, such as his condemnation of Milton and Dryden, his liking for the so-called [[metaphysical poets]] and his insistence that poetry must be impersonal, greatly influenced the formation of the New Critical canon.

==Formalism theory==
New Criticism developed as a reaction to the older philological and literary history schools of the US North, which, influenced by nineteenth-century German scholarship, focused on the history and meaning of individual words and their relation to foreign and ancient languages, comparative sources, and the biographical circumstances of the authors. These approaches, it was felt, tended to distract from the text and meaning of a poem and entirely neglect its aesthetic qualities in favor of teaching about external factors. On the other hand, the literary appreciation school, which limited itself to pointing out the "beauties" and morally elevating qualities of the text, was disparaged by the New Critics as too subjective and emotional. Condemning this as a version of Romanticism, they aimed for newer, systematic and objective method.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Gerald Graff, Professing Literature, Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was felt, especially by creative writers and by literary critics outside the academy, that the special aesthetic experience of poetry and literary language was lost in the welter of extraneous erudition and emotional effusions. Heather Dubrow notes that the prevailing focus of literary scholarship was on "the study of ethical values and philosophical issues through literature, the tracing of literary history, and ... political criticism". Literature was approached  and literary scholarship did not focus on analysis of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Dubrow, Heather. "Twentieth Century Shakespeare Criticism." ''The Riverside Shakespeare''. Houghton Mifflin, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Critics believed the structure and meaning of the text were intimately connected and should not be analyzed separately. In order to bring the focus of literary studies back to analysis of the texts, they aimed to exclude the reader's response, the author's intention, historical and cultural contexts, and moralistic bias from their analysis. These goals were articulated in Ransom's "Criticism, Inc." and [[Allen Tate]]'s "Miss Emily and the Bibliographers".

Close reading (or ''explication de texte'') was a staple of French literary studies, but in the United States, aesthetic concerns, and the study of modern poets was the province of non-academic essayists and book reviewers rather than serious scholars. The New Criticism changed this. Though their interest in textual study initially met with resistance from older scholars, the methods of the New Critics rapidly predominated in American universities until challenged by Feminism and [[structuralism]] in the 1970s. Other schools of critical theory, including, [[post-structuralism]], and [[Deconstruction|deconstructionist theory]], the [[New Historicism]], and Receptions studies followed.

Although the New Critics were never a formal group, an important inspiration was the teaching of [[John Crowe Ransom]] of [[Vanderbilt University]], whose students (all Southerners), [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], and [[Robert Penn Warren]] would go on to develop the aesthetics that came to be known as the New Criticism. Indeed, for Paul Lauter, a Professor of American Studies at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], New Criticism is a reemergence of the [[Southern Agrarians]].&lt;ref name="versionsofnashville"&gt;{{cite journal |first = Paul| last = Lauter| title="Versions of Nashville, Visions of American Studies": Presidential Address to the American Studies Association, October 27, 1994 |journal=American Quarterly |volume=47 |issue=2 |page=195 |jstor=2713279 | date = June 1995 |registration=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, "The New Criticism", Cleanth Brooks notes that "The New Critic, like the [[Snark (Lewis Carroll)|Snark]], is a very elusive beast", meaning that there was no clearly defined "New Critical" manifesto, school, or stance.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Cleanth. "The New Criticism." ''The Sewanee Review'' 87: 4 (1979): 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a number of writings outline inter-related New Critical ideas.

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.  For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]", which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hey-day of the New Criticism in American high schools and colleges was the Cold War decades between 1950 and the mid-seventies. Brooks and Warren's ''Understanding Poetry'' and ''Understanding Fiction'' both became staples during this era.

Studying a passage of prose or poetry in New Critical style required careful, exacting scrutiny of the passage itself. Formal elements such as [[rhyme]], meter, [[setting (fiction)|setting]], [[characterization]], and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] were used to identify the [[theme (literature)|theme]] of the text. In addition to the theme, the New Critics also looked for [[paradox]], [[ambiguity]], [[irony]], and [[Suspense|tension]] to help establish the single best and most unified interpretation of the text.

Although the New Criticism is no longer a dominant theoretical model in American universities, some of its methods (like [[close reading]]) are still fundamental tools of literary criticism, underpinning a number of subsequent theoretic approaches to literature including poststructuralism, deconstruction theory, and [[reader-response theory]].

==Criticism==
It was frequently alleged that the New Criticism treated literary texts as autonomous and divorced from historical context, and that its practitioners were  “uninterested in the human meaning, the social function and effect of literature.” &lt;ref name="Wellek"&gt;Wellek, René. “The New Criticism: Pro and Contra.” ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 4, No. 4. (Summer, 1978), pp. 611–624. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1342947].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jancovich"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jancovich | first = Mark | title = The Cultural Politics of the New Criticism | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-521-41652-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indicative of the [[Reader-response criticism|reader-response school of theory]], Terence Hawkes writes that the fundamental close reading technique is based on the assumption that “the subject and the object of study—the reader and the text—are stable and independent forms, rather than products of the unconscious process of signification," an assumption which he identifies as the "ideology of liberal humanism,” which is attributed to the New Critics who are “accused of attempting to disguise the interests at work in their critical processes.”&lt;ref name="Jancovich"/&gt; For Hawkes, ideally, a critic ought to be considered to “[create] the finished work by his reading of it, and [not to] remain simply an inert consumer of a ‘ready-made’ product.”&lt;ref name="Jancovich"/&gt;

In response to critics like Hawkes, Cleanth Brooks, in his essay "The New Criticism" (1979), argued that the New Criticism was not diametrically opposed to the general principles of reader-response theory and that the two could complement one another. For instance, he stated, "If some of the New Critics have preferred to stress the writing rather than the writer, so have they given less stress to the reader—to the reader's response to the work. Yet no one in his right mind could forget the reader. He is essential for 'realizing' any poem or novel. . .Reader response is certainly worth studying." However, Brooks tempers his praise for the reader-response theory by noting its limitations, pointing out that, "to put meaning and valuation of a literary work at the mercy of any and every individual [reader] would reduce the study of literature to reader psychology and to the history of taste." &lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Cleanth. "The New Criticism." ''The Sewanee Review'' 87:4 (1979) 598.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection to the New Criticism is that it is thought to aim at making criticism scientific, or at least “bringing literary study to a condition rivaling that of science.”&lt;ref name="Wellek"/&gt; [[René Wellek]], however, points out the erroneous nature of this criticism by noting that a number of the New Critics outlined their theoretical aesthetics in stark contrast to the "objectivity" of the sciences (although Ransom, in his essay "Criticism, Inc." did advocate that "criticism must become more scientific, or precise and systematic").&lt;ref name="Wellek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, John Crowe. "Criticism, Inc." ''[[The Virginia Quarterly Review]]'', Autumn 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, Wellek defended the New Critics in his essay “The New Criticism: Pro and Contra” (1978).

'''Nursing documentation''' is the record of [[Nursing|nursing care]] that is planned and delivered to individual [[Patient|clients]] by qualified nurses or other [[caregiver]]s under the direction of a qualified nurse.&lt;ref&gt;Urquhart C, Currell R, Grant MJ. Hardiker NR. Nursing record systems: Effects on nursing practice and healthcare outcomes. Cochrane Data- base of Systematic Reviews 2009; (1): 1–66.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; It contains information in accordance with the steps of the [[nursing process]]. Nursing documentation is the principal clinical information source to meet legal and professional requirements,&lt;ref&gt;Daskein R,Moyle W, Creedy D.Aged-care nurses' knowledge of nursing documentation: An Australian perspective. Journal of Clinical Nursing 2009; 18: 2087–2095.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most significant components in nursing care. Quality nursing documentation plays a vital role in the delivery of quality nursing care services through supporting better communication between different care team members to facilitate continuity of care and safety of the clients.

==Purposes==
* A [[Medical record|written record]] of the history, treatment, care, and response of the client while under the care of a health care provider.
* A guide for reimbursement of care costs.
* Evidence of care in a court of law. A legal record that can be used as evidence of events that occurred or treatments given.
* Show the use of the nursing process. It contains observations by the nurses about the client's condition, care, and treatment delivered.
* Provides data for quality assurance studies and shows progress toward expected outcomes.

== Documentation of the nursing process ==
{{See also|Nursing process}}

The internationally accepted nursing process consists of five steps: [[Nursing assessment|assessment]], nursing problem/diagnosis, goal, intervention and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Björvell C,Thorell-Ekstrand I.Wredling R.Development of an audit instrument for nursing care plans in the client record. Quality in Health Care 2000; 9: 6–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing process model provides the theoretical framework for nursing documentation. A nurse can follow this model to assess the clinical situation of a client and record a constructive document for nursing communication.

==Content==
Nursing documentation mainly consists of a client's background information or nursing history referred as admission form, numerous [[Assessment for Effective Intervention|assessment forms]], nursing care plan and progress notes. These documents record the client's data captured at the relevant stages of the [[nursing process]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, W., &amp; Smith, B. (n.d). Nursing documentation: Frameworks and barriers. Contemporary Nurse, 41(2), 160-168.&lt;/ref&gt; The following sections describe the concept, aim, possible structure and content of these nursing documents using the example of nursing documentation in Australian residential [[aged care]] homes.

=== Admission ===
An [[admission note|admission form]] is a fundamental record in nursing documentation. It documents a client's status, reasons why the client is being admitted, and the initial instructions for that client's care.&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;"General Info". Archived from the original on 12 March 2009. Retrieved 2009-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; The form is completed by a nurse when a client is admitted to a [[Health facility|health care facility]].

The admission form provides the basic information to establish foundations for further nursing assessment. It usually contains the general data about a client, such as name, gender, age, birth date, address, contact, identification information (ID) and some situational descriptions about marriage, work or other background information. Based on the different nursing care provider's requirements, this form may also record [[Family history (medicine)|family history]], [[past medical history]], [[History of the present illness|history of present illness]], and allergies (see Figure 1).

=== Assessment ===
The documentation of nursing assessment is the recording of the process about how a judgment was made and its related factors, in addition to the result of the judgment. It makes the process of nursing assessment visible through what is presented in the documentation content.&lt;ref&gt;Oroviogoicoechea C., Elliott B. &amp; Watson S. (2008) Review: evaluating information systems in nursing. Journal of Clinical Nursing 17, 567–575.&lt;/ref&gt;

During nursing assessment, a nurse systematically collects, verifies, analyses and communicates a health care client's information to derive a nursing diagnosis and plan individualized nursing care for the client.&lt;ref&gt;Crisp J., Taylor C., Potter PA. &amp; Perry A.G. (2005) POTTER and PERRY'S fundamentals of nursing (2nd ed). Elsevier Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Complete and accurate nursing assessment determines the accuracy of the other stages of the nursing process.&lt;ref name="White L. 2002"&gt;White L. (2002) Documentation and the Nursing Process. Delmar Learning, Clifton Park, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

The nursing documents may contain a number of assessment forms. In an assessment form, a licensed [[Registered nurse|Registered Nurse]] records the client's information, such as physiological, psychological, sociological, and spiritual status (see Figure 2). The accuracy and completeness of nursing assessment determine the accuracy of care planning in the nursing process.&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;L. White, Documentation and the Nursing Process, Delmar Learning, Clifton Park, NY, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nursing care plan ===
The [[nursing care plan]] (NCP) is a clinical document recording the nursing process, which is a systematic method of planning and providing care to clients.&lt;ref name="White L. 2002"/&gt; It was originally developed in hospitals to guide nursing students or junior nurses in providing care to client; however, the format was task-oriented rather than nursing-process-based.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood D. (1996) Nursing care plans: issues and solutions. Nursing Management 27(3), 33-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the NCP is widely used in nursing in various clinical and educational settings as a tool to direct individualized nursing care for clients.&lt;ref&gt;Neilson T., Peet M., Ledsham R. &amp; Poole J. (1996) Does the nursing care plan help in the management of psychiatric risk? Journal of Advanced Nursing 24,1201-1206

The nurses make nursing care plans based on the assessments they have completed previously with a client. There are many ways of structuring nursing care plans in correspondence with the different needs of nursing care in different nursing specialties. For example, a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home may be structured with several sections under each care domain such as pain, mobility, lifestyle, nutrition and continence. The information is recorded in free-text style, and various terms are used singly or in combination to name each of the four sections in the formats that are used by a facility during a particular period (Figure 3).

=== Progress notes ===
A [[progress note]] is the record of nursing actions and observations in the nursing care process.&lt;ref&gt;"UW Internal Medicine Residency Program". Retrieved 2009-04-10&lt;/ref&gt; It helps nurses to monitor and control the course of nursing care.
[[File:Figure 3-1. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home..png|thumb|Figure 3-1. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home.]]
Generally, nurses record information with a common format. Nurses are likely to record details about a&amp;nbsp;client's clinical status or achievements during the course of the nursing care.
[[File:Figure 4. A sample progress note in an Australian residential aged care home..png|thumb|Figure 4. A sample progress note in an Australian residential aged care home.]]

== Recording format ==

=== Paper-based nursing documentation ===
The paper-based nursing documentation has been in place for decades. Client's data are recorded in paper documents. The information in these documents needs to be integrated for sense-making in a nursing decision.

=== Electronic nursing documentation ===
Electronic nursing documentation is an electronic format of nursing documentation an increasingly used by nurses. [[Electronic health record|Electronic nursing documentation systems]] have been implemented in health care organizations to bring in the benefits of increasing access to more complete, accurate and up-to-date data and reducing redundancy, improving communication and care service delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Y, Yu P, Shen J. The benefits of introducing electronic health records in residential aged care facilities:A multiple case study. Interna- tional Journal of Medical Informatics 2012; 81: 690–704.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison of the quality of paper-based and electronic documentation ===
Electronic nursing documentation systems are able to produce somewhat better quality data in comparison with paper-based systems, in certain respects depending on the characteristics of the systems and the practice of the various study settings. The common benefits of electronic documentation systems include the improvement of comprehensiveness in documenting the nursing process, the use of standardized language and the recording of specific items about particular client issues and relevance of the message. In addition, electronic systems can improve legibility, dating and signing in nursing records.

For the documentation of nursing assessment, the electronic systems significantly increased the quantity and comprehensiveness of documented assessment forms in each record. In regard to the NCP, the electronic standardized NCPs were graded with a higher total quality score than its paper-based counterpart. In addition, in comparison with the paper-based documentation systems, the electronic systems, due to their automatic functions, were able to improve the format, structure and process features of documentation quality such as legibility, signing, dating, crossing out error and space with a single line and resident identification on every page.

Paper-based documentation has been found to be inferior in comparison with electronic documentation. This is caused by the inherent nature of paper being difficult to update, time-consuming in a recording. Thus, the records are often incomplete, illegible, repetitive and missing signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Ammenwerth E,Eichstadter R,Haux R et al.A randomized evaluation of a computer-based nursing documentation system. Method Inform Med 2001; 40: 61–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Figure 3-2. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home..png|thumb|Figure 3-2. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home]]
Electronic nursing documentation systems have the potential to improve the quality of documentation structure and format, process and content in comparison with paper-based documentation, as demonstrated in a comparative study of electronic and paper-based nursing admission forms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wang, N., Yu, P., &amp; Hailey, D. (2012). Description and comparison of quality of electronic versus paper-based resident admission forms in Australian aged care facilities. International Journal of Medical Informatics, doi:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2012.11.011&lt;/ref&gt; However, improvement in documentation quality is not necessarily to be brought about by the introduction of electronic nursing documentation system to replace paper-based documentation. For example, Wang et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that although the electronic nursing assessment form contained more documented assessment forms, which covered a wider range of resident care needs, they did not perform better than the previous [null paper-based assessment forms according to] the quality criteria of [null completeness] and timeliness. Therefore, further work on the usage of the electronic documentation systems may focus on improving form design and usage. There is also a need for improvement in compliance with standards in order to better meet the clients' care needs.

== Quality of nursing documentation ==

A study by the National Client Safety Agency (NPSA)&lt;ref&gt;National Clients Safety Agency (2007) Recognising and responding appropriately to early signs of deterioration in hospital clients. NPSA, London. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://tinyurl.com/yk8ao5x&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Accessed 20 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; found that poor standards of documentation were a contributory factor in the failure to detect clients who were clinically deteriorating. Nurses are responsible for maintaining accurate records of the care they provide and are accountable if information is incomplete and inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Owen K (2005) Documentation in nursing practice. Nurs Stand 19(32): 48–9&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a quality standard is required for recording of nursing documentation.

The systematic review of nursing documentation audit studies in different settings&lt;ref&gt;Wang N, Hailey D, Yu P. Quality of nursing documentation and approaches to its evaluation: A mixed-method systematic review.Journal of Advanced Nursing 2011; 67: 1858–1875.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the following relevant quality characteristics of nursing documentation:

* Quality of documentation structure and format: relates to constructive features and physical presentation of records such as quantity, completeness, legibility, read- ability, redundancy and the use of abbreviations. 
* Quality of documentation process: the procedural issues of capturing client data such as nurse's signature and designation, date, chronological order, timeliness, regularity of documentation and concordance between documentation and reality. 
* Quality of documentation content: refers to the message from data about a care process. It is concerned with the comprehensiveness, appropriateness and the relation- ship of the five steps of the nursing process. The care issue recorded at each step is also considered.

== Standardized nursing terminology ==
[[NANDA|North American&amp;nbsp;Nursing Diagnosis&amp;nbsp;Association (NANDA)]] nursing diagnosis:

NANDA International (formerly the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) is a professional organization of nurses standardized nursing terminology that was officially founded in 1982 and develops, researches, disseminates and refines the nomenclature, criteria, and taxonomy of nursing diagnoses.

[[Nursing Interventions Classification|Nursing intervention classification (NIC)]]:

The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) is a care classification system which describes the activities that nurses perform as a part of the planning phase of the nursing process associated with the creation of a nursing care plan.

[[Nursing Outcomes Classification|Nursing outcome classification (NOC)]]:

The Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) is a classification system which describes client outcomes sensitive to nursing intervention.

The [[Omaha&amp;nbsp;System]]:

The Omaha System is a standardized health care terminology consisting of an assessment component (Problem Classification Scheme), a care plan/services component (Intervention Scheme), and an evaluation component (Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes).

International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP):

The International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) is a collaborative project under the auspices of the International Council of Nurses. The ICNP provides a structured and defined vocabulary as well as a classification for nursing and a framework into which existing vocabularies and classifications can be cross-mapped to enable comparison of nursing data.&lt;ref&gt;Wake, M., &amp; Coenen, A. (1998). Nursing diagnosis in the international classification for nursing practice (icnp).&amp;nbsp;''International Journal of Nursing Knowledge,''&amp;nbsp;''5''(4), 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structured documentation ==
Structured documentation takes the form of pre-printed guidelines for specific aspects of care and can, therefore, focus nursing care upon diagnoses, treatment aims, client outcomes and evaluations of care.&lt;ref&gt;Dahm M, Wadensten B (2008) Nurses' experiences of and opinions about using standardised care plans in electronic health records; a questionnaire study. J Clin Nurs 17(16): 2137–45&lt;/ref&gt; It can improve client care by replacing the practice of vague, narrative style entries by nurses with cohesive and accurate information determined by the format of the care plan.&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Irvine K, Tracey M, Scott A, Hyde A, Butler M, MacNeela P (2006) Discursive practices in the documentation of client assessments. Journal of Advanced Nursing 53(2): 151–9&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; The clarity of the recorded information also facilitates clinical auditing and evaluation of documentation practices through.&lt;ref&gt;Saranto K, Kinnunen U (2009) Evaluating nursing documentation-research designs and methods: systematic review. J Adv Nurs 65(3): 464–76&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the introduction of structured documentation and care plans are seen as a means by which nurses can raise standards of record-keeping practice.&lt;ref&gt;Law L, Akroyd K, Burke L (2010) Improving nursing documentation and record-keeping in stoma care. Br J Nurs 19(21): 1328–32&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''oil-paper umbrella''' ({{zh|油紙傘}}, {{zh|p=yóuzhǐsǎn}}, {{IPA-cmn|i̯ǒu̯ʈʂɨ̀sàn}}) is a type of paper [[umbrella]] that originated in [[China]]. It subsequently spread across several East, South and Southeast Asian countries such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]], where it has been further developed with different characteristics.&lt;ref name='Hakka'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sinica.edu.tw/tit/culture/1096_Umbrellas.html | title = Oil Paper Umbrellas--Beauties of Hakka Craftsmanship | accessdate = 2012-07-02 | last = Logan | first = Christopher | year = 1995 | publisher = Vision International Publishing Co. | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/68rOq3DN1 | archivedate = 2012-07-02 | quote = The Hakka people of the historic town of Meinung fashion amazing umbrellas out of bamboo and paper. These umbrellas, which are lacquered and painted in colorful designs, actually work fine in the rain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the purpose of providing shade, oil-paper umbrellas are also traditional wedding items. In traditional Chinese and Japanese weddings, the [[bridesmaid|matron of honor]] would cover the [[bride]] with an oil-paper umbrella upon arrival to ward off evil spirits. Purple umbrellas are a symbol of longevity for elders, while white umbrellas are used in funerals. Oil-paper umbrellas are also used as props in [[Japanese traditional dance]]s and [[tea ceremonies]].

In the early [[Hakka]] society, two umbrellas were usually given as [[dowry]], due to the "paper" (纸) and "child" (子) homonym in the language ([[Pha̍k-fa-sṳ]]: chṳ́), symbolizing a blessing for the woman to "give birth to a son soon", a propitiatory compliment to the newlyweds at the time. Also, as the character "umbrella" contains "four people", gifting the umbrellas represents a blessing for the couple to have many sons and grandsons. In addition, because of the "oil" and "have" homonym, and that the umbrellas open into a round shape, they symbolize a happy, complete life. It was also customary to give an umbrella to a 16-year-old man at his [[rite of passage]].

In religious celebrations, oil-paper umbrellas are often seen on the sacred sedan chairs as cover, used to shelter people from rain and sunlight, also to drive the evil spirits away. Today, oil-paper umbrellas are mostly sold as works of [[art]] or [[souvenirs]].

==History==
[[File:Legend_white_snake1.jpg|thumb|right|Oil-paper umbrella in the [[Legend of the White Snake]]]]
The spread of oil-paper umbrellas was started by the invention of Yun ({{lang|zh|雲氏}}), wife of Luban ({{lang|zh|魯班}}). "Chop [[bamboo]] sticks to thin strips, covered in animal fur, closed to become a cane, opened as a cone." But early umbrella materials were mostly feathers or silks, later replaced by paper. When oil-paper umbrellas first appeared is unknown. Some estimate that they spread across to Korea and Japan during the [[Tang dynasty]]. It was commonly called the "green oil-paper umbrella" during the [[Song dynasty]]. The popularity grew and the oil-paper umbrella became commonplace during the [[Ming dynasty]]. They are often mentioned in popular Chinese literature. By the 19th century, oil-paper umbrellas were a common item in international trade under the name [[kittisol]]s.

==Basic production process==
The production process and required procedures are different in each region. However, in general, they can be divided into four main steps:
#[[Bamboo]] is selected
#The bamboo is crafted and soaked in water. It is then dried in the sun, drilled, threaded and assembled into a skeleton.
#Paper is cut and glued onto the skeleton. It is trimmed, oiled, and exposed to sunlight.
#Lastly, patterns are painted onto the umbrella.

==Oil-paper umbrellas in China==
The art of the Chinese style of oil-paper umbrellas are mostly focused on traditional black and white [[Chinese painting]] such as flowers, birds, and scenery. Others include scenes from famous Chinese literature, such as ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' and ''[[Romance of the Western Chamber]]''. Yet, some have Chinese calligraphy instead of paintings. However, traditional colors are kept on the sticks and the scaffold of the umbrella to maintain the antiquity.

===Yuhang, Zhejiang===
In [[Yuhang District]], [[Zhejiang]], oil-paper umbrellas have been produced since the era of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1769), by Dong Wenyuan ({{zh|c=董文遠|p=Dǒng Wényuǎn|labels=no}}), who owned an umbrella shop. Oil-paper umbrellas in Yuhang are made with high mechanical skills and top materials, which provide their endurance. Prolonged exposure to sunlight and rain does no damage, thus their popularity among common people. Lots of travelers who passed through Yuan would buy umbrellas from Dong Wenyuan's umbrella shop as souvenirs for friends and relatives. Oil-paper umbrellas in Yuhang are available in a variety of different types and purposes, including those used for fishing or as collectibles.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1951, Zhejiang province has chosen Yuhang as the focused point of the industrial artifact for oil-paper umbrellas and initiated a group for this establishment in 1952. The later established "Artifact Rain Umbrella Industry Co-operations" ({{zh|t=雨傘手工業合作社|p=Yǔsǎn shǒugōngyè hézuòshè|labels=no}}) was the first industry of artifacts in Zhejiang province. This establishment was once in the spotlight of the Chinese media, however, as the popular metallic umbrella appeared on the market and oil-paper umbrellas have faced extinction.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

On December 5, 2006, artisan Liu Youquan ({{zh|t=劉有泉|p=Liú Yǒuquán|labels=no}}) met a government official of the Yuhang district and proposed to recover the oil-paper umbrella in Yuhan, with the intention of starting a new pop culture trend and increase local wealth. Liu spent a few hundred RMB and bought some dozens of the bamboo umbrella from a bamboo umbrella factory. But Liu did not have the skills, only to keep these as a "canvas" for 30 some years. A local media reported for a search of an oil-paper umbrella artisan and increased local awareness. Four days later, four artisans: Fang Jinquan ({{zh|t=房金泉|p=Fáng Jīnquán|labels=no}}), Chen Yue Xiang ({{zh|t=陳月祥|p=Chén Yuèxiáng|labels=no}}), Shen Lihua ({{zh|t=沈麗華|p=Chén Lìhuá|labels=no}}), and Sun Shuigen ({{zh|t=孫水根|p=Sūn Shuǐgēn|labels=no}}) prompted and have intentions to recover the art (drawing oil paintings on the bamboo umbrella). They have passed their skills and technique to some local bamboo farmers and brought income to them. The governmental officials of Yuhang have listed this art for major protection and important antique artifact ([[Antiquities Act]]).

Production requires skilled hands and technique as well as personal experience. Training to become a master in oil-paper umbrella manufacture requires an apprenticeship and a great deal of practice. Apprentices must practice the skills for three years to officially master this technique. Tools are made by professional blacksmiths. The material of the umbrellas is chosen with care. The umbrella scaffold is made from either bamboo or wood, tied with hair strings. The best umbrellas are made from peach flowers, as the umbrella surface is soaked in persimmon pigment. The persimmon pigment is made from fermenting the juice of green persimmons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiromipaper.com/newsletter/LoriGoodman.htm|title=Hiromi Paper International|work=hiromipaper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a suitable stickiness. The soaked flower petals are stuck to the umbrella scaffold one by one.  Paintings or pictures are drawn on the peach flower petals prior to painting [[tung oil]] on top. The finalized umbrella is left to dry in a dry dark room. It requires at least 70 steps to produce a well-crafted oil-paper umbrella.

===Sichuan===
In [[Luzhou]], [[Sichuan]], the oil-paper umbrella culture started around the end of [[Ming dynasty]] and beginning of [[Qing dynasty]]. Oil-paper umbrellas have existed in Sichuan for as long as four hundred years. Herem, the umbrellas are exquisite with fine paintings, abundant colors and beautiful outlooks, the umbrellas are also famous for their ability to shield strong winds. In 1993 May, six experienced artisans have spent four months to produce a famous ''Erlongxizhu''  umbrella ({{zh|二龍戲珠|p=Èr lóng xì zhū|labels=no}}), which was exported to countries such as [[England]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. The ''Erlongxizhu'' was made out of 88 [[pinaceae]] and 52 bamboo sticks with 1800 skin paper and 100 kilograms of oil pigment. Producing the ''Erlongxizhu'' required over 70 procedures and it was regarded as the "Chinese King of Umbrellas".

After Western umbrellas had increased in popularity, the Luzho oil-paper umbrella's popularity diminished dramatically. In addition, due to the sophisticated procedures, the high production cost and low profit, not many young men were willing to commit to this art. In 2004, only about thirty experienced artisans were willing to continue this umbrella production. Many people worried that the skills may soon become extinct. In October 2005, an exhibition in Shanghai invited the local government to an exhibition of oil-paper umbrellas, and they have recovered some popularity since then.

After the recovery, [[Yunnan]] and Luzho minorities gained awareness of oil-paper umbrellas and used them during ceremonies and gifts. Since then, the umbrellas have been exported to Japan, Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong and Macau.

Contemporary local artisans still utilize the traditional method of oil-paper umbrella production, which includes the 70 or so procedures of total manual production. Such as slicing the bamboo and painting the pictures. Materials used are also orthodox to the traditional materials, such as the bamboo sticks directly brought from the mountains where they were chopped. Tools of production are old too. Such as the black stone ink is already 450 years old. Quality control is strict; the four trenches should not meet and the tung oil must be spread evenly across the umbrella surface. The paintings adhere to the situations they are used for.

===Jiangxi===
Oil-paper umbrellas in the [[Wuyuan County, Jiangxi|Wuyuan County]] of the [[Jiangxi]] province are orthodox and beautiful in appearance, as well as endurable with portability, named the "{{zh|c=金溪斗笠甲路傘|p=Jīnxī dǒulì Jiǎlù sǎn|labels=no}}".

During the Song dynasty, a local resident of Jiangxi named "{{zh|t=馬庭嵐|p=Mǎ Tínglán|labels=no}}" was awarded the position [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]], who then brought an oil-paper umbrella back to Jiangxi with him from a major city. One named "{{zh|t=甲路人|p=Jiǎ Lùrén|labels=no}}" have improved upon the [[prototype]] and  passed it on to his descendants. It was said that during the Ching dynasty when the [[Kangxi Emperor]] was on the throne, one day the Kangxi Emperor secretly traveled to Wuyuan and it was raining. Kangxi Emperor saw a kid who threw a stone at the umbrella, however, the stone bounced back off from the umbrella without damaging it. Kangxi Emperor was surprised by the quality and strength of the oil-paper umbrella and gave it a positive name called the "Jialu paper umbrella Jia Tianxia&lt;!--the "Jia Tianxia" part seems mis/untranslated--&gt;" ({{zh|t=甲路紙傘甲天下|p=Jiǎlù zhǐ sǎn jiǎ tiānxià|labels=no}}). Since then they have been commonly called "Jialu umbrellas" ({{zh|t=甲路傘|p=Jiǎlù sǎn|labels=no}}).

Jialu umbrellas were awarded the first place during an international exhibition in 1936 and reached its peak at 1943, which recorded to have once produced 25,000 umbrellas and exported 17,000 annually. In 2000, however, only three eighty-year-old artisans have possessed the skill, in addition, one of the raw materials, persimmon tree is in extinction{{Clarify| reason=The persimmon article doesn't mention any threat of extinction, and in fact, says that the trees are particularly hardy|date=March 2012}}. Jialu umbrellas have since become extinct. In 2006, the locals have produced a new and natural breed and increased the quality of Jialu umbrellas. Jialu umbrella production reached 50,000 annually and exported to countries such as the United States, Japan, and Korea. Contemporarily, there are four factories located in Wuyuan with a net worth of eight million RMB, thirty villagers and 1,800 workers.

Jialu umbrellas are made from high-quality bamboo, skin paper, and tung oil. The main procedures are slicing the umbrella scaffold, cutting the umbrella portion, installing the umbrella sticks, boiling the umbrella stick, adding the skin paper, painting on the skin paper, editing the umbrella skin, brushing on tung oil, stitching the umbrella with decorations, installing the handle and the head. Altogether about thirty procedures.

===Hunan===
Oil-paper umbrellas in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]] province date back to about 100 years, the earliest oil-paper umbrella shop is {{lang|zh|陶恆泰紙傘店}}, Which is named after Tao Jiqiao ({{lang|zh|陶季橋|p=Táo jì qiáo|labels=no}}), who established the shop during the Qing dynasty.

In 1900, Liang Jingting ({{zh|t=梁敬庭|p=Liáng Jìngtíng|labels=no}}), who worked in an umbrella shop in Changsha opened his own umbrella shop called the ''Lianghongfa San'' ({{zh|t=梁宏發傘|p=liánghóngfā sǎn|labels=no}}). It produces the old type of oil, black ink umbrella. The beautiful name ''Xiangtan Muji Jing Gang You San'' ({{zh|t=湘潭木屐 靖港油傘|p=xiāngtán mùjī jìng gǎng yóu sǎn|labels=no}}) is attributed to its fine features and endurance. In 1921, the Pan Kuiqing ({{zh|t=潘饋清|p=pān kuì qīng|labels=no}}) brothers started a factory called ''Feifei San'' ({{zh|t=菲菲傘|p=fēifēi sǎn|labels=no}}) that mass-produces umbrella skin paper. The umbrella skin it produced included traditional flowered ones and many other pictures, these umbrellas were exported to Hong Kong, Macau and South East Asia. The umbrella was awarded in a Chinese exhibition in 1929.

===Hubei===

The [[Hankou]], [[Hubei]], province has been producing oil-paper umbrellas for a few hundred years. In 1864, Somun ({{zh|c=|s=|t=蘇文|p=Sūwén|}}) who was originally from Hunan, invested in an umbrella shop along with what he has learned. He later opened an official umbrella shop called Suhengtai Sandian ({{Zh|c=|s=|t=蘇恆泰傘店|p=sūhéngtàisǎndiàn}}), hired 12 workers and 3 apprentices. The production rate is about 500-600 umbrellas per month, and he also brought up the popularity of the umbrella market locally. He later expanded his business and gained enormous profits.

Suhengtai ({{Zh|c=|s=|t=蘇恆泰|p=sūhéngtài}}) oil-paper umbrella gained much popularity locally. It was once popular to buy umbrellas for marriages with the brides and the grooms. Bride holding a blue one and groom holding a red one with the connotation of a beautiful marriage. In 1970, the Sheng Tai oil-paper umbrella has become extinct, and this art was officially extinct.

Suhengtai ({{Zh|c=|s=|t=蘇恆泰|p=sūhéngtài}}) oil-paper umbrella uses to class material, the scaffold is made from a special type of bamboo and the umbrella handle from a special type of wood from Hunan. Tung oil, skin paper, and persimmon oil are all strictly picked. A Suhengtai oil-paper umbrella could last for about eight to twelve years.

===Fujian===
[[File:Oiled Paper Umbrella of Fuzhou 2013-07.JPG|thumb|Oil-paper umbrella from [[Fuzhou]]]]
Oil-paper umbrella have been produced in both [[Fuzhou]] and [[Nanping]] of [[Fujian]]. The oil-paper umbrella is one of the three treasures in Fuzhou ({{lang|zh|福州三寶}}). The other two are namely the {{lang|zh|脫胎漆器}} ([[Lacquerware]]) and the {{lang|zh|牛角梳}} ([[comb]]s made of cattle [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]). Umbrellas play a large part in Fuzhou residents' daily lives, local people call it {{lang|zh|包袱傘}}, which literally means everyone's backpack has an umbrella in it. Oil-paper umbrella in Nanping is famous with two other brands altogether known as the "three mouth" ({{lang|zh|三口}}), the other two mouths are {{lang|zh|水口}} and {{lang|zh|閩清口}}. The production initiated in the 20th century. The highest production recorded was fifty thousand annually. The traditional oil-paper umbrella was gradually replaced by the collapsible umbrella in the 1970 decade. The local artisans switched to producing small and portable umbrellas since then. The umbrellas produced in Nanping is currently exported to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, South East Asia, Europe, and America.

Fuzhou oil-paper umbrella materials are chosen strictly with high quality. The scaffold must be made from bamboos of the Northern Fujian province with good elasticity and endurance, and the bamboos must be at least five years old. A single umbrella must go through 83 procedures.

Traditional Fuzhou oil-paper umbrella art is divided into five sub-portions including umbrella scaffold, umbrella installment, umbrella head, handle and painting. The mainstream art is the umbrella installment. There are also a few famous local umbrella painters including {{lang|zh|程家寶}}, {{lang|zh|林永欽}} and {{lang|zh|劉夢秋}}.

The oil-paper umbrella in Fuzhou is dated as long as the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. When {{lang|zh|王審知}} established his own kingdom called "{{lang|zh|閩國}}" at Fuzhou, he brought the oil-paper umbrella from [[Zhejiang]] with him. During the Ching dynasty, there were as many as 300 shops in Fuzhou. Oil-paper umbrella was also one of the symbols for riot against the Japanese during the [[Xinhai revolution]].
The oil-paper umbrella in Fuzhou was famous for its endurance in an expo in [[Panama]] in 1915 and [[Chicago]] in 1933.

In 1985, the Fuzhou oil-paper umbrella has had significant improvement and advancement and was exported to Japan, [[Europe]] and South East Asia. Every umbrella has 72 sticks in the scaffold, opens wide and closes small giving it a snake appearance, thus also named the "Snake Umbrella".

In 1990, a government official {{lang|zh|林愛枝}} went to Seattle for an umbrella exhibition, and a red umbrella he showed provoked a great response in the audience. But Fuzhou umbrella shop closed down in 1997, the production is now low with a minor export to Japan. Despite local umbrella artisans have already being occupied with other jobs, they still petition the local government's assistance in the recovery of this art.

===Yunnan===

Oil-paper umbrella production in [[Tengchong County|Tengchong]], Yunnan, dates back to two-hundred years ago, or nine generations, also called the {{lang|zh|紙撐子}}. It was rumored that {{lang|zh|鄭以公}} who once met two umbrella artisans and learned the skills from them brought the skills with him back to Tengchong, and passed it on to his descendants. In the past, oil-paper umbrella spread across all markets in Tengchong. The local Hakka especially liked the oil-paper umbrellas. The village chief {{lang|zh|鄭傳國}} said that once 80% of the villagers knew how to make oil-paper umbrellas, but now only four that are still making them. The current best production household is the {{lang|zh|鄭家朝}}, who is picky about the material and techniques. Tung oil and persimmon water are made adhering to the traditional methods of production. The final umbrella is elegant and strong. The production rate is about one to two per day. {{lang|zh|鄭映樓}}, who only makes big umbrellas likes to place big umbrellas in front of his shop to shed the sun and attract customers, therefore also named the "shed shop umbrella" ({{lang|zh|照舖傘}}). They only produce umbrellas when they have free time from farm works currently.

The oil-paper umbrellas produced in Tengchong are finely tuned, abundant with colors and beautiful outlook. They were once sold in other provinces of China. However, there has been a gradual decrease in production during the 1950s. The oil-paper umbrella production now is only to pass on the skills to prevent the extinction of this handcraft locally.

The oil-paper umbrella uses special bamboos and wood translocated from {{lang|zh|雲華}} and {{lang|zh|古永}} as umbrella handle and scaffold. The umbrella surface uses skin bought from {{lang|zh|界頭}}. Brushed with tung oil, named the green cloth ({{lang|zh|綠衣子}}). Procedures including slicing bamboo scaffold, stitching, surface skin, brushing persimmon water, collapsing the scaffold, drying the umbrella, painting, installing the handle, brushing tung oil, adding clothes, stitching again. It averages out about two umbrella a day.

"{{lang|zh|紙}}" (Paper) is a homonym for "{{lang|zh|子}}" (sons) in Chinese, for the connotation of having sons early. The character "{{lang|zh|傘}}" (umbrella), contains five "{{lang|zh|人}}" (man) with the connotation of lots of sons and grandsons. Oil-paper umbrella is straight up, with the symbol to eradicate evil spirits. The circular appearance symbolizes "fullness" connotation of a beautiful marriage. And since the umbrella itself can shield rain and the wind, thus prohibiting evil spirits from entering in. Other dowries that come with the oil-paper umbrella include five colored pants, make up the table, door curtain, and boxes. In wealthier families, dowries could include god and jewelry or high-quality cloth or blankets. In addition, bride family would give vegetables that have homonym with positive words such as {{lang|zh|芹菜}}, {{lang|zh|大蒜}}, {{lang|zh|香蔥}}, {{lang|zh|韭菜}} that are then tied with red rope given as gifts to the husband's family.
Oil-paper umbrella as a dowry is still a custom in the Hakka family in Taiwan and some other countries in [[South East Asia]].

====Hakka second burial funerals====
Since many of the Hakka populations are in the mountainous areas of China, most corpses are buried on the mountains. Initially, Hakka people do not put up a gravestone, however, after the second time the corpse is buried (usually 3–5 years later), the additional grander ceremony is added. When buying, usually in the eighth month of the Chinese calendar, an experienced burial master is hired to dig the old burial and enter the clean bones for an official and permanent burial at the exact spot. The oil-paper umbrella is used to cover the bones while they are being cleaned.

====Engagement present of the Yao people====
In the population of [[Yao people|Yao]] located in [[Longhui County]] of [[Hunan]], oil-paper umbrella is used as an engagement present by the men side. When a consensus is built between the two families, the family of the man's side would hire an experienced man to propose a marriage in the woman's house. The first propose does not require any gift but only the permission of the parents of the bride. During the day of engagement, the man's side needs to bring an oil-paper umbrella to the woman's house and place it on the sacred table located in the house; the bride must take the umbrella from the table personally and close the umbrella that is stitched with 12 triangles. Then the experienced man must bring the oil-paper umbrella back to the husband's house for the proof of a successful engagement. On the way back, the experienced man must not open the umbrella himself. If a divorce is made later, the husband must return the string on the stitch back to the bride.

====Funerals of the Dai people====
[[Dai people]] located in Yunnan use a special type of paper called "{{lang|zh|嘎拉沙}}" (Garcia) to make oil-paper umbrella, which is brushed with sesame oil. The Dai believe that the umbrella could lead the dead to [[heaven]]. This type of umbrella is still available in a village today.

====Hakka dance ceremony====

==Oil-paper umbrella in Taiwan==
Oil-paper umbrella has been the cultural symbol of the Hakka in [[Meinong District]] of [[Kaohsiung]]. The production procedures are divided into five major portions. This includes the umbrella scaffold, umbrella production, umbrella head, umbrella handle and art painting. With any one of the above been done, the umbrella could be called as a "full art" ({{lang|zh|全藝}}).

===History and modifications===
Oil-paper umbrella production in Meinong initiation has two rumors.
*One was that it started during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], during which, Lin ({{lang|zh|林阿貴}}) and Wu ({{lang|zh|吳振興}}) invited oil-paper umbrella artisans from mainland China to Taiwan for the purpose of passing the skills to the locals.
*The other was that oil-paper umbrella artisan Guo ({{lang|zh|郭玉琴}}) have arrived in Taiwan from Guangdong province. Since then, he had permanently stayed in the Meinong district and spread the skills locally. Early Meinong oil-paper umbrella factor was called "{{lang|zh|廣}}" (pronounced "Young") for connotations of wealth, wide and progression. In 1960, oil-paper umbrella, tobacco leaves, and rice were Meinong district's major income sources. At that time, it was the renaissance of oil-paper umbrella. It was estimated that there were at least twenty factories producing twenty thousand oil-paper umbrellas annually. However, with the rapid industrialization in Taiwan, mechanically produced Western umbrellas have replaced them in attribute to low cost, longevity, and portability. Taiwan has become the key country of Western umbrella production and forced lots of traditional handmade oil-paper umbrella factories out of business.

In 1970, an English journal used the Goung ({{lang|zh|廣進勝}}) oil-paper umbrella pioneer, Lin ({{lang|zh|林享麟}}) and his umbrella as the magazine cover, along with a detailed article on the culture and production of oil-paper umbrella. BBC have also included a series of recording of the oil-paper umbrella called the "Long Search". In addition, 1983, famous Hakka movie producer, Lin Fu-De ({{lang|zh|林福地}}), have incorporated the oil-paper umbrella into his drama, ''[[Star Knows My Heart]]''. When the drama was played in the Japanese television, Taiwanese oil-paper umbrella gained impression in the Japanese, who have ordered a large quantity for imports. After 1980, with the increase of Taiwan overall financial status, Meinong's increased tourism, oil-paper umbrella have recovered its utility in the daily life along with its value as a local culture and travel souvenir.

===Production and materials===
Meinong oil-paper umbrella scaffolds are made mainly from bamboo sticks, which are translocated from places such as [[Puli, Nantou|Puli]], [[Zhushan, Nantou|Zhushan]], [[Nantou County]] and the [[Qishan District]] of Kaohsiung. Especially the famous [[moso bamboo]] of the Qushan district. Moso bamboo is famous for its strength and elasticity. Thus the scaffold is mainly made of moso bamboo. Prior to production, most bamboo is soaked in water to eliminate the sugar for a month. Then they are dried under the sun to prevent infection of bugs. After cutting and slicing, they become the fundamental scaffold of the umbrella, with additional modifications such as umbrella head, handle and hole drilling for stitching. After the scaffold production, the wax is applied onto the surface as well as the sides. Then persimmon oil, sun bake, painting, handle installment, umbrella head fixed, stitched for a finalized oil paper umbrella.

==Oil-paper umbrella in Japan==
[[File:Making umbrellas (Japan) (9099970800).jpg|thumb|Umbrella making as a home industry]]
Oil-paper umbrellas are often known in Japanese as {{nihongo||和傘|'''wagasa'''|"Japanese umbrella"|lead=yes}}, and these with a bull's-eye design are called {{nihongo4||蛇の目傘|janomegasa}}. The handle and scaffold are often colored black, however, sometimes other colors are applied as well. The surface paintings include traditional Japanese culture, gained popularity from the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] to [[Edo period]].{{efn|A part of wagasa was excavated at {{nihongo4|Kōfu Jōkamachi Site |甲府城下町遺跡}} in Kōfu, Yamanashi, Japan, where the area was a castle town during the rule of feudal lord [[Takeda Shingen]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title =Iseki topikkusu: No. 0342 Kōfu jōkamachi iseki |trans-title =No. 0342 Kōfu Jōkamachi iseki site|work = Site Report |number =| URL = http://www.pref.yamanashi.jp/smartphone/maizou-bnk/topics/301-400/0342.html |author = Maizō-bunkazai Sentā (Archaeological Center at Board of Education)| publisher= Yamanashi Prefecture|location = Yamanashi, Japan | access-date = 2016-04-24|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===History===
[[File:Underside of a Japanese umbrella.jpg|thumb|The underside of a Japanese oil-paper umbrella]]
The origin of oil-paper umbrellas could be traced to those fabric canopies brought from Korea to Japan during the [[Asuka period]], which samples are preserved among the  [[Shōsōin]] treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title =  6.

During the [[Heian period]], techniques in paper production and bamboo work advanced. In the [[Muromachi period]], pigments and wax were applied to the surface of the paper for additional resistance to water.

[[File:Wedding Scene.jpg|thumb|left|Oil-paper umbrella used in weddings in [[Ryūkyū]]]]
During the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]], [[Luzon Sukezaemon]] introduced an umbrella with a shield from the [[Philippines]], which contributed the popularity of the wages. During the [[Genroku]] era, modifications were made to enhance its utility to specific circumstances. Some monks and doctors used shorter and thicker umbrellas with business trademarks or logos on them, then lent them to customers as an advertisement. Umbrellas also became the [[geisha]]'s tool as well. In addition, some unemployed Edo period samurai crafted oil-paper umbrellas as a secondary occupation. A famous example is the {{nihongo4||阿島傘|Ajima-kasa}}, made in [[Nagano Prefecture]], which is still made there.

However, with the popularity of Western umbrellas in the [[Meiji period]], oil-paper umbrellas have diminished markets today, with only a few locations producing it, such as [[Kyoto]], [[Gifu Prefecture]] and [[Yodoe, Tottori|Yodoe]], [[Tottori Prefecture]].

[http://kyototsujikura.com Tsujikura] is the oldest shop of the oil-paper umbrella in Japan.

===Kyoto===
[[File: Kyoto Umbrella 01.jpg|thumb|Kyō wagasa, a traditional umbrella of Kyoto, Japan.]]
A style of oil-paper umbrella in [[Kyoto]] is called {{nihongo4||京和傘|'''kyōwagasa'''}}. Kyowagasa is completely handmade, colors and images are of Japanese features, materials are also strictly controlled. The handle and scaffold are made from bamboo of [[Kameoka, Kyoto]]; the umbrella skin is made from Meinong paper of Gifu. The surface of the umbrella skin is brushed with [[sesame oil]] and tied with fine strings. An experienced artisan usually produces ten to twenty kyowagasa a month. One umbrella style has concentric circles on the exterior side of the umbrella skin called the {{nihongo4||蛇の目傘|janomegasa}}, which literally means ''eye of a snake''.

===Gifu===
Oil-paper umbrella production in Gifu started around 1750. Every oil-paper umbrella made in Gifu goes through over a hundred procedures. During the [[Shōwa period]], the production in Gifu reached its peak at about fifteen million annually. Today, the production is only about a few tens of thousands per year.

===Yodoe===
Oil-paper umbrella production started in [[Yodoe, Tottori]] in 1821, by the {{nihongo4||倉吉屋|Kurayoshiya}}. During the Meiji period, the production in Yodoe was only about a few thousand annually. However, due to the abundance and accessibility of bamboo and other raw materials, during the [[Taishō period]], production by factories increased 71% and a net production of 17,000 Wagasa annually. Most areas in western Japan regularly used the Yodoe Wagasa.

===Wagasa in Japanese culture===
[[File:Wedding, Yoyogi Park (2562137428).jpg|thumb|right| Wagasa at a wedding ceremony]]

Other than its utility, oil-paper umbrellas appear quite often in Japanese culture, and are often associated with geisha, traditional dance, [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], and daily utility including wedding ceremony. Oil-paper umbrella shops in [[Gion]] have classified their customers into categories for different styles of oil-paper umbrella:
*Geisha use purple
*Dancers use pink
*Middle aged clients like green or red
*Men and elderly use dark blue
*Actors tend to pick black or brown
Different colors have different connotations and symbolism; in traditional weddings, brides are usually covered under a red oil-paper umbrella. &lt;!-- examples need to be added to two other colors; Purple oil-paper umbrellas symbolize longevity and white oil-paper umbrellas are used in [[funeral]]s.{{citation needed |date = April 2016}}--&gt;

==Oil-paper umbrellas in Thailand==
[[File:Chiangmai-market.jpg|thumb|right|Umbrella stand at the Sunday market, [[Chiangmai]]]]
Oil-paper umbrella art in the Northern Thailand, or [[Chiang Mai]] dates back to around two hundred years. The umbrella scaffold is made from green bamboo sticks, the colors and images are abundant including pictures of scenery, animals, people and flowers. The umbrella surfaces can have a square shape in addition to the traditional circular one. Oil-paper umbrellas in Thailand have unique features, which often entice tourists to buy them. Of the several types, the most famous are the ones made in the Bo Sang village. Most farmers produce oil-paper umbrellas during their free time in specialized factories.

===History and modifications===
The rumors of the local people have guessed that the oil-paper umbrella has been brought into Thailand by the [[Bamar]]. Long ago, a monk in Thailand named "Pra In that" who practiced Buddhism in "Wat Bo Sang" temple and traveled a lot. One time as he approached near the Northern border of [[Burma]] and stayed there for a few days, the [[Thai people]] there accommodated him while his stay. During a time when Pra In that ate his breakfast, a Bamar gave him an umbrella along with the prayer of the monk. The monk thought the umbrella was very convenient and was curious for how it was made, he decided to learn to make the umbrella. Thus he visited the village that was specialized in the production of umbrella located in Burma. Pra In that recorded the detailed production procedures and brought it with him back to Wat Bo Sang temple.

After arriving back at Wat Bo Sang, Pra In that was on a hunt for the needed materials to produce the umbrella, with some assistance of the villagers, they were able to make the first umbrella in Thailand. Initially, not many villagers were motivated to make umbrellas, however, once they found the convenience of it, many were attracted to mass-produce and buying it. Oil-paper umbrella production became one of the major sources of income for the Bo Sang village.

In 1941, Bo Sang villagers have cooperated and established the "Bo Sang Umbrella Making Cooperative Ltd.". The chief of the company is Jamroon Suthiwiwat. The company is specialized in making umbrella of different sizes such as 14, 16, 18, 20, 35, 40&amp;nbsp; inches and even bigger umbrella. In 1957, Governmental association "Center for Industrial Promotion for the North" have assisted the villagers and improved their production techniques.

===Production and materials===
[[File:Rocket Festival Phangkhi.jpg|thumb|right|Phangki, son of [[Nāga]] under an oil-paper umbrella]]
The umbrella skin is made from the tree skin of [[Morus (plant)|morus plant]] called "sa". Morus skin is cooked to soft, washed, smashed, washed and bleached. It is covered in cloth to increase the thickness. Then dried under the sun. Oil-paper umbrella production is all handmade including slicing the bamboo stick, combining the umbrella scaffold, addition of the skin, painting, and drying. Bo Sang umbrella use [[oil paint]] to paint and are all painted completely by hand.

===Umbrella festival===

The '''People's Prize''' ({{lang-ko|인민상}}) is a [[North Korea]]n arts and sciences award. It is awarded by the People's Prize Awarding Commission, which is working directly under the [[Cabinet of North Korea]].&lt;ref name="ScalapinoLee1972"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert A.

People's Prize has been an important award in the field of [[Cinema of North Korea|North Korean cinema]].

The works and people that have received the People's Prize cover such varied fields as literature, gymnastics, [[Korean revolutionary opera]], [[acupuncture]] and sculpture. The People's Prize has been received by people abroad.

==History==
The People's Prize was instituted on 8 September 1958.&lt;ref name="Weiser2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chests Full of Brass: A DPRK Political History in Orders, Medals, Prizes, and Titles | last = Weiser | first = Martin  | work = Sino-NK | date = 8 January 2016 | access-date = 16 April 2016 | url = http://sinonk.com/2016/01/08/chests-full-of-brass-a-dprk-political-history-in-orders-medals-prizes-and-titles/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first North Korean feature film ''[[My Hometown (film)|My Hometown]]'' (1949) was directed by [[Kang Hongshik]]. It was the first of a film series to be awarded People's Prize. [[Kim Il-sung]] praised many of People's Prize winning movies from 1960s and 1970s of supplying an exhaustive answer to the issue of people's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Chajusŏng|ko|3=자주성 (주체사상)}}''.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=37–42}} The [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]] gives the award to those North Korean films and film-makers seen as fulfilling the role of an "excellent textbook" for the workers party.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=37–42}}

Some of the works, which did not become recognized as "Immortal classics", did earn People's Prize meant only for the best productions. One such production is a three-part film ''[[Five Guerilla Brothers]]'' (1968) directed by [[Choe Ik-gyu]], and overseen by [[Kim Jong-il]] himself. Other films overseen by Kim to win the People's Prize were ''[[A Flowering Village]]'' and ''[[A Family of Workers]]'' (1971). In the case of the ''A Family of Workers'', Kim Jong-il was reportedly not satisfied with the application of the [[On the Art of the Cinema#Seed theory|seed theory]].&lt;ref name="Schönherr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Schönherr|title=North Korean Cinema: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGBog0seMFQC&amp;pg=PA47|date=13 August 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9052-3|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bradley K.

In 1965 the [[Chongryon]] established [[Korea University (Japan)|Chosun University]]'s teaching staff in Japan received the prize.&lt;ref name="Chongryon"/&gt;

Many of the works to obtain People's Prize are still highly regarded in North Korea. ''[[Reminiscences of the Anti-Japanese Guerillas]]'' is regarded as classic of literature of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]], and was awarded People's Prize in 2012. It is still used in daily ideological study sessions at workplaces, and many of the memoirs have later been made into movies.&lt;ref name="KCNA_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2006/200602/news02/04.htm |title=Reminiscences of Anti-Japanese Guerrillas, True Textbook of Life |author= |date=2 February 2006 |website=[[Korean Central News Agency|KCNA]] |publisher= |access-date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public art in [[Barcelona]]''' is a designated group of monuments and outdoor sculptures in the city. In conjunction with architecture and a network of museums, parks and gardens, the works put an artistic stamp on the Catalan capital.&lt;ref&gt;Fabre; Huertas; Bohigas, 1984, p. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Public art in the city developed in the 19th century, although the first municipal commission was the 1673 monument to Saint Eulàlia in Pedró Square.

Artworks are typically located in the interior of [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] and on the façades of public buildings. They are concentrated because of the city's enclosure by medieval defensive walls.&lt;ref&gt;Subirachs i Burgaya, 1986, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The walls were demolished in the 19th Century, sparking a boom in public works such as [[Ildefons Cerdà]]'s [[Eixample]] project.

The city annexed several municipalities in the early 20th century, increasing the space available for public art. Some were commissioned for events such as the [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition|1888]] and [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|1929 Expositions]], the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] and the 2004 [[Universal Forum of Cultures]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Colón (Barcelona).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Ornate outdoor statue|The 1888 [[Columbus Monument, Barcelona|Columbus Monument]] at the Pla del Portal de la Pau, an iconic Barcelona monument]]
Public art in Barcelona is regulated by the city council and protected by Law 9/1993 of Catalan Cultural Heritage, which guarantees the protection, conservation and research of cultural heritage at several levels.&lt;ref&gt;«[http://w110.bcn.cat/portal/site/Urbanisme/menuitem.38ead442d60e56329fc59fc5a2ef8a0c/?vgnextoid=a56e4e13fd076210VgnVCM10000074fea8c0RCRD&amp;lang=ca_ES Patrimoni arquitectònic]».&lt;/ref&gt; Public monuments, commemorating historical figures, are appropriate for a large city.

Urban planning includes [[architecture]], [[engineering]], [[gardening]], [[Artes Mechanicae|industrial arts]] and [[sculpture]]. [[Urbanism]] relates to [[politics]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[geography]] and [[sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Subirachs i Burgaya, 1986, p. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subirachs i Burgaya, 1986, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monuments are generally located in parks and gardens, squares and intersections or near public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Subirachs i Burgaya, 1986, p. 55-57.&lt;/ref&gt; They are of several types; until the 19th century the most common were the [[column]], the [[Triumphal arch|arch of triumph]] and the [[Statue|equestrian statue]], three types of monuments inherited from [[Roman art|Roman]] art. Later monuments were busts placed in niches, [[Medallion (architecture)|medallions]], fountains, [[stele]]s and [[pedestal]]s, [[frieze]]s, [[relief]]s, [[commemorative plaque]]s, [[Headstone|gravestones]], followed by installations, [[land art]] and multidisciplinary works.&lt;ref&gt;Subirachs i Burgaya, 1986, p. 64-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Materials used are [[wood]], [[Gypsum|plaster]], [[terracotta]], [[ceramic]], stone, [[marble]], [[bronze]], [[iron]], [[steel]], [[concrete]] and aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;Subirachs i Burgaya, 1986, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes include homage to a character or event: religious, mythological, symbolic, allegorical, historical, political, military, scientific or artistic. Public artworks commemorate many aspects of the [[history of Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;Subirachs i Burgaya, 1986, p. 89-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Middle Ages ===
Barcelona's first public artworks were created during the [[Middle Ages]], when the city formed part of the [[Crown of Aragon]] and was an important commercial [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port. The 13th-century [[Consell de Cent|Council of One Hundred]] was one of Barcelona's first public institutions. The city was growing beyond its core (the present-day [[Gothic Quarter, Barcelona|Gothic Quarter]], and the [[El Raval]] neighbourhood developed during the 14th century (when Barcelona's population was about 25,000).&lt;ref&gt;Lecea et al., 2009, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time the city had fountains, and the Gothic Town House had sculptures in front dating to about 1400. At the front was a stone statue of the archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] with bronze wings. At either side were statues of St. Severus (bishop of Barcelona) and Saint [[Eulalia of Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;Lecea et al., 2009, p. 20-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Renaissance}}Early modern era ===
[[File:Font de Santa Eulàlia.JPG|thumb|alt=Column and statue in an older part of the city|1673 monument to Saint Eulalia, the city's oldest]]
During the [[Renaissance]], Barcelona became part of the kingdom of Spain which emerged from the union of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]]. It was a period of economic and cultural decline, marked by social conflicts and wars (such as the [[Reapers' War]] and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]). Barcelona was still walled, with its only expansion to the coastal district of [[La Barceloneta, Barcelona|La Barceloneta]] and a population of almost 100,000. Its architecture featured Renaissance and Baroque palaces and churches.&lt;ref&gt;Lecea et al., 2009, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barcelona's artworks were primarily fountains and statues in public buildings until the end of the seventeenth century, when a monument to Saint Eulalia was built.&lt;ref&gt;Lecea et al., 2009, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lecea et al., 2009, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; A cross on a [[Solomonic column]] by Bernat Vilar in the courtyard of the Hospital of the Holy Cross was destroyed in 1691 and rebuilt in 1939. In the same courtyard are statues of [[Saint Roch]] and Caridad dating to the late 1630s. In the courtyard of the hospital's convalescent home is a 1679 statue of Saint Paul by Louis Bonifaç, and on Calle del Carmen is another statue of Paul from 1668 by Dominic Rovira.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

Other works were commissioned by guilds; St. John the Baptist (1628), in the Square of Assaonadors Marcús, was sponsored by the tanners' guild and rebuilt in 1958 by Josep Miret. A 1763 statue of Our Lady of the Angels is on Via Laietana.&lt;ref&gt;Lecea et al., 2009, p. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest public monument in its original location in the city was dedicated to Saint Eulalia employer of the city, erected in the square stone 1673. it was made by master builder Pares Benedict with a wooden statue of the saint by [[Josep Darder]], who in 1685 was replaced by another marble [[Tramulles Lazarus]] and [[Louis Bonifaç]]. In 1826, the base of the monument was turned into a fountain, by Josep Mas i Vila. The monument was demolished in 1936 due to conflicts arising at the start of the Civil War, but was rebuilt in 1951 with a new look, designed by [[Frederic Marès]] -the head of the previous image survived and is preserved in the Museum of History de Barcelona. The base of the monument is a fountain square on which stands an obelisk topped by the statue of Santa Eulalia, which has the attributes of his martyrdom: Palm and believes in vane.&lt;ref&gt;Fabre; Huertas; Bohigas, 1984, p. 20-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that previously had been made a monument in Santa Eulalia, drawn up in 1618 and located in the Plaza del Blat -now Àngel-. It was designed by Rafael Plansó and consisted of an obelisk on which stood the figure of an angel, pointing to the place where an angel had appeared to the delegation that transferred the remains of the saint in the Cathedral Barcelona. The figure of the angel was made by silversmith Felip Ros. In 1821 the obelisk was removed because the movement difficult, and the Angel was placed in a niche. In 1966 it was replaced by a copy and moved to Barcelona City History Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Jaume Fabre, Josep M. ''Huertas i Victòria Mora''. «Àngel». [Consulta: 15 març 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1784 he built the Fountain of Neptune, by Joan Enrich promoted by the count of Assault, next to the Customs, the location of the current station in France. Represented Neptune standing on a pedestal with dolphins and bas-reliefs, amid a cup of water. The statue was destroyed in the popular uprising of Camància (1843) and replaced by a copy made by a stonemason, until 1877 the fountain was dismantled; even retained bas-relief of the pedestal, which is in the Museum of History of Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;Fabre; Huertas; Bohigas, 1984, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth century was founded on the estate of the Marquis de Llupià located in the municipality of Horta de Sant Joan -today a district of the city-garden that despite being passed from private to public property later. Now known as Horta Labyrinth Park, this garden has profuse sculptural decoration, despite being unknown artist is an interesting example of neoclassical art. Garden highlights the labyrinth that gives the park its name, the center of which is a statue of Eros, while in the entrance there is a relief of Ariadne and Theseus, and the output is the Grotto Echo and Narcissus; at a higher level is the Belvedere Viewpoint or, where there are two temples Italian style with statues of Artemis and Danae; Finally, a third terrace stands the pavilion of Charles IV, crowned by a sculpture depicting Apollo and the muses, while the rear is a large lake fed by the source of the nymph Egeria, inspired by the Stowe cave.

=== Nineteenth century ===
[[File:Font d'Hèrcules, Moret Gurri.JPG|thumb|Fountain of Hercules (1802) by Josep Moret and Salvador Gurri, Barcelona's oldest original statue.]]

In this period there was a great economic revival, especially related to the textile industry, which also involved a cultural renaissance. Between 1854 and 1859 there was the demolition of the city walls, so the city could expand, especially through the [[Eixample]] project drawn up by [[Ildefons Cerda]] in 1859. However, thanks to the revolution of 1868 achieved the demolition of the Citadel, the grounds of which were transformed into a public park. The population was growing, especially thanks to immigration from the rest of the state, reaching 400,000 at the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Lecea et al., 2009, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically, the century saw the succession of different political styles including [[neoclassicism]], [[romanticism]] and [[Realism (art movement)|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;DD.AA., 1997, p. 114-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in previous periods, the artistic achievements of governmental buildings were confined mainly to public fountains. Examples of public monuments, such as those dedicated to [[Ferdinand VII]] (1831) and King Ferdinand{{ambiguous|date=August 2018}} (1850), have not survived. However, many such works were made at this time, so you could almost speak of a trend. The oldest was the Hercules Fountain, located at the crossroads of [[Passeig de Sant Joan, Barcelona|Passeig de Sant Joan, Barcelona]] and Carrer de Còrsega, the work done in 1802 by Josep Moret to a design by Salvador Gurri. Initially located in Paseo Nuevo, or the Esplanada of the military fortress of the Citadel, it has been in its present location since 1928, and is though to be the oldest public statue in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;Fabre; Huertas; Bohigas, 1984, p. 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fountains from this period include the ''Font del Vell'' (old fountain) (1816) by Damien Campeny, initially located in Pla del Teatre, next to [[La Rambla, Barcelona|La Rambla]], which was later transferred to the Parc de la Ciutadella (1877) and, lastly, the Plaça de Sants (1975); Fountain of Ceres (1825–1830), Celdoni of plaster, located in Paseo de Gracia Provence street corner, and in 1874 moved to the Plaza Blasco de Garay in the Poble Sec, and in 1918 in the Plaza de Sant Jordi in Montjuïc; Neptune's Fountain (1826), Ferran Adrià, placed at the Moll de la Riba, Barceloneta, and later transferred to the Laribal Gardens and 1983, in the Plaza de la Merced, in front of the basilica; Monument to Galceran Marquet (1851) by Damien Campeny and Joseph Anicet Santigosa in the Plaza del Duque de Medina, the first work performed on iron-Town;{{clarify|date=August 2018}} ''Font del Geni Català'' (1856), Faust and Joseph Baratta Anicet Santigosa at Pla de Palau; and the Fountain of the Three Graces (1876), in the Plaça Reial, designed by the architect Antoni Rovira i Trias. Lastly, the Wallace fountains, made in 1872 by Charles-Auguste Lebourg commissioned by the English philanthropist [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Wallace]], and erected in many European cities as an act of brotherhood; two of the original twelve remain in Barcelona: the Rambla Santa Monica and the Gran Via with Passeig de Gràcia. All of them have four figures of [[caryatids]] supporting a hemispherical dome, with a water jet.&lt;ref&gt;Fabre; Huertas; Bohigas, 1984, p. 26-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for public buildings, the most important were the two statues placed in niches on both sides of the front door of the new facade of the Hotel de Ville, representing James I the Conqueror and Joan Fiveller, made by Josep Bover 1844. Just the opposite, in front of the [[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya|Palau de la Generalitat]], in 1871 was placed a statue of St. George also -located in a fornícula-, designed by Andreu Aleu. This facade was also new, since the opening of the Sant Jaume square in 1823 left both institutional buildings facing front. Note that then the Palau de la Generalitat did not harbor this institution was abolished from the Decree of New Plant, but the Royal Court, the Provincial Council and the General Archive of the Crown of Aragon.&lt;ref&gt;Lecea et al., 2009, p. 42-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

We should also mention regarding public buildings, statues located in the lobby of the [[University of Barcelona]], a monumental architectural complex built between 1863 and 1882. [[Rogent Elijah]] was the same architect who proposed the preparation of the statues, by brothers Agapito and [[Venanci Vallmitjana]], which were made in 1865 and 1876. They placed five figures representing science and knowledge throughout the history of Spain: San Isidoro de Sevilla, the Visigoth kingdom; Averroes, the time for Spanish-Muslim; Alfonso X the medieval period in Castile; Ramon Llull, for the same period in the Crown of Aragon; and Joan Lluís Vives, to the Renaissance period. Finally, we should mention the group of ''Charity'', the work of [[Joan Serra]] 1880, located at the House of Charity; and allegories of Commerce and Industry located in front of the Casino building formerly Mercantile Exchange by [[Rossend Novas]] and [[Joan Roig i Solé]], 1888.

==== Expo 1888 ====
{{Main|1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition}}
[[File:Gran Cascada1.JPG|thumb| [[Cascade Parc de la Ciutadella]] (1875–1888).]]
At the end of the century, an event that was a huge impact on both economic and social planning, art and culture for the city, was the Universal Exhibition of 1888. Held between 20 May and 9 December 1888, and was carried out in [[Ciutadella Park]], formerly belonging to the army and won for the city in 1868. The incentive acts exhibition led to the improvement of infrastructure throughout the city, which made a huge leap in modernization and development. {{sfn| Red|1995|pp = 130-131}} Furthermore, the exhibition marked the testing of a new artistic style, the [[Catalan Modernism|modernism]], which until the beginning of [[century XX]] was what prevailed in the field of architecture and art in the city and became modernist Barcelona, the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], defining the style of the city. {{sfn| DD.AA.|1997|pp = 150-171}} the statues made for the exhibition was the most important contribution to public art in the city's history and coincided with a generation of sculptors carving that caused one of the brightest moments of the [[art of Catalonia|Catalan art history]].&lt;ref&gt;Fabre, Huertas, Bohigas, 1984, p 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The remodeling project Ciutadella Park was commissioned [[Joseph Fontserè Mestre|Josep Fontserè]] in 1872, who designed some gardens for the recreation of the citizens, and along with a green screened central square and a stroll ring and a fountain and various decorative elements, two lakes and woodland, plus several ancillary buildings and infrastructure, such as [[Born Market]].&lt;ref&gt;Garrut, 1976, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barcelona. Triumphal Arch of the Exposition.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the historic [[Arc de Triomf (Barcelona)|Arc de Triumph]].]]
Admission to the exhibition takes place through the [[Arc de Triomf|Arc de Triumph]], a monument created for the occasion that still remains in its original place, designed by [[Joseph Vilaseca and Casanovas|Josep Vilaseca]].

In 1914 the [[Monument to Rafael Casanova|Casanova statue]] was transferred to the Ronda de Sant Pere -cantonada Ali Bey- and replaced by another dedicated to [[Pau Claris]] by [[Rafael Atché]]. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] six statues were removed, and only remained in place of the original ''Roger de Lauria'' and ''Antoni Viladomat''; Five were cast in 1950 to make the image of the [[Virgin of Mercy]] of [[Basilica of the Merced]], while the ''Pau Claris'' municipal was stored in a warehouse, it was restored in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://w10.bcn.cat/APPS/gmocataleg_monum/FitxaMonumentAc.do?idioma=CA&amp;codiMonumIntern=61&amp;cerca=true| title = Characters Hall of Sant Joan| author = James Fabre, Josep M.

=== Twentieth Century ===
[[File:Cançó popular (9-6-13).JPG|thumb |''La cançó popular'' (1909) by [[Miquel Blay]], [[Palau de la Música Catalana]]]]
The twentieth century saw the continued placement of monuments in public spaces of Barcelona, following the custom started with the celebration of the Universal Exhibition.

=== 1929 Barcelona International Exposition ===
{{Main|1929 Barcelona International Exposition}}
In the 1920s, a new exhibition was planned like 1888, whose success left a pleasant memory in the city. This time the site chosen was the mountain of Montjuïc, which thus was urbanized and won as a public space for the city. The International Exhibition took place from May 20, 1929 to January 15, 1930, and left numerous buildings and facilities some of which have become emblems of the city, including the National Palace, Magic Fountain, the Teatre Grec, the Spanish Village and Olímpico.

One of the most important monuments was the monumental Spain Fountain Square, designed by [[Josep Maria Jujol]], with ornate decoration sculptural work and Miquel Miguel Blay and Llucià Oslé brothers. Classically inspired, the iconographic meaning of the work is a poetic allegory to Spain: on a pond triangular plants an edículo stands with three niches with sculptures symbolizing the rivers flowing into the three seas that surround the Iberian Peninsula, Ebro (Mediterranean), the Guadalquivir and Tajo (Atlantic) and some figures of teenagers for the rivers of the Cantabrian Sea, Blay work; at the corners of the pond three groups that represent the fruits and gifts of the waters they lie: Abundance, Public Health and Fisheries and Navigation Oslé work of the brothers; around the central body three columns are placed with various figures and emblems symbolizing religion (a cross with Ramon Llull, Saint Teresa of Avila and Ignatius of Loyola), Heroism (a sword with Don Pelayo, Jaime I of Aragon and Isabella Catholic), and the Arts (a book with Ausiàs March and Miguel de Cervantes); He tops the work a cauldron of fire with three Victorias.&lt;ref&gt;Grandas, 1988, pp. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Spain Square and the National Palace of Montjuic Magic Fountain, designed by [[Carles Buigas]], who wowed audiences for its fantastic play of light and water spouts stood. It is still an emblematic work of the Catalan capital, where they often held musical fireworks shows in the celebrations of the Merced. It is ellipsoidal in shape, formed by three concentric ponds at different levels, with 65&amp;nbsp;m in diameter at its widest part. It has thirty different water games, with their gradual colorations, based on five colors: yellow, blue, green, red and blanco.&lt;ref&gt;Grandas, 1988, pp. 99-101.&lt;/ref&gt; In principle there were built four Ionic columns symbolizing the Catalan flag, designed by Puig i Cadafalch, but the dictator Primo de Rivera sent them topple. With the restoration of democracy was thought to replace them, project carried out between 2010 and 2011 by the team of architects Rosselló-Sangenís, slightly higher than its location original.&lt;ref&gt;Jaume Fabre y Llorenç Bonet. «Las cuatro columnas». Fabre, Huertas y Bohigas, 1984, pp. 107-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works placed on the grounds of the exhibition were: San Jorge (1924), by Josep Llimona, in the homonymous square; Beauty (1924), by Josep Llimona, in Piazza Dante; Tomorrow (1925), the German expressionist sculptor Georg Kolbe, located in the Pavilion of Germany a rationalist style building built by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe; Flowers and sedente (1927), by Josep Llimona in the Marques de Foronda; Water and Earth (1929), Frederic Marès on the stairs to the National Palace; Serenity (1928), Josep Clara in Miramar Gardens; Young Braid (1928) by Josep Viladomat, and Estival (1929), by Jaume Otero, in Laribal Gardens; The Good Shepherd (1929), Joan Rebull, and Venus (1929), Joan Borrell, in the Gardens of Joan Maragall.69 then also carried the Olympic charioteers, a chariot pulled by horses and riders making the Olympic salute two equestrian sculptures in bronze, both of Pablo Gargallo, situated at the Olympic Stadium Lluís Companys of charioteers there is a copy in the park Can Dragó-.&lt;ref&gt;Jaume Fabre, Josep M. Huertas y Oriol Gual. «Los Aurigas olímpicos».&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the achievements at the fair, as in the foregoing various performances throughout the city they were made. The most important was in Plaza Catalunya, currently one of the nerve centers of the city, but that was formerly an esplanade outside the old town, which began to urbanize until 1902. On the occasion precisely the exhibition was out a redevelopment of the entire space of the square, with a project of Francesc Nebot, and was inaugurated by [[Alfonso XIII]] in 1927, to decorate the square a public tender was organized in 1927, in which the installation of a sculpture it was decided 28 works: Motherhood, of Vincente Navarro; Young, Josep Dunyach; The smith, Josep Llimona; Woman with child and piccolo, Josep Viladomat; female figure, of Enric Casanovas; Youth, Josep Clarà; Shepherd Flute, Pablo Gargallo; Navigation, Eusebi Arnau; Barcelona, Frederic Marès; Montserrat, Eusebi Arnau; female figure, Josep Llimona; Hercules, Antoni Parera; Woman with angel, Vincente Navarro; Tarragona, Jaume Otero; Source of six putti, Jaume Otero; Lleida, Joan Borrell; Woman with image of the Virgin, of Enric Monjo; The popular spirit, Jaume Otero; Pastor eagle, Pablo Gargallo; Pomona, Enric Monjo; Wisdom, Miquel Oslé; The Goddess of Josep Clara, currently a copy, the original is in the lobby of the House of the city; Work, Llucià Oslé; Emporion, Frederic Marès; Fisherman, Josep Tenas; Woman, Joan Borrell; Montseny, Jaume Duran; and Gerona, Antoni Parera. which was originally also in the square Children group riding fish (1928) by Frederic Marès, a fountain with water jets and four figures indicating the title, which was transferred in 1961 the junction of Gran Via and Rambla de Catalunya.

With regard to the whole Plaça Catalunya, some changes on the fly in the original project led to the replacement of several parts and transfer to other areas of the city. One of the main reasons was the cancellation of the project of Francesc Nebot placed in the square a pavilion with decorated colonnade with sixteen female figures, which finally took place by decision of the consistory, prompting the resignation of Nebot in front of the works . Thus, some of the sculptures made for this shrine were relocated in different places: four of them executed by Eusebi Arnau, Josep Llimona, Enric Casanovas and Àngel Tarrach, they were placed on the entrance wall of the Royal Palace of Pedralbes; two from Josep Dunyach (Goddess) and Vincente Navarro (night), others were installed in the park of the Citadel; and two more (Fertility, by Josep clear, and the vendimiadora, Pablo Gargallo), in the gardens of Miramar, in Montjuïc. Another reason the surplus works was the decision that all the sculptures of the square were made in bronze except those of the upper terrace, which are stone-, with the result that some works that had already been executed in stone had to be repeated, and the remaining were relocated: it is Lerida, Manuel Fuxà, and Tarragona, Jaume Otero, that were installed on Diagonal avenue, opposite the Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Finally, the work entitled Marinade or Danzarina, by Antoni Alsina was located in the Jardines del Umbráculo on Paseo de Santa Madrona of Montjuïc, in this case because it concerns a female nude that was not viewed favorably by the moral prevailing at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jaume Fabre, Josep M. Huertas y Lídia Català. «Esculturas de la diáspora de la Plaza Catalunya» .&lt;/ref&gt;

After the exhibition, in 1930 the monument was opened to Pau Gil, in honor of the banker who introduced the gas industry in Barcelona and with his testament favored the construction of the Hospital de Sant Pau, a jewel of modernism made by Lluis Domenech i Montaner, whose entrance is the monument. The work of Eusebi Arnau was held in 1916 but was not settled until 1930, and has a bust banker with an allegory of Charity at his feet.&lt;ref&gt;Jaume Fabre, Josep M. Huertas y M. Isabel Marín. «A Pau Gil».&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year was placed on the Gran Via the monument to set designer Francesc Soler i Rovirosa, the work of Frederic Marès shaped reclining female nude with a flower in her hand; and the Monument to Eduardo Dato, on Calle San Antonio Maria Claret by Jaume Duran, composed of an allegory of Fame and a monolith with a medallion of the honoree.&lt;ref&gt;Fabre, Huertas y Bohigas, 1984, pp. 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings''' ('''SPAB''') (sometimes known as '''Anti-Scrape'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=E. P.|last=Thompson|authorlink=E. P. Thompson|year=1976|title=William Morris: Romantic to Revolutionary|publisher=Pantheon|quote=The Society, which Morris dubbed "Anti-Scrape...|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0-394-73320-7|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[amenity society]] founded by [[William Morris]], [[Philip Webb]] and others, in 1877; to oppose what they saw as destructive 'restoration' of ancient buildings then occurring in [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[England]]; 'ancient' being used in the wider sense of 'very old' rather than the more usual modern one of 'pre-[[medieval]]'.

Morris was particularly concerned about the practice, which he described as 'forgery', of attempting to return functioning buildings to an idealised state from the distant past, which often involved the removal of elements added in their later development, and which Morris saw as contributing to their interest as documents of the past.  Instead, he proposed that ancient buildings should be repaired, not restored, so that their entire history would be protected as [[cultural heritage]].  Today, these principles are widely accepted.

==Organisation and activities==
Today, the SPAB still operates according to Morris's original manifesto.  It campaigns, advises, runs training programmes and courses, conducts research and publishes information.  As one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], the Society is a statutory consultee on alterations to [[Listed Building|listed buildings]], and by law must be notified of any application in England and Wales to demolish in whole or part any listed building.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]]|title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015|date=24 March 2015|url=https://www.GOV.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015|website=www.GOV.uk|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom|HM Government]]|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It currently has c. 8,500 members (2012).  The Society also has a branch in [[Scotland]].

The society's Mills Section is the only British national body concerned with the protection, repair and continued use of traditional [[windmill]]s and [[watermill]]s; [[Ken Major]] carried out much work on its behalf.

The society, which is a registered charity, is based at 37 [[Spitalfields|Spital Square]], [[London|LONDON]] [[London E1|E1]] 6DY, [[England]].

For its dedicated service to heritage, the society was awarded the [[European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards|European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://EuropaNostra.org/laureates-2012/|title=2012 EU Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards – Category 3 - Dedicated service|website=EuropaNostra.org|publisher=[[Europa Nostra]]|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://EuropaNostra.org/awards/89/|title=The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB)|website=EuropaNostra.org|publisher=[[Europa Nostra]]|date=20 March 2012|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-254_en.htm|title=Winners of 2012 EU Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards announced|website=Europa.eu|publisher=[[European Commission]] - press release|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SpiralIsland2000.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Spiral Island I in early March 2000]]

'''Spiral Island''' is the name of a [[floating island|floating]] [[artificial island]] built in [[Mexico]] by British artist Richart "Reishee" Sowa. It was destroyed by [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] in 2005; a replacement, Joyxee Island, has been open for tours since 2008.

Spiral Island has been featured in a number of [[newspaper]]s and TV [[Documentary film|documentaries]] around the world, including in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], and has been featured in an episode of the ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' TV series, and on the MTV program Extreme Cribs in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-of-recycled-plastic-bottle-eco-art-is |title=Grand Launch of Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiral Island==
The first Spiral island was located in a [[lagoon]] near [[Puerto Aventuras]], on the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Mexico]] south of [[Cancún]]; Richart Sowa began constructing it in 1998.  He filled nets with empty discarded plastic bottles to support a structure of [[plywood]] and [[bamboo]], on which he poured sand and planted numerous plants, including [[mangrove]]s. The island sported a two-story house, a [[solar oven]], a self-[[composting toilet]], and three beaches. He used some 250,000 bottles for the {{convert|66|x|54|ft|m|adj=on}} structure. 

Sowa was ordered to take the island out of the man-made canal in 2004 because many private homes and condos were being built and he lived for one year tied to the end of a loose rock pier. Richart was offered a new location in the bay of Soliman about 200 km south, Finally, he was permitted by Port authorities to tow Spiral Island but the island was destroyed by Hurricane Emily in 2005. &lt;ref&gt;[http://greentravelife.com/richart-sowa-a-green-island-made-of-plasti-bottles/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joyxee Island==
In late 2007 and 2008, Sowa built a replacement for Spiral Island in the waters of [[Isla Mujeres]], the "Island of Women", also near Cancun. It opened for tours in August 2008. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-recycled-plastic-bottle-ecological-ar |title=Birthing of Floating Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader — Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new island was initially {{convert|20|m|ft}} in diameter and contained about 100,000 bottles. It has since expanded to 25 metres (82 ft) due to various plants and mangroves growing from the island.  The new island has three beaches, a house, two ponds, a wave-powered washing machine, solar panels, a solar-powered waterfall and river. The island is a constant work in progress with volunteers and Sowa himself continually making improvements.

In May 2011, Reishee embarked on a project to berth his island out in Isla Mujeres Bay, as it was now too big for its current site off a pier in Laguna Majax. The Mexican Government also recognized Joyxee Island as an "Eco Boat" and therefore needed to comply with all current boating regulations, which involved the purchase of fire extinguishers, life ring buoys and emergency kits. The project was launched on kickstarter.com with a goal of $18,000 that it failed to reach. Reishee later successfully relaunched the project with a more conservative $9,000 goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-of-recycled-plastic-bottle-eco-art-is |title=Grand Launch of Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Stalingrad''''' is an oil painting by the Danish artist [[Asger Jorn]] depicting the futility of war. Considered to be one of Denmark's artistic masterpieces, it was included in the 2006 [[Danish Culture Canon]]. The canvas, {{Convert|296 x 492|cm|abbr=on}}, now hangs in [[Museum Jorn, Silkeborg]].&lt;ref name="kulturkontakten"&gt;[http://kum.dk/Documents/Publikationer/2006/Kulturkontakten%202006/kulturkontakten_kulturkanon_2006.pdf "Stalingrad, 1957–1972, Asger Jorn (1914–1973)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029183615/http://kum.dk/Documents/Publikationer/2006/Kulturkontakten%202006/kulturkontakten_kulturkanon_2006.pdf |date=2013-10-29 }}, in Kulturkontacten 20, 2006. {{da icon}} Retrieved 11 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the 1950s, after a long and difficult period in hospital suffering from tuberculosis, Jorn had embarked on figurative painting hoping to establish himself at the European level. He often reacted against the works, overpainting the edges or the background. By 1956, he had set up a studio in the little Italian town of [[Albisola]] near [[Genoa]] where he began to compose a large painting he called ''La ritirata di Russia'' (The Retreat from Russia). The painting had been inspired by stories told by his friend Umberto Gambetta, who had fought with the Italians in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] (1942–1943) before spending years in Russian prisoner-of-war camps from which few survived. The canvas had detailed these events to such an extent that Gambetta referred to it as "my portrait". Jorn ensured that all such personal references were covered over so as to enhance the work's universal significance.&lt;ref name=fh&gt;[http://fondation-hermitage.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/presse/2012_jorn/JORN_Press_file.pdf Troels Andersen, translated by Peter Shield, "Asger Jorn — An Introduction"], Fondation Hermitage. Retrieved 11 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=museumjorn&gt;[http://www.museumjorn.dk/da/visning_af_vaerk.asp?AjrDcmntId=19 "Stalingrad, le non-lieu où le fou-rire du courage"], Museum Jorn. {{da icon}} Retrieved 11 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He then titled it ''Le fou rire'' (sometimes translated The Mad Laughter) and sent it off to Brussels where a collector had shown interest in a large painting by Jorn. In fact it was acquired by the restaurant owner Albert Niels who allowed Jorn to come and work on it further. It was also seen by the Dutch museum expert [[Willem Sandberg]] who arranged for it to be sent to the [[Century 21 Exposition|Seattle World Fair]] in 1961. In that connection, it was renamed ''Stalingrad''.&lt;ref name=museumjorn/&gt;

==Description==
Like [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', the painting addresses the horrors of war, in this case depicting the Battle of Stalingrad, one of the most notable events of the [[Second World War]]. Jorn's impression of warfare is conveyed above all in the process behind the painting. Indeed, his thick coating of colour is more of a process in its own right than a representation, revealing war as a phenomenon beyond man's understanding. Stalingrad could be seen as an enormous battlefield where all traces of mankind and civilisation were buried under layers of snow. An outline of a body or the suggestion of a face can perhaps be discerned but under the surface, the destruction and upheaval are already fading from memory. Jorn sees war as a tragedy of madness, completely devoid of heroism. Created at a time when mankind lived under the threat of nuclear war, the painting can be seen as the artist's personal expression of a world lamenting its own end.&lt;ref name=kulturkontakten/&gt;

==A long history==
The painting also expresses Jorn's own experiences and his fight for existence. He referred to it as a work he could continue to paint throughout his life. In the mid-1960s, he therefore bought it back, presenting it to the Silkeborg Museum in 1966. It was exhibited in Paris and Cuba before being hung in the old school which then served as the museum. It was there that Jorn would work on final adjustments, adding a few black dots representing houses in December 1972, shortly before he died.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;&lt;ref name=museumjorn/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2442">The '''Swedish National Archive of Recorded Sound and Moving Images''', in Swedish ''Statens ljud- och bildarkiv'', SLBA, was founded in 1979 (originally having the name ''Arkivet för ljud och bild,'' ALB) with the aim of collecting and preserving all film and recorded sound produced in [[Sweden]], including radio and television programs. The archive was an independent institution under the Ministry of Education, Research and Culture (utbildnings - och kulturdepartementet). It was located in [[Stockholm]] and employed 65 people. The last director general was Sven Allerstrand.

A national deposit law requires publishers to submit a copy of all new titles to the archive. The older collections are gradually built from donations and acquisitions, but suffer from the institution's youth. Other major sound and film archives in Sweden exist among private collectors and the national public broadcasting company [[Sveriges Radio]].

In April 2008, the Swedish government asked the [[National Library of Sweden]] to investigate and prepare for a merger between SLBA and the library by January 1, 2009.

== Migration ==
SLBA performed a mass-digitizing on parts of its collections, primarily focusing on public service material. Over a three-year period, an initial selection of 1.5 million hours of material were to be digitized and made available to researchers.

Most of the digitization process was automated. At full speed, 200 tapes per day, or 2,800 hours, were digitized by a staff of just five people. A number of relatively unconventional methods were being used, including the high-speed transfer of open-reel audiotapes, robotic automation of cassette-based audio and video transfer, and a suite of custom scripts that process the digitized files automatically.

The infrastructure includes a migration asset management system developed inhouse that handles such things as communication with production systems, logistics (of both original carriers and resultant files), and metadata input and transfer. Once the digitization process is completed, automatic functions create new carrier database records, insert metadata, direct the new archive and browsing files to their final mass storage locations, and link files to the MARC based database for direct access.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">[[Gara Garayev]]'s '''Symphony No. 3''' was composed in 1964. It was the last of the composer's three numbered symphonies and it marks a development from his two previous contributions to the genre, composed in the mid-1940s during his studies in the [[Leningrad Conservatory]] under [[Dmitri Shostakovich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.wanadoo.nl/ovar/karaev.htm List of works] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414004304/http://home.wanadoo.nl/ovar/karaev.htm |date=2006-04-14 }} in Onno van Rijen's Shostakovich &amp; other Soviet composers page&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first [[serialism|serial]] symphonies composed in the [[Soviet Union]], fusing the [[twelve-tone technique]] with [[Azerbaijan]]i [[folk music]] influences in the [[ashug]] tradition in the frame of a classical structure, attempting ''to find to new ways of artistic expression, new principles of form and construction, and, most notably, new means of expressive musical language'' and wanting to prove that ''strictly following the twelve-tone technique it is possible to  write [[musical nationalism|nationalistic music]], and not simply nationalistic, but specifically ashug'' according to the composer.&lt;ref&gt;Booklet notes by Anastasia Belina to the Russian Philharmonic - Yablonsky Naxos release, 8.570720&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony is scored for a [[chamber orchestra]] and it lasts c. 25 minutes, consisting of four movements:

# Allegro moderato
# Allegro vivace
# Andante
# Allegro

'''''The Slave Market''''' ({{Lang-fr|'''Le Marché d'esclaves'''}}) is an 1866 painting by the French artist [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. It depicts an unspecific Middle Eastern or North African setting where a man inspects the teeth of a nude, female slave.

The painting was bought by Adolphe Goupil on 23 August 1866 and exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1867. It was bought and sold several times until [[Robert Sterling Clark]] bought it in 1930. Since 1955 it is part of the [[Clark Art Institute]]'s collection.&lt;ref name="lees"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Lees|editor-first=Sarah|year=2012|url=http://media.clarkart.edu/1955.53_EuroCat.pdf|title=Nineteenth-Century European Paintings at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute|pp=359–360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Gérôme's ''[[The Snake Charmer]]'', ''The Slave Market'' has become an iconic example of 19th-century [[Orientalism|orientalist]] art.&lt;ref name="lees" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[Maxime Du Camp]], who had travelled extensively in the Near East, reviewed the painting from the 1867 Salon. He located the motif to Cairo's slave market and described the painting as "a scene done on the spot".&lt;ref name="lees" /&gt; Du Camp wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is one of these [more expensive] women, an Abyssinian, that M. Gérôme has taken as the principal figure of his composition. She is nude and being displayed by the djellab, who has the fine head of a brigand accustomed to every sort of abduction and violence; the idea of the eternal soul must not very often have tormented such a bandit. The poor girl is standing, submissive, humble, resigned, with a fatalistic passivity that the painter has very skillfully rendered.&lt;ref name="lees" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Gender and Sexuality ==
In an art historical context, [[Harem]] scenes depicted domestic spaces for the women in the Muslim societies, the males were only included in barbaric and sexual relations. This painting presents an unspecific Middle Eastern or North African setting in which a man inspects the teeth of a nude, female slave. Women were depicted with a passive sexuality, while the men were depicted as violent and disrespectful towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ali|first=Isra|year=2015|title=The harem fantasy in nineteenth-century Orientalist paintings|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|volume=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Treasure of Villena''' ({{lang-es|Tesoro de [[Villena]]}}) is one of the greatest [[hoard]] finds of [[gold]] of the European [[Bronze Age]]. It comprises 59 objects made of gold, [[silver]], [[iron]] and [[amber]] with a total weight of almost 10 kilos, 9 of them of 23.5 karat gold. This makes it the most important find of prehistoric gold in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and second in Europe, just behind that from the [[Grave Circle A, Mycenae|Royal Graves]] in [[Mycenae]], Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= [Spanish] Culture and Education Ministry|editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |date=26 February 2003|title= RESOLUCIÓN de 7 de enero de 2003, de la Dirección General de Patrimonio Artístico de la Consejería de Cultura y Educación, por la que se incoa expediente de declaración de bien de interés cultural a favor de la colección arqueológica del Tesoro de Villena.|trans-title=January 7, 2003, RESOLUTION of the General Direction on Artistic Heritage of the Culture and Education Council, which opens a file on the declaration as Good of Cultural Interest (BIC) the archaeologic collection known as Treasure of Villena|journal= [Spanish] State Official Bulletin (BOE)|volume= |series= |issue= 49|page= |pages= 7798–7802|publisher= Spanish Government|location= Madrid|issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2003/02/26/pdfs/A07798-07802.pdf|language= Spanish|format= pdf|accessdate= December 6, 2009|laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote= Desde el punto de vista histórico, artístico y arqueológico, el Tesoro de Villena constituye un «unicum», un depósito no normalizado, por su peso y contenido (A.

From a historic, artistic and archaeological point of view, the Treasure of Villena constitutes a "unicum", a non-normalised deposit, according to its weight and content (A. Perea). In fact, '''''it is the second most important golden tableware finding in Europe''''', after that of the Royal Graves in Mycenae in Greece (A. Mederos)|ref= |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gold pieces include eleven bowls, three bottles and 28 bracelets.

The iron pieces are the oldest found in the Iberian Peninsula and correspond to a stage in which iron was considered to be a [[precious metal]], and so was hoarded. The archaeologists estimate the date of this trove at c. 1000 BC.

The hoard was found in December 1963 by archaeologist [[José María Soler]] 5&amp;nbsp;km from [[Villena]], and since then has been the main attraction of Villena's Archaeological Museum. Its discovery was published in most of the Spanish media and also some abroad, mainly in France, Germany and the United States of America. It has been exhibited in [[Madrid]], [[Alicante]], [[Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto]], and now there are two sets of copies of the whole treasure to be shown in exhibitions while the originals are permanently conserved in an armoured showcase at Villena's Archaeological Museum.

The same type of metalwork is also found in the big [[Eberswalde Hoard]] that was discovered in [[Brandenburg]], Germany, in 1913.

A '''Tristimulus colorimeter''', colloquially shortened to colorimeter, is used in [[digital imaging]], to profile and calibrate output devices.
It takes a limited number of wideband spectral energy readings along the [[visible spectrum]] by using [[optical filter|filtered]] [[photodetector]]s; e.g. [[silicon photodiode]]s.&lt;ref name=schanda&gt;{{cite book|last=Schanda|first=János|author2=George Eppeldauer |author3=Georg Sauter |title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]]|date=2007|isbn=978-0-470-04904-4|chapter=Tristimulus Color Measurement of Self-Luminous Sources|doi=10.1002/9780470175637.ch6|editor=János Schanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A colorimeter with the known value of absolute error allows measuring (x,y)-chromaticity coordinates in red, green, blue and white colors. Measured values are used for calculation of LCD profile coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13462/metod_programmnoy_kompensaciitehnologicheskogo_razbrosa_koordinat_cvetnostizhidkokristallicheskih_paneley.htm|title=Method of software-based compensation of technological variation in chromaticity coordinates of LCD panels|author=Zharinov I.O., Zharinov O.O.|journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=3|pages=387–397|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, three glass filters whose [[transmittance]] spectra mimicked the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE]] [[color matching function]]s (shown below) were employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Photoelectric tristimulus colorimetry with three filters|journal=[[JOSA]]|first=Richard Sewall|last=Hunter|date=September 1942|volume=32|issue=9|pages=509–538| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-32-9-509|doi=10.1364/JOSA.32.000509}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[filter bank]] may be used to decompose the individual color matching functions if more accuracy is desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/103/6/j36epp.pdf|format=PDF|title=Spectral Response Based Calibration Method of Tristimulus Colorimeters|first=George|last=Eppeldauer|journal=Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology|volume=103|issue=6|date=Nov–Dec 1998|pages=615–619|doi=10.6028/jres.103.040|pmid=28009362|pmc=4890952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A camera or colorimeter is said to be ''colorimetric'' if it satisfies the {{Interlanguage link multi|Luther condition|de|3=Luther-Bedingung}} by {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Thomas Dietrich Luther{{!}}Robert Luther|de|3=Robert Thomas Dietrich Luther}} (1868–1945)&lt;!-- 1868-01-02 (21.

A colorimeter or a digital camera with a [[color filter array]] can, under certain conditions, be used as an alternative to a [[spectrophotometer]].&lt;ref name=Imai1999&gt;{{cite journal | author = Imai, Francisco H. |author2=Berns, Roy S.  | date = 1999 | title = Spectral estimation using trichromatic digital cameras | journal = Proceedings of the International Symposium on Multispectral Imaging and Color Reproduction for Digital Archives | volume = 42 | url = http://www.cis.rit.edu/research/mcsl2/online/Spectral/TechnicalPapers/SpecEstimRGBCamera_Chiba99.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solli2004&gt;{{cite journal | last = Solli | first = Martin |date=16 December 2004 | title = Filter characterization in digital cameras | url = http://www.diva-portal.org/diva/getDocument?urn_nbn_se_liu_diva-2667-1__fulltext.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[standard illuminant|illuminant]] and [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE standard observer|observer conditions]] should be specified when citing a measurement (e.g. [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]]/10°).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oEsZiCt5VOAC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=%22tristimulus+colorimeter%22+OR+spectrocolorimeter#PPA41,M1|title=The Colour Image Processing Handbook|first=Stephen J.|last=Sangwine|author2=Horne |author3=Robin E.

 |Title= Who Is Under the Gunn?
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|1|16}}
 |ShortSummary= In the premiere of the show, Tim Gunn introduces the three mentors to a group of 15 designers. He separates the designers into 2 groups- group one with 8 and the group two with 7. He announces that 3 designers will be eliminates, and that the second group will not be participating in the first challenge. The first group is led into the workroom and given a bag of 6 3-yard pieces of fabric that they have 6 hours to make an outfit that shows their design aesthetics. After the runway, the mentors take turns to pick out their team. Designers who are chosen by more than one mentor are given the opportunity to choose their mentor. Nick becomes disheartened when it appears that he is unpopular with the designers.

'''First selection:''' Michelle 
'''Selecting Mentors:''' Mondo, Anya, Nick

'''Fifth Selection:''' Brady

'''Selected Mentor:''' Anya

'''Sixth Selection:''' Oscar
'''Selection Mentor:''' Nick
'''Selected Mentor:''' Nick (''uncontested'')

This leaves Melissa and Natalia in the bottom two; the mentors bemoan the simplicity of Melissa's look, and raise doubts about Natalia's taste and time management. However, after a tearful appeal to the judges, both Nick and Mondo invite Natalia to be on their teams. Citing construction concerns, she ultimately chooses Nick, to his delight.

 |Title= The Mentor Face Off
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|1|23}}
 |ShortSummary= The second group is given 30 seconds to pick out as much fabric as they want from drums scattered around the FIDM courtyard and given 6 hours to create a look that represents their aesthetic. Cognizant of the fact that there are fewer open positions for their group, several of the designers "up their game," creating a more competitive playing field for the mentors.

'''First selection:''' Sam 
'''Selecting Mentors:''' Mondo, Anya, Nick
'''Selected Mentor:''' Mondo

This leaves one spot on Nick's team open. Stephanie, Amy, and Rey plead their cases to Nick, but ultimately Nick states that his mind was already made up, and chooses Stephanie for his final mentee, leaving a disappointed Amy and a somewhat aggravated Rey to be eliminated.

 |ShortSummary= Tim takes the designers and mentors for a bus tour around hollywood to inspire the designers to come up with a red carpet look, with Zanna Roberts Rassi citing that the winning look would be worn by a celebrity in a future publication of ''Marie Claire''. As Tim analyzes the mentors, he finds himself stepping in to stop Nick from getting too hands-on with his designers. During the runway critique, Sam's outfit stands out for approaching red carpet clothing from a different direction and he is awarded the win; conversely, Camila is sent home for keeping her look too plain.

She sets the designers with the task of making an outfit using vampire-related materials, which the designers have to run and collect from a in a graveyard-setting in the FIDM courtyard. Despite landing in the bottom two the previous week, Michelle is awarded the win over Asha for this challenge,  while Anya is given the task of choosing between Brady and Nicholas as the losing designer. Ultimately, she decides that Nicholas has more potential, and sends Brady home.

 |ShortSummary= The designers must create a performance look for Zendaya to wear onstage while on tour. The designers seem to struggle with this challenge, and during the runway critique, seven designs are critiqued, with only Shan and Asha landing on top, while Nick's entire group (Stephanie, Oscar, Natalia, and Isabelle) and Blake end up on the bottom. Despite an overwhelming consensus from the judges that seems to point to Isabelle's elimination, Nick figuratively throws her under the bus after being unable to successfully help her manage her time, which causes concern amongst his remaining designers. Zendaya--tasked with choosing the winning designer--clearly heavily favors Asha's design, and awards her the win.

 |ShortSummary=  The first team challenge requires the designers to create mini collections of 3 cohesive pieces, inspired by the Getty Villa and the movie, Pompeii. Nick's team has a shaky start, and seems unable to reach common ground. Oscar takes over the group in order to turn things around, and Nick's group ultimately ends up winning the challenge, with Oscar being cited as the clear winner in his group. Mondo's team is safe, while Anya's team is declared the losing team. Blake's outfit is praised by the judges, which leaves Shan and Nicholas up for elimination. Ultimately neither designer is eliminated due to their "potential."

Tensions run high between Anya and Nicholas because of his consecutive bad performances, whereas Shan has upped his game after his near elimination. Shan wins the challenge, and Anya is yet again given the task between sending Blake or Nicholas home. Apparently learning from her mistake the first time, she chooses Blake to stay.

Frustrated with being safe since his initial win, Sam seems to struggle with his look, whereas Oscar has difficultly settling on a design for the challenge. Tim criticizes him for relying too much on the mentor critique to drive his design choices. After the runway, Mondo is given the responsibility of awarding the win to either Sam or Asha, ultimately choosing Sam for overcoming his frustrations with the challenge, and sticking to his design aesthetic. Sam is also awarded a bonus prize for creating the look that best matched the mood of the California beach party challenge. Even though Michelle is harshly criticized for making a cocktail waitress outfit and not utilizing enough unconventional materials, it's Stephanie who is sent home for yet again failing to deliver a compelling runway look.

 |Title= Crossing Teams
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|3|20}}
 |ShortSummary=   The designers are placed in pairs across mentor groups to create a 3 look mini collection to be manufactured and sold at Francesca's. Shan and Oscar, Blake and Sam, and Natalia and Asha are paired up for this challenge. Asha is noticeably unhappy about the proposition of working with the unpredictable Natalia, and the two butt heads when Natalia seems to be wasting time. The mentors collaborate on their critiques, with Nick and Mondo seemingly disagreeing over the direction of the Asha/Natalia pairing. Several of the designers provide interviews saying that Natalia is faking her incessant emotional outbursts.

Oscar, Shan, Sam, and Blake are in contention for the win, with both Shan and Oscar being chosen as the winner. Asha and Natalia both give tearful speeches after being asked which of them should be sent home, and though neither of them actually give a clear answer, Natalia insinuates that she wouldn't want Asha to feel as though she was being sent home for something Natalia did. Ultimately, Natalia is eliminated for her poor construction.

 |Title= The Benefit of Fashion
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|3|27}}
 |ShortSummary=   The designers are paired with clients who have specific fashion needs, and are tasked with giving them makeovers.

'''Oscar:''' Dani has to shop in the children's sections of stores due to her petite stature, and is in need of a more age appropriate wardrobe.
'''Shan:''' Brittany is a single mom looking for exciting date look to break up the monotony of her day wear.
'''Blake:''' Ruzena is looking to have her tomboyish image more feminized.
'''Sam:''' Norah is looking for something that she can wear from the office to the bar.
'''Asha:''' Erin is looking for a birthday outfit that celebrate her recent 50lb weight loss.

All of the designers seemingly struggle in this challenge--Asha frets that the judges will send her home for the most minor issue after the previous week, while Sam is criticized for his poor fabric choices. Shan's client has an allergic reaction to sequins, and he has to make a dress for her in the two hours before the runway show. On the runway, Oscar is criticized for making Dani look old, whereas Sam and Blake both struggle to give their clients interesting designs. Asha is praised for making Erin glow with happiness, while Shan is credited with his think quick design, and is awarded the win and a bonus prize for his resourcefulness.

 |Title= Superhero Fashion
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|4|3}}
 |ShortSummary=   The designers are tasked with creating looks inspired by the attributes of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] Superheroes. Sam becomes emotional after he connects Hawkeye's story to his struggles as a young gay teen, and shares that his mother accidentally prevented him from committing suicide, which he had never told her. Despite this emotional breakthrough, he and Asha are put up for elimination, both of whom seem sad to be losing their best friend right before the finale. However, in a twist, both designers from Mondo's team are put through to the finale, to the distaste of the other designers and mentors.

 |Title= Finale
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|4|10}}
 |ShortSummary=   The designers must create their collections in three days. The winning designer and mentor are chosen.

'''Sam's Collection:''' Inspired by the armor people build up to protect themselves, and how his armor crumbled during the competition.
'''Asha's Collection:''' Inspired by "Coming to America" and the idea of Queen Nefertiti in Harlem.
'''Oscar's Collection:" Inspiration unclear; seems to be inspired by Cuba and women giving life. Recycles past designs.
'''Shan's Collection:''' Inspired by the dichotomy of hard and soft, using leather and lace.

In the workroom, Nick is surprised at how directional Sam's collection is turning out, while Sam declares Asha his biggest competition. During critique, Mondo challenges both Asha and Sam to make their designs less costumey. Shan struggles to come up with a cohesive statement, and Oscar is reprimanded for repeating past looks.

On the runway, Sam is lauded for his ability to create a cohesive, salable collection out of highly disparate fabric choices but criticized for not creating more of a show. Asha is told her collection is "next level" by the sitting judges, who appreciate her growth in the competition; however Neil and Heidi find it to be too costumey. Oscar is praised by the guest judges for a gorgeously made collection, but the main judges are disappointed at how many of his looks are disappointing remakes. The judges' disappointment in Shan's collection is palpable, with Jen Rade looking nearly in tears.

The judges debate the criteria of who should win the challenge, and Tim has to reiterate the nature of the challenge itself. Shan is left out of the conversation while Asha, Oscar, and Sam are thrown around as potential winners. Ultimately, the decision comes down to Oscar and Sam, and the former is declared the winner of Under the Gunn.
