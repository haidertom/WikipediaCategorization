'''Albert Kahn Associates''' is an architectural design firm in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] with a second office located in Miami, Florida. It was established in 1895 and is still active today. Recent work includes being awarded third place in the [https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/3DPHab/five-teams-win-a-share-of-100000-in-virtual-modeling-stage Virtual Modeling Stage of NASA’s 3D-Printed Habitat Competition] (as of July 2018) for their work on martian habitats, and also creating the world's largest penguin conservation center, [https://penguins.detroitzoo.org/ Polk Penguin Conservation Center]. In earlier years, It introduced a new technology in industrial building involving a unique reinforced concrete method referred to as the [[Kahn System]] of construction using proprietary patented reinforcement steel manufactured by [[Trussed Concrete Steel Company]]. The building of automobile factories and other types of factories were revolutionized from wooden [[timber framing]] construction. Besides being an advanced technology in strength that led to wider open interior spaces, it featured a high degree of fire resistance and larger window space for light. The firm started by [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]] built factories for Chrysler for over a decade, Ford Automobile for 30 years and Packard Automobile for 35 years. Other important clients of the firm were Republic Steel and General Motors. The firm was awarded a $40 million contract to build a tractor factory in Russia in 1928. The firm's output was over a million dollars worth of work per week by 1929. By 1939, the firm designed 19 percent of all industrial buildings in the United States and had designed some $800&amp;nbsp;million of buildings worldwide.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|pp=15-18}} 

==History==
[[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]] established the Detroit firm in 1895 and was its first and only employee then.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=24}} In 1896, Kahn took on two partners: George Nettleton and Alexander Trowbridge.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=30}} All three were architects at the time with the architectural firm [[George D. Mason|Mason &amp; Rice]] in Detroit. The firm they opened in January 1896 was initially called "Nettleton, Kahn, and Trowbridge".{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=30}} At the time there was an abundance of design jobs available. Mason &amp; Rice even referred some of their work to Kahn's new firm when they had more than they could handle.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=40}}

The firm's first large design job in Detroit was to design [[Children's Hospital of Michigan|Children's Hospital]] of Michigan.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=40}} Its next major project came in 1898 from [[James E. Scripps]] to design an elaborate library with an art gallery. The Scripps Library and Museum was located adjacent to Scripps' mansion home on Trumbull Avenue at Grand River Avenue.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=41}} The dynamics of the firm changed when Trowbridge took a position at Cornell University in 1897 and Nettleton died in 1900. The firm then hired designers with good reputations and an ability to work as a team with other designers. Ernest Wilby, a young Englishman from Canada, was their key designer working for the firm at the time.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=151}} This new team then collaborated with the Mason &amp; Rice architectural firm to design the [[Palms Apartments]], a building with English architecture on Jefferson Avenue at Rivard Street in Detroit. It was one of the first buildings to use [[reinforced concrete]] as a major construction material.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=42}}

The firm changed its name in 1901 to "Albert Kahn, architect; Ernest Wilby, associate",{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=43}} and had its first industrial design the same year. [[Joseph Boyer]] had hired the firm to design a factory that made [[pneumatic tool]]s.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=45}} Boyer then asked the firm to design a building to house the Burroughs Adding Machine Company, where modern mechanical calculators were made.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=45}} Boyer in 1902 introduced Kahn to [[Henry Bourne Joy|Henry Joy]], head of the [[Packard Motor Car]] company.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca3300/ca3339/data/ca3339data.pdf |title=Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park, Ford Assembly Plant No. CA-326-H |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1968 |website=Library of Congress Prints &amp; Photographs Online |publisher=Historic American Engineering Record, National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior |accessdate=2014-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810130804/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca3300/ca3339/data/ca3339data.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahn's firm received several non-industrial jobs from Joy, including remodeling Joy's home.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt;{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}} Joy additionally had the firm design automobile factory buildings.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt;{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}}

Between 1903–05, the firm designed the first nine [[Packard Automotive Plant|Packard Automotive Plant buildings]] using traditional wooden designs that had spans no longer than {{convert|14|ft|m|1}}.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|pp=28-29}} Packard produced over 700 automobiles a year by 1905, so an expansion to the factory facility was in order. The team decided to use reinforced concrete to build the new factory space.{{sfn|Atlas|1907|p=131}} With Albert's younger brother [[Julius Kahn (inventor)|Julius]] as the key architect and engineer, Building Number 10 was constructed with the [[Kahn System|Kahn bar]] and other [[Hy-Rib|reinforced concrete products]]. These were manufactured at the Trussed Concrete Steel Company (aka "Truscon"), which provided {{convert|32|ft|m|1|adj=on}} spans.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}}&lt;ref name=SedlarReport&gt;{{cite web |url= http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/98436/Sedlar_Engineering_Industrial_Architecture.pdf?sequence=1 |title= Engineering Industrial Architecture / The Trussed Concrete Steel Company and Albert Kahn|last1=Sedlar  |first1=Frank |last2= |first2= |date=April 23, 2013 |website=U of M Library |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=2014-07-30}} "The Packard #10 building was the first to utilize reinforced concrete with Julius Kahn's Kahn Bar but also as previously discussed, the full range of steel building products from the Trussed Concrete Steel Company."&lt;/ref&gt; This new technology for concrete changed the way American automobile factories were built.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt;{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}} This building was built with uniquely designed steel beam reinforced concrete for reinforcement that used the Kahn bar with winged tabs on the steel bar edges that were bent back at 45 degrees to resist and counter tension stresses.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}}&lt;ref name=SedlarReport/&gt;{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=29}} This was the first time reinforced concrete was used for automobile factory construction in the United States.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}}{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=31 "Thus Plant Number Ten represented a clear advance in factory construction for Packard and for the automobile industry in general, as it was the first automobile plant to be built of reinforced concrete"}}{{sfn|Nelson|1939|p=17 "The Packard job was the first reinforced concrete factory in America, and for the first time an industrialist got a plant in which fenestration was reasonably adequate and production departments were coordinated with an eye to efficiency'"}} The new [[state of the art]] design concept featured larger open interior spaces than the old mill-framed wooden factory buildings.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=51}} The building was 322 feet long by 60 feet wide (about 98 meters by 18 meters).{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}} This new factory concept of building with reinforced concrete lead to Albert Kahn Associates doing all the aviation factories for the government during World War I.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|p=17 ''By the time America entered the war the office was large enough to take over all of the government's aviation work''}}

In 1906, the firm designed factory buildings for the [[Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company]] in [[Buffalo, New York]].{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=37-49}} In 1908 the [[Highland Park Ford Plant]] was designed by the firm.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=37}} It was similar to the Packard factory just a few miles away, however different from the Pierce-Arrow factory buildings that were of one-story only and had saw-tooth roofs with [[skylights]]. The Ford factory building had four stories.
It was however, of reinforced concrete design using the patented Kahn System of his brother Julius, just like the Packard and Pierce-Arrow factory buildings. The Ford plant was 860 feet long and 75 feet wide.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt; The steel reinforced concrete building designs were fireproof.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt; The "Model factory" featured what was referred to as Truscon's "Daylight System" because of the many large windows.{{sfn|Skinner|1997|p=15}}

Henry Ford had the firm design his [[River Rouge Plant|River Rouge automobile factory]] that started construction in 1917.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=50}} At the time Ford decided to make a ship factory for the United States Navy and had the firm design B Building.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=50}} This was called the Eagle Plant because it built [[Eagle Boats]] that were antisubmarine chasers that destroyed German submarines.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=59}} It was 100 feet (30 meters) high by 300 feet (91 meters) wide by 1700 feet (518 meters) long.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=50}} When World War I ended this factory plant was converted to make Ford automobiles.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=59}}

The firm designed over 50 factories between 1921 and 1929 and had a substantial quantity of work not related to industrial buildings. It had over 400 on the staff by 1930 and was producing a million dollars worth of construction a week.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=126}} The firm never hired an architectural college graduate until 1935.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt;{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=126}} Going into the twenty-first century the firm name is Albert Kahn Associates and has branches in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and [[São Paulo|São Paulo, Brasil]].&lt;ref name=KahnWebsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albertkahn.com/where.php |title=About Kahn:Where |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2014|website=Albert Kahn, family of companies  |publisher=Albert Kahn Associates |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm designed about two thousand structures between 1895 and 1945 of which twenty-six were buildings for the University of Michigan.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=24, 151}}

== Organizational layout ==

The firm had a staff of 300–400 people in the 1930s, including about 40 secretaries, stenographers, typists, and file clerks. There were around 175 architectural designers and draftsmen, 80–90 mechanical and electrical engineers, 40–50 field superintendents, and about 30 specification writers.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|p=19}} The chief administrator was Albert Kahn and his assistants were his brothers Julius, Moritz and Louis.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|p=21}}  The staff was increased to 600 people at the time of World War II. The firm ramped up for war plants to make tanks and other war related equipment.{{sfn|Ferry|1970|p=25}}

[[File:Kahn firm layout 1939.jpg|1000px|center|Albert Kahn Associates firm layout in 1939]] 
The Technical Division had departments that designed the projects which included electrical, plumbing, heating and air-conditioning.
This division was responsible for the functional design of the building. Key important design elements for factories included  "straight-line" production capability, flexibility in interior floor designs to accommodate various changing production methods, generous column spacing to give maximum open floor space, high ceilings, strong floors to carry heavy loads, and with good lighting and ventilation.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|pp=19, 20, 24}}

The Executive Division was responsible for the management of the projects. Business-like management was required for concerns of economics, speed, obtaining reliable sub-contractors, adequate supervision, and complete accurate drawings.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|pp=20, 21, 24}}

'''The Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers (AIAMC)''' is an American national membership organization of approximately 70 major [[Academic health science centre|academic medical centers]] and health systems committed to quality [[patient care]], [[medical education]] and [[research]].  AIAMC members regard medical education and research as strategic assets in providing [[patient-centered care]]; operate independently of [[medical school]] ownership or governance while maintaining major medical school affiliations; care for a patient population that mirrors their local communities; and provide teaching and research that is innovative, applicable to practice and community responsive.

==History ==
The AIAMC was formed in 1989 to provide a forum for those institutions whose governance and academic leadership were distinct from that of their associated medical schools.  Since that time, the organization’s prestige and influence have grown progressively.&lt;ref&gt;Medical Meetings. [http://meetingsnet.com/medicalmeetings/news/3-ways-aiamc-changed-up-its-annual-conference-0419/.] "3 Ways AIAMC Changed Up Its Annual Conference."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is considered a national resource, with Alliance members participating in leadership and governance roles in key groups as the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]], [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education|ACCME]], [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]], [[American Hospital Association|AHA]], [[American Medical Association|AMA]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;AIAMC. [http://www.aiamc.org/history.php AIAMC History.] "AIAMC."&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Initiative to Improve Patient Care through Graduate Medical Education ==
===National Initiative I===
In early 2007, the Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers (AIAMC) launched Improving Patient Care through Graduate Medical Education: A National Initiative of Independent Academic Medical Centers. Nineteen AIAMC-member institutions participated in this charter effort. The National Initiative (NI) featured five meetings over the course of 18 months which served as touchstones for ongoing quality improvement in AIAMC participating organizations. These meetings, as well as the monthly collaborative calls held in-between, provided structure, discussion and networking opportunities around specific quality improvement initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;ACGME. [http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/bulletin/bulletin11_07.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928070626/http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/bulletin/bulletin11_07.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} ''ACGME Bulletin.'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This 18-month "NI-I" was supported by a grant from the foundation of [[HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education]], an AIAMC member institution located in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;AIAMC. [http://www.aiamc.org/ni-overview.php National Initiative Overview.] ''AIAMC.''&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was led by Carl Patow, MD, Executive Director of HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education. 

As a result of these efforts, AIAMC has initial findings that demonstrate the efficacy of integrating GME into patient safety and quality improvement initiatives. These findings have been organized into a series of articles that were published in the December 2009 issue of Academic Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1749–56 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181bf686f |title=Integrating Quality Improvement and Residency Education: Insights from the AIAMC National Initiative About the Roles of the Designated Institutional Official and Program Director |year=2009 |last1=Jenson |first1=Hal B. |last2=Dorner |first2=Douglas |last3=Hinchey |first3=Kevin |last4=Ankel |first4=Felix |last5=Goldman |first5=Stuart |last6=Patow |first6=Carl |journal=Academic Medicine |volume=84 |issue=12 |pmid=19940584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Initiative II===
In 2009, AIAMC launched the second National Initiative and expanded participation to 35 AIAMC-member teaching hospitals from Seattle to Maine.  Each participating hospital developed a quality improvement team led by a resident or faculty member, and included their respective quality improvement leader. These teams met four times and participated in monthly conference calls over an 18-month period. Quality improvement projects focused on the following areas: Communication, Hand Offs, Infection Control, Readmissions and Transitions of Care. The objectives of this second phase were: 
* to align and integrate academic programs with quality initiatives to accelerate the efforts of quality and patient safety;
* assist residency program directors and house staff in the teaching, learning and assessment of the core competencies focused on Practice-Based Learning and Systems Based Practice;
* inform hospital and policy leaders about the contributions that can be made by faculty and house staff in expediting patient safety; and
* integrate house staff into multidisciplinary team-based safety initiatives as a national priority.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Harris. [https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/feb11/174758/residents_quality_improvement.html] "Residents Help Drive Quality Improvement". 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Initiative III===
National Initiative III launched in the fall of 2011, and will directly address the ACGME Common Program Requirements for Professionalism, Personal Responsibility and Patient Safety by educating program directors, faculty members and residents in a train-the-trainer approach. The structure and content of NI III will also meet directives for Teamwork by providing training in effective communication as part of inter-professional teams. The structure of the National Initiative III will resemble the previous two initiatives, with quarterly meetings for quality improvement didactics and leadership training, conference calls to assess progress, and local hospital team initiatives to improve patient care.

===National Initiative IV===
The fourth National Initiative recognized the importance of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education initiative entitled the "Clinical Learning Environment Review".  Teams from over 35 teaching hospitals across the United States participated in a two year learning collaborative to improve performance in six focus areas: patient safety, quality imrpvoement, transitions of care, supervision, fatigue management and professionalism. 

===National Initiative V===
National Initiative V began in 2015, and focused on the role of teaching hospitals' response to health care disparities. Findings from the National Initiatives are published in the Oschner Journal.

[[File:Arching action in laterally restrained slab.svg|thumb|Idealisation of arching action forces in laterally restrained slab]]
'''Arching or compressive membrane action (CMA) in reinforced concrete slabs''' occurs as a result of the great difference between the [[tensile]] and [[compressive strength]] of concrete.  Cracking of the concrete causes a migration of the neutral axis which is accompanied by in-plane expansion of the slab at its boundaries.  If this natural tendency to expand is restrained, the development of arching action enhances the strength of the slab. 
The term arching action is normally used to describe the arching phenomenon in one-way spanning slabs and compressive membrane action is normally used to describe the arching phenomenon in two-way spanning slabs.

== Background ==
[[File:Arching action in bridge deck slab.png|thumb|Arching action forces in beam and slab bridge deck]]
The strength enhancing effects of arching action in [[reinforced concrete]] floors were first recognised near the beginning of last century.&lt;ref&gt;Westergaard, H.M. and Slater, W.A., ' Moments and stresses in slabs', Proceedings of the American Concrete Institute, 1921, Vol. 17, pp 415–538.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the full scale destructive load tests by Ockleston&lt;ref&gt;Ockleston, A.J., 'Load tests on a three-storey building in Johannesburg', The Structural Engineer, 1955, Vol. 33, October, pp 304–322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ockleston, A.J., 'Arching action in reinforced concrete slabs', The Structural Engineer, 1958, Vol. 36, No.6, pp 197–201.&lt;/ref&gt; on the Old Dental Hospital in [[Johannesburg]] that the extent of strength enhancement caused by arching action was really appreciated.  In these tests, collapse loads of between 3 and 4 times those predicted by yield-line theory&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, K.W., 'Brudlinieteorier', Jul. Gjellerups Forlag, Copenhagen, 1943, 191pp (Yieldline theory', translated by Cement &amp; Concrete Association, London, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; were obtained.
[[File:Arching action strength enhancement.png|thumb|Arching action (CMA) strength enhancement in laterally restrained slab strip]]

== Approaches to treatment of arching action (CMA) ==
Since the 1950s there have been several attempts to develop theories for arching action in both one and two-way slabs.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, R.H., 'Plastic and elastic design of slabs and plates', Thames and Hudson, London, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, K.P., 'The effect of membrane stresses on the ultimate strength of an interior panel in a reinforced concrete slab', The Structural Engineer, 1963, Vol. 41, No. 8, pp 261–265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leibenberg, A.C., 'Arch action in concrete slabs', National Building Research Institute Bulletin, 1966, No. 40. CSIR Research Report No. 234, Pretoria, S. Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the principal approaches to membrane action was that due to Park&lt;ref&gt;Park, R., 'Ultimate strength of rectangular concrete slabs under short-term uniform loading with edges restrained against lateral movement', Proceedings Instn. Civ. Engrs, Vol.28, June 1964, pp. 125–150.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been used as a basis for many studies into arching action in slabs.  Park's approach was based on rigid plastic slab strip theory, and required the assumption of a critical deflection of one half of the slab depth at failure.  Park's approach was later extended by Park and Gamble&lt;ref&gt;Park, R. and Gamble, W.L., 'Reinforced concrete slabs', Wiley Interscience, New York, 1980, pp 562–612.&lt;/ref&gt; in their method for predicting the plastic load-deformation response of laterally restrained slabs.

In 1971, the [[American Concrete Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;American Concrete Institute, 'Cracking, deflection and ultimate load of concrete slab systems', SP-30, Detroit, 1971, 382 pp.
&lt;/ref&gt; produced a special publication which presented the most recent research, to that time, on arching and compressive membrane action in reinforced concrete slabs.

A comprehensive review of the literature and studies of both rigid-plastic and elastic-plastic approaches to arching have been compiled by Braestrup&lt;ref&gt;Braestrup, M.W., 'Dome effect in reinforced concrete slabs: rigid-plastic analysis’, J. Struct. Div., Proc Am. Soc. Civ. Engrs, 1980, Vol 106, No. ST6, pp 1237–1253.&lt;/ref&gt; and Braestrup and Morley.&lt;ref&gt;Braestrup, M.W. and Morley, C.T., ‘Dome effect in reinforced concrete slabs: elastic-plastic analysis’, J. Struct. Div., Proc Am. Soc. Civ. Engrs, 1980, Vol 106, No. ST6, pp 1255–1262.&lt;/ref&gt; Lahlouh and Waldron&lt;ref&gt;Lahlouh, E.H. and Waldron, P., ‘Membrane action in one-way slab strips’, Proc. Instn. Civ. Engrs, Structs &amp; Bldgs, 1992, Vol 94, Nov., pp 419–428.&lt;/ref&gt; were some of the earliest researchers to achieve a degree of success in finite element modelling of the phenomenon.  In 1993, Kuang and Morley&lt;ref&gt;Kuang, J. S. and Morley, C. T., ‘A plasticity model for the punching shear of laterally restrained concrete slabs with compressive membrane action’, International Journal of Science, Vol. 35, No. 5, 1993, pp 371–385.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a plasticity approach which included the effect of compressive membrane action on the punching shear strength of laterally restrained concrete slabs.

== United Kingdom approach to CMA in bridge deck design==
In the United Kingdom, the method developed by Kirkpatrick, Rankin &amp; Long&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Rankin Long"&gt;Kirkpatrick, J., Rankin, G.I.B. and Long, A.E.,  'Strength evaluation of M-beam bridge deck slabs',  The Structural Engineer, Vol. 62B, No 3, Sept 1984, pp 60–68.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1984 and substantiated by testing a full-scale bridge in 1986&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, J., Rankin, G.I.B. and Long, A.E.,  'The influence of compressive membrane action on the serviceability of beam and slab bridge decks', The Structural Engineer, Vol. 64B, No 1, March 1986, pp 6–9 and 12.&lt;/ref&gt; first led to the introduction of new rules for the economic design of reinforced concrete beam and slab bridge decks in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland, 'Design of M-beam bridge decks', Amendment No. 3 to the Bridge Design Code, Northern Ireland Roads Service Headquarters, March 1986, 11.1–11.5.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and method were later incorporated, by the United Kingdom [[Highways Agency]], into the UK design manual for roads and bridges, BD 81/02, 'Use of Compressive Membrane Action in Bridge Decks'.&lt;ref name = "BD81/02"&gt;United Kingdom Highways Agency, 'Use of compressive membrane action in bridge decks', Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, Vol. 3, Section 4, Part 20, BD 81/02, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of this CMA methodology normally results in substantial savings in reinforcement in the slab of a beam and slab bridge deck, provided certain limitations and boundary conditions are satisfied.

[[File:Bridge deck - punching failure top cracking.png|thumb|Top surface crack pattern of punching failure zone in model bridge deck test&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"&gt;Kirkpatrick, J., 'An analytical field and model study of M-beam bridge decks', PhD Thesis, Dept of Civil Engineering, Queen's University of Belfast, 1982, 330 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Bridge deck - punching failure bottom cracking.png|thumb|Bottom surface crack pattern of punching failure zone in model bridge deck test&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick" /&gt;]]

Kirkpatrick, Rankin &amp; Long's&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Rankin Long" /&gt; approach to the prediction of the enhanced punching strength of bridge deck slabs was based on the punching shear prediction equation derived by Long&lt;ref&gt;Long, A.E., 'A two-phase approach to the prediction of the punching strength of slabs', Journal of the American Concrete Institute, Proceedings, Vol.72, No.2, February 1975, pp 37–45.&lt;/ref&gt; for the shear mode of punching failure, combined with an effective reinforcement ratio, which represented the arching action strength enhancement. The effective reinforcement ratio was determined from the maximum arching moment of resistance in a rigidly restrained concrete slab, which Rankin&lt;ref name="Rankin"&gt;Rankin, G.I.B.,  'Punching failure and compressive membrane action in reinforced concrete slabs', PhD Thesis, Dept of Civil Engineering, Queen's University of Belfast, 1982, 334 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; had derived for laterally restrained concrete slabs from McDowell, McKee and Sevin's&lt;ref&gt;McDowell. E.L., McKee, K.E. and Sevin. E. 'Arching action theory of masonry walls', Journal of the Structural Division, Proceedings, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1956, 82, No. ST2, 915-1–915-18.&lt;/ref&gt; arching action deformation theory for masonry walls.  The derivation of the maximum arching moment of resistance of laterally restrained concrete bridge deck slabs utilised Rankin's&lt;ref name="Rankin" /&gt; idealised elastic-plastic stress-strain criterion for concrete, valid for concrete cylinder strengths up to at least 70N/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which he had derived on the basis of Hognestad, Hanson and McHenry's&lt;ref&gt;Hognestad, E, Hanson, N.W. and McHenry, D., 'Concrete stress distribution in ultimate strength design', Journal of the American Concrete Institute, Proceedings, Vol.52, No.6, December 1955, pp 455–479.&lt;/ref&gt; ultimate parabolic stress block coefficients for concrete.
The adaptation of Kirkpatrick, Rankin &amp; Long's&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Rankin Long" /&gt; punching strength prediction method for laterally restrained bridge deck slabs, given in BD 81/02,&lt;ref name="BD81/02" /&gt; is summarised as follows:

The concrete equivalent cylinder strength, &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{c}} &lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f_{\text{c}} = \frac{  0.8f_{\text{cu}}  } {\gamma_{\text{m}} }&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 1}}}}

The plastic strain value, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\text{c}} &lt;/math&gt;, of an idealised elastic-plastic concrete is given by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\text{c}} = { \left( -400+60f_{\text{c}}-0.33f_{\text{c}} ^2\right) x 10^{-6}} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 2}}}}

The non-dimensional parameter, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, for the arching moment of resistance is given by:
  
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{  \varepsilon_{\text{c}} L_{\text{r}} ^2 } {h^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 3}}}}

In order to treat the slab as restrained, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; must be less than 0.26.  If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 0.26, the deck slab shall be treated as if it were unrestrained.

The non-dimensional arching moment coefficient, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;k = { 0.0525\left( 4.3-16.1\sqrt{3.3 x 10^{-4} +0.1243R}\right) } &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 4}}}}

The effective reinforcement ratio, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\text{e}}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{\text{e}} = k\left [ \frac{f_{\text{c}}  }{240} \right ] \left [ \frac{h}{d} \right ]^2 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 5}}}}

The predicted ultimate punching load for a single wheel, &lt;math&gt;P_{\text{ps}}&lt;/math&gt; (N), is given by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P_{\text{ps}}  = { 1.52\left( \phi+d\right)d\sqrt{f_{\text{c}} }\left(100\rho_{\text{e}} \right)^{0.25} } &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 6}}}}

where:

* &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; = average effective depth to tensile reinforcement (mm)
* &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{cu}}&lt;/math&gt; = characteristic concrete cube strength (N/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; = overall slab depth (mm)
* &lt;math&gt;L_{\text{r}}&lt;/math&gt; = half span of slab strip with boundary restraint (mm)
* &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; = diameter of loaded area (mm)
* &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\text{m}} &lt;/math&gt; = partial safety factor for strength

Further details on the derivation of the method and how to deal with situations of less than rigid lateral restraint are given by Rankin&lt;ref name="Rankin" /&gt; and Rankin &amp; Long.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, G.I.B. and Long, A.E. (1997), ‘Arching action strength enhancement in laterally restrained slab strips’, Proc. Instn. Civ. Engrs Structs &amp; Bldgs, 122, Nov., pp 461–467.&lt;/ref&gt; Long and Rankin&lt;ref&gt;Long, A.E. and Rankin, G.I.B., ‘Real strength and robustness of reinforced concrete structures’, Proceedings of conference on Conservation of Engineering Structures, Institution of Civil Engineers/Royal Institute of British Architects, 1989, pp 47–58.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that the concepts of arching or compressive membrane action in beam and slab bridge decks are also applicable to flat slab and cellular reinforced concrete structures where considerable strength enhancements over design code predictions can also be achieved.

Research into arching or compressive membrane action has continued over the years at [[Queen’s University Belfast]], with the work of Niblock,&lt;ref&gt;Niblock, R., 'Compressive membrane action and the ultimate capacity of uniformly loaded reinforced concrete slabs, PhD thesis, The Queen's University of Belfast, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, G.I.B., Niblock, R.A., Skates, A.S. and Long, A.E.,  'Compressive membrane action strength enhancement in uniformly loaded, laterally restrained slabs', The Structural Engineer, Vol 69, No. 16, 20 August 1991, pp 287–295.&lt;/ref&gt; who investigated the effects of CMA in uniformly loaded laterally restrained slabs; Skates,&lt;ref&gt;Skates, A.S., Development of a design method for restrained concrete slab systems subject to concentrated and uniform loading, PhD thesis, The Queen's University of Belfast, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; who researched CMA in cellular concrete structures; Ruddle,&lt;ref&gt;Ruddle, M.E., 'Arching action and the ultimate capacity of reinforced concrete beams', PhD thesis, The Queen's University of Belfast, February 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruddle M.E., Rankin G.I.B. and Long A.E., 'Arching action–flexural and shear strength enhancements in rectangular and Tee beams', Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Structures and Buildings Journal, 156, Issue 1, February 2003, pp 63–74.&lt;/ref&gt; who researched arching action in laterally restrained rectangular and [[T-beam|Tee-beams]]; Peel-Cross,&lt;ref&gt;Peel-Cross, R.J., Rankin, G.I.B., Gilbert, S.G. and Long, A.E., ' Compressive membrane action in composite floor slabs in the Cardington LBTF', Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Structures and Buildings Journal, 146, Issue 2, May 2001, pp 217–226.&lt;/ref&gt; who researched CMA in composite floor slab construction; Taylor&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., 'Compressive membrane action in high strength concrete bridge deck slabs', PhD thesis, The Queen's University of Belfast, January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., Rankin, G.I.B. and Cleland, D.J., (2001) 'Arching action in high strength concrete slabs', Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Structures and Buildings, Vol.146, Issue 4, Nov.2001 pp 353–362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., Rankin, B., Cleland, D.J, and Kirkpatrick, J., 'Serviceability of bridge deck slabs with arching action', American Concrete Institute Structural Journal, Vol. 104, No.1 January–February 2007, pp 39–48.&lt;/ref&gt; who researched CMA in high strength concrete bridge deck slabs, and Shaat&lt;ref&gt;Shaat, A.J.S., 'The real strength of laterally restrained reinforced concrete slabs, PhD thesis, Queen's University of Belfast, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; who researched CMA using [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA) techniques. A comprehensive guide to compressive membrane action in concrete bridge decks, was compiled by Taylor, Rankin and Cleland in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., Rankin, G.I.B. and Cleland, D.J., 'Guide to compressive membrane action in concrete bridge decks', Technical Paper 3, Concrete Bridge Development Group, Camberley, Surrey, 2002, 46 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

==North American approach to CMA in bridge-deck design==
In North America, a more pragmatic approach has been adopted and research into compressive membrane action has primarily stemmed from the work of Hewitt and Batchelor&lt;ref name ="Hewitt and Batchelor"&gt;Hewitt , B.E. and Batchelor, B. de V., 'Punching shear strength of restrained slabs', J.

Later, Mufti and Newhook&lt;ref&gt;Mufti, A. A. and Newhook, J.P., 'Punching shear strength of restrained bridge deck slabs', ACI Structures Journal, 1998, 8(3), pp 375–381.&lt;/ref&gt; adapted Hewitt and Batchelor's&lt;ref name="Hewitt and Batchelor" /&gt; model to develop a method for evaluating the ultimate capacity of fibre reinforced deck slabs using external steel straps for the provision of lateral restraint.

:{{see also|Art valuation|Art auction}}
The art market is represented by a marketplace of buyers and sellers trading in the commodities, services, and works-of-art commonly associated with the various arts. The art market is also concerned with the production of new art which enters the art market. The art market is an example of one type of marketplace, among many different types of markets which occur in economics. In particular, the art market has many similarities with other marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet, as well as significant distinguishing factors indicative of its differences from other types of markets in economics.

==The art market economic model==
The [[Economics of the arts and literature#The market for artworks|art market]] operates in an economic model that considers more than [[supply and demand]]: it is a hybrid type of [[prediction market]] where art is bought and sold for values based not only on a work's perceived cultural value, but on both its past monetary value as well as its predicted future value. The market has been described as one where producers don't make work primarily for sale, where buyers often have no idea of the value of what they buy, and where middlemen routinely claim reimbursement for sales of things they have never seen to buyers they have never dealt with.&lt;ref name="platter"&gt;Plattner, Stuart, [http://www.stuartplattner.com/AA-ART-Paradox.pdf A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Market for Contemporary Fine Art], ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 100(2):482-493, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the market is not transparent; private sales data is not systematically available&lt;ref name="Coslor"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|date=April 2016|title=Transparency in an opaque market: Evaluative frictions between "thick" valuation and "thin" price data in the art market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300307|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=50|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and private sales represent about half of market transactions.

===Market size===
Unlike the volumes in the [[securities market]] where millions of people and firms participate in buying and selling financial interests, or the [[Commodity market|commodities market]] where measures of raw or primary products are exchanged using standardized contracts, art market activity largely follows the demands of a more limited array of private collectors, museums, and large corporate interests as the principal market participants.&lt;ref name="microcosm"&gt;The art market sees itself as a microcosm: it lists its collectors in the hundreds, as opposed to the securities market which has millions of participants. ''ARTnews'': [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 The Top Ten] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003020/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 |date=16 October 2009 }}, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 The ARTnews 200 Top Collectors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003056/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 |date=16 October 2009 }}. One art writer, however, answered the question: "Do you see the art world as a microcosm of other broader, power communities?" with the following observation: "I'm not sure if it's a microcosm or the shape of things to come. Its manic internationalism...." [http://www.vmagazine.com/2008/11/111208-insider-art/ Insider Art]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''V Magazine'', 2008-11-12, vmagazine.com.  Accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate collectors, however, can have a disparately large market impact, for instance, ''[[Spear's Wealth Management Survey|Spear's]]'' reported in 2015 that [[British Rail]] began investing in art for its pension fund beginning in 1974 (prior to privatization), spending about £40M or approximately 3% of its funds on art, before selling those assets between 1987&amp;ndash;1999.&lt;ref name="britrailspears"&gt;Lindsay, Ivan, [http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/#.U4W0eSj8iZQ Go Figure], ''Spear's'', spearswms.com, 21 January 2011; free [https://web.archive.org/web/20140529052940/http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/ archived version]. Accessed 17 November 2015. The article also mentions that British Rail Pension realized an annualized return of 11.3% because of a number of factors particular to the market at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; British Rail's efforts realized profits, particularly due to the Impressionist portfolio, but the collection was liquidated because it came to be seen as an illegitimate investment area, particularly as alternative investments became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|last2=Spaenjers|first2=Christophe|date=November 2016|title=Organizational and epistemic change: The growth of the art investment field|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300782|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=55|pages=48–62|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because original artworks are not [[Fungibility|fungible]] like [[stock]]s, they have valuation challenges not similarly affecting securities,&lt;ref name="baumol"&gt;Baumol, William J., [http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf Unnatural Value: Or Art Investment as Floating Crap Game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425235014/http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf |date=25 April 2012 }}, ''The American Economic Review'', 76:2 (May 1986), pp. 10-14, Papers and Proceedings of the Ninety-Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association,; ''Journal of Arts Management and Law'' (now ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''), 15:3, 1985, pp. 47-60. {{DOI|10.1080/07335113.1985.9942162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with dynamics of what Karpik calls singularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9215.html|title=Valuing the Unique|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, because the art market's participants are far more limited in number than the securities or commodities markets, because artworks are not fungible, and because art valuation relies to a great extent on the advice and enthusiasm of a variety of specialized market analysts, these limitations each in turn dictate the size of the market and increase the risk that some items may be over or undervalued.

===Market timing===
The art market moves in cycles with activity generally peaking in the spring and autumn when the major auction houses traditionally schedule auctions, and results in the market being seasonal rather than ongoing.&lt;ref name="sched"&gt;[http://www.artmarket.com/ Art Market Cycles], artmarket.com, retrieved 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  While private sales take place all year, those sales are often not publicized as auctions are and thus do not affect the market until they become known.

Art valuations made for an autumn auction may be unrealistic for the following spring auction season because fortunes in the financial markets during one season can affect the art market in the following season, and equity markets do significantly impact the art market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goetzmann|first=William N|last2=Renneboog|first2=Luc|last3=Spaenjers|first3=Christophe|date=May 2011|title=Art and Money|url=http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=101|issue=3|pages=222–226|doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volatility in the financial markets often causes volatility in the art market as happened in the contraction of the art market during the [[2008–2012 global recession|2008-2009 recession]]&lt;ref&gt;For more on the economic background causing the market contraction, see also the [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence]].&lt;/ref&gt; when sales at [[Sotheby's]], [[Christie's]], and [[Phillips de Pury &amp;amp; Company]] were less than half the previous year: November 2008, $803.3 million compared to November 2007, $1.75 billion; and between 2000 and 2003 when the annual volume of art works sold at auction dropped 36%.&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;&lt;ref name="contraction"&gt;Esterow, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 How to Buy in 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015210756/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 |date=15 October 2009 }}, ''ARTnews'', March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, the art market can fare reasonably well despite volatility in the stock market such as happened from January 1997 through May 2004 when the average quarterly fluctuation in the Artprice Global Index was two to three times smaller than the same statistic for the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] and the [[S&amp;P 500]].&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;

As art market participants' fortunes wax and wane in the financial markets, buying power evolves and affects participants' ability to afford highly valued works, resulting in new buyers and sellers entering, leaving, or re-entering the market, and an artwork sold to offset losses in the financial market might be sold for substantially more or substantially less than its last {{H:title|price for which work sold at auctioneer's hammer strike|hammer value|link=no}} at auction.&lt;ref name="gerber"&gt;Gerber, Manuel, [http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf Primary Art Market Investments - A Safe Haven when All Else Suddenly Correlates?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002174957/http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf# |date=2013-10-02 }}, Prime Art Management Ltd., published in ''Art Fund Tracker'', Nov. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s during the stock-market boom, the art market expanded in turn with prices soaring to new heights, and investment firms took a greater interest in the art market and began to study it in-depth.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, [http://i1.exhibit-e.com/collectionofmodernart/39049d22.pdf The Art of Portfolio Diversification]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Maastricht University, March 2004.

Art sometimes has transient fashionability that also can affect its value: what sells well for a time may be supplanted in the market by new styles and ideas in short order. For instance, in the spring of 2008 a collector offered over $80 million for Jeff Koons' stainless-steel ''Rabbit'', and yet a year later, of four works in the fall auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York, only two of his pieces sold well and one failed to sell entirely.&lt;ref name="inflatable"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14941205 Inflatable investments, The volatile art of Jeff Koons], ''[[The Economist]]'', 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Christie's sold Koons' ''Balloon Flower'' sculpture for $16.9 million.&lt;ref name="koonsballoon"&gt;Christie's, [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/jeff-koons-balloon-flower/5371708/lot/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5371708&amp;sid=e5ce29ac-d2b6-41b6-9092-7aacf3e6974b Auction result, Sale 2355 / Lot 23], christies.com, retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary and secondary markets===
The art market as a whole is affected by its two main parts: the primary art market, where new art comes to the market for the first time, and the secondary market, for existing art that has been sold at least once before. Once a work is sold on the primary market it enters the secondary market, and the prices for which it sold in the primary market have a direct bearing on the work's value in the secondary market. Supply and demand affect the secondary market more than the primary market because works new to the market, mainly contemporary art, have no market history for predictive analysis and thus valuation of such work is more difficult, and more speculative.&lt;ref name="gerald"&gt;Gerard and Louis, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V64-3YRSMF4-28/2/44fafa98be1c97504c5a1fdc722b55ba On pricing the priceless: Comments on the economics of the visual art market], ''European Economic Review'', Elsevier, vol. 39(3-4), April 1995, pp. 509-518. (membership required).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery, dealer, consultant, and agent promotion as well as collectors acting as [[alpha consumer]]s (trend-setters) are the forces at work in valuing primary market works.

===Market entry barriers===
As with [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip]] stocks, works by "blue-chip" or well-known artists are generally valued more highly than works by unknown artists since it is hard to predict how an unknown artist's work will sell, or whether it will sell at all. [[barriers to entry|High barriers to market entry]] for artists&lt;ref name="jeffri"&gt;Jeffri, Joan, Philanthropy and the American artist: A historical overview, ''[[International Journal of Cultural Policy|The European Journal of Cultural Policy]]'', 3(2), 2009, pp. 207-233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barriers"&gt;Jackson, M.R., et al, [http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411311_investing_in_creativity.pdf Investing in Creativity: A study of the support structure for US artists], ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society'', 2004.

All these concerns are in play when gallerists set prices for emerging artists at a much lower level than for established artists.

===Market transparency===
With the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]], the art market faced criticism for its lack of transparency, its [[Byzantinism|Byzantine]] valuation methods, and a perceived lack of ethical behavior enabled by structural inadequacies in the market itself. In response, a 2009 debate occurred between valuation-setting members of the art market on the proposition that "the art market is less ethical than the stock market". At the end of the debate the audience determined that those debating in agreement with the proposition won the debate.&lt;ref name="morality"&gt;Saltz, Jerry, [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/saltz/saltz3-6-09.asp Morality Play], artnet.com, 2009-03-06, discussing the debate and its outcome. Participants included art dealers Richard Feigen and Michael Hue-Williams, collector Adam Lindemann on the "pro" side, and artist [[Chuck Close]], critic Jerry Saltz, and auctioneer Amy Cappellazzo opposing. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpsTNdYeG6U debate video] is available on [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note in the debate was the identification of "chandelier bidding" as a practice perceived as ethically questionable. The debaters described "chandelier bidding" as bids from the chandelier, or bids from an unknown source, meaning both the bidding by the auction houses on behalf of the sellers whose items the houses are auctioning (a [[conflict of interest]]), and bidding by unidentified bidders having no intention of buying but bidding in order to drive prices up, all practiced because the auction houses keep secret from bidders a seller's [[Reservation price|reserve price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/arts/design/as-art-market-rise-so-do-questions-of-oversight.html|title=As Art Market Soars, So Do Questions of Oversight|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|date=27 January 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=9 June 2017|last2=Flynn|first2=Kevin|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate also included the issue of first and third-party guaranteed bids, and whether sellers' reserve prices should be disclosed so that participants no longer bid on an object they have no chance of buying. In response to criticisms regarding chandelier bidding and unidentified third-party guaranteed bids, Christie's International chairman Edward Dolman countered that, without a secret reserve, illegal cartels of bidders would know in advance information that could facilitate their manipulation of the market and corruption of final valuation by selling price at auction.&lt;ref name="transpADAA2"&gt;ADAA, video 3 at 22:05 min, et seq..&lt;/ref&gt;

With the art market's weaknesses (especially lack of transparency and conflicts of interests) becoming better known, serious external conversations about market regulation have begun among major market players; for example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' noted that in early 2015, participants at the January [[World Economic Forum]] meeting attended a lunch seminar where the speaker warned that the global art market needs to be regulated because of systemic weaknesses which enable inside information trading, tax evasion, and money laundering.&lt;ref name="gapper"&gt;Gapper, John, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150125081849/http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2015/01/art-worlds-shady-dealings-under-scrutiny-at-davos Art world’s shady dealings under scrutiny at Davos], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 22 January 2015. Accessed 17 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of academic research, there is work on the opacity of price formation in finance and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Géraldine|last2=Oosterlinck|first2=Kim|last3=Szafarz|first3=Ariane|title=Art market inefficiency|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033|journal=Economics Letters|volume=121|issue=1|pages=23–25|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Competitors ===
Christie's and Sotheby's are the leading auction venues. In 2002, [[LVMH]] acquired Swiss art advisory firm de Pury &amp; Luxembourg and merged it with Phillips to form [[Phillips de Pury &amp; Company]], with the aim of breaking the duopoly at the top of the market.

=== Segments ===
Fine art auctions are generally held separately for Impressionist and Modern art as well as for Post-war and Contemporary Art. [[Pablo Picasso]]'s works remain the most coveted lot as of 2004. In 2008 just over  million of art by [[Damien Hirst]] was sold at auction, a world record for a living artist; however in 2009, Hirst’s annual auction sales had shrunk by 93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Estimates ===
"Estimates" often reflect the [[consignor]]'s ambitions as much as the auction specialist's considered opinion. They do not reflect commissions. To secure consignments, auction houses concede high estimates to suit the requirements of art owners.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/arts/08iht-melikian08.html When Auction Estimates Go Haywire], ''[[The New York Times]]'', nytimes.com, October 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Before an auction, interested buyers typically turn for advice to the auction house specialist who quotes the estimate and often recommends going beyond in order to secure the item.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/arts/18iht-melik19.1.9319140.html Behind stellar sales of art market, a dangerous game], ''The New York Times'', nytimes.com, January 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commissions and Buyer's Premium ===
Auction houses operate contractually on behalf of sellers of goods, charging sellers a fixed [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] (fee) amounting to a percentage of the “hammer price” for which a lot is sold.&lt;ref name="horror"&gt;{{cite journal
 | title = Hammer houses of horror
 | magazine = [[The Economist]]
 | date = July 24, 1997
 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/152446
 | accessdate = 2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie's published its commissions in September 1995, with its fees ranging from 20% on the least expensive lots to 2% on lots sold for over m; Sotheby's followed suit.&lt;ref name="horror" /&gt; For Phillips de Pury &amp; Company, final prices include commission of 25% of the first  20% of the next  to  million, and 12% of the rest, with estimates not reflecting commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/arts/design/14auction.html Phillips Sale Totals Less Than Half the Low Estimate] ''The New York Times'', nytimes.com, November 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Objects sold are also subject to a further fee called the "[[buyer's premium]]", 15% being typical, with the term implying that by virtue of selling an object, the auction house performs a service for the buyer subject to remuneration. Thus, both the seller and the buyer of an object or lot sold by the major auction houses pay a fee. First implemented in 1975 by Christie's, the assessment of a buyer's premium is one of several auction-house practices to which art dealers object.&lt;ref&gt;Orley Ashenfelter &amp; Kathryn Graddy, Anatomy of the Rise and Fall of a Pricefixing Conspiracy: Auctions At Sotheby’s And Christie’s, ''Journal of Competition Law and Economics'', 1(1), 3–20, March 2005, {{doi|10.1093/joclec/nhi003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance-based fees ===
Beginning in 2014, Christie's charged 2 percent of the hammer price of a work that meets or exceeds its high estimate. The fee does not apply to online only sales.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Gerlis (September 26, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 Christie's takes another 2%] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928075542/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 |date=2014-09-28 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guarantees ===
An auction house may offer a guaranteed selling price, or "guaranteed minimum", a practice designed to give sellers confidence to consign works and to give potential bidders reassurance that there are others willing to buy an item.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thornton]], [https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/11/art-market Financial machinations at auctions], ''The Economist'', economist.com, November 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Auction houses have offered guarantees since the early 1970s to encourage collectors to sell their artworks: ''The Art Newspaper'' reported that guarantees were first introduced in 1971 at Sotheby’s, when 47 [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]s and other works from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] were offered with a guaranteed minimum; similar arrangements followed in 1972 and 1973 for the Ritter and Scull collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 2008 when the market turned sour, Christie's and Sotheby's had to pay out at least  million on works for which they guaranteed a minimum price but which failed to sell. In order to reduce their exposure to such losses, boost the market, and reduce volatility, the main auction houses now prefer that third parties take on this financial risk via "third-party guarantees" or "irrevocable bids": using this practice the auction houses sell a work to a third party for a minimum price prior to the auction and this selling price then becomes the “reserve” below which the artwork will not be sold. If bidding for specified works stops at the minimum price, which remains undisclosed, the "third party" acquires the lot; if bidding exceeds the reserve, the third party splits any profit from its sale with the consignor and with the auction house, the percentage going to each party varying with the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Online sales ===
[[File:Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art).jpg|thumb|A Screenshot of Teo Spiller's net.art net.art.trade]]
In May 1999, [[Teo Spiller]] sold a web art project Megatronix to Ljubljana Municipal Museum, which was by the New York Times announced as the first sell of an [[Internet art]] [[net.art]].&lt;ref&gt;Mirapaul, M [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/cyber/artsatlarge/13artsatlarge.html "There May Be Money in Internet Art After All"], ''The New York Times, 1999-05-13''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Sotheby's abandoned its partnership with [[eBay]] after it lost millions through its various attempts to sell fine art over the internet.&lt;ref name="duopoly"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/1612774 Just the two of us - The duopoly in fine-art auctions is weakened but very much alive] ''The Economist'', economist.com, February 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;


==What Counts==
The [[art sale|art market]] can also be used to understand what “counts” as part of art history. [[Art dealers]] and auctioneers organize material for distribution to collectors. Two of the largest, and oldest, art auction houses are [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]], and each hold frequent sales of great [[antiquities]] and [[Art Object|art objects]].

==Black Market==
In addition to upstanding practices, a [[black market]] exists for great art, which is closely tied to [[art theft]] and [[art forgery]]. No auction houses or dealers admit openly to participating in the black market because of its illegality, but exposés suggest widespread problems in the field. Because demand for art objects is high, and security in many parts of the world is low, a thriving trade in [[illicit antiquities]] acquired through [[looting]] also exists. Although the art community nearly universally condemns looting because it results in destruction of [[Archaeological site|archeological sites]], [[looted art]] paradoxically remains omnipresent. Warfare is correlated with such looting, as is demonstrated by the recent [[archaeological looting in Iraq]].

An '''augmented marked graph''' is basically a [[Petri net]] with a specific set of places called resource places. If removing these resource places and their associated arcs, it will become a marked graph where every cycle is marked. For each resource place, there are pairs of outgoing and incoming transitions connected by elementary paths.

== Application ==

Augmented marked graphs are often used for modelling systems with shared resources, such as manufacturing systems. Based on the special properties of augmented marked graphs, the properties of the modelled systems, such as liveness, boundedness and reversibility, can be effectively analyzed.

[[File:Mackie CFX12 Live Sound Mixer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mackie CFX12 Live Sound Mixer]]
An '''aux-send''' (auxiliary send) is an electronic signal-routing output used on  multi-channel sound [[mixing console]]s used in recording and broadcasting settings and on [[PA system]] amplifier-mixers used in music concerts. The signal from the auxiliary send is often routed through outboard audio processing [[effects unit]]s (e.g., reverb, digital delay, compression, etc.) and then returned to the mixer using an auxiliary return input jack, thus creating an [[effects loop]]. This allows effects to be added to an audio source or channel within the mixing console. Another common use of the aux send mix is to create monitor mixes for the onstage performers' [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]] or [[in-ear monitors]]. The aux send's monitor mix is usually different from the front of house mix the audience is hearing.

==Purpose==
The routing configuration and usage of an aux-send will vary depending on the application. Two types of aux-sends commonly exist: pre-fader and post-fader. Pre-fader sends are not affected by the main fader for the channel, while post-fader sends ones are affected by the position of the main fader slider control for the channel.

In a common configuration, a post-fader aux-send output is connected to the audio input of an outboard (i.e., an external [usually rack-mounted] unit that is not part of the mixer console) audio [[effects unit]] (most commonly a temporal/time-based effect such as [[reverb]] or [[delay (audio effect)|delay]]; [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]]s and other dynamic processors would normally be on an [[Insert (effects processing)|insert]], instead). The audio output of the outboard unit is then connected to the aux-return input on the mixing console (if the recording console has one), or, alternatively, it can be looped back to one of the console's unused input channels. A post-fader output is used in order to prevent channels whose faders are at zero gain from "contaminating" the effects-return loop with hiss and hum.

Mixing consoles most commonly have a group of aux-send knobs in each channel strip, or, on small mixers, a single aux-send knob per channel, where one knob corresponds to each aux-send on the board. The controls enable the operator to adjust the amount of signal that will be sent from its corresponding channel into the signal bus routed to its corresponding aux-send output. The largest, most expensive mixers have a number of aux-send knobs on every channel, thus giving the audio engineer the flexibility to create many live sound and/or recording applications for the mixer.

[[File:ALTO S-8 mixer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Alto S-8 mixer has two knobs for controlling the aux-send mix (the third and fourth knobs from the bottom).]]
A benefit of using an aux-send is that it enables the signals from multiple channels on a mixing console to be simultaneously routed to a single outboard device. For instance, audio signals from all the channels of a sixteen-channel mixing console can be routed to a single outboard reverb unit so that all channels are heard with reverb. 

The aux-sends from a group of inputs can also be routed to an amplifier and then sent to [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speaker]]s so that the onstage musicians can hear their singing or playing through monitor wedge speakers on the stage or through [[in ear monitor]]s. The benefit of using the pre-fader aux-send function is that the volume of the vocals or instruments in the monitor mix does not have to be the same as the "front-of-house" mix for the audience. Musicians whose voices are barely present in the "front-of-house" mix, such as [[backup vocal]]ists, can have their sound clearly and loudly sent through a monitor speaker so that they can hear themselves singing and ensure that their pitch and timing is correct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">'''Bureaupedia''' is a [[corporate wiki|wiki used internally]] at the [[FBI]] with the intention of capturing the knowledge of senior agents and reduce knowledge loss due to retirement.

Bureaupedia's existence was revealed in a September 2008 article in ''[[Federal Computer Week]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://fcw.com/articles/2008/09/26/fbi-creates-knowledge-wiki.aspx |title= FBI creates knowledge wiki |first= Ben |last= Bain |journal= [[Federal Computer Week|FCW]] |date= Sep 26, 2008 |dead-url= no |archive-date= October 2, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081002074743/http://www.fcw.com/online/news/153926-1.html |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBI officials see Bureaupedia as a [[knowledge management]] tool that will let agents and analysts share their experiences to ensure that their accumulated insight remains after they retire. The project is a collaborative effort between the FBI’s chief knowledge officer and chief technology officer.

The Cedej has the status of a "Joint Entity of French Research Institutes Abroad" (UMIFRE, Unité Mixte des Instituts français de recherche à l’étranger) and is under the aegis of the [[French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and the [[CNRS]] (National Centre for Scientific Research). Karine Bennafla is its director since September 2015.

It has published numerous books and periodicals in all fields of social sciences in Egypt, the Sudan and the Arabic world. Among these, ''Egypte/Monde arabe'', published from 1990, which is online in full text on the portal revues.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ema.revues.org|title=Égypte/Monde arabe|access-date=2018-03-14|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It offers a social sciences library (more than 35000 books, most of them in Arabic), a huge database of geolocated statistics, a complete collection of old and new maps of Egypt and its cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3237">'''Chandrasekhar Polarization''' is a partial [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of emergent radiation at the limb of rapidly rotating early-type stars or [[binary star system]] with purely electron-scattering atmosphere, named after the [[Indian Americans|Indian American]] [[astrophysicist]] [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], who first predicted its existence theoretically in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Rucinski, S. M. (1970). An Upper Limit to the Chandrasekhar Polarization in Early Type Stars. Acta Astronomica, 20, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1946). On the Radiative Equilibrium of a Stellar Atmosphere. X. The Astrophysical Journal, 103, 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandrasekhar published series of 26 papers in [[The Astrophysical Journal]] titled ''On the Radiative Equilibrium of a Stellar Atmosphere'' from 1944 to 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1989). Selected Papers, Vol 2, Radiative transfer and negative ion of hydrogen. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|9780226100920}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10th paper, he predicted that the purely electron stellar atmosphere emits a polarized light using [[Thomson scattering|Thomson law of scattering]]. The theory predicted that 11 percent polarization could be observed at maximum. But when this is applied to a spherical star, the net polarization effect was found to be zero, because of the spherical symmetry. But it took another 20 years to explain under what conditions this polarization can be observed. J. Patrick Harrington and George W. Collins, II &lt;ref&gt;Harrington, J. P., &amp; Collins, G. W. (1968). Intrinsic polarization of rapidly rotating early-type stars. The Astrophysical Journal, 151, 1051.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that this symmetry is broken if we consider a rapidly rotating star (or a binary star system), in which the star is not exactly spherical, but slightly oblate due to extreme rotation (or tidal distortion in the case of binary system). The symmetry is also broken in eclipsing binary star system.

==Discovery==

Attempts made to predict this polarization effect were initially unsuccessful, but rather led to the prediction of [[Polarization in astronomy|interstellar polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;Hiltner, W. A. (1949). Polarization of radiation from distant stars by the interstellar medium. Nature, 163(4138), 283.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, scientists found the first evidence of this polarization effect on the star [[Algol]], an eclipsing binary-star system.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, J. C., Henson, G. D., Barbour, M. S., Kraus, D. J., &amp; Collins, G. W. (1983). Discovery of eclipse polarization in Algol. The Astrophysical Journal, 273, L85-L88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The polarization on rapidly rotating star was not found until 2017 since it required a high-precision [[polarimeter]]. On September 2017,&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, D. V., Bailey, J., Howarth, I. D., Bott, K., Kedziora-Chudczer, L., Lucas, P. W., &amp; Hough, J. H. (2017). Polarization due to rotational distortion in the bright star Regulus. Nature Astronomy, 1(10), 690.&lt;/ref&gt; a team of scientists from Australia observed this polarization on the star [[Regulus]], which rotates at 96.5 percent of its critical angular velocity for breakup.

'''Colleen Cavanaugh''' is an American academic [[microbiologist]] best known for her studies of [[hydrothermal vent]] [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaines|first1=Susan|last2=Eglington|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Rullkotter|first3=Jurgen|title=Echoes of Life: What Fossil Molecules Reveal about Earth History|date=2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780195176193|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, she is the Edward C. Jeffrey Professor of [[Biology]] in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at [[Harvard University]] and is affiliated with the [[Rowland Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colleen Cavanaugh|url=http://cavanaughlab.oeb.harvard.edu/people/colleen-cavanaugh|website=Cavanaugh Lab|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavanaugh was the first to propose that the deep-sea [[giant tube worm]], ''[[Riftia pachyptila]]'', obtains its food from [[bacteria]] living within its [[Cell (biology)|cells]], an insight which she had as a [[graduate student]] at Harvard.&lt;ref name="tenure"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cromie |first1=William |title=Microbiologist-Aquanaut Colleen Cavanaugh Receives Tenure |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/11.14/Microbiologist-.html |accessdate=15 September 2016 |publisher=The Harvard University Gazette |date=November 14, 1996 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234707/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/11.14/Microbiologist-.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, she made the connection that these [[chemoautotroph]]ic bacteria were able to play this role through their use of [[chemosynthesis]], the biological oxidation of inorganic compounds (e.g., [[hydrogen sulfide]]) to synthesize organic matter from very simple carbon-containing molecules, thus allowing [[organism]]s such as the bacteria (and dependent organisms such as tube worms) to exist in [[ocean floor|deep ocean]] without [[sunlight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirchman|first1=David|title=Processes in Microbial Ecology|date=2012|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780199586936|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Cavanaugh was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=J. |title=Colleen Cavanaugh: Winner of the Ecology Institute's IRPE PRIZE 1986 in marine ecology |journal=[[Marine Ecology Progress Series]] |date=November 27, 1986 |volume=34 |issue=9–10 |doi=10.3354/meps034009 |url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/34/m034p009.pdf |accessdate=15 September 2016|bibcode=1986MEPS...34....9G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavanaugh received her undergraduate degree from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1977, where she initially studied music but ultimately majored in ecology.&lt;ref name="kunzig"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kunzig |first1=R. |title=Mapping the Deep: The Extraordinary Story of Ocean Science |date=2000 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |isbn=9780393320633 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; She says her life changed direction in her sophomore year when she heard about a course in [[marine ecology]] at the [[oceanography|oceanographic]] center in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]]. There, her work involved wading out into chilly waters to study the [[sexual reproduction|mating habit]]s of [[horseshoe crab]]s, and she described herself as "[falling] in love" with the relaxed camaraderie and exchange of ideas between biologists, [[geology|geologists]], and scientists from other disciplines.&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt; Cavanaugh ended up stranded in the [[Greater Boston]] area looking for a job, and ultimately replaced a "no show" in a [[Boston University]] [[undergraduate]] research program, which returned her to work with local horseshoe crabs.

Cavanaugh then moved to [[Cape Cod]] to work at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] at Woods Hole. During the next two years the focus of her attention shifted from [[Crustacea]] to [[bacteria]], "creatures that impressed her for their ability to live anywhere."&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;

==Graduate training==
[[File:Nur04505.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cavanaugh's analyses of bacterial symbioses involving [[giant tube worms]] and other [[deep sea]] [[invertebrate]]shas led to her being described as a "scientific [[Captain Nemo]]."&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;{{third-party inline|date=September 2016}}]]
Cavanaugh pursued her graduate training in biology at Harvard University, in association with the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]]. She entered Harvard in the fall of 1979, earning an M.A. in 1981 and graduating with her PhD in biology in 1985.&lt;ref name="kunzig"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shea|first1=Neil|title=At Large on the Blue Frontier|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2003/07/at-large-on-the-blue-fro.html|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Harvard Magazine|date=August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Ph.D.]] dissertation, entitled ''Symbiosis of chemoautotrophic bacteria and marine invertebrates'', was accepted in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Colleen|title=Symbiosis of chemoautotrophic bacteria and marine invertebrates|date=1985|url=http://hollis.harvard.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=HVD&amp;search_scope=default_scope&amp;docId=HVD_ALEPH001337169&amp;fn=permalink|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of chemosynthesis in tube worms===
By one account, Cavanaugh was attending a lecture by Meredith L. Jones, curator of worms at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], shortly after she began her [[graduate school|graduate studies]]. Jones was discussing the giant tube worm, a creature lacking both [[mouth]] and [[Gut (zoology)|gut]], where the challenge was to understand how it survived. Jones mentioned elemental [[sulfur]] crystals within the worms gut; Cavanaugh states that "It was at that point that I jumped up and said, 'Well, it's perfectly clear! They must have sulphur-oxidising bacteria inside their bodies'".&lt;ref name="kunzig"/&gt; Jones apparently told her to sit down,&lt;ref name="kunzig"/&gt; but provided Cavanaugh with a specimen captured by a research [[submarine]] working on the bottom of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Cavanaugh eventually substantiated her case.

The ''Harvard Gazette'' describes Cavanaugh's pioneering study of these unique creatures:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As a first-year graduate student, she discovered what makes life possible… where the sun never shines, [where] temperatures can exceed 250 degrees F, and [where] the ocean exerts pressures of thousands of pounds on every square inch of an animal's body. Giant worms, huge [[clam]]s and [[mussel]]s, and strange [[shrimp]] thrive in such conditions because of one-celled [[bacteria]] who live on and inside them. The bacteria turn sulfur, [[methane]], and other inedibles into [[organic molecule]]s that their hosts feed on.&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cavanaugh went on to publish the results of the further work that began to substantiate the discovery, writing from the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] at Harvard, as first of a five author paper, a short 1981 ''Science'' report with [[Stephen L. Gardiner]] and [[Meredith L. Jones]] of the Smithsonian Institution, and [[Holgar W. Jannasch]] and [[John B. Waterbury]] at [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Woods Hole]] (see Significant publications).

==Career==
Cavanaugh's first appointment was as a Junior Fellowship in the Society of Fellows at [[Harvard University]], in 1986-1989.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This was followed by elevation to assistant professorship in 1989, and associate professor in 1993. In 1995, she was granted tenure as a full professor "for [her] discoveries and her reputation as a teacher and mentor."&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;

==Research and outreach highlights==
Cavanaugh has continued to build her career on the study of hydrothermal vent ecology. Cavanaugh went on to discover similar symbiotic partnerships among [[Solemyidae]] clams living in shallow [[Zostera|eelgrass]] beds and [[mudflat]]s along the [[New England]] coast, and in shrimp near sub-sea springs in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;

Cavanaugh believes that [[life|life on Earth]] may have started under similar conditions and says "the idea makes sense because some of the oldest forms of free-living [[bacteria]] show signs of being heat-loving organisms."&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt; Cavanaugh's work has made the scientific community rethink the "warm [[chicken soup]]" [[theory]] of life's origins in which the accumulation of organic molecules in [[coast|shallow waters]] was a result of [[lightning]] [[electricity]].
[[File:Photo of Ruth Turner and Colleen Cavanaugh dissecting clams from the deep sea.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ruth Turner]] and Cavanaugh dissecting [[DSV Alvin|Alvin]] retrieved clams from the deep sea in 1992]]
Cavanaugh's discoveries of the biology of the deep [[Pacific Ocean]] were made in a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] (Harvard) [[laboratory]], and she worked on marine life in the laboratory and onboard [[ship]]s for twelve years before securing a place on the deep-diving submarine ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]''; she went to the bottom of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], off the [[Florida]] coast, for the first time in 1992. According to the ''Harvard Gazette'' article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not many people have visited with 6-foot-long, bright red worms on the boiling bottom of the ocean. It sounds like a [[Jules Verne]] fantasy, but newly tenured Professor of Biology Colleen Cavanaugh has seen these and other strange creatures on voyages to the bottom of the deep sea.&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She later participated in more "Extreme Expeditions"—such as a dive to a depth of 8,200 feet off the west coast of [[Mexico]]&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt; to collect tube worms and their bacteria, the chemically-rich fluids that flow out of the vents, and mineral samples from the [[deep sea]] ocean floor.&lt;ref name="UofDel-worms"&gt;{{cite web|author=Cavanaugh, Colleen and UDel EDF Staff |date=2003 |title=Extreme 2003: Exploring the Deep Frontier, 'Tubeworms: The "Rose Garden" on the Sea Floor,' and 'Mystery of the "Gutless Wonder"' |website=Ocean.UDel.edu/Extreme2003 |location=Newark, DE |publisher=University of Delaware, Department of Earth, Ocean, and Environment |url=http://www.ocean.udel.edu/extreme2003/creatures/tubeworms/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530081121/http://www.ocean.udel.edu/extreme2003/creatures/tubeworms/index.html |archive-date=2009-05-30 |access-date=12 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavanaugh, who has been called "a scientific [[Captain Nemo]]."&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt; is prominent in her field of biology.Robert Kunzig, in describing her work for a 2001 ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine article, writes of her visit to "a hot crack in the Earth under the [[Indian Ocean]]":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Biologists who study the [[physiology]] of organisms are under time pressure: They must dissect the organisms before they deteriorate. Colleen Cavanaugh, a microbiologist from Harvard, needs animals that are alive and not starved; once they've been away from their vent too long, even if they've been sitting in a box on the ocean floor, they start to digest the symbiotic bacteria in which she is interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kunzig, Robert |year=2001 |title=Expedition to the Bottom of the Deep Blue Sea |journal=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |issue=December 1 |pages= |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/dec/cover |access-date=12 September 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014115811/http://discovermagazine.com/2001/dec/cover |archivedate=14 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As reported in February 2000, Cavanaugh is the discoverer of a new [[species]] of deep-dwelling mussel in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] that shares its body with symbiotic bacteria that feed on methane.&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt; She joined Craig Smith of the University of Hawaii and other colleagues in a ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' report on a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] [[National Undersea Research Program]] study at its West Coast and Polar Regions Center (at the [[University of Alaska, Fairbanks]]), regarding how [[whale]] [[corpse]]s that drop to the bottom of the ocean—and their [[bone]]s in particular—play an important role in [[ocean floor]] ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldman|first1=Jana|title=OCEANOGRAPHERS SAY DEAD WHALES PROVIDE DEEP-SEA LIVING LEGACY|url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2000/feb00/noaa00r506.html|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=February 17, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oceanographers Say Dead Whales Provide Deep-Sea Living Legacy|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/02/000218055946.htm|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Science Daily|date=February 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Distel|first1=Daniel|last2=Baco|first2=Amy|last3=Chuang|first3=Ellie|last4=Morrill|first4=Wendy|last5=Cavanaugh|first5=Colleen|last6=Smith|first6=Craig|title=Marine ecology: Do mussels take wooden steps to deep-sea vents?|journal=Nature|date=February 17, 2000|volume=403|issue=725–726|pages=725–726|doi=10.1038/35001667|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6771/full/403725a0.html#a2|accessdate=15 September 2016|bibcode=2000Natur.403..725D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cavanaugh Laboratory==
The Cavanaugh Laboratory at Harvard works on a number of projects related to bacterial [[symbiosis]] in marine [[invertebrates]] from [[Black smoker|deep sea hydrothermal vent]]s, [[methane]] seeps, and coastal reducing [[sediment]]s. Researchers there have a special interest in characterizing the [[metabolism|metabolic]] and [[genetics|genetic]] capabilities of symbionts, their [[evolution]]ary relationships with free-living bacteria, and the co-evolution of symbiont and host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research|url=http://cavanaughlab.oeb.harvard.edu/research|website=Cavanaugh Lab|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:StylidiumFlora5.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Flower of ''[[Stylidium turbinatum]]'', showing the column.]]
The '''column''', or technically the '''gynostemium''', is a reproductive structure that can be found in several plant families: [[Aristolochiaceae]], [[Orchidaceae]], and [[Stylidiaceae]]. 

It is derived from the fusion of both male and female parts ([[stamen]]s and [[carpel|pistil]]) into a single organ. This means that the ''style'' and ''stigma'' of the pistil, with the filaments  and one or more anthers, are all united.

== Orchidaceae ==
[[Image:VanillaFlowerLongitudinalSection-en.png|thumb|right|400px|&lt;center&gt;Longitudinal view of a vanilla flower, showing the column &lt;/center&gt;]]
The stigma sits at the apex of the column in the front but is pointing downwards after '''[[resupination]]''' (the rotation by 180 degrees before unfolding of the flower). 

This stigma has the form of a small bowl, the '''clinandrium''', a viscous surface embedding the (generally) single anther. On top of it all is the '''anther cap'''. Sometimes there is a small extension or little beak to the median stigma lobe, called '''[[rostellum]]'''.

'''Column wings''' may project laterally from the stigma. The '''column foot''' is formed by the attachment of the [[Labellum (botany)|lip]] to the basal protruding part of the column. One speaks of a '''mentum''' (chin) if the lateral [[sepal]]s are also basally adnate (= attached to the foot of the column).

The column both releases [[pollen]] and also receives it (from another individual) for fertilization. In the Orchidaceae family, unlike almost all other [[flowering plants]], the single male anther at the tip of the ''column'' produces [[pollen]] that is not free and powdery but held in waxy masses of two, four or six pellets called '''''[[pollinium|pollinia]]'''''. The transfer of ''pollinia'' from one flower to another, though highly efficient, is often reliant upon one particular species of [[arthropod]]s and it can be catastrophic for the population if its pollinator disappears from the community.

'''Cosmography''' is the science that [[map]]s the general features of the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]], describing both [[heaven]] and [[Earth]] (but without encroaching on [[geography]] or [[astronomy]]). The 14th-century work ''[['Aja'ib al-makhluqat wa-ghara'ib al-mawjudat]]'' by [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] is considered to be an early work of cosmography.

Traditional Hindu, Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] cosmography schematize a universe centered on [[Mount Meru]] surrounded by rivers, continents and seas.  These cosmographies posit a universe being repeatedly created and destroyed over time cycles of immense lengths.

an Engraving on Wood, attributed to---&gt; &amp;ndash; by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], in the "Cosmographie" of Munster (Basle, 1552, folio).]]
In 1551, [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]], from [[Zaragoza]], Spain, published ''[[Breve compendio de la esfera y del arte de navegar]]''. Translated into English and reprinted several times, the work was of great influence in Britain for many years. He proposed spherical charts and mentioned magnetic deviation and the existence of magnetic poles.

[[Peter Heylin]]'s 1652 book ''Cosmographie'' (enlarged from his ''Microcosmos'' of 1621) was one of the earliest attempts to describe the entire world in English, and being the first known description of [[Australia]] and among the first of [[California]]. The book has 4 sections, examining the geography, politics, and cultures of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, with an addendum on ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]'', including Australia, and extending to [[Utopia]], [[Álfheimr|Fairyland]], and the "Land of [[Chivalry|Chivalrie]]".

In 1659, Thomas Porter published a smaller, but extensive ''Compendious Description of the Whole World'', which also included a [[chronology]] of world events from [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] forward. These were all part of a major trend in the [[European Renaissance]] to explore (and perhaps comprehend) the known world.

The word was also commonly used by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in his lectures.

In [[astrophysics]], the term "cosmography" is beginning to be used to describe attempts to determine the large-scale [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|matter distribution]] and [[kinematics]] of the [[universe|observable universe]], dependent on the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] but independent of the temporal dependence of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] on the matter/energy composition of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Ecotoxicity''', the subject of study of the field of [[ecotoxicology]] (a [[portmanteau]] of [[ecology]] and [[toxicology]]), refers to the potential for [[biological]], [[chemical]] or physical [[stressor]]s to affect [[ecosystems]]. Such stressors might occur in the natural environment at densities, concentrations or levels high enough to disrupt the natural biochemistry, physiology, behavior and interactions of the living organisms that comprise the ecosystem.

Ecotoxicology has been defined as, "the branch of toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including human), vegetable and microbial, in an integral context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Truhaut R | year = 1977 | title = Eco-Toxicology - Objectives, Principles and Perspectives | url = | journal = Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 151–173 | doi=10.1016/0147-6513(77)90033-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common environmental toxicants == 
# [[Diethyl phthalate]], that enter environments through industries manufacturing cosmetics, plastic and many other commercial products.
# [[Bisphenol A]] (BPA), found in many mass-produced products such as, medical devices, food packaging, cosmetics, children's toys, computers, CD's, etc.
# Pharmaceuticals such as [[Climbazole]], a fungicide found in [[anti-dandruff shampoo]]s.
# [[Pesticide]]s
# Some but not all; [[Cleaning agent|cleaning products]], [[laundry detergent]]s, [[fabric softener]]s, [[oven cleaner]]s, [[disinfectant]]s
# [[Phosphate]]s
# [[Oil]]

== Everyday hazards ==

In Canada, there is no law requiring manufactures to state the health and [[environmental hazard]]s associated with their cleaning products. Many people buy such products to support a clean and healthy home, often unaware of the products ability to harm both their own health and the surrounding environment. "Canadians spend more than $275 million on household [[cleaning product]]s in a year" &lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidsuzuki.org/issues/health/science/toxics/the-dirt-on-toxic-chemicals-in-household-cleaning-products/ |title=The dirt on toxic chemicals in household cleaning products |last=Suzuki |first=David |publisher= The David Suzuki Foundation |date=  |website=David Suzuki Foundation, Solutions are in our nature |access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals from these cleaners enter our bodies through air passageways and [[skin absorption|absorption through the skin]] and when these cleaning products are  washed down the drain they negatively affect [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. There are also no regulations in place stating that the ingredients be listed on labels of cleaning products leading the users to be ultimately unaware of the chemicals they expose themselves and their surrounding environments to.

=== 2-Butoxyethanol === 
The organic compound [[2-Butoxyethanol]], commonly found in [[glass cleaner]]s, laundry [[stain remover]]s, windshield wiper fluid, [[oven cleaner]]s, and [[rust remover]]s has been proven to cause [[reproductive problems]] in laboratory experiments.

=== Ammonia === 
The compound [[ammonia]] is found in many window cleaners, drain cleaners, bathroom cleaners, oven cleaners, [[car polish]], and all-purpose cleaners. Its vapour is particularly harmful to people with [[asthma]] and it may also cause kidney and [[liver damage]]. When ammonia is mixed with products containing [[chlorine bleach]], highly poisonous [[chloramine]] gas is formed. This poisonous gas often forms when cleaners are mixed in the home forming strong irritants.

=== Fragrance chemicals ===

[[Fragrance]] chemicals are found in most cleaning products, perfumes, and [[personal care]] products. More than 3000 chemicals are used in these fragrance mixtures. The synthetic musks used in [[detergent]]s accumulate in the environment and are harmful to aquatic organisms. Certain musks are possible [[endocrine disruptor]]s that interfere with hormone functioning. Phthalates are a common ingredient in these fragrance mixtures found in laundry detergents and fabric softeners. These phthalates are suspected endocrine disrupters that affect reproduction rates including reduced sperm count in males. Certain glass cleaners and floor polishes contain dibutyl phthalate (DBP). The European Union classifies DBP as very toxic to aquatic organisms, posing a huge danger as these cleaners, especially the floor polishes are often rinsed down the drain and into aquatic environments.

=== Phosphates ===

[[Phosphates]] are found in many dishwasher detergents, laundry detergents, and bathroom cleaners. They act as a fertilizer in water and in high concentrations can promote algae blooms and increase weed growth. When water containing phosphates are washed into water areas they carry with them [[fertilizer]]s, nutrients, and wastes from the land. [[Phytoplankton]] and algae flourish at the surface due to increased phosphates. Dead phytoplankton and other organisms sink to the bottom giving rise to large numbers of decomposers due to increased food supply (dead organisms, phytoplankton). Due to the increased number of decomposers that use more oxygen, fish and shrimp at the lower layers of the ocean become oxygen-starved and [[hypoxic zone]]s become apparent.

=== Quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) ===

[[Quats]] are [[anti-microbial]] agents that are found in bathroom cleaners, [[fabric softener]]s, and degreasers. They are a class of irritants and [[Allergy|sensitizers]] that negatively affect people who suffer from asthma. Chemicals in this class are persistent in aquatic environments, and toxic to the organisms that live in these environments. Many researchers are concerned that their widespread use in everyday household [[disinfectant]]s and cosmetics are contributing to [[antibiotic resistant]] bacteria, thus limiting microbial infection treatment options.

===Trisodium nitrilotriacetate===

Trisodium [[nitrilotriacetate]] is found in bathroom cleaners and possibly some laundry detergents although more actively used in industrial formulations. Small amounts add up in the environment and add to an overall toxic issue. In aquatic ecosystems these chemicals cause [[heavy metal (chemical element)|heavy metals]] in [[sediment]] to redisolve and many of these metals are toxic to fish and other wildlife.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"/&gt;

== Plasticizers ==
[[Phthalates]] and [[Bisphenol A|BPA]] date back to the 1920s and 1930s. Phthalates have been applied as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) additives since 1926, but were also used for health care purposes as [[insect repellent]]s and [[cercaricides]]. BPA is present in most aquatic environments, entering water systems through [[landfill]]s and [[sewage treatment plant]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] allowing for [[bioaccumulation]] in aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=Oehlmann2009&gt;{{cite journal|author = Oehlmann, J. | author2 = Oehlmann, U.S. | author3 = Kolas, W. | author4 = Jagnytsch, O. |author5=Lutz, I. | author6 = Kusk, K.O. | author7 = Wollenberger, L. | author8 = Santos E.M. | author9 = Paull, G.C. | author10 = Van Look, K.J.W. | author11 = Tyler, C.R. | date = 2009| title = A critical analysis of the biological impacts of plasticizers on wildlife. |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume= 364| issue = | pages = 2047–2062 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0242 | pmid=19528055 | pmc=2873012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These endocrine disrupters are a large group of chemicals that enter into the aquatic environment through the manufacturing of various industrial and consumer products, agriculture and food/drug processing, waste water treatment plants and human wastes. Phthalate esters are common additives that soften and make PVC more flexible.&lt;ref name=Barse2007&gt;{{cite journal|author = Barse, A. V.| author2 = Chakrabarti, T. | author3 = Ghosh, T.K. | author4 = Pal, A.K. |author5=Jadhao, S.B.| date = 2007| title = Endocrine disruption and metabolic changes following exposure of Cyprinus carpio to diethyl phthalate |journal= Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology |volume= 88| issue = | pages = 36–42 | doi=10.1016/j.pestbp.2006.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in many everyday items such as medical devices, packaging for fragrances and cosmetics, ropes and varnishes, in plastic used to wrap food, and shower curtains. These Phthalate esters have been found in areas of water, air, sediment, and in gulfs and rivers around the world, Giam et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; Phalates and BPA affect reproduction in animal groups such as Molluscs, crustaceans, amphibians and fish. Most of these plasticizers affect hormone systems, and some phthalates have even larger pathways of disruption. Phthalates and BPA have been proven to affect development and reproduction in a variety of species. Disturbances include changes in the number of offspring produced and reduced hatching success. In amphibians for example, phthalates and BPA disrupt thyroid functioning which in turn impacts larval development. Molluscs, crustaceans and amphibians appear to be more responsive than fish, with most effects being induced in low concentration ranges with the exception of disrupted [[spermatogenesis]] in fish in the low range.&lt;ref name="Oehlmann2009"/&gt; 
A Phthalate referred to as [[diethyl phthalate]] (DEP) enters the aquatic environment through industries that manufacture cosmetics, plastics and many commercial products that pose hazards to aquatic organisms and human health. Through exposing an adult male common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) to [[LC50]] doses it was evident that a bioaccumulation of DEP in testis, liver, brain, gills and muscle tissue was present. Fish exposed to 20 ppm of DEP became drowsy and discolored during the onset of the fourth week.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; 
Sources of DEP contamination and accumulation in humans include cosmetic products and dietary meat of fish, Persky et al.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; This DEP acts as a cosmetic ingredient and vehicle for fragrances, both which come in contact with the skin. 
Many countries around the world including India practice sewage fed fisheries where waste waters are used for the purpose of culturing fish. Endocrine disruption and a presence of phthalate residue is highly likely to be observable in these sewage fed fish. This is the case as waste water from various industries and garbage containing DEP are released into these waters. Through a DEP treatment with [[Cyprinus carpio]], liver size was observed to increase and testis size decreased. In fish, muscle ALT and AST activities decreased as it was effected by DEP treatment.  Like many toxic chemicals DEP has been known to affect metabolic enzyme profiles and activities of phosphatases and transaminases, Ghorpade et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; A decrease in immunity of [[M. rosenbergii]] after exposure to DEP was also noted. 
Given that biological effect concentrations for plasticizers used in the laboratory coincide with concentrations present in the environment, it seems that some wildlife species must be negatively impacted.

== Personal hygiene products ==
Personal care products can reach the environment through drainage from waste water treatment plants and digested sludge. Recently, the anti-dandruff and [[antimycotic]], [[Climbazole]], was detected in waste water treatment drainages. Climbazole is readily used in cosmetics, and is an ingredient in anti-dandruff shampoos. Shampoos contain formulations of up to 2.0% which is the equivalent of approximately 15g/L. Climbazole is classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. It affects the growth of green algae [[Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata]] at very low concentrations. [[Zebrafish]] experienced lethal effects after exposure to climbazole in laboratory testing. Effects included thickening of fertilized eggs, lack of somite formation, lack of detachment of the tail bud from the yolk sac, and lack of a heartbeat were evaluated after 48 hours.&lt;ref name=Richter2013&gt;{{cite journal|author = Richter, E. | author2 = Wick, A. | author3 = Ternes, T.A. | author4 = Coors, A. | date = 2013| title = Ecotoxicity of Climbzole, a fungicide contained in Antridandruff shampoo. |journal= Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry  |volume= 32| issue = | pages = 2816–2825 | doi=10.1002/etc.2367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Danio rerio]], [[Lemna minor]], [[Navicula pelliculosa]], Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and [[Daphnia magna]] were tested and all were found to be negatively affected by climbazole in a concentration-dependant manner with highest toxicity observed in L. minor. Effects included stunted colony growth and darkening in color. Effects of climbazole on [[oats]] and [[turnip]] included retarded, stunted growth of the leaves and shoot as well as turning darker in color. The aquatic ecotoxicity of climbazole can be classified as very toxic to Lemna and algae, toxic to fish and harmful to Daphnia.&lt;ref name="Richter2013"/&gt;

== Pesticides == 
[[Pesticides]] often pose serious problems as they kill not only targeted organisms but also non-targeted organisms in the process. They are released into the natural environment intentionally by people who are often unaware that the chemicals will travel further than anticipated, Hatakeyama et al. as cited in.&lt;ref name=Hanazato2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hanazato T. | date = 2001 | title = Pesticide effects on freshwater zooplankton: an ecological perspective | url = | journal = Environmental Pollution  | volume = 112 | issue = 1| pages = 1–10 | doi=10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00110-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the pesticides largely affect the natural communities in which they are used. They negatively effect multiple levels ranging from molecules to tisues to organs to individuals to populations and onto communities. In the natural environment, a combination of pesticide exposure and natural stressors such as fluctuating temperature, food shortage or decreased oxygen availability are worse than when presented alone. Pesticides can affect the feeding rates of zoo-plankton. In the presence of pesticides zoo-plankton display lower feeding rates which result in reduced growth and reproduction. Swimming may also be affected by pesticides which poses a life-threatening issue for zoo-plankton as they swim to obtain food and nutrients and avoid predators. Such changes may alter predator-prey relationships. A spinning behavior became apparent in Daphnia induced by carbaryl which increased the probability of the Daphnia being eaten by other fish, Dodson et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Hanazato2001"/&gt; The toxicant [[pentachlorophenol]] increases swimming speed in the rotifer [[Brachionus calyciflorus]], in turn increasing the encounter rate of the prey with their predators, Preston et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Hanazato2001"/&gt;

== Oil spills == 
One of the major environmental impacts of oil exploration on the environment is the contamination of aquatic ecosystems from [[oil spill]]s and oil seepages from pits. Oftentimes, as is the case in the [[Ecuadorian Amazon]], oil is used to control [[dust]] on roadways, causing the precipitation [[surface runoff|runoff]] from these roads to also be contaminated. Direct human health hazards occur since many people, including children walk barefoot on these oiled roads putting them in direct contact with the crude oil. Other hazards to humans include [[seepage]]s into ponds that provide drinking water for the population. 
During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. Environmental concerns are primarily focused on a group of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs). “PAHs accumulate on particles and sediments, which tend to protect them from biodegrading processes", Green and Trett as cited in.&lt;ref name=Wernersson2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wernersson A.S. | date = 2004 | title = Aquatic ecotoxicity due to oil pollution in the Ecuadorian Amazon. | url = | journal = Aquatic Ecosystem Health &amp; Management | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 127–136 | doi=10.1080/14634980490281470}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. 
Samples were collected from four sites (13 stations) in the Ecuadorian Amazon where crude oil was the main pollutant. The water collected from Site B, a drinking water pond located 100m from an in use pit, had the highest [[total petroleum hydrocarbon]] (THP) concentration. Sediments were found to be acutely [[phototoxic]]. This area which has poorly developed infrastructure is one where residents collect water for drinking, cooking and bathing from the rivers and ponds nearby. “A recent study observed excess [[cancer rate]]s in a village in this region” Sebastian et. Al, as cited in.&lt;ref name="Wernersson2004"/&gt; Not only were excess cancer rates apparent but many people in this area that were consuming the water for drinking purposes became ill.
In Wernersson’s study, toxicity of water and sediment samples were studied on Daphnia magna (a crustacean zoo-plankton species) and [[Hyalella azteca]] (an amphipod). These samples were collected from four sites where crude oil was the main source of pollution. 1-4 day old organisms of both species were used in the tests. Immobility of D. magna was recorded after 24 hours of exposure indoors. They were then moved outdoors where they were exposed to sunlight. After 1–2 hours the samples were removed from the sunlight and it was found that D. Magna often recovered within an hour after UV exposure.
Hyalella azteca was cultured in the same medium as was used for the D. Magna species. To minimize stress shade was provided. 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness were provided. [[Lethality]] was recorded after 96 hours of exposure.

'''Engineering fits''' are generally used as part of [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] when a part or assembly is designed. In engineering terms, the "fit" is the clearance between two mating parts, and the size of this clearance determines whether the parts can move independently from each other, or are then temporarily or even permanently joined. Engineering fits are generally described as a "shaft and hole" but are not limited to just round components. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] is the internationally accepted standard for defining engineering fits, but [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] is often still used in North America.

ISO and ANSI both group fits into three categories: clearance, location or transition, and interference. Within each category are several codes to define the size limits of the hole or shaft - the combination of which determines the type of fit. A fit is usually selected at the design stage according to whether the mating parts need to be accurately located, free to slide or rotate, separated easily, or resist separation. Cost is also a major factor in selecting a fit, as more accurate fits will be more expensive to produce, and tighter fits will be more expensive to assemble.

==ISO system of limits and fits==

=== Overview ===
The [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organisation for Standardization]] system splits the three main categories into several individual fits based on the allowable limits for hole and shaft size. Each fit is allocated a code, made up of a number and a letter, which is used on engineering drawings in place of upper &amp; lower size limits to reduce clutter in detailed areas.

=== Hole and shaft basis ===
A fit is either specified as shaft-basis or hole-basis, depending on which part has its size controlled to determine the fit. To elaborate: in a hole-basis system, the size of the hole remains constant and it is the diameter of the shaft that is varied to determine the fit; conversely in a shaft-basis system, the size of shaft remains constant and the hole diameter is varied to determine the fit.

The ISO system uses an alpha-numeric code to illustrate the tolerance ranges for the fit, with the upper-case representing the hole tolerance and lower-case representing the shaft. For example, in H7/h6 (a commonly-used fit) H7 represents the tolerance range of the hole and h6 represents the tolerance range of the shaft. These codes can be used by machinists or engineers to quickly identify the upper and lower size limits for either the hole or shaft. The potential range of clearance or interference can be found by subtracting the smallest shaft diameter from the largest hole, and largest shaft from the smallest hole.

=== Types of fit ===
The three types of fit are:
# Clearance - the hole is larger than the shaft, enabling the two parts to slide and / or rotate when assembled. 
# Location / transition - the hole is fractionally smaller than the shaft and mild force is required to assemble / disassemble 
# Interference - the hole is smaller than the shaft and high force and / or heat is required to assemble / disassemble

== ANSI fit classes (USA Only) ==

=== Interference fits ===

{{main|Interference fit}}

''Interference Fits
', also known as ''Press Fits'' or ''Friction Fits'', are fastenings between two parts in which the inner component is larger than the outer component. Achieving an interference fit requires applying force during assembly. After the parts are joined, the mating surfaces will feel pressure due to friction, and deformation of the completed assembly will be observed.

==== Force fits ====
''Force fits'' are designed to maintain a controlled pressure between mating parts, and are used where forces or torques are being transmitted through the joining point. Like interference fits, force fits are achieved by applying a force during component assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Robert|title=Machine Elements in Mechanical Design|publisher=Pearson|page=495|edition=Fifth|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cat more|Interference fit#Force}}
FN 1 to FN 5

==== Shrink fits ====

''Shrink fits'' serve the same purpose as force fits, but are achieved by heating one member to expand it while the other remains cool. The parts can then be easily put together with little  applied force, but after cooling and contraction, the same dimensional interference exists as for a force fit. Like force fits, shrink fits range from FN 1 to FN 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Robert|title=Machine Elements in Mechanical Design|publisher=Pearson|page=495|edition=Fifth|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cat more|Interference fit#Thermal expansion or contraction}}

=== Location fits ===

Location fits are for parts that do not normally move relative to each other.

==== Location interference fit ==== &lt;!-- The upper case N in interference is intentional to highlight the source and be a memory aid for the N in LN. --&gt;
LN 1 to LN 3  ( or LT 7 to LT 21? {{citation needed|date=January 2016}} )

==== Location transition fit ====
LT 1 to LT 6

==== Location clearance fit====
LC 1 to LC 11

=== RC fits ===
The smaller RC numbers have smaller clearances for tighter fits, the larger numbers have larger clearances for looser fits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobanengineering.com/Tolerances/ANSILimitsAndFits.asp|accessdate=9 September 2013|title=ANSI Standard Limits and Fits (ANSI B4.1-1967,R1974)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== RC1: close sliding fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended for the accurate location of parts which must assemble without noticeable play.

==== RC2: sliding fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended for the accurate location but with greater maximum clearance than class RC1. Parts made to this fit turn and move easily. This type is not designed for free run. Sliding fits in larger sizes may seize with small temperature changes due to little allowance for thermal expansion or contraction.

==== RC3: precision running fits ====

Fits of this kind are about the closest fits which can be expected to run freely. Precision fits are intended for precision work at low speed, low bearing pressures, and light journal pressures. RC3 is not suitable where noticeable temperature differences occur.

==== RC4: close running fits ====

Fits of this kind are mostly for running fits on accurate machinery with moderate surface speed, bearing pressures, and journal pressures where accurate location and minimum play are desired. Fits of this kind also can be described as smaller clearances with higher requirements for precision fit.

==== RC5 and R6: medium running fits ====

Fits of this kind are designed for machines running at higher running speeds, considerable bearing pressures, and heavy journal pressure. Fits of this kind also can be described with greater clearances with common requirements for fit precision.

==== RC7: free running fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended to use where accuracy is not essential. It is suitable for great temperature variations. This fit is suitable to use without any special requirements for precise guiding of shafts.

==== RC8 and RC9: loose running fits ====

This kind of fit is intended for use where wide commercial tolerances may be required on the shaft. With this fits, the parts with great clearances with having great tolerances. Loose running fits exposed to effects of corrosion, contamination by dust and thermal or mechanical deformations.

'''Figured bass''', or '''thoroughbass''', is a kind of [[musical notation]] in which numerals and symbols (often [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]) indicate [[interval (music)|intervals]], [[chord (music)|chord]]s, and [[non-chord tone]]s that a musician playing [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[lute]] (or other instruments capable of playing chords) play in relation to the bass note that these numbers and symbols appear above or below. Figured bass is closely associated with [[#Basso continuo|basso continuo]], a historically improvised [[accompaniment]] used in almost all genres of music in the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]] of [[Classical music]] ({{circa}}1600–1750), though rarely in modern music.

Other systems for [[Chord (music)#Notation|denoting or representing chords]] include&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Benward |first1=Bruce |last2=Marilyn Nadine |first2=Saker |year=2003 |title=Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I |publisher=Mcgraw-Hill |edition=7th |publication-place=N.Y.|page=77 |ISBN=978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; plain [[staff notation]], used in [[classical music]]; [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]], commonly used in [[harmonic analysis (music)|harmonic analysis]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Schoenberg |first=Arnold |year=1983 |title=Structural Functions of Harmony |publisher=Mcgraw-Hill |edition=7th |publication-place=London |pages=1–2 |ISBN= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Macro analysis|macro symbols]], sometimes used in modern [[musicology]]; the [[Nashville number system]]; and various [[Chord names and symbols (jazz and pop music)|chord names and symbols]] used in [[jazz]] and [[popular music]] (e.g., [[Major chord|C Major]] or simply C; [[Minor chord|D minor]] or Dm; [[Dominant seventh|G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;]], etc.).

==Basso continuo==&lt;!--[[Basso continuo]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
Basso continuo parts, almost universal in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era (1600–1750), provided the [[harmony (music)|harmonic]] structure of the music. The phrase is often shortened to ''continuo'', and the instrumentalists playing the continuo part are called the ''continuo group''.

The makeup of the continuo group is often left to the discretion of the performers, and practice varied enormously within the Baroque period. At least one instrument capable of playing chords must be included, such as a [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]], [[guitar]], [[Regal (instrument)|regal]], or [[harp]]. In addition, any number of instruments which play in the [[bass (music)|bass]] register may be included, such as [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[viol|bass viol]], or [[bassoon]]. The most common combination, at least in modern performances, is harpsichord and cello for instrumental works and secular vocal works, such as [[opera]]s, and organ for [[sacred music]]. Typically performers match the [[Family (musical instruments)|instrument families]] used in the full ensemble: including bassoon when the work includes oboes or other winds, but restricting it to cello and/or [[double bass]] if only strings are involved. [[Harp]]s, lutes, and other handheld instruments are more typical of early 17th-century music. Sometimes instruments are specified by the composer: in ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) [[Monteverdi]] calls for an exceptionally varied instrumentation, with multiple harpsichords and lutes with a [[bass violin]] in the pastoral scenes followed by lamenting to the accompaniment of [[Positive organ|''organo di legno'']] and ''[[chitarrone]]'', while [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] stands watch to the sound of a regal.

The keyboard (or other chord-playing instrument) player ''realizes'' a continuo part by playing, in addition to the notated bass line, notes above it to complete chords, either determined ahead of time or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] in performance. The figured bass notation, described below, is a guide, but performers are also expected to use their musical judgment and the other instruments or voices (notably the lead [[melody]] and any [[accidental (music)|accidental]]s that might be present in it) as a guide. Experienced players sometimes incorporate [[Motive (music)|motives]] found in the other instrumental parts into their improvised chordal accompaniment. Modern editions of such music usually supply a realized keyboard part, fully written out in [[staff notation]] for a player, in place of improvisation. With the rise in [[historically informed performance]], however, the number of performers who are able to improvise their parts from the figures, as Baroque players would have done, has increased.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Basso continuo, though an essential structural and identifying element of the Baroque period, continued to be used in many works, mostly (but not limited to) sacred choral works, of the [[Classical music era|classical]] period (up to around 1800).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://thegreathistoryofarts.weebly.com/classical-era.html Classical Era (1750-1820)]", ''TheGreatHistoryofArts.Weebly.com''. Accessed: 27 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--Source emphasizes the rapid decline of continuo practice in the Classical Era, and does not say what sort of music might have proved most resistant to this discontinuance.--&gt; An example is [[C. P. E. Bach]]'s Concerto in D minor for flute, strings and basso continuo. Examples of its use in the 19th century are rarer, but they do exist: [[mass (music)|mass]]es by [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert]], for example, have a basso continuo part that was for an organist.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Figured bass notation==
A part notated with figured bass consists of a [[bass line]] notated with [[Musical note|note]]s on a [[musical staff]] plus added numbers and [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]s (or in some cases [[Backslash|(back)slash]]es added to a number) beneath the staff to indicate what [[interval (music)|interval]]s above the bass notes should be played, and therefore which [[Inverted chord|inversions]] of which chords are to be played.

The phrase ''[[tasto solo]]'' indicates that only the bass line (without any upper chords) is to be played for a short period, usually until the next figure is encountered. This instructs the chord-playing instrumentalist not to play any improvised chords for a period. The reason ''tasto solo'' had to be specified was because it was an accepted convention that if no figures were present in a section of otherwise figured bass line, the chord-playing performer would either assume that it was a [[root-position]] triad, or deduce from the harmonic motion that another figure was implied. For example, if a continuo part in the key of C begins with a C bass note in the first measure, which descends to a B{{music|natural}} in the second measure, even if there were no figures, the chord-playing instrumentalist would deduce that this was most likely a [[first inversion]] [[dominant chord]] (spelled B–D–G, from bottom note of the chord to the top).

Composers were inconsistent in the usages described below. Especially in the 17th century, the numbers were omitted whenever the composer thought the chord was obvious. Early composers such as [[Claudio Monteverdi]] often specified the octave by the use of [[interval (music)|compound intervals]] such as 10, 11, and 15.

Contemporary figured bass abbreviations for triads and seventh chords are shown in the table to the right.

The numbers indicate the number of [[Scale (music)|scale]] steps above the given bass-line that a note should be played.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/courses/MU182A/upload/Figured-Bass-Notation.pdf|title=Figured Bass Notation|last=Vigil|first=R|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c1 } \figures { &lt; 6 4 &gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

Here, the bass note is a C, and the numbers 4 and 6 indicate that notes a fourth and a sixth above it should be played, that is an F and an A. In other words, the second inversion of an F major chord can be realized as:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;a f c&gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

In cases where the numbers 3 or 5 would normally be understood, these are usually left out. For example:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \clef bass &lt;&lt; { \cadenzaOn c1 b, g, } \figures { &lt; _ &gt;1 &lt; 6 &gt; &lt; 7 &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

has the same meaning as

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \clef bass &lt;&lt; { \cadenzaOn c1 b, g, } \figures { &lt; 5 3 &gt;1 &lt; 6 3 &gt; &lt; 7 5 3 &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

and can be realized as

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \clef bass \cadenzaOn &lt;c e g&gt;1 &lt;b, d g&gt; &lt;g, b, d f&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

although the performer may choose which octave to play the notes in and will often elaborate them in some way, such as by playing them as [[Arpeggio|arpeggios]] rather than as [[Block chord|block chords]], or by adding improvised [[Ornament (music)|ornaments]], depending on the [[tempo]] and [[texture (music)|texture of the music]].

Sometimes, other numbers are omitted: a 2 on its own or {{su|b=2|p=4}} indicates {{overset|6|{{SubSup||2|4}}}}, for example. From the figured bass-writer's perspective, this bass note is obviously a [[third inversion]] [[seventh chord]], so the [[sixth interval]] is viewed as an interval that the player should automatically infer. In many cases entire figures can be left out, usually where the chord is obvious from the [[chord progression|progression]] or the melody.

Sometimes the chord changes but the bass note itself is held. In these cases the figures for the new chord are written wherever in the bar they are meant to occur.

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 &lt;&lt; { a'2 g' } \new Staff { \clef bass { c1 } } \figures { &lt; 6 &gt;2 &lt; 5 &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as  &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 &lt;&lt; { a'2 g' } \new Staff { \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;a e&gt;2 &lt;g e&gt; } \\ { c1 } &gt;&gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

When the bass note changes but the notes in the chord above it are to be held, a line is drawn next to the figure or figures, for as long as the chord is to be held, to indicate this:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c2 b, } \figures { \bassFigureExtendersOn &lt; 6 &gt;2 &lt; 6&gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as  &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;e a&gt;1 } \\ { c2 b, }  &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

Note that when the bass moves the chord intervals have effectively changed, in this case from {{su|b=3|p=6}} to {{su|b=4|p=7}}, but no additional numbers are written.

===Accidentals===

When an [[accidental (music)|accidental]] is shown on its own without a number, it applies to the note a third above the lowest note; most commonly, this is the third of the chord.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harmony, Fifth Edition|last=Piston|first=Walter|publisher=W.

Norton|year=1987|isbn=978-0-393-95480-7|location=New York|pages=84-86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, if a number is shown, the accidental affects the said interval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, this, showing the widespread default meaning of an accidental without number as applying to the third above the bass:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { e1 c } \figures { &lt; _+ &gt;1 &lt; 6- _- &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \clef bass &lt;e gis b&gt;1 &lt;c ees aes&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

Sometimes the accidental is placed after the number rather than before it.

Alternatively, a cross placed next to a number indicates that the pitch of that note should be raised ([[augmented interval|augmented]]) by a [[semitone]] (so that if it is normally a [[flat (music)|flat]] it becomes a natural, and if it is normally a natural it becomes a [[sharp (music)|sharp]]). A different way to indicate this is to draw a [[backslash]] through the number itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The following three notations, therefore, all indicate the same thing:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c1 c c } \figures { &lt; 6! &gt;1 &lt; 6\+ &gt; &lt;6\\&gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can all be realized as &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;c ees a&gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

More rarely, a ''forward'' slash through a number indicates that a pitch is to be lowered ([[diminished interval|diminished]]) by a semitone:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c1 c } \figures { &lt; 5- &gt;1 &lt; 5/ &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can both be realized as  &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;c ees ges&gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

When sharps or flats are used with [[key signature]]s, they may have a slightly different meaning, especially in 17th-century music. A sharp might be used to cancel a flat in the key signature, or vice versa, instead of a [[natural sign]].

== History ==

Improvised organ accompaniments for choral works were common by the late 16th century, and separate organ parts showing only a bass line date back to at least 1587.  In the mid-16th century, some Italian church composers began to write [[polychoral]] works. These pieces, for two or more [[choir]]s, were created in recognition of particularly festive occasions, or else to take advantage of certain architectural properties of the buildings in which they were performed which created natural [[reverberation]]. With eight or more [[polyphony|polyphonic]] voice parts to keep track of in performance, works in polychoral style required some sort of instrumental [[accompaniment]]. They were also known as ''cori spezzati'', since the choirs were structured in musically independent or interlocking parts, and may sometimes also have been placed in physically different locations.

The concept of allowing two or more concurrently performing choirs to be independent structurally would probably not have arisen had there not been an already existing practice of choral accompaniment in church.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Financial and administrative records indicate the presence of organs in churches dates back to the 15th century, although their precise use is not known. Many first-person accounts of church services from the 15th and 16th centuries imply organ accompaniment in some portions of the liturgy, as well as indicating that the [[a cappella|unaccompanied]] practice of the ''[[Sistine Chapel Choir|Cappella Sistina]]'' was somewhat unusual. By early in the 16th century, it seems that accompaniment by organ at least in smaller churches was commonplace, and commentators of the time lamented on occasion the declining quality of church choirs. Even more tellingly, many manuscripts, especially from the middle of the century and later, feature written-out organ accompaniments. It is this last observation which leads directly to the foundations of continuo practice, in a somewhat similar one called ''basso seguente'' or "following bass".

Written-out accompaniments are found most often in early polychoral works (those composed, obviously, before the onset of [[concertato|concerted]] style and its explicit instrumental lines), and generally consist of a complete reduction (to what would later be called the "grand staff") of one choir’s parts.  In addition to this, however, for those parts of the music during which that choir rested was presented a single line consisting of the lowest note being sung at any given time, which could be in any vocal part.  Even in early concerted works by the Gabrielis ([[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]]), [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]] and others, the lowest part, that which modern performers colloquially call "continuo", is actually a "basso seguente", though slightly different, since with separate instrumental parts, the lowest note of the moment in the instrumental parts is often lower than any being sung.

The first known published instance of a basso seguente was a book of [[Introit]]s and [[Alleluia]]s by the Venetian [[Placido Falconio]] from 1575. What is known as "figured" continuo, which also features a bass line that because of its structural nature may differ from the lowest note in the upper parts, developed over the next quarter-century. The composer [[Lodovico Grossi da Viadana|Lodovico Viadana]] is often credited with the first publication of such a continuo, in a 1602 collection of motets that according to his own account had been originally written in 1594. Viadana’s continuo, however, did not include figures. The earliest extant part with sharp and flat signs above the staff is a [[motet]] by [[Giovanni Croce]], also from 1594.

Following and figured basses developed concurrently in secular music; such [[madrigal]] (a song style) composers as [[Emilio de' Cavalieri]] and [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi]] began in the late 16th century to write works explicitly for a soloist with accompaniment, following an already standing practice of performing multi-voice madrigals this way, and also responding to the rising influence at certain aristocratic courts of featuring popular individual singers.  This tendency toward solo-with-accompaniment texture in [[secular vocal music]] (non-religious music) culminated in the genre of [[monody]], just as in sacred vocal music it resulted in the [[sacred concerto]] for various forces including few voices and even solo voices. The use of numerals to indicate accompanying sonorities in accompaniment parts began with the earliest [[opera]]s, composed by Cavalieri and [[Giulio Caccini]].

These new genres, just as the polychoral one probably was, were indeed made possible by the existence of a semi- or fully independent bass line.  In turn, the separate bass line, with figures added above to indicate other chordal notes, shortly became "[[Functional harmony|functional]]," as the sonorities became "harmonies," (see [[harmony]] and [[tonality]]), and music came to be seen in terms of a melody supported by [[chord progression]]s ([[homophony]]), rather than interlocking, equally important lines that are used in [[polyphony]].  The figured bass, therefore, was integral to the development of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], by extension the [[Classical music era|”classical”]] style, which built on the innovations of the Baroque era, and by further extension most subsequent musical styles.

As part of the new [[Classical period (music)#The Baroque/Classical transition c. 1730–1760|galant]] style in the mid-18th century, with its emphasis on lighter and more varied textures, and singable melodies, orchestral music gradually phased out the basso continuo, and solo-with-accompaniment textures increasingly featured fully written-out accompaniments. By the second half of the 18th century, figured bass was almost entirely eliminated, except in sacred choral music, where it lingered until well after 1800: Beethoven's [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C major]] (1807), for example, has a figured bass part.

Many composers and theorists of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries wrote "how-to guides" for chord-playing musicians, to aid them in realizing figured bass notation, including [[Gregor Aichinger]], [[Filippo Bonaffino]], [[Friedrich Erhard Niedt]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C. P. E. Bach]], and [[Michael Praetorius]].

==Contemporary uses==
In the 20th and 21st century, figured bass is also sometimes used by [[classical music]]ians as a shorthand way of indicating chords when a [[composer]] is sketching out ideas for a new piece or when a music student is [[Harmonic analysis|analyzing the harmony]] of a notated piece of music (e.g., a Bach chorale or a Chopin piano prelude). Figured bass is not generally used in modern musical compositions, except for neo-Baroque pieces.  A form of figured bass is used in notation of [[accordion]] music; another simplified form is used to notate [[guitar chord]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the 2000s, outside of professional [[Baroque ensemble]]s that specialize in the [[performance practice]] of the Baroque era, the most common use of figured bass notation is to indicate the [[inversion (music)|inversion]] in a harmonic analysis or composer's sketch context, however, often without the staff notation, using letter note names followed with the figure. For instance, if a piano piece had a C major triad in the right hand (C–E–G), with the bass note a G with the left hand, this would be a [[second inversion]] C major chord, which would be written C{{su|b=4|p=6}}. If this same C major triad had an E in the bass, it would be a [[first inversion]] chord, which would be written C{{su|b=3|p=6}} or C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; (this is different from the [[jazz]] notation, where a C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; means the [[major sixth]] chord C–E–G–A, i.e., a C major with an added 6th degree). The symbols can also be used with Roman numerals in analyzing [[diatonic functionality|functional harmony]], a usage called ''figured Roman''; see [[chord symbol]].

The '''French Institute of Petroleum''' (in [[French (language)|French]]: '''''Institut français du pétrole, IFP''''') is a public research organisation in [[France]] founded in 1944&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=French Institute of Petroleum (IFP)|url=http://www.zeroco2.no/projects/developers/french-institute-of-petroleum|journal=http://www.zeroco2.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''Institute of Oil, Fuels and Lubricants''' (''Institut du pétrole, des carburants et des lubrifiants'').

The Institute is based at [[Rueil-Malmaison]] near [[Paris]], and has sites near [[Lyon]] and at [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]].  {{As of|2004}}, it had 1729 employees, a budget of 253 million euros, and was responsible for a post-graduate training centre, [[IFP School]] (also known as the '''''École du pétrole et des moteurs'''''), and an extensive industrial training programme, IFP Training.

IFP has designed several methods to assess the oil potential of a sedimentary rock, amongst others, the Rock-Eval technique using a standardized [[pyrolysis]] apparatus. This technique is used worldwide amongst petroleum companies to compare their results in the same way.

[[File:GlobalFlyer at KSC before launch.jpg|thumb|With a fuel fraction of nearly 85%, the [[Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer|GlobalFlyer]] could carry 5 times its weight in fuel.]]

In [[aerospace engineering]], an aircraft's '''fuel fraction''', '''fuel weight fraction''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brandt | first = Steven | title = Introduction to Aeronautics: a Design Perspective | publisher = AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Ast) | page = 359 | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-56347-701-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a spacecraft's '''propellant fraction''', is the weight of the fuel or propellant divided by the gross take-off weight of the craft (including propellant):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vinh | first = Nguyen | title = Flight Mechanics of High-Performance Aircraft | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | page = 139| year = 1993 | isbn = 0-521-47852-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ \zeta = \frac{\Delta W}{W_1} &lt;/math&gt;

The fractional result of this mathematical division is often expressed as a percent. For aircraft with external [[drop tank]]s, the term '''internal fuel fraction''' is used to exclude the weight of external tanks and fuel. 

Fuel fraction is a key parameter in determining an aircraft's range, the [[Range (aircraft)|distance it can fly without refueling]].
[[Louis Charles Breguet|Breguet]]’s aircraft [[range (aircraft)|range]] equation describes the relationship of range with [[airspeed]], [[lift-to-drag ratio]], [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]], and the part of the total fuel fraction available for cruise, also known as the '''cruise fuel fraction''', or ''' cruise fuel weight fraction'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Fighter aircraft==

At today’s state of the art for jet [[fighter aircraft]], fuel fractions of 29 percent and below typically yield subcruisers; 33 percent provides a quasi–[[supercruise]]r; and 35 percent and above are needed for useful supercruising missions. The U.S. [[F-22 Raptor]]’s fuel fraction is 29 percent,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050908090849/http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=199 8200/27900 = 0.29]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurofighter]] is 31 percent, both similar to those of the subcruising [[F-4 Phantom II]], [[F-15 Eagle]] and the Russian [[Mikoyan MiG-29]] "Fulcrum". The Russian supersonic interceptor, the [[Mikoyan MiG-31]] "Foxhound", has a fuel fraction of over 45 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/do-000812-f22.htm The F-22 Program FACT VERSUS FICTION] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421194617/http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/do-000812-f22.htm |date=2007-04-21 }} by Everest E. Riccioni, Col. USAF, Ret.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Panavia Tornado]] had a relatively low internal fuel fraction of 26 percent, and frequently carried drop tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Spick | first = Mike | title = Brassey's Modern Fighters | publisher = Potomac Books | location = Washington | year = 2002 | pages = 51–53 | isbn = 1-57488-462-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This successful use of bacterial mutagenicity as a screen for carcinogenicity confirmed the use of this methodology as a rapid and efficient test, in comparison to animal testing alone, and led to its further development. The availability of such simpler tests in turn gave rise to greater government oversight and testing of compounds to which the public would be exposed.&lt;ref&gt;

{{evolutionary biology}}

The '''gene-centered view of evolution''', '''gene's eye view''', '''gene selection theory''', or '''selfish gene theory''' holds that adaptive [[evolution]] occurs through the differential survival of competing [[gene]]s, increasing the [[allele frequency]] of those [[allele]]s whose [[phenotypic trait]] effects successfully promote their own propagation, with gene defined as "not just one single physical bit of DNA [but] all replicas of a particular bit of DNA distributed throughout the world".&lt;ref name="selfishgene" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Haig |first=David |authorlink=David Haig (biologist) |date=2012-07-01 |title=The strategic gene |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-012-9315-5 |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=461–479 |doi=10.1007/s10539-012-9315-5 |issn=0169-3867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gardner |first=Andy |title=The Strategic Revolution |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867416311308 |journal=Cell |volume=166 |issue=6 |pages=1345–1348 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proponents of this viewpoint argue that, since [[heritability|heritable]] information is passed from generation to generation almost exclusively by [[DNA]], [[natural selection]] and evolution are best considered from the perspective of genes.

Proponents of the gene-centered viewpoint argue that it permits understanding of diverse phenomena such as [[altruism in animals|altruism]] and [[intragenomic conflict]] that are otherwise difficult to explain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins| date=January 1979 |title=Twelve Misunderstandings of Kin Selection |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1979.tb00682.x/full |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=51 |pages=184–200 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1979.tb00682.x |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ågren |first=J.

The gene-centered view of evolution is a synthesis of the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], the [[particulate inheritance theory]], and the [[Lamarckism|non-transmission of acquired characters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19932-0_3 |title=Life’s dual nature: a way out of the impasse of the gene-centred 'versus' complex systems controversy on life |last=Tiège |first=Alexis De |last2=Tanghe |first2=Koen B. |last3=Braeckman |first3=Johan |authorlink3=Johan Braeckman |last4=Peer |first4=Yves Van de |date=2015 |work=Evolutionary Biology: Biodiversification from Genotype to Phenotype |publisher=Springer, Cham |isbn=9783319199313 |location= |pages=35–52  |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-19932-0_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Crow |first=James F. |date=2001-02-15 |title=The beanbag lives on |url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/35057409 |journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6822 |pages=771–771 |doi=10.1038/35057409}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that those [[allele]]s whose phenotypic effects successfully promote their own propagation will be favorably selected relative to their competitor alleles within the population. This process produces adaptations for the benefit of alleles that promote the reproductive success of the [[organism]], or of other organisms containing the same allele ([[kin altruism]] and [[green-beard effect]]s), or even its own propagation relative to the other [[gene]]s within the same organism ([[Selfish genetic element|selfish genes]] and [[intragenomic conflict]]).

The gene-centered perspective can be traced to the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] who wrote, in his book, ‘Creative Evolution’ (1907)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'Évolution créatrice (Creative Evolution)|last=Bergson|first=Henri|authorlink=Henri Bergson |publisher=|year=1907|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

‘Life is like a current passing from germ to germ through the medium of a developed organism. It is as if the organism itself were only an excrescence, a bud caused to sprout by the former endeavouring to continue itself in a new germ’.

The gene-centered view of [[evolution]] is a model for the evolution of social characteristics such as selfishness and altruism.

===Acquired characteristics===
The formulation of the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] was summarized by [[Maynard Smith]]:

{{quote|If the central dogma is true, and if it is also true that nucleic acids are the only means whereby information is transmitted between generations, this has crucial implications for evolution. It would imply that all evolutionary novelty requires changes in nucleic acids, and that these changes &amp;ndash; mutations &amp;ndash; are essentially accidental and non-adaptive in nature. Changes elsewhere &amp;ndash; in the egg cytoplasm, in materials transmitted through the placenta, in the mother's milk &amp;ndash; might alter the development of the child, but, unless the changes were in nucleic acids, they would have no long-term evolutionary effects.|Maynard Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=John Maynard Smith | last=Maynard Smith | first=J. | year=1998 | title=Evolutionary Genetics | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK | pages=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rejection of the inheritance of acquired characters, combined with [[Ronald Fisher]] the [[statistics|statistician]], giving the subject a mathematical footing, and showing how [[Mendelian genetics]] was compatible with natural selection in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ronald Fisher | last=Fisher | first=R.

===The gene as the unit of selection===

The view of the gene as the [[unit of selection]] was developed mainly in the works of [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okasha |first1=Samir |authorlink1=Samir Okasha |editor1-last=Zalta |editor1-first=Edward N. |editor1-link=Edward N.

According to Williams' 1966 book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'',

{{quote|[t]he essence of the genetical theory of natural selection is a statistical bias in the relative rates of survival of alternatives (genes, individuals, etc.). The effectiveness of such bias in producing adaptation is contingent on the maintenance of certain quantitative relationships among the operative factors. One necessary condition is that the selected entity must have a high degree of permanence and a low rate of endogenous change, relative to the degree of bias (differences in selection coefficients).|Williams,&lt;ref name="williams66"/&gt; 1966, pp. 22&amp;ndash;23}}

Williams argued that "[t]he natural selection of [[phenotype]]s cannot in itself produce cumulative change, because phenotypes are extremely temporary manifestations." Each phenotype is the unique product of the interaction between genome and environment. It does not matter how fit and fertile a phenotype is, it will eventually be destroyed and will never be duplicated.

Since 1954, it has been known that [[DNA]] is the main physical substrate to genetic information, and it is capable of high-fidelity [[DNA replication|replication]] through many generations. So, a particular gene coded in a [[nucleobase]] sequence of a lineage of replicated DNA molecules can have a high permanence and a low rate of endogenous change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/documents/ThirdCulture/h-Ch.1.html|title=A package of information|last=Williams|first=George C.| authorlink=George C. Williams (biologist) |date=1995|website=Edge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In normal sexual reproduction, an entire [[genome]] is the unique combination of father's and mother's chromosomes produced at the moment of fertilization. It is generally destroyed with its organism, because "[[meiosis]] and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] destroy genotypes as surely as death."&lt;ref name="williams66"/&gt; Only half of it is transmitted to each descendant due to [[Mendelian inheritance#Mendel.27s law of segregation|independent segregation]].

And the high prevalence of horizontal gene transfer in [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] means that genomic combinations of these asexually reproducing groups are also transient in evolutionary time: "The traditional view, that prokaryotic evolution can be understood primarily in terms of clonal divergence and periodic selection, must be augmented to embrace gene exchange as a creative force."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gogarten|first=J.

The gene as an informational entity persists for an evolutionarily significant span of time through a lineage of many physical copies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his book ''[[River out of Eden]]'', Dawkins coins the phrase ''[[God's utility function]]'' to explain his view on genes as units of selection. He uses this phrase as a synonym of the "[[meaning of life]]" or the "purpose of life". By rephrasing the word ''purpose'' in terms of what [[economists]] call a [[utility function]], meaning "that which is maximized", Dawkins attempts to [[reverse engineering|reverse-engineer]] the purpose in the mind of the Divine Engineer of Nature, or the ''utility function of god''. Finally, Dawkins argues that it is a mistake to assume that an [[ecosystem]] or a [[species]] as a whole exists for a purpose. He writes that it is incorrect to suppose that individual organisms lead a meaningful life either; in nature, only genes have a utility function – to perpetuate their own existence with indifference to great sufferings inflicted upon the organisms they build, exploit and discard.

===Organisms as vehicles===

Genes are usually packed together inside a genome, which is itself contained inside an organism. Genes group together into genomes because "genetic replication makes use of energy and substrates that are supplied by the metabolic economy in much greater quantities than would be possible without a genetic division of labour."&lt;ref name="haig97"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=David Haig (biologist) | last=Haig | first=D. | year=1997 | chapter=The Social Gene | editor1-first=J. R. | editor1-last=Krebs | editor1-link=John Krebs, Baron Krebs | editor2-first=N. B. | editor2-last=Davies | editor2-link=Nicholas Barry Davies |title=Behavioural Ecology | publisher=Blackwell Scientific, UK | pages=284–304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They build vehicles to promote their mutual interests of jumping into the next generation of vehicles. As Dawkins puts it, organisms are the "[[The Selfish Gene#Crude analogy|survival machine]]s" of genes.&lt;ref name="selfishgene"/&gt;

The phenotypic effect of a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so how is it possible to speak of a gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic ''differences'' between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.

"A gene can have multiple phenotypic effects, each of which may be of positive, negative or neutral value. It is the net selective value of a gene's phenotypic effect that determines the fate of the gene."&lt;ref name="cronin91"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Helena Cronin | last=Cronin | first=H. | year=1991 | title=The Ant and the Peacock | publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK | isbn=0-521-32937-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a gene can cause its bearer to have greater reproductive success at a young age, but also cause a greater likelihood of death at a later age. If the benefit outweighs the harm, averaged out over the individuals and environments in which the gene happens to occur, then phenotypes containing the gene will generally be positively selected and thus the abundance of that gene in the population will increase.

Even so, it becomes necessary to model the genes in combination with their vehicle as well as in combination with the vehicle's environment.

==Selfish-gene theory==
The selfish-gene theory of natural selection can be restated as follows:&lt;ref name="cronin91"/&gt;

{{quote|Genes do not present themselves naked to the scrutiny of natural selection, instead they present their phenotypic effects. [...] Differences in genes give rise to differences in these phenotypic effects. Natural selection acts on the phenotypic differences and thereby on genes. Thus genes come to be represented in successive generations in proportion to the selective value of their phenotypic effects.|Cronin, 1991, p. 60}}

The result is that "the prevalent genes in a sexual population must be those that, as a mean condition, through a large number of genotypes in a large number of situations, have had the most favourable phenotypic effects for their own replication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink=George C. Williams (biologist) | last=Williams | first=G. C. | year=1985 | title=A defense of reductionism in evolutionary biology | journal=Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology | volume=2 | pages=1–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, we expect [[Selfish genetic element|selfish genes]] ("selfish" meaning that it promotes its own survival without necessarily promoting the survival of the organism, group or even species). This theory implies that [[adaptation]]s are the phenotypic effects of genes to maximize their representation in future generations. An adaptation is maintained by selection if it promotes genetic survival directly, or else some subordinate goal that ultimately contributes to successful reproduction.

===Individual altruism and genetic egoism===

The gene is a unit of hereditary information that exists in many physical copies in the world, and which particular physical copy will be replicated and originate new copies does not matter from the gene's point of view.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=George C. Williams (biologist) | last=Williams | first=G. C. | year=1992 | title=Natural Selection: Domains, Levels and Challenges | publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK | isbn=0-19-506932-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A selfish gene could be favored by selection by producing altruism among organisms containing it. The idea is summarized as follows:

{{quote|If a gene copy confers a benefit ''B'' on another vehicle at cost ''C'' to its own vehicle, its costly action is strategically beneficial if ''pB &gt; C'', where ''p'' is the probability that a copy of the gene is present in the vehicle that benefits. Actions with substantial costs therefore require significant values of ''p''. Two kinds of factors ensure high values of ''p'': relatedness (kinship) and recognition (green beards).|Haig,&lt;ref name="haig97"/&gt; 1997, p. 288}}

A gene in a [[somatic (biology)|somatic]] cell of an individual may forego replication to promote the transmission of its copies in the germ line cells. It ensures the high value of ''p = 1'' due to their constant contact and their common origin from the [[zygote]].

The [[kin selection]] theory predicts that a gene may promote the recognition of kinship by historical continuity: a mammalian mother learns to identify her own offspring in the act of giving birth; a male preferentially directs resources to the offspring of mothers with whom he has copulated; the other chicks in a nest are siblings; and so on. The expected altruism between kin is calibrated by the value of ''p'', also known as the [[coefficient of relationship|coefficient of relatedness]]. For instance, an individual has a ''p = 1/2'' in relation to his brother, and ''p = 1/8'' to his cousin, so we would expect, ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', greater altruism among brothers than among cousins. In this vein, geneticist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] famously joked, "Would I lay down my life to save my brother? No, but I would to save two brothers or eight cousins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Clark | first=Ronald W. |authorlink=Ronald W. Clark |year=1968 | title=JBS: The Life and Work of J. B. S. Haldane | isbn=0-340-04444-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, examining the human propensity for altruism, kin selection theory seems incapable of explaining cross-familiar, cross-racial and even cross-species acts of kindness. &lt;!-- A far more expansive explanation for altruism is rooted in the [[green-beard effect]].--&gt;

===Green-beard effect===

[[Green-beard effect]]s gained their name from a thought-experiment of Richard Dawkins,&lt;ref name="selfishgene"/&gt; who considered the possibility of a gene that caused its possessors to develop a green beard and to be nice to other green-bearded individuals. Since then, "green-beard effect" has come to refer to forms of genetic self-recognition in which a gene in one individual might direct benefits to other individuals that possess the gene. Such genes would be ''especially selfish'', benefiting themselves regardless of the fates of their vehicles. After Dawkins predicted them, green-beard genes have been discovered in nature, such as ''Gp-9'' in fire ants (''Solenopsis invicta''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krieger|first=Michael J.

===All kinds of altruism===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}

====Kindness====

On the other hand, a single trait, group reciprocal kindness, is capable of explaining the vast majority of altruism that is generally accepted as "good" by modern societies. Imagine a green-bearding behavioral trait whose recognition does not depend on the recognition of some external feature such as beard color, but relies on recognition of the behavior itself. Imagine now that the behavior is altruistic. The success of such a trait in sufficiently intelligent and undeceived organisms is implicit. Moreover, the existence of such a trait predicts a tendency for kindness to unrelated organisms that are apparently kind, even if the organisms are of a completely different species. Moreover, the gene need not be exactly the same, so long as the effect is similar. Multiple versions of the gene—or even [[meme]]—would have virtually the same effect in a sort of [[symbiotic]] green-bearding cycle of altruism.

====Deceit====

Whenever recognition plays a role in evolution, so does deception. Just like the harmless lizard that has evolved a pattern that mimics its poisonous cousin and therefore tricks predators, the selfish creature may pretend to be kind by "growing a green beard" (whatever that green beard may be). Thus green-bearding and the selfish-gene theory also give rise to an explanation for the evolution of lies and deceit, characteristics that do not benefit the population as a whole.

==Intragenomic conflict==
{{Main|Intragenomic conflict}}

As genes are capable of producing individual altruism, they are capable of producing conflict among genes inside the genome of one individual. This phenomenon is called [[intragenomic conflict]] and arises when one gene promotes its own replication in detriment to other genes in the genome. The classic example is segregation distorter genes that cheat during [[meiosis]] or [[gametogenesis]] and end up in more than half of the functional [[gamete]]s. These genes can persist in a population even when their transmission results in reduced [[fertility]]. Egbert Leigh compared the genome to "a parliament of genes: each acts in its own self-interest, but if its acts hurt the others, they will combine together to suppress it" to explain the relative low occurrence of intragenomic conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Leigh | first=Egbert Giles | year=1971 | title=Adaptation and Diversity | publisher=Cooper, San Francisco, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Price equation==
{{main|Price equation}}

The [[Price equation]] is a [[covariance]] equation that is a mathematical description of [[evolution]] and [[natural selection]]. The Price equation was derived by [[George R. Price]], working in [[London]] to rederive [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s work on [[kin selection]].

==Advocates==
Besides [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], other [[biologist]]s and [[philosopher]]s have expanded and refined the selfish-gene theory, such as [[John Maynard Smith]], [[George R. Price]], [[Robert Trivers]], [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], [[Helena Cronin]], [[David Hull]], [[Philip Kitcher]], and [[Daniel C. Dennett]].

==Criticisms==
The gene-centric view has been opposed by [[Ernst Mayr]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], [[David Sloan Wilson]], and philosopher [[Elliott Sober]]. An alternative, [[multilevel selection]] (MLS), has been advocated by [[E. O. Wilson]], David Sloan Wilson, Sober, Richard E. Michod,&lt;ref name="Philosophy 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shelton |first1=Deborah E. |last2=Michod |first2=Richard E. |title=Philosophical foundations for the hierarchy of life |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |date=3 April 2009 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=391–403 |doi=10.1007/s10539-009-9160-3 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-009-9160-3 |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samir Okasha]].&lt;ref name="Philosophy 2010"/&gt;

Writing in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', Gould has characterized the gene-centered perspective as confusing book-keeping with [[causality]]. Gould views selection as working on many levels, and has called attention to a hierarchical perspective of selection. Gould also called the claims of ''Selfish Gene'' "strict [[adaptationism]]", "ultra-Darwinism", and "Darwinian [[fundamentalism]]", describing them as excessively "[[reductionist]]". He saw the theory as leading to a simplistic "algorithmic" theory of evolution, or even to the re-introduction of a [[teleology|teleological principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 12, 1997 |title=Darwinian Fundamentalism |first=Stephen Jay |last=Gould |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/jun/12/darwinian-fundamentalism/ |work=The New York Review of Books |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr went so far as to say "Dawkins' basic theory of the gene being the object of evolution is totally non-Darwinian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/mayr/mayr_print.html | title=Ernst Mayr: What evolution is | date=31 October 2001 | accessdate=21 July 2010 | publisher=Edge Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gould also addressed the issue of selfish genes in his essay "Caring groups and selfish genes".&lt;ref name="onselfishgenesinpandasthumb"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould | last=Gould | first=S. J. | year=1990 | chapter=Caring Groups and Selfish Genes | title=[[The Panda's Thumb (book)|The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History]] | publisher=Penguin Books, London, UK | pages=72–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould acknowledged that Dawkins was not imputing conscious action to genes, but simply using a shorthand metaphor commonly found in evolutionary writings. To Gould, the fatal flaw was that "no matter how much power Dawkins wishes to assign to genes, there is one thing that he cannot give them – direct visibility to natural selection."&lt;ref name="onselfishgenesinpandasthumb"/&gt; Rather, the unit of selection is the phenotype, not the genotype, because it is phenotypes that interact with the environment at the natural-selection interface. So, in [[Kim Sterelny]]'s summation of Gould's view, "gene differences do not cause evolutionary changes in populations, they register those changes."&lt;ref name="DawkinsvsGould"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sterelny | first=K. | authorlink=Kim Sterelny | year=2007 | title=[[Dawkins vs. Gould]]: Survival of the Fittest | publisher=Icon Books, Cambridge, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Dawkins replied to this criticism in a later book, ''The Extended Phenotype'', that Gould confused particulate genetics with particulate embryology, stating that genes do "blend", as far as their effects on developing phenotypes are concerned, but that they do not blend as they replicate and recombine down the generations.&lt;ref name="extendedphenotype"/&gt;

Since Gould's death in 2002, [[Niles Eldredge]] has continued with counter-arguments to gene-centered natural selection.&lt;ref name="Eldredge2004"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Niles Eldredge | last=Eldredge | first=N. | year=2004 | title=Why We Do It: Rethinking Sex and The Selfish Gene | publisher=W. W. Norton, New York, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eldredge notes that in Dawkins' book ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'', which was published just before Eldredge's book, "Richard Dawkins comments on what he sees as the main difference between his position and that of the late Stephen Jay Gould. He concludes that it is his own vision that genes play a causal role in evolution," while Gould (and Eldredge) "sees genes as passive recorders of what worked better than what".&lt;ref name="Eldredge2004p233"&gt;Eldredge (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;233&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Genetic code.svg|thumb|280px|right|none|alt=Flow of genetic information.|Genes are expressed by being [[Transcription (biology)|transcribed]] into RNA, and this transcript may then be translated into protein.]]
 
'''Gene expression''' is the process by which information from a [[gene]] is used in the synthesis of a functional [[gene product]]. These products are often [[protein]]s, but in non-protein coding genes such as [[Transfer RNA|transfer RNA (tRNA)]] or [[Small nuclear RNA|small nuclear RNA (snRNA)]] genes, the product is a functional [[RNA]].

The process of gene expression is used by all known life—[[eukaryotes]] (including [[multicellular organisms]]), [[prokaryotes]] ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]), and utilized by [[virus]]es—to generate the [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] machinery for life.

Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated, including the [[transcription (biology)|transcription]], [[RNA splicing]], [[Translation (biology)|translation]], and [[post-translational modification]] of a protein. [[Regulation of gene expression|Gene regulation]] gives the [[cell (biology)|cell]] control over structure and function, and is the basis for [[cellular differentiation]], [[morphogenesis]] and the versatility and [[adaptability]] of any [[organism]]. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism.

In [[genetics]], gene expression is the most fundamental level at which the [[genotype]] gives rise to the [[phenotype]], i.e. observable trait. The [[genetic code]] stored in [[DNA]] is "interpreted" by gene expression, and the properties of the expression give rise to the organism's phenotype. Such phenotypes are often expressed by the synthesis of proteins that control the organism's shape, or that act as [[enzyme]]s catalysing specific metabolic pathways characterising the organism. [[Gene regulation|Regulation of gene expression]] is thus critical to an organism's [[developmental biology|development]].

==Mechanism==

===Transcription===
[[File:simple transcription elongation1.svg|thumb|400px|alt=RNA polymerase moving along a stretch of DNA, leaving behind newly synthetized strand of RNA.|The process of transcription is carried out by RNA polymerase (RNAP), Which uses DNA (black) as a template and produces RNA (blue).]]
{{main|Transcription (genetics)}} 
A [[gene]] is a stretch of DNA that [[genetic code|encodes]] information. Genomic DNA consists of two antiparallel and reverse complementary strands, each having [[5']] and [[3']] ends. With respect to a gene, the two strands may be labeled the "[[template strand]]," which serves as a blueprint for the production of an RNA transcript, and the "[[coding strand]]," which includes the DNA version of the transcript sequence.  (Perhaps surprisingly, the "coding strand" is not physically involved in the coding process because it is the "template strand" that is read during transcription.)

The production of the RNA copy of the DNA is called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], and is performed in the nucleus by [[RNA polymerase]], which adds one RNA [[nucleotide]] at a time to a growing RNA strand as per the complementarity law of the bases. This RNA is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template 3' → 5' DNA strand,&lt;ref name="Brueckner2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brueckner F, Armache KJ, Cheung A, Damsma GE, Kettenberger H, Lehmann E, Sydow J, Cramer P | title = Structure-function studies of the RNA polymerase II elongation complex | journal = Acta Crystallographica D | volume = 65 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 112–20 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19171965 | pmc = 2631633 | doi = 10.1107/S0907444908039875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is itself complementary to the coding 5' → 3' DNA strand. Therefore, the resulting 5' → 3' RNA strand is identical to the coding DNA strand with the exception that [[Thymine]]s are replaced with [[uracil]]s (U) in the RNA. A coding DNA strand reading "ATG" is indirectly transcribed through the non-coding strand as "UAC" in RNA.

In prokaryotes, transcription is carried out by a single type of RNA polymerase, which needs a DNA sequence called a [[Pribnow box]] as well as a [[sigma factor]] (σ factor) to start transcription. In eukaryotes, transcription is performed by three types of RNA polymerases, each of which needs a special DNA sequence called the [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and a set of DNA-binding proteins—[[transcription factors]]—to initiate the process. [[RNA polymerase I]] is responsible for transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. [[RNA polymerase II]] (Pol II) transcribes all protein-coding genes but also some non-coding RNAs (e.g., snRNAs, snoRNAs or long non-coding RNAs). Pol II includes a C-terminal domain (CTD) that is rich in serine residues. When these residues are phosphorylated, the CTD binds to various protein factors that promote transcript maturation and modification. [[RNA polymerase III]] transcribes 5S rRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and some small non-coding RNAs (e.g., [[7SK RNA|7SK]]). Transcription ends when the polymerase encounters a sequence called the [[Terminator (genetics)|terminator]].

===RNA processing===
{{main|Post-transcriptional modification}}
While transcription of prokaryotic protein-coding genes creates [[mRNA|messenger RNA]] (mRNA) that is ready for translation into protein, transcription of eukaryotic genes leaves a [[primary transcript]] of RNA ([[Precursor mRNA|pre-mRNA]]), which first has to undergo a series of modifications to become a mature mRNA.

These include 5' ''capping'', which is set of enzymatic reactions that add [[7-methylguanosine]] (m&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;G) to the 5' end of pre-mRNA and thus protect the RNA from degradation by [[exonucleases]]. The m&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;G cap is then bound by [[cap binding complex]] heterodimer (CBC20/CBC80), which aids in mRNA export to cytoplasm and also protect the RNA from decapping.

Another modification is 3' ''cleavage and polyadenylation''. They occur if polyadenylation signal sequence (5'- AAUAAA-3') is present in pre-mRNA, which is usually between protein-coding sequence and terminator. The pre-mRNA is first cleaved and then a series of ~200 adenines (A) are added to form poly(A) tail, which protects the RNA from degradation. Poly(A) tail is bound by multiple [[poly(A)-binding protein]]s (PABP) necessary for mRNA export and translation re-initiation.

[[Image:Pre-mRNA to mRNA.svg|right|thumbnail|350px|right|alt=Pre-mRNA is spliced to form of mature mRNA.|Simple illustration of exons and introns in pre-mRNA and the formation of mature mRNA by splicing. The UTRs are non-coding parts of exons at the ends of the mRNA.]]
A very important modification of eukaryotic pre-mRNA is ''[[RNA splicing]]''. The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs consist of alternating segments called [[exons]] and [[introns]]. During the process of splicing, an RNA-protein catalytical complex known as [[spliceosome]] catalyzes two transesterification reactions, which remove an intron and release it in form of lariat structure, and then splice neighbouring exons together. In certain cases, some introns or exons can be either removed or retained in mature mRNA. This so-called [[alternative splicing]] creates series of different transcripts originating from a single gene. Because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins, splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression.

Extensive RNA processing may be an [[evolution|evolutionary advantage]] made possible by the nucleus of eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, transcription and translation happen together, whilst in eukaryotes, the [[nuclear membrane]] separates the two processes, giving time for RNA processing to occur.

===Non-coding RNA maturation===
{{main|TRNA#tRNA biogenesis|l1=tRNA maturation|RRNA#Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes|l2=rRNA maturation|MicroRNA#Biogenesis|l3=miRNA maturation}}
In most organisms [[ncRNA|non-coding genes (ncRNA)]] are transcribed as precursors that undergo further processing.  In the case of ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), they are often transcribed as a pre-rRNA that contains one or more rRNAs. The pre-rRNA is cleaved and modified (2′-O-methylation and [[pseudouridine]] formation) at specific sites by approximately 150 different small nucleolus-restricted RNA species, called snoRNAs. SnoRNAs associate with proteins, forming snoRNPs. While snoRNA part basepair with the target RNA and thus position the modification at a precise site, the protein part performs the catalytical reaction. In eukaryotes, in particular a snoRNP called RNase, MRP cleaves the 45S pre-rRNA into the 28S, 5.8S, and 18S rRNAs. The rRNA and RNA processing factors form large aggregates called the [[nucleolus]].&lt;ref name="Sirri2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sirri V, Urcuqui-Inchima S, Roussel P, Hernandez-Verdun D | title = Nucleolus: the fascinating nuclear body | journal = Histochemistry and Cell Biology | volume = 129 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–31 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18046571 | pmc = 2137947 | doi = 10.1007/s00418-007-0359-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of transfer RNA (tRNA), for example, the 5' sequence is removed by [[RNase P]],&lt;ref name="pmid9759486"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frank DN, Pace NR | title = Ribonuclease P: unity and diversity in a tRNA processing ribozyme | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 67 | issue =  | pages = 153–80 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9759486 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the 3' end is removed by the [[Ribonuclease Z|tRNase Z]] enzyme&lt;ref name="pmid17305600"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ceballos M, Vioque A | title = tRNase Z | journal = Protein and Peptide Letters | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–45 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17305600 | doi = 10.2174/092986607779816050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the non-templated 3' CCA tail is added by a [[nucleotidyl transferase]].&lt;ref name="pmid15498478"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiner AM | title = tRNA maturation: RNA polymerization without a nucleic acid template | journal = Current Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 20 | pages = R883-5 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15498478 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2004.09.069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[miRNA|micro RNA (miRNA)]], miRNAs are first transcribed as primary transcripts or pri-miRNA with a cap and poly-A tail and processed to short, 70-nucleotide stem-loop structures known as pre-miRNA in the cell nucleus by the enzymes [[Drosha]] and [[Pasha (protein)|Pasha]]. After being exported, it is then processed to mature miRNAs in the cytoplasm by interaction with the endonuclease [[Dicer]], which also initiates the formation of the [[RNA-induced silencing complex|RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)]], composed of the [[Argonaute]] protein.

Even snRNAs and snoRNAs themselves undergo series of modification before they become part of functional RNP complex. This is done either in the nucleoplasm or in the specialized compartments called [[cajal body|Cajal bodies]]. Their bases are methylated or pseudouridinilated by a group of [[Small Cajal body-specific RNA|small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs)]], which are structurally similar to snoRNAs.

===RNA export===
In eukaryotes most mature RNA must be exported to the cytoplasm from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]. While some RNAs function in the nucleus, many RNAs are transported through the [[nuclear pore]]s and into the [[cytosol]]. Notably this includes all RNA types involved in protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="K2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Köhler A, Hurt E | title = Exporting RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm | journal = Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 761–73 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17786152 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases RNAs are additionally transported to a specific part of the cytoplasm, such as a [[synapse]]; they are then towed by [[motor protein]]s that bind through linker proteins to specific sequences (called "zipcodes") on the RNA.&lt;ref name="Jambhekar2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jambhekar A, Derisi JL | title = Cis-acting determinants of asymmetric, cytoplasmic RNA transport | journal = RNA | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 625–42 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17449729 | pmc = 1852811 | doi = 10.1261/rna.262607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
[[File:Ribosome mRNA translation en.svg|300px|thumb|right|alt=Ribosome translating messenger RNA to chain of amino acids (protein).|During the translation, tRNA charged with amino acid enters the ribosome and aligns with the correct mRNA triplet. Ribosome then adds amino acid to growing protein chain.]]
{{main|Translation (genetics)}}
For some RNA (non-coding RNA) the mature RNA is the final gene product.&lt;ref name="Amaral2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amaral PP, Dinger ME, Mercer TR, Mattick JS | title = The eukaryotic genome as an RNA machine | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5871 | pages = 1787–9 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18369136 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155472 | bibcode = 2008Sci...319.1787A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of messenger RNA (mRNA) the RNA is an information carrier coding for the synthesis of one or more proteins. mRNA carrying a single protein sequence (common in eukaryotes) is [[monocistronic]] whilst mRNA carrying multiple protein sequences (common in prokaryotes) is known as [[polycistronic]].

Every mRNA consists of three parts: a 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), a protein-coding region or open reading frame (ORF), and a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The coding region carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the [[genetic code]] to form triplets. Each triplet of nucleotides of the [[coding region]] is called a [[codon]] and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in transfer RNA. Transfer RNAs with the same anticodon sequence always carry an identical type of [[amino acid]]. Amino acids are then chained together by the [[ribosome]] according to the order of triplets in the coding region. The ribosome helps transfer RNA to bind to messenger RNA and takes the amino acid from each transfer RNA and makes a structure-less protein out of it.&lt;ref name="Hansen2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hansen TM, Baranov PV, Ivanov IP, Gesteland RF, Atkins JF | title = Maintenance of the correct open reading frame by the ribosome | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 499–504 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12717454 | pmc = 1319180 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.embor825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berk2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berk V, Cate JH | title = Insights into protein biosynthesis from structures of bacterial ribosomes | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 302–9 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17574829 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2007.05.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each mRNA molecule is translated into many protein molecules, on average ~2800 in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwanhäusser B, Busse D, Li N, Dittmar G, Schuchhardt J, Wolf J, Chen W, Selbach M | title = Global quantification of mammalian gene expression control | journal = Nature | volume = 473 | issue = 7347 | pages = 337–42 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21593866 | doi = 10.1038/nature10098 | bibcode = 2011Natur.473..337S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwanhäusser B, Busse D, Li N, Dittmar G, Schuchhardt J, Wolf J, Chen W, Selbach M | title = Corrigendum: Global quantification of mammalian gene expression control | journal = Nature | volume = 495 | issue = 7439 | pages = 126–7 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23407496 | doi = 10.1038/nature11848 | bibcode = 2013Natur.495..126S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prokaryotes translation generally occurs at the point of transcription (co-transcriptionally), often using a messenger RNA that is still in the process of being created. In eukaryotes translation can occur in a variety of regions of the cell depending on where the protein being written is supposed to be. Major locations are the [[cytoplasm]] for soluble cytoplasmic proteins and the membrane of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] for proteins that are for export from the cell or insertion into a cell [[lipid bilayer|membrane]]. Proteins that are supposed to be expressed at the endoplasmic reticulum are recognised part-way through the translation process. This is governed by the [[signal recognition particle]]—a protein that binds to the ribosome and directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum when it finds a [[signal peptide]] on the growing (nascent) amino acid chain.&lt;ref name="Hegde2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hegde RS, Kang SW | title = The concept of translocational regulation | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 182 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–32 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18644895 | pmc = 2483521 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200804157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folding===

[[Image:Protein folding.png|thumb|right|300px|alt=Process of protein folding.|Protein before (left) and after (right) folding]] 
The [[Peptide|polypeptide]] folds into its characteristic and functional [[protein structure|three-dimensional structure]] from a [[random coil]].&lt;ref name=Alberts&gt;{{cite book | last =Alberts| first =Bruce| first2 = Alexander | last2 = Johnson | first3 = Julian | last3 = Lewis | first4 = Martin | last4 = Raff | first5 = Keith | last5 = Roberts | first6 = Peter | last6 = Walters | name-list-format = vanc  | title =Molecular Biology of the Cell; Fourth Edition | publisher =Garland Science| year =2002 | location =New York and London | chapter =The Shape and Structure of Proteins |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=books&amp;doptcmdl=GenBookHL&amp;term=mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+372270%5Buid%5D&amp;rid=mboc4.section.388 | isbn =0-8153-3218-1 | authorlink =Bruce Alberts}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each [[protein]] exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of [[mRNA]] into a linear chain of [[amino acid]]s. This polypeptide lacks any developed three-dimensional structure (the left hand side of the neighboring figure). Amino acids interact with each other to produce a well-defined three-dimensional structure, the folded protein (the right hand side of the figure) known as the [[native state]]. The resulting three-dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence ([[Anfinsen's dogma]]).&lt;ref name="Anfinsen"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anfinsen CB | title = The formation and stabilization of protein structure | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 737–49 | date = July 1972 | pmid = 4565129 | pmc = 1173893 | doi = 10.1042/bj1280737 | authorlink = Christian B.

The correct three-dimensional structure is essential to function, although some parts of functional proteins [[Intrinsically unstructured proteins|may remain unfolded]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy M.

===Translocation ===
Secretory proteins of eukaryotes or prokaryotes must be translocated to enter the secretory pathway. Newly synthesized proteins are directed to the eukaryotic Sec61 or prokaryotic SecYEG translocation channel by [[signal peptide]]s. The efficiency of protein secretion in eukaryotes is very dependent on the [[signal peptide]] which has been used.&lt;ref name="pmid23124363"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kober L, Zehe C, Bode J | title = Optimized signal peptides for the development of high expressing CHO cell lines | journal = Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume = 110 | issue = 4 | pages = 1164–73 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23124363 | doi = 10.1002/bit.24776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein transport===
Many proteins are destined for other parts of the cell than the cytosol and a wide range of signalling sequences or [[Signal peptide|(signal peptides)]] are used to direct proteins to where they are supposed to be. In prokaryotes this is normally a simple process due to limited compartmentalisation of the cell. However, in eukaryotes there is a great variety of different targeting processes to ensure the protein arrives at the correct organelle.

Not all proteins remain within the cell and many are exported, for example, [[digestive enzymes]], [[hormone]]s and [[extracellular matrix]] proteins. In eukaryotes the export pathway is well developed and the main mechanism for the export of these proteins is translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by transport via the [[Golgi apparatus]].&lt;ref name="Moreau2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreau P, Brandizzi F, Hanton S, Chatre L, Melser S, Hawes C, Satiat-Jeunemaitre B | title = The plant ER-Golgi interface: a highly structured and dynamic membrane complex | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–64 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16990376 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erl135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prudovsky2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prudovsky I, Tarantini F, Landriscina M, Neivandt D, Soldi R, Kirov A, Small D, Kathir KM, Rajalingam D, Kumar TK | title = Secretion without Golgi | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 103 | issue = 5 | pages = 1327–43 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 17786931 | pmc = 2613191 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.21513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation of gene expression==
{{main|Regulation of gene expression}}
[[File:Tortie-flame.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A cat with patches of orange and black fur. |The patchy colours of a [[tortoiseshell cat]] are the result of different levels of expression of [[pigmentation]] genes in different areas of the [[skin]].]]

Regulation of gene expression refers to the control of the amount and timing of appearance of the functional product of a gene. Control of expression is vital to allow a cell to produce the gene products it needs when it needs them; in turn, this gives cells the flexibility to adapt to a variable environment, external signals, damage to the cell, and other stimuli.  More generally, gene regulation gives the cell control over all structure and function, and is the basis for [[cellular differentiation]], [[morphogenesis]] and the versatility and adaptability of any organism.

Numerous terms are used to describe types of genes depending on how they are regulated; these include:
* A '''constitutive gene'''&lt;!--Bolded per MOS:BOLD because the phrase redirects here--&gt; is a gene that is transcribed continually as opposed to a facultative gene, which is only transcribed when needed.
* A ''[[housekeeping gene]]'' is a gene that is required to maintain basic cellular function and so is typically expressed in all cell types of an organism. Examples include [[actin]], [[GAPDH]] and [[ubiquitin]].  Some housekeeping genes are transcribed at a relatively constant rate and these genes can be used as a reference point in experiments to measure the expression rates of other genes.
* A '''facultative gene'''&lt;!--Bolded per MOS:BOLD because the phrase redirects here--&gt; is a gene only transcribed when needed as opposed to a constitutive gene.
* An '''inducible gene'''&lt;!--Bolded per MOS:BOLD because the phrase redirects here--&gt; is a gene whose expression is either responsive to environmental change or dependent on the position in the cell cycle.

Any step of gene expression may be modulated, from the DNA-RNA transcription step to [[post-translational modification]] of a protein. The stability of the final gene product, whether it is RNA or protein, also contributes to the expression level of the gene—an unstable product results in a low expression level. In general gene expression is regulated through changes&lt;ref name="pmid15277516"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zaidi SK, Young DW, Choi JY, Pratap J, Javed A, Montecino M, Stein JL, Lian JB, van Wijnen AJ, Stein GS | title = Intranuclear trafficking: organization and assembly of regulatory machinery for combinatorial biological control | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 42 | pages = 43363–6 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15277516 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.R400020200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the number and type of interactions between molecules&lt;ref name="pmid19154003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mattick JS, Amaral PP, Dinger ME, Mercer TR, Mehler MF | title = RNA regulation of epigenetic processes | journal = BioEssays | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–9 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19154003 | doi = 10.1002/bies.080099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that collectively influence transcription of DNA&lt;ref name="pmid19274664"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez NJ, Walhout AJ | title = The interplay between transcription factors and microRNAs in genome-scale regulatory networks | journal = BioEssays | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 435–45 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19274664 | pmc = 3118512 | doi = 10.1002/bies.200800212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and translation of RNA.&lt;ref name="pmid18348251"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomilin NV | title = Regulation of mammalian gene expression by retroelements and non-coding tandem repeats | journal = BioEssays | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 338–48 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18348251 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some simple examples of where gene expression is important are:
* Control of [[insulin]] expression so it gives a signal for [[blood glucose regulation]].
* [[X-inactivation|X chromosome inactivation]] in female [[mammals]] to prevent an "overdose" of the genes it contains.
* [[Cyclin]] expression levels control progression through the eukaryotic [[cell cycle]].

===Transcriptional regulation===
{{main|Transcriptional regulation}}
[[File:Regulation of Lactose Metabolism in Prokaryotes.svg|thumb|When lactose is present in a prokaryote, it acts as an inducer and inactivates the repressor so that the genes for lactose metabolism can be transcribed.]]
Regulation of transcription can be broken down into three main routes of influence; genetic (direct interaction of a control factor with the gene), modulation interaction of a control factor with the transcription machinery and epigenetic (non-sequence changes in DNA structure that influence transcription).

[[File:Lambda repressor 1LMB.png|thumb|185px|right|alt=Ribbon diagram of the lambda repressor dimer bound to DNA.|The [[Lambda phage#Repressor|lambda repressor]] transcription factor (green) binds as a dimer to [[Nucleic acid double helix|major groove]] of DNA target (red and blue) and disables initiation of transcription. From {{PDB|1LMB}}.]]

Direct interaction with DNA is the simplest and the most direct method by which a protein changes transcription levels. Genes often have several protein binding sites around the coding region with the specific function of regulating transcription. There are many classes of regulatory DNA binding sites known as [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]]s, [[insulator (genetics)|insulator]]s and [[silencer (genetics)|silencer]]s. The mechanisms for regulating transcription are very varied, from blocking key binding sites on the DNA for [[RNA polymerase]] to acting as an [[activator (genetics)|activator]] and promoting transcription by assisting RNA polymerase binding.

The activity of transcription factors is further modulated by intracellular signals causing protein post-translational modification including [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]], [[acetylation|acetylated]], or [[glycosylation|glycosylated]]. These changes influence a transcription factor's ability to bind, directly or indirectly, to promoter DNA, to recruit RNA polymerase, or to favor elongation of a newly synthesized RNA molecule.

The nuclear membrane in eukaryotes allows further regulation of transcription factors by the duration of their presence in the nucleus, which is regulated by reversible changes in their structure and by binding of other proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid18937349"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Veitia RA | title = One thousand and one ways of making functionally similar transcriptional enhancers | journal = BioEssays | volume = 30 | issue = 11-12 | pages = 1052–7 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18937349 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20849 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental stimuli or endocrine signals&lt;ref name="pmid19182219"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen T, Nioi P, Pickett CB | title = The Nrf2-antioxidant response element signaling pathway and its activation by oxidative stress | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 284 | issue = 20 | pages = 13291–5 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19182219 | pmc = 2679427 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.R900010200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; may cause modification of regulatory proteins&lt;ref name="pmid18937370"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul S | title = Dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in multiple disease conditions: therapeutic approaches | journal = BioEssays | volume = 30 | issue = 11-12 | pages = 1172–84 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18937370 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20852 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eliciting cascades of intracellular signals,&lt;ref name="pmid19319914"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Los M, Maddika S, Erb B, Schulze-Osthoff K | title = Switching Akt: from survival signaling to deadly response | journal = BioEssays | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 492–5 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19319914 | pmc = 2954189 | doi = 10.1002/bies.200900005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which result in regulation of gene expression.

More recently it has become apparent that there is a significant influence of non-DNA-sequence specific effects on transcription. These effects are referred to as [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] and involve the higher order structure of DNA, non-sequence specific DNA binding proteins and chemical modification of DNA. In general epigenetic effects alter the accessibility of DNA to proteins and so modulate transcription.

[[File:Nucleosome 1KX5 2.png|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon representation of the nucleosome structure.|In eukaryotes, DNA is organized in form of [[nucleosomes]]. Note how the DNA (blue and green) is tightly wrapped around the protein core made of [[histone]] [[octamer]] (ribbon coils), restricting access to the DNA. From {{PDB|1KX5}}.]]

[[DNA methylation]] is a widespread mechanism for epigenetic influence on gene expression and is seen in [[bacteria]] and [[eukaryotes]] and has roles in heritable transcription silencing and transcription regulation. In eukaryotes the structure of [[chromatin]], controlled by the [[histone code]], regulates access to DNA with significant impacts on the expression of genes in [[euchromatin]] and [[heterochromatin]] areas.

===Transcriptional regulation in cancer===
{{main|Regulation of transcription in cancer}}

The majority of gene [[Promoter (genetics)#CpG islands in promoters|promoters]] contain a [[CpG site#CpG islands|CpG island]] with numerous [[CpG site]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid16432200"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saxonov S, Berg P, Brutlag DL | title = A genome-wide analysis of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome distinguishes two distinct classes of promoters | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 5 | pages = 1412–7 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16432200 | pmc = 1345710 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0510310103 | bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.1412S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When many of a gene's promoter CpG sites are [[DNA methylation|methylated]] the gene becomes silenced.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird A | title = DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–21 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11782440 | doi = 10.1101/gad.947102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colorectal cancers typically have 3 to 6 [[Somatic evolution in cancer#Glossary|driver]] mutations and 33 to 66 [[Genetic hitchhiking|hitchhiker]] or passenger mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid23539594"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vogelstein B, Papadopoulos N, Velculescu VE, Zhou S, Diaz LA, Kinzler KW | title = Cancer genome landscapes | journal = Science | volume = 339 | issue = 6127 | pages = 1546–58 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23539594 | pmc = 3749880 | doi = 10.1126/science.1235122 | bibcode = 2013Sci...339.1546V }}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, transcriptional silencing may be of more importance than mutation in causing progression to cancer.  For example, in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally silenced by CpG island methylation (see [[regulation of transcription in cancer]]).  Transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other [[Cancer epigenetics|epigenetic]] mechanisms, such as altered expression of [[MicroRNA#DNA repair and cancer|microRNAs]].&lt;ref name="pmid24616890"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tessitore A, Cicciarelli G, Del Vecchio F, Gaggiano A, Verzella D, Fischietti M, Vecchiotti D, Capece D, Zazzeroni F, Alesse E | title = MicroRNAs in the DNA Damage/Repair Network and Cancer | journal = International Journal of Genomics | volume = 2014 | issue =  | pages = 820248 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24616890 | pmc = 3926391 | doi = 10.1155/2014/820248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In breast cancer, transcriptional repression of [[BRCA1]] may occur more frequently by over-expressed microRNA-182 than by hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter (see [[BRCA1#Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers|Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers]]).

===Post-transcriptional regulation===
{{main|Post-transcriptional regulation}}
In eukaryotes, where export of RNA is required before translation is possible, nuclear export is thought to provide additional control over gene expression. All transport in and out of the nucleus is via the [[nuclear pore]] and transport is controlled by a wide range of [[importin]] and [[exportin]] proteins.

Expression of a gene coding for a protein is only possible if the messenger RNA carrying the code survives long enough to be translated. In a typical cell, an RNA molecule is only stable if specifically protected from degradation. RNA degradation has particular importance in regulation of expression in eukaryotic cells where mRNA has to travel significant distances before being translated. In eukaryotes, RNA is stabilised by certain post-transcriptional modifications, particularly the [[5' cap]] and [[polyadenylation|poly-adenylated tail]].

Intentional degradation of mRNA is used not just as a defence mechanism from foreign RNA (normally from viruses) but also as a route of mRNA ''destabilisation''. If an mRNA molecule has a complementary sequence to a [[small interfering RNA]] then it is targeted for destruction via the RNA interference pathway.

===Three prime untranslated regions and microRNAs===
{{main|Three prime untranslated region}}
{{main|MicroRNA}}
[[Three prime untranslated region]]s (3'UTRs) of [[messenger RNA]]s (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding sites for [[microRNA]]s (miRNAs) as well as for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA.

The 3'-UTR often contains [[Three prime untranslated region#MicroRNA response elements|microRNA response elements (MREs)]]. MREs are sequences to which miRNAs bind.  These are prevalent motifs within 3'-UTRs. Among all regulatory motifs within the 3'-UTRs (e.g. including silencer regions), MREs make up about half of the motifs.

As of 2014, the [[miRBase]] web site,&lt;ref&gt;miRBase.org&lt;/ref&gt; an archive of [[microRNA|miRNA]] [[Sequence (biology)|sequences]] and annotations, listed 28,645 entries in 233 biologic species.  Of these, 1,881 miRNAs were in annotated human miRNA loci.  miRNAs were predicted to have an average of about four hundred target [[messenger RNA|mRNAs]] (affecting expression of several hundred genes).&lt;ref name=Freidman&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedman RC, Farh KK, Burge CB, Bartel DP | title = Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs | journal = Genome Research | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 92–105 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18955434 | pmc = 2612969 | doi = 10.1101/gr.082701.108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Freidman et al.&lt;ref name=Freidman /&gt; estimate that &gt;45,000 miRNA target sites within human mRNA 3'UTRs are conserved above background levels, and &gt;60% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs.

Direct experiments show that a single miRNA can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique mRNAs.&lt;ref name="pmid15685193"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lim LP, Lau NC, Garrett-Engele P, Grimson A, Schelter JM, Castle J, Bartel DP, Linsley PS, Johnson JM | title = Microarray analysis shows that some microRNAs downregulate large numbers of target mRNAs | journal = Nature | volume = 433 | issue = 7027 | pages = 769–73 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15685193 | doi = 10.1038/nature03315 | bibcode = 2005Natur.433..769L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments show that a single miRNA may repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression often is relatively mild (less than 2-fold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Selbach M, Schwanhäusser B, Thierfelder N, Fang Z, Khanin R, Rajewsky N | title = Widespread changes in protein synthesis induced by microRNAs | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7209 | pages = 58–63 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18668040 | doi = 10.1038/nature07228 | bibcode = 2008Natur.455...58S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baek D, Villén J, Shin C, Camargo FD, Gygi SP, Bartel DP | title = The impact of microRNAs on protein output | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7209 | pages = 64–71 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18668037 | pmc = 2745094 | doi = 10.1038/nature07242 | bibcode = 2008Natur.455...64B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translational regulation===
[[File:Neomycin B C.svg|thumb|right|alt=A chemical structure of neomycin molecule.|[[Neomycin]] is an example of a small molecule that reduces expression of all protein genes inevitably leading to cell death; it thus acts as an [[antibiotic]].]]

{{Main|Translation (genetics)}}
Direct regulation of translation is less prevalent than control of transcription or mRNA stability but is occasionally used. Inhibition of protein translation is a major target for [[toxin]]s and [[antibiotic]]s, so they can kill a cell by overriding its normal gene expression control. [[Protein synthesis inhibitor]]s include the antibiotic [[neomycin]] and the toxin [[ricin]].

===Protein degradation===
{{main|Proteasome}}
Once protein synthesis is complete, the level of expression of that protein can be reduced by protein degradation. There are major protein degradation pathways in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes, of which the [[proteasome]] is a common component. An unneeded or damaged protein is often labeled for degradation by [[ubiquitinylation|addition of ubiquitin]].

==Measurement==
Measuring gene expression is an important part of many [[life science]]s, as the ability to quantify the level at which a particular gene is expressed within a cell, tissue or organism can provide a lot of valuable information. For example, measuring gene expression can:
*Identify viral infection of a cell ([[viral protein]] expression).
*Determine an individual's susceptibility to [[cancer]] ([[oncogene]] expression).
*Find if a bacterium is resistant to [[penicillin]] ([[beta-lactamase]] expression).
Similarly, the analysis of the location of protein expression is a powerful tool, and this can be done on an organismal or cellular scale. Investigation of localization is particularly important for the study of [[Developmental biology|development]] in multicellular organisms and as an indicator of protein function in single cells. Ideally, measurement of expression is done by detecting the final gene product (for many genes, this is the protein); however, it is often easier to detect one of the precursors, typically [[mRNA]] and to infer gene-expression levels from these measurements.

===mRNA quantification===
Levels of mRNA can be quantitatively measured by [[northern blotting]], which provides size and sequence information about the mRNA molecules. A sample of RNA is separated on an [[agarose gel]] and hybridized to a radioactively labeled RNA probe that is complementary to the target sequence. The radiolabeled RNA is then detected by an [[autoradiograph]]. Because the use of radioactive reagents makes the procedure time consuming and potentially dangerous, alternative labeling and detection methods, such as digoxigenin and biotin chemistries, have been developed. Perceived disadvantages of Northern blotting are that large quantities of RNA are required and that quantification may not be completely accurate, as it involves measuring band strength in an image of a gel. On the other hand, the additional mRNA size information from the Northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts.

Another approach for measuring mRNA abundance is RT-qPCR. In this technique, [[reverse transcription]] is followed by [[quantitative PCR]]. Reverse transcription first generates a DNA template from the mRNA; this single-stranded template is called [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]]. The cDNA template is then amplified in the quantitative step, during which the [[fluorescence]] emitted by labeled [[hybridization probe]]s or [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalating dyes]] changes as the [[Polymerase chain reaction|DNA amplification]] process progresses. With a carefully constructed standard curve, qPCR can produce an absolute measurement of the number of copies of original mRNA, typically in units of copies per nanolitre of homogenized tissue or copies per cell. qPCR is very sensitive (detection of a single mRNA molecule is theoretically possible), but can be expensive depending on the type of reporter used; fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes are more expensive than non-specific intercalating fluorescent dyes.

For [[expression profiling]], or high-throughput analysis of many genes within a sample, [[quantitative PCR]] may be performed for hundreds of genes simultaneously in the case of low-density arrays. A second approach is the [[DNA microarrays|hybridization microarray]]. A single array or "chip" may contain probes to determine transcript levels for every known gene in the genome of one or more organisms. Alternatively, "tag based" technologies like [[Serial analysis of gene expression]] (SAGE) and [[RNA-Seq]], which can provide a relative measure of the cellular [[concentration]] of different mRNAs, can be used. An advantage of tag-based methods is the "open architecture", allowing for the exact measurement of any transcript, with a known or unknown sequence. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) such as [[RNA-Seq]] is another approach, producing vast quantities of sequence data that can be matched to a reference genome. Although NGS is comparatively time-consuming, expensive, and resource-intensive, it can identify [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]], splice-variants, and novel genes, and can also be used to profile expression in organisms for which little or no sequence information is available.

===RNA profiles in Wikipedia ===
[[File:PBB GE SLC2A4 206603 at fs.png|thumb|right|300px|alt=An RNA Expression diagram.|The RNA expression profile of the GLUT4 Transporter (one of the main glucose transporters found in the human body]]

Profiles like these are found for almost all proteins listed in Wikipedia. They are generated by organizations such as the [[Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation]] and the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]]. Additional information can be found by searching their databases (for an example of the GLUT4 transporter pictured here, see citation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GLUT4 RNA Expression Profile|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/genes/ENSG00000181856}}&lt;/ref&gt; These profiles indicate the level of DNA expression (and hence RNA produced) of a certain protein in a certain tissue, and are color-coded accordingly in the images located in the Protein Box on the right side of each Wikipedia page.

===Protein quantification===
For genes encoding proteins, the expression level can be directly assessed by a number of methods with some clear analogies to the techniques for mRNA quantification.

The most commonly used{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} method is to perform a [[Western blot]] against the protein of interest—this gives information on the size of the protein in addition to its identity. A sample (often cellular [[lysate]]) is separated on a [[polyacrylamide gel]], transferred to a membrane and then probed with an [[antibody]] to the protein of interest. The antibody can either be conjugated to a [[fluorophore]] or to [[horseradish peroxidase]] for imaging and/or quantification. The gel-based nature of this assay makes quantification less accurate, but it has the advantage of being able to identify later modifications to the protein, for example [[proteolysis]] or [[ubiquitination]], from changes in size.

===Localisation===
{{Main|In situ hybridization|Immunofluorescence}}
[[File:Hunchback in situ.jpg|thumb|alt=Visualization of hunchback mRNA in Drosophila embryo.|In situ-hybridization of [[Drosophila]] [[embryo]]s at different developmental stages for the mRNA responsible for the expression of [[Drosophila embryogenesis#Maternal effect genes|hunchback]]. High intensity of blue color marks places with high hunchback mRNA quantity.]]

Analysis of expression is not limited to quantification; localisation can also be determined. mRNA can be detected with a suitably labelled complementary mRNA strand and protein can be detected via labelled antibodies. The probed sample is then observed by microscopy to identify where the mRNA or protein is.

[[File:GFP structure.png|thumb|left|200px|alt=A ribbon diagram of green fluorescent protein resembling barrel structure.|The three-dimensional structure of [[green fluorescent protein]]. The residues in the centre of the "barrel" are responsible for production of green light after exposing to higher energetic blue light. From {{PDB|1EMA}}.]]

By replacing the gene with a new version fused to a [[green fluorescent protein]] (or similar) marker, expression may be directly quantified in live cells. This is done by imaging using a [[fluorescence microscope]]. It is very difficult to clone a GFP-fused protein into its native location in the genome without affecting expression levels so this method often cannot be used to measure endogenous gene expression. It is, however, widely used to measure the expression of a gene artificially introduced into the cell, for example via an [[expression vector]]. It is important to note that by fusing a target protein to a fluorescent reporter the protein's behavior, including its cellular localization and expression level, can be significantly changed.

The [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] works by using antibodies immobilised on a [[microtiter plate]] to capture proteins of interest from samples added to the well. Using a detection antibody conjugated to an enzyme or fluorophore the quantity of bound protein can be accurately measured by [[fluorometric]] or [[Colorimetry (chemical method)|colourimetric]] detection. The detection process is very similar to that of a Western blot, but by avoiding the gel steps more accurate quantification can be achieved.

==Expression system==
[[Image:Tet-ON inducible transgene expression cells.svg|thumbnail|500px|Tet-ON inducible shRNA system]]
{{main|Protein production (biotechnology)}}

An expression system is a system specifically designed for the production of a gene product of choice. This is normally a protein although may also be RNA, such as [[tRNA]] or a [[ribozyme]]. An expression system consists of a gene, normally encoded by [[DNA]], and the [[molecular machinery]] required to [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribe]] the DNA into [[mRNA]] and [[translate]] the mRNA into [[protein]] using the reagents provided. In the broadest sense this includes every living cell but the term is more normally used to refer to expression as a laboratory tool. An expression system is therefore often artificial in some manner. Expression systems are, however, a fundamentally natural process. Viruses are an excellent example where they replicate by using the host cell as an expression system for the viral proteins and genome.

===Inducible expression===
[[Doxycycline]] is also used in "Tet-on" and "Tet-off" [[tetracycline controlled transcriptional activation]] to regulate [[transgene]] expression in organisms and [[cell culture]]s.

===In nature===
In addition to these biological tools, certain naturally observed configurations of DNA (genes, promoters, enhancers, repressors) and the associated machinery itself are referred to as an expression system. This term is normally used in the case where a gene or set of genes is switched on under well defined conditions, for example, the simple repressor switch expression system in [[Lambda phage]] and the [[lac operator]] system in bacteria. Several natural expression systems are directly used or modified and used for artificial expression systems such as the [[Tetracycline controlled transcriptional activation|Tet-on and Tet-off]] expression system.

==Gene networks==
{{main|Gene regulatory network}}
Genes have sometimes been regarded as nodes in a network, with inputs being proteins such as [[transcription factor]]s, and outputs being the level of gene expression. The node itself performs a function, and the operation of these functions have been interpreted as performing a kind of [[information processing]] within cells and determines cellular behavior.

Gene networks can also be constructed without formulating an explicit causal model. This is often the case when assembling networks from large expression data sets. Covariation and correlation of expression is computed across a large sample of cases and measurements (often [[transcriptome]] or [[proteome]] data). The source of variation can be either experimental or natural (observational). There are several ways to construct gene expression networks, but one common approach is to compute a matrix of all pair-wise correlations of expression across conditions, time points, or individuals and convert the matrix (after thresholding at some cut-off value) into a graphical representation in which nodes represent genes, transcripts, or proteins and edges connecting these nodes represent the strength of association (see [http://www.genenetwork.org]).&lt;ref name="pmid 15114364"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chesler EJ, Lu L, Wang J, Williams RW, Manly KF | title = WebQTL: rapid exploratory analysis of gene expression and genetic networks for brain and behavior | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 485–6 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15114364 | doi = 10.1038/nn0504-485 | url = http://www.nature.com/index.html?file=/neuro/journal/v7/n5/full/nn0504-485.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Weighted correlation network analysis]] (WGCNA) involves weighted networks defined by soft-thresholding the pairwise correlations among variables (e.g. measures of transcript abundance). WGCNA can be applied to compute eigengenes, which are highly robust biomarkers (features) useful for diagnosis and prognosis.&lt;ref name="Pigegene"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foroushani A, Agrahari R, Docking R, Chang L, Duns G, Hudoba M, Karsan A, Zare H | title = Large-scale gene network analysis reveals the significance of extracellular matrix pathway and homeobox genes in acute myeloid leukemia: an introduction to the Pigengene package and its applications | journal = BMC Medical Genomics | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 16 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28298217 | doi = 10.1186/s12920-017-0253-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques and tools==

[[File:Pixelbay Question mark Word Art.png|thumb|A question mark]]
An '''inquiry''' is any process that has the aim of augmenting [[knowledge]], resolving [[doubt]], or [[problem solving|solving a problem]]. A theory of inquiry is an account of the various types of inquiry and a treatment of the ways that each type of inquiry achieves its aim.

==Inquiry theories==

===Deduction===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When three terms are so related to one another that the last is wholly contained in the middle and the middle is wholly contained in or excluded from the first, the extremes must admit of perfect syllogism. By 'middle term' I mean that which both is contained in another and contains another in itself, and which is the middle by its position also; and by 'extremes' (a) that which is contained in another, and (b) that in which another is contained. For if ''A'' is predicated of all ''B'', and ''B'' of all ''C'', ''A'' must necessarily be predicated of all ''C''. ... I call this kind of figure the First. (Aristotle, ''Prior Analytics'', 1.4)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Induction===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inductive reasoning consists in establishing a relation between one extreme term and the middle term by means of the other extreme; for example, if ''B'' is the middle term of ''A'' and ''C'', in proving by means of ''C'' that ''A'' applies to ''B'';  for this is how we effect inductions. (Aristotle, ''Prior Analytics'', 2.23)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Abduction===
The ''locus classicus'' for the study of [[abductive reasoning]] is found in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Book 2, Chapt. 25. It begins this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have Reduction (απαγωγη, [[abductive reasoning|abduction]]):
:# When it is obvious that the first term applies to the middle, but that the middle applies to the last term is not obvious, yet is nevertheless more probable or not less probable than the conclusion;
:# Or if there are not many intermediate terms between the last and the middle;
For in all such cases the effect is to bring us nearer to knowledge.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By way of explanation, [[Aristotle]] supplies two very instructive examples, one for each of the two varieties of abductive inference steps that he has just described in the abstract:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:# For example, let ''A'' stand for "that which can be taught", ''B'' for "knowledge", and ''C'' for "morality". Then that knowledge can be taught is evident;  but whether virtue is knowledge is not clear. Then if ''BC'' is not less probable or is more probable than ''AC'', we have reduction;  for we are nearer to knowledge for having introduced an additional term, whereas before we had no knowledge that ''AC'' is true.
:# Or again we have reduction if there are not many intermediate terms between ''B'' and ''C'';  for in this case too we are brought nearer to knowledge. For example, suppose that ''D'' is "to square", ''E'' "rectilinear figure", and ''F'' "circle".  Assuming that between ''E'' and ''F'' there is only one intermediate term — that the circle becomes equal to a rectilinear figure by means of [[Lune (mathematics)|lunules]] — we should approximate to knowledge. ([[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", 2.25, with minor alterations)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristotle's latter variety of abductive reasoning, though it will take some explaining in the sequel, is well worth our contemplation, since it hints already at streams of inquiry that course well beyond the syllogistic source from which they spring, and into regions that Peirce will explore more broadly and deeply.

==Inquiry in the pragmatic paradigm&lt;!--Section linked from [[Issue-based information system]] and [[Problem structuring methods]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
In the pragmatic philosophies of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], and others, inquiry is closely associated with the [[normative science]] of [[logic]]. In its inception, the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry was extracted by Peirce from its raw materials in classical logic, with a little bit of help from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and refined in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic by [[George Boole|Boole]], [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]], and Peirce himself to address problems about the nature and conduct of scientific reasoning. Borrowing a brace of concepts from [[Aristotle]], Peirce examined three fundamental modes of reasoning that play a role in inquiry, commonly known as [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] [[inference]].

In rough terms, ''[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'' is what we use to generate a likely [[hypothesis]] or an initial [[diagnosis]] in response to a phenomenon of interest or a problem of concern, while ''[[deductive reasoning|deduction]]'' is used to clarify, to derive, and to explicate the relevant consequences of the selected hypothesis, and ''[[inductive reasoning|induction]]'' is used to test the sum of the predictions against the sum of the data. It needs to be observed that the classical and pragmatic treatments of the types of reasoning, dividing the generic territory of inference as they do into three special parts, arrive at a different characterization of the environs of reason than do those accounts that count only two.

These three processes typically operate in a cyclic fashion, systematically operating to reduce the uncertainties and the difficulties that initiated the inquiry in question, and in this way, to the extent that inquiry is successful, leading to an increase in knowledge or in skills.

In the pragmatic way of thinking everything has a purpose, and the purpose of each thing is the first thing we should try to note about it.&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, N. (2012). ''Pragmatism: The Restoration of its Scientific Roots''. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of inquiry is to reduce doubt and lead to a state of belief, which a person in that state will usually call ''[[knowledge]]'' or ''[[certainty]]''. As they contribute to the end of inquiry, we should appreciate that the three kinds of inference describe a cycle that can be understood only as a whole, and none of the three makes complete sense in isolation from the others. For instance, the purpose of abduction is to generate guesses of a kind that deduction can explicate and that induction can evaluate. This places a mild but meaningful constraint on the production of hypotheses, since it is not just any wild guess at explanation that submits itself to reason and bows out when defeated in a match with reality. In a similar fashion, each of the other types of inference realizes its purpose only in accord with its proper role in the whole cycle of inquiry. No matter how much it may be necessary to study these processes in abstraction from each other, the integrity of inquiry places strong limitations on the effective [[modularity]] of its principal components.

In ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'', John Dewey defined inquiry as "the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole"&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John (1938). ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry''. New York:NY: D.C. Heath &amp; Co.&lt;http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/osullis/spring07/courses/page0/history/documents_files/Dewey_pattern%20of%20inquiry.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and Peirce's conception of inquiry extended beyond a system of thinking and incorporated the social nature of inquiry. These ideas are summarize in the notion [[Community of inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Fixation of Belief]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seixas|first=Peter|title=The Community of Inquiry as a Basis for Knowledge and Learning: The Case of History|url=http://aer.sagepub.com/content/30/2/305.short|publisher=Sage|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shields|first=Patricia|title=The Community of Inquiry|url=http://aas.sagepub.com/content/35/5/510.short|publisher=Sage|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and science of inquiry===
For our present purposes, the first feature to note in distinguishing the three principal modes of reasoning from each other is whether each of them is exact or approximate in character. In this light, deduction is the only one of the three types of reasoning that can be made exact, in essence, always deriving true conclusions from true premises, while abduction and induction are unavoidably approximate in their modes of operation, involving elements of fallible judgment in practice and inescapable error in their application.

The reason for this is that deduction, in the ideal limit, can be rendered a purely internal process of the reasoning agent, while the other two modes of reasoning essentially demand a constant interaction with the outside world, a source of phenomena and problems that will no doubt continue to exceed the capacities of any finite resource, human or machine, to master. Situated in this larger reality, approximations can be judged appropriate only in relation to their context of use and can be judged fitting only with regard to a purpose in view.

A parallel distinction that is often made in this connection is to call deduction a ''demonstrative'' form of inference, while abduction and induction are classed as ''[[non-demonstrative]]'' forms of reasoning. Strictly speaking, the latter two modes of reasoning are not properly called inferences at all. They are more like controlled associations of words or ideas that just happen to be successful often enough to be preserved as useful heuristic strategies in the repertoire of the agent. But non-demonstrative ways of thinking are inherently subject to error, and must be constantly checked out and corrected as needed in practice.

In classical terminology, forms of judgment that require attention to the context and the purpose of the judgment are said to involve an element of "art", in a sense that is judged to distinguish them from "science", and in their renderings as expressive judgments to implicate arbiters in styles of [[rhetoric]], as contrasted with [[logic]].

In a figurative sense, this means that only deductive logic can be reduced to an exact theoretical science, while the practice of any empirical science will always remain to some degree an art.

===Zeroth order inquiry===
Many aspects of inquiry can be recognized and usefully studied in very basic logical settings, even simpler than the level of [[syllogism]], for example, in the realm of reasoning that is variously known as ''[[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]'', ''[[propositional logic|propositional calculus]]'', ''sentential calculus'', or ''zeroth-order logic''. By way of approaching the learning curve on the gentlest availing slope, we may well begin at the level of ''[[zeroth-order inquiry]]'', in effect, taking the syllogistic approach to inquiry only so far as the propositional or sentential aspects of the associated reasoning processes are concerned. One of the bonuses of doing this in the context of Peirce's logical work is that it provides us with doubly instructive exercises in the use of his [[logical graph]]s, taken at the level of his so-called "[[alpha graph]]s".

In the case of propositional calculus or sentential logic, deduction comes down to applications of the [[transitive relation|transitive law]] for conditional implications and the approximate forms of inference hang on the properties that derive from these. In describing the various types of inference I will employ a few old "terms of art" from classical logic that are still of use in treating these kinds of simple problems in reasoning.

: '''Deduction''' takes a Case, the [[minor premise]] &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
: and combines it with a Rule, the major premise &lt;math&gt;Y \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: to arrive at an Act, the demonstrative [[logical consequence|conclusion]] &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Z.&lt;/math&gt;

: '''Induction''' takes a Case of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
: and matches it with a Fact of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: to infer a Rule of the form &lt;math&gt;Y \Rightarrow Z.&lt;/math&gt;

: '''Abduction''' takes a Fact of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: and matches it with a Rule of the form &lt;math&gt;Y \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: to infer a Case of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Y.&lt;/math&gt;

For ease of reference, Figure 1 and the Legend beneath it
summarize the classical terminology for the three types
of inference and the relationships among them.

In its original usage a statement of Fact has to do with a deed done or a record made, that is, a type of event that is openly observable and not riddled with speculation as to its very occurrence. In contrast, a statement of Case may refer to a hidden or a hypothetical cause, that is, a type of event that is not immediately observable to all concerned. Obviously, the distinction is a rough one and the question of which mode applies can depend on the points of view that different observers adopt over time. Finally, a statement of a Rule is called that because it states a regularity or a regulation that governs a whole class of situations, and not because of its syntactic form. So far in this discussion, all three types of constraint are expressed in the form of conditional propositions, but this is not a fixed requirement. In practice, these modes of statement are distinguished by the roles that they play within an argument, not by their style of expression. When the time comes to branch out from the syllogistic framework, we will find that propositional constraints can be discovered and represented in arbitrary syntactic forms.

==Example of inquiry==
Examples of inquiry, that illustrate the full cycle of its abductive, deductive, and inductive phases, and yet are both concrete and simple enough to be suitable for a first (or zeroth) exposition, are somewhat rare in Peirce's writings, and so let us draw one from the work of fellow pragmatician [[John Dewey]], analyzing it according to the model of zeroth-order inquiry that we developed above.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man is walking on a warm day. The sky was clear the last time he observed it; but presently he notes, while occupied primarily with other things, that the air is cooler. It occurs to him that it is probably going to rain; looking up, he sees a dark cloud between him and the sun, and he then quickens his steps. What, if anything, in such a situation can be called thought? Neither the act of walking nor the noting of the cold is a thought. Walking is one direction of activity; looking and noting are other modes of activity. The likelihood that it will rain is, however, something ''suggested''. The pedestrian ''feels'' the cold; he ''thinks of'' clouds and a coming shower. (John Dewey, ''[[How We Think]]'', 1910, pp. 6-7).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Once over quickly===
Let's first give Dewey's example of inquiry in everyday life the quick once over, hitting just the high points of its analysis into Peirce's three kinds of reasoning.

====Abductive phase====
In Dewey's "Rainy Day" or "Sign of Rain" story, we find our peripatetic hero presented with a surprising Fact:
:* Fact: C → A, In the Current situation the Air is cool.

Responding to an intellectual reflex of puzzlement about the situation, his resource of common knowledge about the world is impelled to seize on an approximate Rule:
:* Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool.
This Rule can be recognized as having a potential relevance to the situation because it matches the surprising Fact, C → A, in its consequential feature A.

All of this suggests that the present Case may be one in which it is just about to rain:
:* Case: C → B,  The Current situation is just Before it rains.

The whole mental performance, however automatic and semi-conscious it may be, that leads up from a problematic Fact and a previously settled knowledge base of Rules to the plausible suggestion of a Case description, is what we are calling an [[abductive inference]].

====Deductive phase====
The next phase of inquiry uses deductive inference to expand the implied consequences of the abductive hypothesis, with the aim of testing its truth. For this purpose, the inquirer needs to think of other things that would follow from the consequence of his precipitate explanation. Thus, he now reflects on the Case just assumed:
:* Case: C → B, The Current situation is just Before it rains.

He looks up to scan the sky, perhaps in a random search for further information, but since the sky is a logical place to look for details of an imminent rainstorm, symbolized in our story by the letter B, we may safely suppose that our reasoner has already detached the consequence of the abduced Case, C → B, and has begun to expand on its further implications. So let us imagine that our up-looker has a more deliberate purpose in mind, and that his search for additional data is driven by the new-found, determinate Rule:
:* Rule: B → D, Just Before it rains, Dark clouds appear.

Contemplating the assumed Case in combination with this new Rule leads him by an immediate deduction to predict an additional Fact:
:* Fact: C → D, In the Current situation Dark clouds appear.

The reconstructed picture of reasoning assembled in this second phase of inquiry is true to the pattern of [[deductive inference]].

====Inductive phase====
Whatever the case, our subject observes a Dark cloud, just as he would expect on the basis of the new hypothesis. The explanation of imminent rain removes the discrepancy between observations and expectations and thereby reduces the shock of surprise that made this process of inquiry necessary.

===Looking more closely===

====Seeding hypotheses====
Figure 4 gives a graphical illustration of Dewey's example of inquiry, isolating for the purposes of the present analysis the first two steps in the more extended proceedings that go to make up the whole inquiry.

Figure 4.  Dewey's 'Rainy Day' Inquiry
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this analysis of the first steps of Inquiry, we have a complex or a mixed form of inference that can be seen as taking place in two steps:
:* The first step is an Abduction that abstracts a Case from the consideration of a Fact and a Rule.
:: Fact: C → A, In the Current situation the Air is cool.
:: Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool.
:: Case: C → B, The Current situation is just Before it rains.

:* The final step is a Deduction that admits this Case to another Rule and so arrives at a novel Fact.
:: Case: C → B, The Current situation is just Before it rains.
:: Rule: B → D, Just Before it rains, a Dark cloud will appear.
:: Fact: C → D, In the Current situation, a Dark cloud will appear.

This is nowhere near a complete analysis of the Rainy Day inquiry, even insofar as it might be carried out within the constraints of the syllogistic framework, and it covers only the first two steps of the relevant inquiry process, but maybe it will do for a start.

One other thing needs to be noticed here, the formal duality between this expansion phase of inquiry and the argument from [[analogy]]. This can be seen most clearly in the propositional [[graph (data structure)|lattice]] diagrams shown in Figures 3 and 4, where analogy exhibits a rough "A" shape and the first two steps of inquiry exhibit a rough "V" shape, respectively. Since we find ourselves repeatedly referring to this expansion phase of inquiry as a unit, let's give it a name that suggests its duality with [[analogical reasoning|analogy]]—"[[catalogical reasoning|catalogy]]" will do for the moment. This usage is apt enough if one thinks of a catalogue entry for an item as a text that lists its salient features. Notice that [[analogical reasoning|analogy]] has to do with the examples of a given quality, while [[catalogical reasoning|catalogy]] has to do with the qualities of a given example. Peirce noted similar forms of duality in many of his early writings, leading to the consummate treatment in his 1867 paper [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame.htm "On a New List of Categories"] (CP 1.545-559, W 2, 49-59).

====Weeding hypotheses====
In order to comprehend the bearing of [[inductive reasoning]] on the closing phases of inquiry there are a couple of observations that we need to make:
:* First, we need to recognize that smaller inquiries are typically woven into larger inquiries, whether we view the whole pattern of inquiry as carried on by a single agent or by a complex community.
:* Further, we need to consider the different ways in which the particular instances of inquiry can be related to ongoing inquiries at larger scales. Three modes of inductive interaction between the micro-inquiries and the macro-inquiries that are salient here can be described under the headings of the "Learning", the "Transfer", and the "Testing" of rules.

====Analogy of experience====
Throughout inquiry the reasoner makes use of rules that have to be transported across intervals of experience, from the masses of experience where they are learned to the moments of experience where they are applied. Inductive reasoning is involved in the learning and the transfer of these rules, both in accumulating a knowledge base and in carrying it through the times between acquisition and application.
:* Learning. The principal way that induction contributes to an ongoing inquiry is through the learning of rules, that is, by creating each of the rules that goes into the knowledge base, or ever gets used along the way.
:* Transfer. The continuing way that induction contributes to an ongoing inquiry is through the exploit of analogy, a two-step combination of induction and deduction that serves to transfer rules from one context to another.
:* Testing. Finally, every inquiry that makes use of a knowledge base constitutes a "field test" of its accumulated contents. If the knowledge base fails to serve any live inquiry in a satisfactory manner, then there is a prima facie reason to reconsider and possibly to amend some of its rules.

Let's now consider how these principles of learning, transfer, and testing apply to John Dewey's "Sign of Rain" example.

=====Learning=====
Rules in a knowledge base, as far as their effective content goes, can be obtained by any mode of inference.

For example, a rule like:
:* Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool,
is usually induced from a consideration of many past events, in a manner that can be rationally reconstructed as follows:
:* Case: C → B, In Certain events, it is just Before it rains,
:* Fact: C → A, In Certain events, the Air is cool,
: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:* Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool.

However, the very same proposition could also be abduced as an explanation of a singular occurrence or deduced as a conclusion of a presumptive theory.

=====Transfer=====
What is it that gives a distinctively inductive character to the acquisition of a knowledge base? It is evidently the "analogy of experience" that underlies its useful application. Whenever we find ourselves prefacing an argument with the phrase "If past experience is any guide..." then we can be sure that this principle has come into play. We are invoking an analogy between past experience, considered as a totality, and present experience, considered as a point of application. What we mean in practice is this: "If past experience is a fair sample of possible experience, then the knowledge gained in it applies to present experience". This is the mechanism that allows a knowledge base to be carried across gulfs of experience that are indifferent to the effective contents of its rules.

Here are the details of how this notion of transfer works out in the case of the "Sign of Rain" example:

Let K(pres) be a portion of the reasoner's knowledge base that is [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the conjunction of two rules, as follows:
:* K(pres) = (B → A) and (B → D).

K(pres) is the present knowledge base, expressed in the form of a logical constraint on the present [[universe of discourse]].

It is convenient to have the option of expressing all logical statements in terms of their [[model theory|logical models]], that is, in terms of the primitive circumstances or the elements of experience over which they hold true.
:* Let E(past) be the chosen set of experiences, or the circumstances that we have in mind when we refer to "past experience".
:* Let E(poss) be the collective set of experiences, or the projective total of possible circumstances.
:* Let E(pres) be the present experience, or the circumstances that are present to the reasoner at the current moment.

If we think of the knowledge base K(pres) as referring to the "regime of experience" over which it is valid, then all of these sets of models can be compared by the simple relations of [[set inclusion]] or [[logical implication]].

Figure 5 schematizes this way of viewing the "analogy of experience".

Figure 5.  Analogy of Experience
&lt;/pre&gt;

In these terms, the "analogy of experience" proceeds by inducing a Rule about the validity of a current knowledge base and then deducing a Fact, its applicability to a current experience, as in the following sequence:

Inductive Phase:
:* Given Case: E(past) → E(poss), Chosen events fairly sample Collective events.
:* Given Fact: E(past) → K(pres), Chosen events support the Knowledge regime.
: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:* Induce Rule: E(poss) → K(pres), Collective events support the Knowledge regime.

Deductive Phase:
:* Given Case: E(pres) → E(poss), Current events fairly sample Collective events.
:* Given Rule: E(poss) → K(pres), Collective events support the Knowledge regime.
: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:* Deduce Fact: E(pres) → K(pres), Current events support the Knowledge regime.

=====Testing=====
If the observer looks up and does not see dark clouds, or if he runs for shelter but it does not rain, then there is fresh occasion to question the utility or the validity of his knowledge base. But we must leave our foulweather friend for now and defer the logical analysis of this testing phase to another occasion.

The '''Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities''' ('''IATH''')  is a research unit of the [[University of Virginia]], USA. Its goal is to explore and develop [[information technology]] as a tool for scholarly [[humanities]] research. To that end, IATH provide Fellows with consulting, technical support, applications development, and networked publishing facilities. It cultivates partnerships and participate in humanities computing initiatives with libraries, publishers, information technology companies, scholarly organizations, and other groups residing at the intersection of computers and cultural heritage.

The research projects, essays, and documentation are the products of a collaboration between humanities and computer science research faculty, computer professionals, student assistants and project managers, and library faculty and staff. In many cases, this work is supported by private or federal funding agencies. In all cases, it is supported by the Fellows’ home departments; the College or School to which those departments belong; the University of Virginia Library; the Vice President for Research and Public Service; the Vice President and Chief Information Officer; the Provost; and the President of the University of Virginia.

==History==
The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities was established at the University of Virginia in 1992, with a major grant from IBM and a multi-year commitment of support from the University.

IATH’s founders are in humanities computing, digital scholarship, and academic administration. Beginning in 1992 a steering committee of scholars, including [[Edward Ayers]], [[Alan Batson]], [[Jerome McGann]], [[Kendon Stubbs]] and [[William Wulf]] managed IATH. A search committee commissioned by the steering committee carried out the search for a director of the institute. [[John Unsworth]] was selected, and his term began September 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.virginia.edu/content/new-leader-ever-expanding-university-library-looks-future |title=With New Leader, Ever-Expanding University Library Looks to the Future |work=UVA Today |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] |first=Katie |last=McNally |date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IATH has generated over $10.7 million in grant funding and gifts in kind since it began operations.  Much of this funding has come from Federal agencies and private foundations, and has gone to support faculty research and teaching across the University.

'''Master of Technology in Clinical engineering''' is a graduate program in [[Clinical engineering]] offered jointly by three institutes in India. This is the only graduate program currently in India that trains engineers in the field of clinical engineering. It is one of the two programs jointly offered by the three institutes, the other being a PhD in Biomedical devices &amp; technology.

==Need for this Program==
Over the past five decades, [[healthcare]] delivery has increasingly become technology driven - be it development of new drugs, vaccines or [[medical devices]]. Innovative solutions to healthcare can be developed with a cross-disciplinary approach with systematic training, in which, students with a background in engineering are trained in biological sciences and clinical practices.

==Aim of the Program==
The aim is to address the country's need of [[human resource development]] in [[Clinical engineering]] as well as in Biomedical Device Development, and thereby contribute to the overall development of healthcare delivery in the country.

==About the Program==
This Program was started in the year 2008 with the assistance of department of science &amp; technology, Government of India. The three institutes in this joint program are premier institutes in India in their respective fields.

==Participant institutes==
*[[IIT Madras]](Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai)
*[[CMC Vellore]](Christian Medical College, Vellore)
*[[Sree Chitra Tirunal institute for medical sciences and technology]](SCTIMST, Trivandrum)

==Course work==
* Duration:Two and a half years (5 semester program)

==Orientation programme==
The orientation program is for about 3–4 weeks period at SCTIMST, Trivandrum. This orientation introduces the new entrants about the entire program and clinical engineering in generally. They are taken to various departments in hospital wing and also at the BMT wing. introductory classes are taken related to clinical sciences and medical device development by practicing clinicians and scientists who work in development of medica devices.

==1st semester==

*Quality Management in Healthcare
*Patient Safety and Risk Management in hospitals
*Elective 2(Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine/ Advanced Polymer Science and Technology/ Analytical instrumentation and medical laboratory equipment)
*Clinical engineering internship

==5th semester==
*Major Project

==Rural hospital visits==
Visits to various rural hospitals are undertaken for period of about 1 week to learn and understand about the ground realities in rural healthcare system. Some of the locations to which the students have visited so far includes:
*Herbertpur, Uttarakhand
*Manali, Himachal Pradesh
*Makunda, Assam
*Bissamkatak, Odhisa
*Gudalur, Tamil Nadu
*padhar,Madhya Pradesh

==Corporate Hospital internships==
These full-time internships are taken up by all students in this program for a period of about 4 weeks in the biomedical / clinical engineering departments of various corporate hospital across the major cities of India. So far the following are the hospitals where students have gone for internship:
*Fortis Raheja Hospital, Mumbai
*Max Healthcare, Delhi
*Care Hospitals, Hyderabad
*Apollo Hospitals, Chennai
*King Edward Memorial Hospital, Mumbai

==Idea generation exercise==
All the students are required to independently identify the problems in clinical settings during their clinical attachment and then try to solve them using an innovative approach and finally submit 25 solutions which are novel, practical and implementable. one or more these ideas might on a later stage be implemented as a project.

This gives the students an opportunity to horn their skills of innovative thinking. Hundreds of such ideas have been generated so far.

==Clinical attachment==
The intention of clinical attachment for engineers is quite similar to that why a clinical student is put into it i.e. to learn how to work in clinical settings and understand the various challenges faced there. This gives a good working experience to the students before the graduate itself.

==at CMC Vellore==
At CMC Vellore, the clinical attachment is 2 days per week for an entire semester leading to more than 100 hours of total clinical rotation across about 10 clinical departments.

==Eligibility criteria==
B.E./B.Tech./Recognized appropriate four-year course; on the basis of [http://www.koshikaacademy.com/ GATE] ([[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering]]) subject (AE, BT, CE, CH, CS, EC, EE, IN, IT, ME, MN, MT, PI, TF, XE) and score.

==Admission Process==
The admissions are carried out by IIT Madras at the IIT Madras campus, Chennai. Only the candidates with a valid GATE score are eligible to apply for this program. Applications can be sent in when the notification is released (generally in the period of march every year). The list of shortlisted is declared by mid-April and these candidates are generally called further rounds of selection in the month of may. These selections include a screening test which is on basic mathematics and physics. This is followed by personal interview of those candidates who have cleared the screening test. Those who finally clear this interview process are offered admission into the M.Tech program.

==Intake==
Intake currently being offered under this program is around 16 students every year.

'''Near Eastern Archaeology''' (sometimes known as '''Middle Eastern archaeology''') is a regional branch of the wider, global discipline of [[archaeology]]. It refers generally to the excavation and study of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and [[material culture]] of the [[Near East]] from antiquity to the recent past.

==Definition==
The description "Near Eastern" for this branch of archaeology is, of course, highly Eurocentric and Americocentric, reflecting the origins and growth of the field in Western academic traditions. However, in the absence of better solutions, and the continued heavy involvement of Western academics, the term has taken hold and remains in frequent use.

The definition of the Near East is usually based on the [[Fertile Crescent]]; the region between the Nile Valley (modern [[Egypt]]) and Mesopotamia (modern [[Iraq]]). Also usually included are [[Iran]], the [[Arabian peninsula]] and its islands, Anatolia (modern-day [[Turkey]]), [[Cyprus]] and [[North Africa]] west of Egypt. The history of archaeological investigation in this region grew out of the 19th century discipline of [[Biblical archaeology]], efforts mostly by Europeans to uncover evidence for [[Bible|Biblical]] ([[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments) narratives. Much archaeological work in this region is still influenced by that discipline, although within the last three decades there has been a marked tendency by some archaeologists to dissociate their work from Biblical frameworks.

Near Eastern Archaeology is a term with a wide, often generalised application, and is frequently divided into further regional sub-branches, the archaeology of modern states in the region or along broad thematic lines. Regions can be loosely defined, but are often based on recognizable entities that evidence cultural cohesion and coincide with topographical zones. Scholars may differ on the way the region is divided. Regional divisions also may change from period to period.

The most common fields of study are [[Biblical archaeology]] dealing with the region and history of the [[Bible]]; [[Assyriology]] dealing with [[Mesopotamia]]; [[Egyptology]] dealing with the ancient history of what is today [[Egypt]] and parts of the [[Sudan]]; and [[prehistoric archaeology]] which is not tied to a region but instead deals with the origins of [[culture]] before the invention of [[writing]].

==Geographic subdivisions==
[[Egyptology]] is one example of a specialized branch that deals with the Nile Valley cultures of Egypt and associated regions in sub-Saharan Africa, the Sinai Peninsula to the east, and parts of North Africa. It includes language studies, history and archaeology and their related disciplines. Nowadays, there is much work also done on the prehistoric archaeological record and its practitioners are best described as prehistorians.

The name [[Levant]] (or Syria-Palestine) is used to refer to the area adjacent to the east coast of the Mediterranean. The southern region included in this term encompasses [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], and part of [[Jordan]]. [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] was its ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] name and was also in use during the [[Crusade]]s (1095–1291), the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule (1517-1917) and the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate]] (1918–1948). The same region is also called the [[Holy Land]], the [[Land of Israel]], and [[Canaan]] because of biblical associations. The foregoing names can be perceived as having political overtones, meaning that the more neutral, geographically based term the [[southern Levant]] has become popular with archaeologists who wish to refer to this area without prejudice or political orientation.  In many contexts the Sinai Peninsula is also considered to be part of the southern Levant, although it is part of the modern state of Egypt. Archaeologically, it is distinguished from the heartland of Egypt, the Nile Valley and Delta.

The term northern Levant can be used to refer to [[Lebanon]], the Syrian littoral and portions of the Mediterranean coast of Turkey in the province of [[Hatay Province|Hatay]]. More usually,  these regions are included in greater Syria, a name used to refer to the whole area between Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Arabia. The Mediterranean coast of Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and parts of Northern Israel are also known as [[Phoenicia]], after the ancient kingdom. However, this term suffers from the same problems as Canaan and equivalents and so is generally now only used in a strict historical sense.

The landmass of [[Anatolia]], most of modern Turkey, is bordered by several seas and includes parts of Northern Mesopotamia. The [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rise in Turkey and flow south into Iraq.

[[Cyprus]] (ancient [[Alashiya]]), a large island in the eastern Mediterranean was a separate cultural entity during most periods of human occupation. However, its proximity to both Anatolia and the northern and southern Levant was responsible for influences from and to both these regions. This was especially the case as Cyprus was an important source of copper for much of the region.

[[Mesopotamia]] ("The Land of Two Rivers") is considered to begin more or less near the modern border with Iraq and refers to the flat valley of the southern [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers and their tributaries. These rivers empty into the [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway that separates Iraq from Iran. Sumerology is a very specialized discipline that deals with the history, language and archaeology of ancient [[Sumer]] (southern Mesopotamia), mostly during the [[4th millennium BCE|4th]] and 3rd millennium BCE. [[Assyriology]] deals with the [[Assyria]]ns who succeeded the Sumerians and covers much of the region while that language was still in use.

[[Iran]], sometimes known as [[Persia]], includes a large plateau and its periphery, including the [[Zagros Mountains]]. Sub-disciplines of this region deal mostly with the languages, history and archaeology of regions within this large area.

The Arabian Peninsula and its offshore islands is a separate geographical zone that has contacts with Sinai, the well-watered regions to the north, and by sea with the far-east.

==Organisations==
Due to the historic interest in the archaeology of the Near East, especially due to the Biblical links of the area, there are a large number of organisations dedicated to the archaeological investigation of the region. These include the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] which publishes the journal ''[[Near Eastern Archaeology Magazine]]'', the [[Council for British Research in the Levant]] which publishes the journal [http://www.art.man.ac.uk/ARTHIST/levant.htm Levant], and [[The Netherlands Institute for the Near East]] which publishes the journal [http://www.nino-leiden.nl/publication/bibliotheca-orientalis Bibliotheca Orientalis].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field intends to unite [[functional genomics]] and [[neurobiology]] in order to understand the nervous system as a whole from a genomic perspective.

The nervous system in vertebrates is made up of two major types of cells – [[Neuroglia|neuroglial cells]] and [[neuron]]s. Hundreds of different types of neurons exist in humans, with varying functions – some of them process external stimuli; others generate a response to stimuli; others organize in centralized structures ([[brain]], [[Ganglia, spinal|spinal ganglia]]) that are responsible for cognition, perception, and regulation of motor functions. Neurons in these centralized locations tend to organize in giant networks and communicate extensively with each other. Prior to the availability of [[Gene expression profiling|expression arrays]] and [[DNA sequencing|DNA sequencing methodologies]], researchers sought to understand the cellular behaviour of neurons (including [[Synapse|synapse formation]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and neuronal development and regionalization in the human nervous system) in terms of the underlying molecular biology and biochemistry, without any understanding of the influence of a neuron’s genome on its development and behaviour. As our understanding of the genome has expanded, the role of networks of gene interactions in the maintenance of neuronal function and behaviour has garnered interest in the [[neuroscience]] research community. Neurogenomics allows scientists to study the nervous system of organisms in the context of these underlying regulatory and transcriptional networks. This approach is distinct from [[neurogenetics]], which emphasizes the role of single genes without a network-interaction context when studying the nervous system.&lt;ref name="Jain 7–16"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neurogenetics and Neurogenomics|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-62703-272-8_2|publisher = Humana Press|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9781627032711|pages = 7–16|language = en|first = Kewal K.|last = Jain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probes can also have species-specific binding affinities that can confound comparative analysis.

Notably, the association between behavioural patterns and high [[penetrance]] single [[Gene locus|gene loci]] falls under the purview of [[neurogenetics]] research, wherein the focus is to identify a simple causative relationship between a single, high penetrance gene and an observed function/behaviour.  However, it has been shown that several neurological diseases tend to be [[Polygenic disorder|polygenic]], being influenced by multiple different [[gene]]s and [[regulatory regions]] instead of one gene alone. There has hence been a shift from single gene approaches to network approaches for studying neurological development and diseases, a shift that has been greatly propelled by the advent of [[next generation sequencing]] methodologies.

However, linkage studies have largely failed at identifying causative variants for psychiatric disorders such as these, primarily because of their complex genetic architecture. Multiple low penetrance [[Risk allele|risk variants]] can be aggregated in affected individuals and families, and sets of causative variants could vary across families.

With the availability of massively parallel [[next generation sequencing]] methodologies, scientists have been able to look beyond the probe based captures of expressed genes. [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]], for example, identifies 25-60% more expressed genes than microarrays do. In the upcoming field of neurogenomics, it is hoped that by understanding the genomic profiles of different parts of the brain, we might be able to improve our understanding of how the interactions between genes and pathways influence cellular function and development.

When [[autism]] was identified as a distinct biological disorder in the 1980s, researchers found that autistic individuals showed a brain growth abnormality in the [[cerebellum]] in their early developmental years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hypoplasia of cerebellar vermal lobules VI and VII in autism|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|date = 1988-05-26|issn = 0028-4793|pmid = 3367935|pages = 1349–1354|volume = 318|issue = 21|doi = 10.1056/NEJM198805263182102|first = E.|last = Courchesne|first2 = R.|last2 = Yeung-Courchesne|first3 = G. A.|last3 = Press|first4 = J. R.|last4 = Hesselink|first5 = T. L.|last5 = Jernigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has indicated that 90% of autistic children have a larger brain volume than their peers by 2 to 4 years of age, and show an expansion in the white and gray matter content in the [[cerebrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unusual brain growth patterns in early life in patients with autistic disorder: an MRI study|journal = Neurology|date = 2001-07-24|issn = 0028-3878|pmid = 11468308|pages = 245–254|volume = 57|issue = 2|first = E.|last = Courchesne|first2 = C.

These findings highlighted the influence of structural variance in the brain on psychiatric disorders, and have motivated the use of imaging technologies to map regions of divergence between healthy and diseased brains. Furthermore, while it may not always be possible to retrieve biological specimens from different areas live human brains, [[neuroimaging]] techniques offer a noninvasive means to understanding the biological basis of neurological disorders. It is hoped that an understanding of localization patterns of different psychiatric diseases could in turn inform network analysis studies in neurogenomics.

====MRI====
[[Magnetic resonance imaging|Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) can be used to identify the structural composition of the brain. Particularly in the context of neurogenomics, MRI has played an extensive role in the study of [[Alzheimer's disease]](AD) over the past four decades. It was initially used to rule out other causes of [[dementia]],&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent studies indicated the presence of characteristic changes in patients with AD. As a result, MRI scans are currently being used as a neuroimaging tool to help identify the temporal and spatial pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, such as specific cerebral alterations and [[amyloid imaging]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The ease and non-invasive nature of MRI scans has motivated research projects that trace the development and onset of psychiatric diseases in the brain. Alzheimer disease has become a key candidate in this topographical approach to psychiatric diseases. For example, MRI scans are currently being used to track the resting and task-dependent functional profiles of brains in children with autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brain Imaging and Blood Biomarker Abnormalities in Children With Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study|journal = JAMA Neurology|date = 2015-08-01|issn = 2168-6157|pmc = 4625544|pmid = 26121081|pages = 912–919|volume = 72|issue = 8|doi = 10.1001/jamaneurol.2015.1099|first = Yakeel T.|last = Quiroz|first2 = Aaron P.|last2 = Schultz|first3 = Kewei|last3 = Chen|first4 = Hillary D.|last4 = Protas|first5 = Michael|last5 = Brickhouse|first6 = Adam S.|last6 = Fleisher|first7 = Jessica B.|last7 = Langbaum|first8 = Pradeep|last8 = Thiyyagura|first9 = Anne M.|last9 = Fagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have found indications of early onset brain alterations in at-risk individuals for AD.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Autism Center of Excellence at University of California, San Diego, is also conducting MRI studies with children between 12 and 42 months, in the hopes of characterizing brain development abnormalities in children who present behavioural symptoms of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UC San Diego Autism Center of Excellence|url = https://autism-center.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspx|website = autism-center.ucsd.edu|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional research has indicated that there are specifics patterns of [[atrophy]] in the cerebrum (as a repercussion of [[neurodegeneration]]) in different neurological disorders and diseases. These disease-specific patterns of progression of atrophy can be identified with MRI scans, and provide a clinical phenotype context to neurogenomic research. The temporal information about disease progression provided by this approach can also potentially inform the interpretation of gene network-level perturbations in psychiatric diseases.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Optical mapping ====
One prohibitive feature of 2nd generation sequencing methodologies is the upper limit on the genomic range accessible by [[Whole genome sequencing|mate-pairing.]] [[Optical mapping]] is an emerging methodology used to span large-scale variants that cannot usually be detected using paired end reads. This approach has been successfully applied to detect [[Structural variation|structural variants]] in [[oligodendroglioma]], a type of brain cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Discovery of structural alterations in solid tumor oligodendroglioma by single molecule analysis|url = http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-14-505|journal = BMC Genomics|date = 2013-07-26|pmc = 3727977|pmid = 23885787|volume = 14|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-14-505|language = En|first = Mohana|last = Ray|first2 = Steve|last2 = Goldstein|first3 = Shiguo|last3 = Zhou|first4 = Konstantinos|last4 = Potamousis|first5 = Deepayan|last5 = Sarkar|first6 = Michael A|last6 = Newton|first7 = Elizabeth|last7 = Esterberg|first8 = Christina|last8 = Kendziorski|first9 = Oliver|last9 = Bogler|pages=505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has also highlighted the versatility of optical maps in improving existing genome assemblies. [[Chromosomal rearrangement]]s, [[microdeletion]]s, and large-scale [[translocations]] have been associated with impaired neurological and [[cognitive function]], for example in hereditary [[Neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa|neuropathy]] and [[neurofibromatosis]]. Optical mapping can significantly improve variant detection and inform gene interaction network models for the diseased state in neurological disorders.

==== Studying other brain diseases ====
Apart from neurological disorders, there are additional diseases that manifest in the brain and have formed exemplar use-case scenarios for the application of brain imaging in network analysis. In a classic example of imaging-genomic analyses, a research study in 2012 compared MRI scans and gene expression profiles of 104 glioma patients in order to distinguish treatment outcomes and identify novel targetable genomic pathways in [[Glioblastoma multiforme|Glioblastoma Multiforme]] (GBM). Researchers found two distinct groups of patients with significantly different organization of [[white matter]] (invasive vs non-invasive). Subsequent pathway analysis of the gene expression data indicated mitochondrial dysfunction as the top canonical pathway in an aggressive, low-mortality GBM phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Imaging genomic mapping of an invasive MRI phenotype predicts patient outcome and metabolic dysfunction: a TCGA glioma phenotype research group project|journal = BMC Medical Genomics|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1755-8794|pmc = 4057583|pmid = 24889866|pages = 30|volume = 7|doi = 10.1186/1755-8794-7-30|first = Rivka R.|last = Colen|first2 = Mark|last2 = Vangel|first3 = Jixin|last3 = Wang|first4 = David A.|last4 = Gutman|first5 = Scott N.|last5 = Hwang|first6 = Max|last6 = Wintermark|first7 = Rajan|last7 = Jain|first8 = Manal|last8 = Jilwan-Nicolas|first9 = James Y.|last9 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion of brain imaging approaches to other diseases can be used to rule out other medical illnesses while diagnosing psychiatric disorders, but cannot be used to inform the presence or absence of a psychiatric disorder.

== Research developmental models ==

=== In humans ===
The current approaches in collecting gene expression data in human brains are to use either [[microarray]]s or [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]]. Currently, it is rare to gather "live" brain tissue – only when treatments involve brain surgery is there a chance that brain tissue is collected during the procedure. This is the case with epilepsy.

Currently, gene expression data is usually collected on post mortem brains and this is often a barrier to neurogenomics research in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* The cause of death is also an important variable to consider in the collection of human brain samples for the purposes of neurogenomics research. For example, brain samples of individuals with clinical [[Depression (differential diagnoses)|depression]] are often collected after suicide. Certain conditions of death, such as drug overdose or self-inflicted gunshot, will alter the expression of the brain. 
* Another issue with studying gene expression in brains is the cellular heterogeneity of brain tissue samples. Bulk brain samples may vary in proportions of specific cell populations from case to case. This can impact the gene expression signatures and may significantly change differential expression analysis. 
** One approach to address this issue is to use [[Single cell sequencing|single cell RNA-seq]]. This would control for a specific cell type. However, this solution is only applicable where studies are not cell-type specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Differential diagnosis]] also remains a critical pre-analytical confounder of cohort-wide studies of spectrum neurological disorders.

===Animal models===
Ongoing genomics research in neurological disorders tends to use animal models (and corresponding [[Homologous chromosome|gene homologs]]) to understand the network interactions underlying a particular disorder due to ethical issues surrounding the retrieval of biological specimens from live human brains. This, too, is not without its roadblocks.

Neurogenomic research with a model organism is contingent on the availability of a fully sequenced and annotated reference genome. Additionally, the RNA profiles ([[MicroRNA|miRNA]], [[Non-coding RNA|ncRNA]], [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]) of the model organism need to be well catalogued, and any inferences applied from them to humans must have a basis in functional/sequence [[Homology (biology)|homology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Experimental mice models for psychiatric disorders ====
A common approach to using a mouse model is to apply an experimental treatment to a pregnant mouse in order to affect a whole litter. However, a key issue in the field is the treatment of litters in a statistical analysis. Most studies consider the total number of offspring produced as that may lead to an increase in statistical power. However, the correct way is to count by the number of litters and to normalize based on litter size. It was found that several autism studies incorrectly performed their statistical analyses based on total number of offspring instead of number of litters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Several anxiety disorders such as [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) involve [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] changes in several different brain regions, such as the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]], and [[nucleus accumbens]]. The cellular encoding of traumatic events and the behavioral responses triggered by such events has been shown to lie primarily in changes in signaling molecules associated with [[synaptic transmission]].

Global [[gene expression profiling]] of the various gene regions implicated in fear and anxiety processing, using mice models, has led to the identification of temporally and spatially distinct sets of differentially expressed genes. Pathway analysis of these genes has indicated possible roles in [[neurogenesis]] and anxiety-related behavioural responses, alongside other functional and phenotypic observations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Mice models for brain research have contributed significantly to [[drug development]] and increased our understanding of the genomic underpinnings of several neurological diseases in the last generation. [[Chlorpromazine]], the first [[antipsychotic]] drug (discovered in 1951), was identified as a viable treatment option after it was shown to suppress response to aversive stimuli in rats in a behavioural screen.

==== Challenges ====
The modelling and assessment of latent symptoms (thoughts, verbal learning, social interactions, cognitive behaviour) remains a challenge when using model organisms to study [[psychiatric disorders]] with a complex genetic [[pathology]]. For example, a given genotype+phenotype in a mouse model must imitate the genomic underpinnings of a phenotype observed in a human.

This is a particularly crucial item of consideration in spectrum disorders such as [[autism]]. Autism is a disorder whose symptoms can be divided into two categories: (i) deficits of social interactions and (ii) repetitive behaviours and restricted interests. Since mice tend to be more social creatures amongst all members of the order ''[[Rodent]]ia'' currently being used as model organisms, mice are generally used to model human psychiatric disorders as closely as possible. Particularly for autism, the following work-arounds are currently in place to emulate human behavioural symptoms:
* For the first diagnostic category of impaired social behaviour, mice are subject to a social assay intended to represent typical autistic social deficits. Normal social behaviour for mice includes sniffing, following, physical contact and [[allogrooming]]. Vocal communication could be used as well. 
* There are a number of ways the second diagnostic category can be observed in mice. Examples of repetitive behaviours can include excessive circling, self-grooming and excessive digging. Usually these behaviours would be performed consistently within a long measurement of time (i.e. self-grooming for 10 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

** While repetitive behaviours are easily observable, it is difficult to characterize actual restricted interests of mice. One aspect of restricted interests of autistic individuals is the "insistence of sameness"—the concept that autistic individuals require their environment to remain consistent. If that environment should change, the individual would experience stress and anxiety. There has been reported success in confirming a mouse model of autism by changing the mouse’s environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Gene expression in the brain==
The gene expression profile of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) is unique. Eighty percent of all human genes are expressed in the brain; 5,000 of these genes are solely expressed in the CNS. The human brain has the highest amount of gene expression of all studied mammalian brains. In comparison, tissues outside of the brain will have more similar expression levels in comparison to their mammalian counterparts. One source of the increased expression levels in the human brain is from the non-protein coding region of the genome. Numerous studies have indicated that the human brain have a higher level of expression in regulatory regions in comparison to other mammalian brains. There is also notable enrichment for more [[alternative splicing]] events in the human brain.&lt;ref name="Jain 7–16"/&gt;

===Spatial differences===
Gene expression profiles also vary within specific regions of the brain. A [[Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization|microarray study]] showed that the transcriptome profile of the CNS clusters together based on region. A different study characterized the regulation of gene expression across 10 different regions based on their [[Expression quantitative trait loci|eQTL]] signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic variability in the regulation of gene expression in ten regions of the human brain|url = http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v17/n10/full/nn.3801.html|journal = Nature Neuroscience|date = 2014-10-01|issn = 1097-6256|pmc = 4208299|pmid = 25174004|pages = 1418–1428|volume = 17|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/nn.3801|language = en|first = Adaikalavan|last = Ramasamy|first2 = Daniah|last2 = Trabzuni|first3 = Sebastian|last3 = Guelfi|first4 = Vibin|last4 = Varghese|first5 = Colin|last5 = Smith|first6 = Robert|last6 = Walker|first7 = Tisham|last7 = De|last8 = UK Brain Expression Consortium|last9 = North American Brain Expression Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the varying expression profiles relates to function, [[neuron migration]] and cellular heterogeneity of the region.

A study completed at Harvard Medical School in 2014 was able to identify developmental lineages stemming from single base neuronal mutations. The researchers sequenced 36 neurons from the cerebral cortex of three normal individuals, and found that highly expressed genes, and neural associated genes, were significantly enriched for single-neuron [[Single nucleotide variants|SNVs]]. These SNVs, in turn, were found to be correlated with chromatin markers of transcription from fetal brain.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Somatic mutation in single human neurons tracks developmental and transcriptional history|journal = Science|date = 2015-10-02|issn = 1095-9203|pmc = 4664477|pmid = 26430121|pages = 94–98|volume = 350|issue = 6256|doi = 10.1126/science.aab1785|first = Michael A.|last = Lodato|first2 = Mollie B.|last2 = Woodworth|first3 = Semin|last3 = Lee|first4 = Gilad D.|last4 = Evrony|first5 = Bhaven K.|last5 = Mehta|first6 = Amir|last6 = Karger|first7 = Soohyun|last7 = Lee|first8 = Thomas W.|last8 = Chittenden|first9 = Alissa M.|last9 = D'Gama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development patterns in humans===
Gene expression of the brain changes throughout the different phases of life. The most significant levels of expression are found during early development, with the rate of gene expression being highest during fetal development. This results from the rapid growth of neurons in the embryo. Neurons at this stage are undergoing [[Neuron|neuronal differentiation]], [[cell proliferation]], migration events and dendritic and [[Synapse|synaptic development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v508/n7495/full/nature13185.html|journal = Nature|date = 2014-04-10|issn = 0028-0836|pmc = 4105188|pmid = 24695229|pages = 199–206|volume = 508|issue = 7495|doi = 10.1038/nature13185|language = en|first = Jeremy A.|last = Miller|first2 = Song-Lin|last2 = Ding|first3 = Susan M.|last3 = Sunkin|first4 = Kimberly A.|last4 = Smith|first5 = Lydia|last5 = Ng|first6 = Aaron|last6 = Szafer|first7 = Amanda|last7 = Ebbert|first8 = Zackery L.|last8 = Riley|first9 = Joshua J.|last9 = Royall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene expression patterns shift closer towards specialized functional functional profiles during embryonic development, however, certain developmental steps are still ongoing at parturition. Consequently, gene expression profiles of the two brain hemispheres appear asymmetrical at birth. At birth, gene expression profiles appear asymmetrical between [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemispheres]]. As development continues, the gene expression profiles become similar between the hemispheres.  Given a healthy adult, expression profiles stay relatively consistent from the late twenties into the late forties. From the fifties onwards, there is significant decrease in the expression of genes important for regular function. Despite this, there is an increase in the diversity of genes being expressed across the brain. This age related change in expression may be correlated with [[GC-content|GC content]]. At later stages of life, there is an increase in the induction of low GC-content pivotal genes as well as an increase in the repression of high GC-content pivotal genes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another cause of the shift in gene diversity is the accumulation of mutations and DNA damage. Gene expression studies show that genes that accrue these age-related mutations are consistent between individuals in the aging population. Genes that are highly expressed at development decrease significantly at late stages in life, whereas genes that are highly repressed at development increase significantly at the late stages.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Sequence data is used to understand the evolutionary genetic changes which led to the development of the human CNS. We can then understand how the neurological phenotypes differ between species. [[Comparative genomics]] entails comparison of sequence data across a [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] to pinpoint the genotypic changes that occur within specific lineages, and understand how these changes might have arisen. The increase in high quality mammalian reference sequences generally makes [[Qualitative comparative analysis|comparative analysis]] better as it increases [[statistical power]]. However, the increase in number of species in a [[phylogeny]] does risk adding unnecessary noise as the alignments of the [[Orthologous gene|orthologous]] sequences usually decrease in quality. Furthermore, different classes of species will have significant differences in their phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Geschwind 633–647"&gt;{{Cite journal

Despite this, comparative genomics has allowed us to connect the genetic changes found in a phylogeny to specific pathways. In order to determine this, lineages are tested for the functional changes that accrue over time. This is often measured as a ratio of [[nonsynonymous substitution]]s to [[synonymous substitution]]s or the [[dN/dS ratio]] (sometimes, further abbreviated to ω). When the dN/dS ratio is greater than 1, this indicates [[positive selection]]. A dN/dS ratio equal to 1 is evidence of no selective pressures. A dN/dS ratio less than 1 indicates [[negative selection (artificial selection)|negative selection]]. For example, the conserved regions of the genome will generally have a dN/dS ratio of less than 1 since any changes to those positions will likely be detrimental.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal

Understanding the significance of the [[positive selection]] is generally the next step. For example, ''[[ASPM (gene)|ASPM]]'', ''[[CDK5RAP2]]'' and ''[[NIN (gene)|NIN]]'' are genes that are positively selected for on the human lineage and have been directly correlated with brain size. This finding may help elucidate why human brains are larger than other mammalian brains.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Network level expression differences between species ===
It is thought that gene expression changes, being the ultimate response for any genetic changes, are a good proxy for understanding [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences within biological samples. Comparative studies have revealed a range of differences in the [[Transcriptional regulation|transcriptional controls]] between [[primate]]s and [[rodent]]s. For example, the gene ''[[CNTNAP2]]'' is specifically enriched for in the [[prefrontal cortex]]. The mouse homolog of ''CNTNAP2'' is not expressed in the mouse brain. ''CNTNAP2'' has been implicated in cognitive functions of language as well as [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s such as Autism Spectrum Disorder. This suggests that the control of expression plays a significant role in the development in unique human cognitive function.  As a consequence, a number of studies have investigated the brain specific enhancers. [[Transcription factor]]s such as ''[[SOX5]]'' have been found to be positively selected for on the human lineage. Gene expression studies in humans, [[chimpanzee]]s and [[rhesus macaque]]s, have identified human specific co-expression networks, and an elevation in gene expression in the human cortex in comparison to primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decoding human gene expression signatures in the brain|journal = Transcription|date = 2013-06-01|issn = 2154-1272|pmc = 4042582|pmid = 23665540|pages = 102–108|volume = 4|issue = 3|first = Guang-Zhong|last = Wang|first2 = Genevieve|last2 = Konopka|doi=10.4161/trns.24885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders==

Neurogenomic disorders manifest themselves as [[neurological disorder]]s with a complex genetic architecture and a [[Non-Mendelian inheritance|non-Mendelian]]-like pattern of inheritance.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Some examples of these disorders include [[Bipolar disorder]] and [[Schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several genes may be involved in the manifestation of the disorder, and mutations in such disorders are generally rare and ''de novo.'' Hence it becomes extremely unlikely to observe the same (potentially causative) variant in two unrelated individuals affected with the same neurogenomic disorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ongoing research has implicated several ''[[De novo mutation|de novo]]'' exonic variations and structural variations in [[Autism spectrum|Autism Spectrum Disorder]] (ASD), for example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[allelic spectrum]] of the rare and common variants in neurogenomic disorders therefore necessitates a need for large cohort studies in order to effectively exclude low effect variants and identify the overarching pathways frequently mutated in the different disorders, rather than specific genes and specific [[High-penetrance|high penetrance]] mutations.

[[Whole genome sequencing]] (WGS) and [[whole exome sequencing]] (WES) has been used in [[Genome-wide association study|Genome Wide Association Studies]] (GWAS) to  characterize genetic variants associated with neurogenomic disorders. However, the impact of these variants cannot always be verified because of the non-Mendelian inheritance patterns observed in several of these disorders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another prohibitive feature in network analysis is the lack of large-scale datasets for many psychiatric (neurogenomic) diseases. Since several diseases with neurogenomic underpinnings tend to have a [[Polygenic disorder|polygenic]] basis, several nonspecific, rare, and partially penetrant ''de novo'' mutations in different patients can contribute to the same observed range of phenotypes, as is the case with Autism Spectrum Disorder and schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a large-scale initiative like this is still lacking in the field of neurogenomic disorders specifically.

=== Modelling psychiatric disorders in neurogenomics research – issues ===
One major [[Genome-wide association study|GWAS]] study identified 13 new risk loci for [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genome-wide association analysis identifies 13 new risk loci for schizophrenia|journal = Nature Genetics|date = 2013-10-01|issn = 1546-1718|pmc = 3827979|pmid = 23974872|pages = 1150–1159|volume = 45|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ng.2742|first = Stephan|last = Ripke|first2 = Colm|last2 = O'Dushlaine|first3 = Kimberly|last3 = Chambert|first4 = Jennifer L.|last4 = Moran|first5 = Anna K.|last5 = Kähler|first6 = Susanne|last6 = Akterin|first7 = Sarah E.|last7 = Bergen|first8 = Ann L.|last8 = Collins|first9 = James J.|last9 = Crowley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the impact of these candidates would ideally demonstrate a schizophrenia phenotype in animal models, which is usually difficult to observe due to its manifestation as a latent personality. This approach is able to determine the molecular impact the [[candidate gene]]. Ideally the candidate genes would have a neurological impact, which in turn would suggest that it plays a role in the neurological disorder. For example, in the aforementioned schizophrenia GWAS study, Ripke and colleagues&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; determined that these candidate genes were all involved in calcium signalling. Alternatively, one can study these variants in model organisms in the context of affected neurological function. It is important to note that the [[High-penetrance|high penetrance]] variants of these disorders tend to be ''de novo'' mutations.

A further complication to studying neurogenomic disorders is the heterogeneous nature of the disorder. In many of these disorders, the mutations observed from case to case do not stay consistent. In autism, an affected individual may experience a large amount of deleterious mutations in gene X. A different affected individual may not have any significant mutations on gene X but have a large amount of mutations in gene Y. The alternative is to determine if gene X and gene Y impact the same biochemical pathway—one that influences a neurological function. A bioinformatics network analysis is one approach to this problem. Network analyses methodologies provide a generalized, systems overview of a molecular pathway.

One final complication to consider is the comorbidity of neurogenomic genes. Several disorders, especially at the more severe ends of the spectrum tend to be comorbid with each other. For example, more severe cases of [[Autism spectrum|ASD]] tend to be associated with [[intellectual disability]] (ID). This raises the question of whether or not there are true, unique ASD genes and unique ID genes or if there are just genes just associated with neurological function that can be mutated into an abnormal phenotype. One confounding factor may be the actual diagnostic category and methods of the spectrum disorders as symptoms between severe disorders may be similar. One study investigated the comorbid symptoms between groups of ID and ASD, and found no significant difference between the symptoms of ID children, ASD children with ID and ASD children without ID. Future research may help establish a more stringent genetic basis for the diagnoses of these disorders.

=== Network analysis ===
[[File:Network analysis pipeline.tif|thumb|417x417px|A typical network analysis pipeline in neurogenomics]]
The main goal of network analysis in neurogenomics is to identify statistically significant nonrandom associations between genes that contain risk variants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While several algorithm implementations of this approach already exist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the general steps for network analysis remain the same. 
* The analytical process starts out with the identification of a biological network based on experimental validation. This can be a [[gene co-expression network]], or a [[Protein–protein interaction|protein-protein interaction]] (PPI) network. The nodes of the network will be clustered.
* Subsequently, a specific list of genes with known associations to a particular phenotype of interest is generated. This list could be determined by experimental data, agnostic of genetic studies in psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is referred to as a 'hit list'. 
* Genes that belong to the hit list as well as the biological network selected in the first step are marked as such.  
* This is followed by a guilt-by-association (GBA) step. This means that clusters within the biological network that have a significant amount of genes from the hit list are investigated further using functional enrichment tools and database querying for the pathways in which these high scoring cluster genes participate &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Thus the biological associations of the high-scoring, experimentally implicated cluster members are investigated, expanding the search area from beyond the initial hit list to include gene members of additional pathways that may have significant association with the initial biological network under consideration. This results in a set of candidate genes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The underlying principle of this approach is that the genes that cluster together, will also jointly affect the same molecular pathway. Again, they would ideally be part of a neurological function. The candidate genes can then be used to prioritize variants for wet lab validation.

== Neuropharmacology ==
Historically, due to the behavioural stimulation manifested as a symptom in several the neurogenomic disorders, the therapies would rely mostly on [[Antipsychotic|anti-psychotics]] or antidepressents. These classes of medications would suppress common symptoms of the disorders, but with questionable efficacy. The biggest barrier to neruopharmacogenomic research was the cohort sizes. Given newly available large-cohort sequencing data, there has been a recent push to expand therapeutic options. The heterogenous nature of neurological diseases is the key motivation for personalized medicine approaches to their therapies. It is rare to find single high penetrance causative genes in neurological diseases. The genomic profiles understandably vary between cases, and logically, the therapies would need to vary between cases. Further complicating the issue is that many of these disorders are spectrum disorders. Their genetic etiology will vary within this spectrum. For example, severe ASD is associated with high penetrance de novo mutations. Milder forms of ASD is usually associated with a mixture of common variants.

The key issue then is the translation of these newly identified genetic variants (from [[Copy-number variation|Copy Number Variant]] studies, candidate gene sequencing and high throughput sequencing technologies) into an intervention for patients with neurogenomic disorders. One aspect will be if the neurological disorder are medically actionable (i.e. is there a simple metabolic pathway that a therapy can target). For example, specific cases of [[Autism spectrum|ASD]] have been associated with microdeletions on [[TMLHE]] gene. This gene codes for the enzyme of [[carnitine biosynthesis]]. Supplements to elevate carnitine levels appeared to alleviate certain ASD symptoms but the study was confounded by many influencing factors. As mentioned earlier, using a gene network approach will help identify relevant pathways of interest. Many neuropharmacogenomic approaches have focused on targeting the downstream products of these pathways.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine in Neuropsychiatry|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662731200431X|journal = Neuron|date = 2012-06-07|pmc = 3407812|pmid = 22681682|pages = 773–776|volume = 74|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.05.004|first = Francis J.|last = McMahon|first2 = Thomas R.|last2 = Insel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From De Novo Mutations to Personalized Therapeutic Interventions in Autism|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-med-091113-024550|journal = Annual Review of Medicine|date = 2015-01-01|pmid = 25587659|pages = 487–507|volume = 66|issue = 1|doi = 10.1146/annurev-med-091113-024550|first = William M.|last = Brandler|first2 = Jonathan|last2 = Sebat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blood brain barrier ===
Studies in animal models for several brain diseases has shown that the [[Blood–brain barrier|blood brain barrier]] (BBB) undergoes modification at many levels; for example, the surface glycoprotein composition can influence the types of HIV-1 strains transported by the BBB. The BBB has been found to be key in the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]] disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mouse models of neurological disorders: a view from the blood-brain barrier|journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date = 2010-10-01|issn = 0006-3002|pmc = 2891624|pmid = 19879356|pages = 881–888|volume = 1802|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.10.011|first = William A.|last = Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely difficult, however, to be able to study this in humans due to obvious restrictions with accessing the brain and retrieving biological specimens for sequencing or morphological analysis. Mice models of the BBB and models of disease states have served well in conceptualizing the BBB as a regulatory interface between disease and good health in the brain.

=== Personalized neurobiology ===
The heterogenous nature of neurological diseases is the key motivation for personalized medicine approaches to their therapies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Genomic samples of individual patients could be used to identify predictive factors, or to better understand the specific prognosis of a neurogenomic disease, and use this information to guide treatment options.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is a clear clinical utility to this approach, the adaptation of this approach is still nonexistent.

There are various issues prohibiting the application of personalized genomics to the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. 
* Firstly, the causative network biology of several spectrum disorders with neurogenomic underpinnings is not fully understood yet, in spite of extensive studies conducted with disorders like [[Autism spectrum|Autism Spectrum]]&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thus, the analytical validity of standing hypotheses concerning the etiology of neurogenomic disorders has still not been fully established and is subject to debate and controversy.
* The clinical validity of genetic variants that have shown to be highly correlated with specific neurogenomic disorders is often a major cause of concern.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The interpretation of these test results, and subsequent decision making, are a complicated undertaking given the polygenic nature of many of these disorders. Complicating things further, it has been shown that pre-emptive intervention in major psychiatric disorders does not always reduce the risk for the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intervention might not even be available for at-risk offspring of affected adults, thereby limiting the 'medical actionability' of the data.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 
* Ethical concerns have also been raised regarding the safeguarding of personal genomic information, and how best to approach the burden of incidental findings and family risk assessment. 
** Consanguinity and in-breeding can lead to selective enrichment of rare, otherwise low penetrance genetic mutations attributed to various symptoms of neurogenomic disorders. Thus, the interpretation of family-specific genetic mutations and/or network-level disruptions in the onset of a rare psychiatric disorder requires careful consideration of the motivations of participants included in the study.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 
** That said, these issues can be addressed by effective education and counseling, and collection of genomic data from patients with psychiatric disorders should not be disqualified solely on this basis. The data itself serves as a dynamic health resource and can significantly further our understanding of the genomic basis of several psychiatric disorders.

The '''Newbury Principles''' collectively refer to an [[urban planning]] guideline stating that decisions should be made based only on the planning considerations relevant to the current development, even if the consideration of ulterior purposes may lead to a greater public good. In practice, the principles are used as a test to verify the validity of conditions to be imposed by a planning authority. 

Specifically, the decision of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment'',&lt;ref&gt;''Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment'' [1981] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 578.&lt;/ref&gt; contains the following three principles when considering the reasonableness of imposing conditions on consents:

# It must be imposed for a planning purpose.
# It must fairly and reasonably relate to the development for which permission is being given.
# It must be reasonable.

The Newbury principles are applied in [[Australia]], and have been cited by courts in [[New South Wales]] and [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1981+AC+578 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example:

Being in Time.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[monument]] in [[County Meath]], Ireland, located {{convert|8|km}} west of [[Drogheda]] on the north side of the [[River Boyne]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly, Michael J. 1982. ''Newgrange: Archaeology, Art and Legend''. London: Thames and Hudson. Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an exceptionally grand [[passage tomb]] built during the [[Neolithic]] period, around 3200 BC, making it older than [[Stonehenge]] and the [[Egyptian pyramids]]. 

The site consists of a large circular mound with an inner stone passageway and chambers. Human bones and possible [[grave goods]] or [[votive offering]]s were found in these chambers. The mound has a retaining wall at the front, made mostly of white quartz cobblestones, and it is ringed by engraved kerbstones. Many of the larger stones of Newgrange are covered in [[megalithic art]]. The mound is also ringed by a [[stone circle]]. Some of the material that makes up the monument came from as far away as the [[Mourne Mountains|Mournes]] and [[Wicklow Mountains]]. There is no agreement about what the site was used for, but it is believed that it had religious significance. Its entrance is aligned with the rising sun on the [[winter solstice]], when sunlight shines through a '[[roofbox]]' and floods the inner chamber. Several other [[Passage grave|passage tombs]] in Ireland are aligned with solstices and equinoxes, and Cairn G at [[Carrowkeel Megalithic Cemetery|Carrowkeel]] has a similar 'roofbox'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=897049982 Carrowkeel Cairn G].

It is the most famous monument within the Neolithic [[Brú na Bóinne]] complex, alongside the similar passage tomb mounds of [[Knowth]] and [[Dowth]], and as such is a part of the Brú na Bóinne [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Newgrange consists of approximately 200,000 tonnes of rock and other materials. It is {{convert|85|m}} wide at its widest point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Light: The origins of Newgrange|last=Hensey|first=|publisher=Oxbow Books|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its initial use, Newgrange was sealed for several millennia. It continued to feature in [[Irish mythology]] and [[folklore]], in which it is said to be a dwelling of [[Tuatha Dé Danann|the deities]], particularly [[The Dagda]] and his son [[Aengus]]. [[Antiquarians]] first began its study in the seventeenth century, and [[archeology|archaeological]] excavations took place at the site in the years that followed. Archaeologist [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] led the most extensive of these and also reconstructed the frontage of the site in the 1970s, a reconstruction that is controversial and disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/news/newgrange-got-new-lease-of-light-and-life-in-1960s-rebuild-1.1275165 | publisher = Irish Times | date=20 December 2008 | title= Newgrange got new lease of light and life in 1960s 'rebuild' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newgrange is a popular tourist site and, according to the archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]], is "unhesitatingly regarded by the prehistorian as the great national monument of Ireland" and as one of the most important megalithic structures in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, Colin, in O'Kelly, Michael J. 1982.

==Physical description==

===Mound and passage tomb===
[[File:Wakeman Newgrange tumulus chamber cross section.png|thumb|right|Cross section sketch of the passage]]
The Newgrange monument primarily consists of a large mound, built of alternating layers of earth and stones, with grass growing on top and a reconstructed facade of flattish white [[quartz]] stones studded at intervals with large rounded [[cobblestone|cobbles]] covering part of the circumference. The mound is {{Convert|76|m|ft}} across and {{Convert|12|m|ft}} high, and covers {{convert|4500|m2|acre}} of ground. Within the mound is a chambered passage, which may be accessed by an entrance on the southeastern side of the monument. The passage stretches for 19 metres (60&amp;nbsp;ft),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newgrange.com/|title=Newgrange|work=newgrange.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about a third of the way into the centre of the structure. At the end of the passage are three small chambers off a larger central chamber with a high [[Corbel arch|corbelled]] vault roof. Each of the smaller chambers has a large flat "basin stone" where the bones of the dead may have been deposited during prehistoric times. Whether it was a burial site remains unclear. The walls of this passage are made up of large stone slabs, twenty-two of which are on the western side and twenty-one on the eastern side. They average 1½ metres in height;&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:21)&lt;/ref&gt; several are decorated with carvings (as well as graffiti from the period after the rediscovery). The ceiling shows no evidence of smoke.
[[File:Newgrange, Meath.jpg|thumb|The entrance passage to Newgrange, and the entrance stone]]
Situated around the perimeter of the mound is a circle of [[standing stones]]. Twelve standing-stones survive out of a possible original thirty-five or thereabouts. Most archaeologists suggest that they were added later, during the [[Bronze Age]], centuries after the original monument had been abandoned as a ritual centre.

===Art===
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 079.jpg|thumb|right|Megalithic art on one of the kerbstones]]
[[File:Newgrange Stone Age Passage Tomb - Boyne Valley, Ireland (6961311036) (2).jpg|thumb|The retaining wall and kerbstones]]
Newgrange contains various examples of [[graphics|graphic]] Neolithic rock art carved onto its stone surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; These carvings fit into ten categories, five of which are curvilinear (circles, spirals, arcs, serpentiniforms, and dot-in-circles) and the other five of which are rectilinear (chevrons, lozenges, radials, parallel lines, and offsets). They are marked by wide differences in style, the skill-level needed to produce them, and on how deeply carved they are.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:146–147).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable types of art at Newgrange are the [[triskelion|triskele]]-like features found on the entrance stone. It is approximately three metres long and 1.2 metres high (10&amp;nbsp;ft long and 4&amp;nbsp;ft high), and about five tonnes in weight. It has been described as "one of the most famous stones in the entire repertory of [[megalithic art]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ó Ríordáin |first=Seán P. |author2=Glyn, Edmund Daniel  |title= New Grange and the Bend of the Boyne |publisher=F.A. Praeger |date= 1964 |pages=26}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4bs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=newgrange+entrance+slab+famous+megalithic+art&amp;dq=newgrange+entrance+slab+famous+megalithic+art&amp;num=100&amp;ei=FCU0SKHXIpCkzgTjwpjLDw&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists believe that most of the carvings were produced prior to the stones being erected, although the entrance stone was carved in situ before the kerbstones were placed alongside it.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:149).&lt;/ref&gt;

Various archaeologists have speculated as to the meanings of the designs, with some, such as [[George Coffey]] (in the 1890s), believing them to be purely decorative, whilst others, such as [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] (who led the 1962–1975 excavation at the site), believed them to have some sort of [[symbol]]ic purpose, because some of the carvings had been in places that would not have been visible, such as at the bottom of the orthostatic slabs below ground level.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:148).&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive research on how the art relates to alignments and astronomy in the Boyne Valley complex was carried out by American-Irish researcher, Martin Brennan.

==History==
The Neolithic people who built the monument were native agriculturalists, growing crops and raising animals such as cattle in the area where their settlements were located.

===Construction and burials===
The original complex of Newgrange was built between c. 3200 and 3100&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="WHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldheritageireland.ie/bru-na-boinne/built-heritage/newgrange/|title=Newgrange|publisher=Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs| date= |first= |last=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-14 dates]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Grogan, "Prehistoric and Early Historic Cultural Change at Brugh na Bóinne", ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' 91C, 1991, pp. 126–132&lt;/ref&gt; it is approximately five hundred years older than the current form of [[Stonehenge]] and the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in Egypt, as well as predating the [[Mycenaean culture]] of [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:48)&lt;/ref&gt; Some put its period of construction somewhat later, at 3000 to 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Jim|title=The archaeology coursebook|date=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-46286-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BgRG99HriOUC&amp;pg=PA159q=newgrange#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Sam Gorin |author3=Neil Fleming |accessdate=17 August 2011|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geological analysis indicates that the thousands of pebbles that make up the [[cairn]], which together would have weighed about 200,000 tonnes, came from the nearby [[Fluvial terrace|river terraces]] of the Boyne. There is a large pond in this area that is believed to be the site quarried for the pebbles by the builders of Newgrange.&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:117"/&gt; Most of the 547 slabs that make up the inner passage, chambers, and the outer kerbstones are [[greywacke]]. Some or all of them may have been brought from sites approximately 5&amp;nbsp;km away,&lt;ref name="tilley160"&gt;Tilley, Christopher. ''Body and Image: Explorations in Landscape Phenomenology''. Left Coast Press, 2008. p.160&lt;/ref&gt; from the rocky beach at [[Clogherhead]], [[County Louth]], about 20&amp;nbsp;km to the northeast. The facade and entrance were built with white quartz cobblestones from the [[Wicklow Mountains]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km to the south; dark rounded [[granodiorite]] cobbles from the [[Mourne Mountains]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km to the north; dark [[gabbro]] cobbles from the [[Cooley Mountains]]; and banded [[siltstone]] from the shore at [[Carlingford Lough]].&lt;ref name="tilley160"/&gt; The stones may have been transported to Newgrange by sea and up the River Boyne by fastening them to the underside of boats at low tide.&lt;ref name=Benozzo&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the structural slabs were quarried, for they show signs of having been weathered naturally, so they must have been collected and then transported, largely uphill, to the Newgrange site.&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:117"&gt;O'Kelly (1982:117)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[granite]] basins found inside the chambers also came from the Mournes.&lt;ref name="tilley160"/&gt;

[[George Francis Mitchell|Frank Mitchell]] suggested that the monument could have been built within a space of five years, basing his estimation upon the likely number of local inhabitants during the Neolithic and the amount of time they could have devoted to building it rather than farming. This estimate, however, was criticised by Michael. J. O'Kelly and his archaeological team, who believed that it would have taken a minimum of thirty years to build.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:117–118)&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations have revealed deposits of both burnt and unburnt human bone in the passage, indicating human corpses had been placed within it, some of whom had been [[cremation|cremated]]. From examining the unburnt bone, it was shown to come from at least two separate individuals, but much of their skeletons was missing, and what was left had been scattered about the passage.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:105–106)&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[grave goods]] were deposited alongside the bodies inside the passage. Excavations that took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s revealed seven 'marbles', four pendants, two beads, a used flint flake, a bone chisel, and fragments of bone pins and points.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:105)&lt;/ref&gt; Many more artifacts had been found in the passage in previous centuries by visiting antiquarians and tourists, although most of these were removed and went missing or held in private collections. Nonetheless, sometimes these were recorded and it is believed that the grave goods that came from Newgrange were typical of Neolithic Irish passage grave assemblages.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:107)&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of animals also have been found in the structure, primarily those of [[mountain hare]]s, rabbits, and dogs, but also of [[bat]]s, sheep, goats, cattle, [[song thrush]]es, and more rarely, [[mollusc|molluscs]] and frogs. Most of these animals would have entered and died in the chamber many centuries or even millennia after it was constructed: for instance, rabbits were only introduced to Ireland in the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:215–216)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Newgrange (BM).JPG|thumb|right|Gold jewellery from Roman times deposited in the mound (British Museum)]]

During much of the [[Neolithic]] period, the Newgrange area continued to be a focus of some ceremonial activity. In the Late Neolithic, it appears that Newgrange was no longer being used by the local population, who did not leave any artefacts in the structure or bury their dead there. As the archaeologist Michael J. O'Kelly stated, "by 2000 [BC] Newgrange was in decay and squatters were living around its collapsing edge".&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:145"&gt;O'Kelly (1982:145).&lt;/ref&gt; These people were adherents of the [[Beaker culture]], which had been imported from mainland Europe, and made Beaker-style pottery locally.&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:145"/&gt; A large [[timber circle]] (or henge) was built to the southeast of the main mound and a smaller timber circle to the west. The eastern timber circle consisted of five concentric rows of pits. The outer row contained wooden posts. The next row of pits had clay linings and was used to burn animal remains. The three inner rows of pits were dug to accept the animal remains. Within the circle were post and stake holes associated with Beaker pottery and [[flint]] flakes. The western timber circle consisted of two concentric rows of parallel [[posthole]]s and pits defining a circle {{convert|20|m}} in diameter.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} A concentric mound of [[clay]] was constructed around the southern and western sides of the mound that covered a structure consisting of two parallel lines of post and ditches that had been partly burnt. A free-standing circle of large stones was raised around the Newgrange mound. Near the entrance, seventeen [[hearth]]s were used to set fires. These structures at Newgrange are generally contemporary with a number of [[henge]]s known from the [[Boyne Valley]], at Newgrange Site A, Newgrange Site O, [[Dowth]] Henge, and Monknewtown Henge.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The site evidently continued to have some ritual significance into the [[Iron Age]]. Among various objects later deposited around the mound are two pendants made from gold [[Roman Empire|Roman]] coins of 320–337 AD (now in the [[National Museum of Ireland]]) and Roman gold jewellery including two bracelets, two finger rings, and a necklace, now in the collections of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=5016&amp;plaA=5016-3-1|title=British Museum - Collection search: You searched for|work=British Museum|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===

There have been various debates as to its original purpose. Many archaeologists believed that the monument had religious significance of some sort or another, either as a place of worship for a "cult of the dead" or for an astronomically-based faith. The archaeologist [[Michael J. O'Kelly]], who led the 1962–1975 excavations at the site, believed that the monument had to be seen in relation to the nearby [[Knowth]] and [[Dowth]], and that the building of Newgrange "cannot be regarded as other than the expression of some kind of powerful force or motivation, brought to the extremes of aggrandizement in these three monuments, the cathedrals of the megalithic religion."&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:122"&gt;O'Kelly (1982:122)&lt;/ref&gt; O'Kelly believed that Newgrange, alongside the hundreds of other passage tombs built in Ireland during the Neolithic, showed evidence for a religion that venerated the dead as one of its core principles. He believed that this "cult of the dead" was just one particular form of European Neolithic religion, and that other megalithic monuments displayed evidence for different religious beliefs that were solar-oriented, rather than ancestor-oriented.&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:122"/&gt;
[[File:Newgrange at a distance.jpg|thumb|right|View of Newgrange's elevation]]
Studies in other fields of expertise offer alternative interpretations of the possible functions, however, which principally centre on the astronomy, engineering, geometry, and mythology associated with the Boyne monuments. It is speculated that the sun formed an important part of the religious beliefs of the Neolithic people who built it. One idea was that the room was designed for a ritualistic capturing of sun rays on the shortest day of the year, the [[Winter Solstice]], as the room gets flooded with sunlight, which might have signaled that the days would start to get longer again. This view is strengthened by the discovery of alignments in [[Knowth]], [[Dowth]], and the [[Lough Crew]] Cairns leading to the interpretation of these monuments as calendrical or astronomical devices. 

Formerly, the Newgrange mound was encircled by an outer ring of immense standing stones, of which twelve of a possible thirty-seven remain. Evidence from carbon dating suggests that the stone circle which encircled Newgrange may not be contemporary with the monument however, but was placed there some 1,000 years later in the [[Bronze Age]]. This view is disputed and relates to a carbon date from a standing stone setting that intersects with a later timber post circle, the theory being, that the stone in question could have been moved and later, re-set in its original position. This research implies a continuity of use of Newgrange of over a thousand years; with partial remains found from only five individuals, some question the tomb theory for its purpose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Once a year, at the Winter Solstice, the rising sun shines directly along the long passage, illuminating the inner chamber and revealing the carvings inside, notably the [[triple spiral]] on the front wall of the chamber. This illumination lasts for approximately 17 minutes.&lt;ref name="solstice" /&gt; Michael J. O'Kelly was the first person in modern times to observe this event on 21 December 1967.&lt;ref name="firstmodernobservation"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.meath.ie/Tourism/Heritage/Newgrange/| title = Brú na Bóinne (Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth)| accessdate = 12 October 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012040152/http://www.meath.ie/Tourism/Heritage/Newgrange/| archivedate = 12 October 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sunlight enters the passage through a specially contrived opening, known as a [[roofbox]], directly above the main entrance. Although solar alignments are not uncommon among passage graves, Newgrange is one of few to contain the additional roofbox feature. ([[Cairn]] G at [[Carrowkeel Megalithic Cemetery]] is another, and it has been suggested that one can be found at Bryn Celli Ddu.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts (2006) Sensational new discoveries at Bryn Celli Ddu. British Archaeology No. 89 (July/August): 6.&lt;/ref&gt;) The alignment is such that although the roofbox is above the passage entrance, the light hits the floor of the inner chamber. Today the first light enters about four minutes after sunrise, but calculations based on the [[precession]] of the Earth show that 5,000 years ago, first light would have entered exactly at sunrise.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The solar alignment at Newgrange is very precise compared to similar phenomena at other passage graves such as [[Dowth]] or [[Maes Howe]] in the [[Orkney Islands]], off the coast of [[Scotland]].

==Discovery, excavation, and restoration==

===Mythology and folklore during Medieval and Early Modern periods===
During the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], Newgrange and the wider [[Brú na Bóinne]] Neolithic complex gained various attributes in local [[folklore]], which was often connected to figures from wider [[Irish mythology]]. The monuments of the Brú were thought of by some as being the abode of the supernatural [[Tuatha De Danann]], whilst others considered them to be the burial mounds of the ancient kings of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]. Amongst those who believed the folkloric tales relating the Brú to the Tuatha De Danann, it was commonly thought that they were the abode of the most powerful of the Tuatha, particularly [[The Dagda]], his wife [[Boann]], and his son, [[Aengus|Oengus]]. According to the eleventh-century ''[[Book of Lecan]]'', the Dagda had built the Brú for use by his family, whilst the twelfth-century ''[[Book of Leinster]]'' describes how Oengus tricked his father into giving him the Brú for all eternity. Another text, ''The Pursuit of Diarmaid and Grainne'' also implies that Oengus owned the Brú, when he declared how he took his friend [[Diarmaid]] to it.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:43–46)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after 1142 the structure became part of outlying farmland owned by the [[Mellifont Abbey|Cistercian Abbey of Mellifont]]. These farms were referred to as 'granges'. Newgrange is not mentioned in any of the early charters of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but an ''[[wikt:inspeximus|Inspeximus]]'' granted by [[Edward III]] in 1348 includes a ''Nova Grangia'' among the [[demesne]] lands of the abbey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27728922 "An Important Mellifont Document." ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', vol. 14, no. 1, 1957, pp. 1–13. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 1539, following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] by [[Henry VIII]], Mellifont Abbey and its demesnes became the fortified mansion of an English soldier of fortune, Edward Moore, ancestor of the [[Earls of Drogheda]].&lt;ref&gt;Geraldine Stout, ''Newgrange and the Bend of the Boyne'', Cork University Press, Cork (2002), pp. 85, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 1699, Alice Moore, Countess Dowager of Drogheda, leased the demesne of Newgrange to a [[Williamite]] settler, Charles Campbell, for 99 years.&lt;ref&gt;Stout (2002:128)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquarianism during seventeenth and eighteenth centuries===
[[File:Bru na Boinne Squire.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to Newgrange in the late 1800s, when the mound had become largely overgrown]]
In 1699, a local landowner, Charles Campbell, ordered some of his farm labourers to dig up a part of Newgrange, which then had the appearance of a large mound of earth, so that he could collect stone from within it. The labourers soon discovered the entrance to the tomb within the mound, and a Welsh [[antiquarianism|antiquarian]] named [[Edward Lhwyd]], who was staying in the area, was alerted and took an interest in the monument. He wrote an account of the mound and its tomb, describing what he saw as its "barbarous sculpture" and noting that animal bones, beads, and pieces of glass had been found inside of it (modern archaeologists have speculated that these latter two were in fact the polished pottery beads that subsequently have been found at the site and that were a common feature of Neolithic tombs).&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:24)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon another antiquarian visitor, [[Sir Thomas Molyneux, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Molyneaux]], professor at the [[University of Dublin]], also came to the site. He talked to Charles Campbell, who informed him that he had found the remains of two human corpses in the tomb, one (which was male), in one of the cisterns, and another farther along the passageway, something that Lhwyd had not noted.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:27)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Newgrange was visited by a number of antiquarians, who often performed their own measurements of the site and made their own observations, which often were published in various antiquarian journals; these included such figures as [[Sir William Wilde]], Thomas Pownall, [[Thomas Wright (antiquarian)|Thomas Wright]], [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]], [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]], and [[James Frederic Ferguson|James Ferguson]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:33–34)&lt;/ref&gt;

These antiquarians often concocted their own theories about the origins of Newgrange, many of which have since been proved incorrect. [[Thomas Pownall]] conducted a very detailed survey of New Grange in 1769,&lt;ref&gt;Archaeologia Vol 2, 1773. A Description of the Sepulchral Monument of New Grange, near Drogheda, in the County of Meath, in Ireland. By Thomas Pownall, Esq. in a letter to the Rev. Gregory Sharpe, D.D. Master of the Middle Temple. Read at the Society of Antiquaries, June 21/28 1770. Archaeologia Vol 2, pp.236-276 [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101076451119;view=1up;seq=338]&lt;/ref&gt; which numbers all the stones and also records some of the carvings on the stone and asserted that the mound originally had been taller and a lot of the stone on top of it had been removed, a theory that has been disproven by archaeological research.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:33)&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these antiquarians also refused to believe that it was ancient peoples native to Ireland who built the monument, with many believing that it had been built in the early medieval period by invading [[Vikings]], whilst others speculated that it had been built by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, ancient Indians, or the [[Phoenicians]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:35)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern conservation, archaeological investigation, and reconstruction ===
[[File:Newgrange (8294082764).jpg|thumb|The entrance to Newgrange in the early 1900s, after much of the debris had been cleared]]
At some time in the early 1800s, a [[folly]] was built a few yards behind Newgrange. The folly, with two circular windows, was made of stones taken from Newgrange. In 1882, under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act, Newgrange and the nearby monuments of Knowth and Dowth were taken under the control of the state (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, as it was then known), and they were placed under the responsibility of the Board of Public Works. In 1890, under the leadership of [[Thomas Newenham Deane]], the board began a project of conservation of the monument, which had been damaged through general deterioration over the previous three millennia as well as the increasing vandalism caused by visitors, some of whom had inscribed their names on the stones.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:38–39)&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent decades, a number of [[archaeology|archaeologists]] performed excavations at the site, discovering more about its function and how it had been built; however, even at the time, it was still mistakenly believed by archaeologists to be built during the [[Bronze Age]] rather than during the earlier Neolithic period.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:42)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, electric lighting was installed in the passageway to allow visitors to see more clearly,&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:41)&lt;/ref&gt; whilst an exhaustive archaeological excavation was undertaken from 1962 through to 1975, the excavation report of which was written by Michael J. O'Kelly and published in 1982 by [[Thames and Hudson]] as ''Newgrange: Archaeology, Art and Legend''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:09)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the O'Kelly excavation, further restoration and reconstruction took place at the site. Based on the positions of the cobblestones, and after conducting experiments, O'Kelly concluded that they had made up a [[retaining wall]], but had fallen from the face of the mound. As part of the restoration, this wall was 'rebuilt' and the cobblestones were fixed into a near-vertical steel-[[reinforced concrete]] wall surrounding the front of the mound. This work is controversial among the archaeological community. P. R. Griot described the monument as looking like a "cream cheese cake with dried currants distributed about."&lt;ref name="Giot 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giot|first=P.-R.|title=Review: Newgrange: archaeology, art and legend.|journal=Antiquity|year=1983|volume=57|issue=220|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Oliver]] described the reconstruction as "a bit brutal, a bit overdone, kind of like Stalin does the Stone Age".&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Ancient Britain" Series 1 episode 3, "Age of Cosmology", BBC documentary, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the new wall claim that the technology to fix a retaining wall at this angle did not exist when the mound was created.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Another theory is that some, or all, of the white quartz cobblestones had formed a plaza on the ground at the entrance. This theory was preferred at nearby [[Knowth]], where the restorers laid the quartz stones out as an "apron" in front of the entrance to the great mound.

The inward-curving dark stone walls on each side of the entrance are not original, nor are they intended to suggest Newgrange's original appearance, but were designed solely to facilitate visitor access. A visitor guide book to the site, however, has a reconstruction drawing depicting Neolithic inhabitants using Newgrange that shows the modern entrance as if it were part of Newgrange's original appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knowth.com/excavation.htm Alan Marshall, "Newgrange Excavation Report Critique"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and access==

Newgrange is located {{Convert|8.4|km|}} west of [[Drogheda]] in [[County Meath]]. The interpretive centre is located on the south bank of the river and Newgrange is located on the north side of the river. Access is only from the interpretive centre.

Access to Newgrange is by guided tour only. Tours begin at the [[Brú na Bóinne Visitor Centre]] from which visitors are taken to the site in groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritageireland.ie/en/midlands-eastcoast/brunaboinnevisitorcentre/ Heritage Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; Current-day visitors to Newgrange are treated to a guided tour and an re-enactment of the Winter Solstice experience through the use of high-powered electric lights situated within the tomb. The finale of a Newgrange tour results in every visitor standing inside the tomb where the tour guide then turns off the lights, and then turns on ones simulating the sunlight that would appear on the winter solstice.

To experience the phenomenon on the morning of the Winter Solstice from inside Newgrange, visitors to Bru Na Bóinne Visitor Centre must enter an annual lottery at the centre. Of the thousands who enter, twenty are chosen each year. The winner is permitted to bring a single guest. The winners are split into groups of ten and taken in on the five days around the solstice in December when sunlight can enter the chamber, weather permitting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newgrange.com/solstice-lottery.htm "Newgrange Winter Solstice Lottery Draw"]&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Object Process Methodology''' ('''OPM''') is a conceptual [[modeling language]] and [[methodology]] for [[Knowledge capture|capturing knowledge]] and [[Systems design|designing systems]], specified as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[Publicly Available Specification|PAS]] 19450.&lt;ref name="ISO19450"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/62274.html |title=ISO/PAS 19450:2015 - Automation systems and integration -- Object-Process Methodology |website=iso.org |date=December 2015 |accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a minimal universal [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of [[stateful]] [[Object (computer science)|object]]s and [[Process theory|process]]es that transform them, OPM can be used to formally specify the function, structure, and behavior of artificial and natural systems in a large variety of domains.

OPM was conceived and developed by [[Dov Dori]]. The ideas underlying OPM were published for the first time in 1995.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dori|first=Dov|authorlink=Dov Dori|title=Object-Process Analysis: Maintaining the Balance between System Structure and Behavior|journal=[[Journal of Logic and Computation]]|date=1995|volume=5|issue=2|pages=227–249|doi=10.1093/logcom/5.2.227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, OPM has evolved and developed.

In 2002, the first book on OPM&lt;ref name="Object-Process Methodology – A Holistic Systems Paradigm"/&gt; was published, and on December 15, 2015, after six years of work by ISO TC184/SC5, [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] adopted OPM as ISO/PAS 19450.&lt;ref name="ISO19450" /&gt; A second book on OPM was published in 2016.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;

== Overview ==
Object Process Methodology (OPM) is a conceptual modeling language and methodology for capturing knowledge and designing systems. Based on a minimal universal [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of [[stateful]] [[Object (computer science)|object]]s and [[Process theory|process]]es that transform them, OPM can be used to formally specify the function, structure, and behavior of artificial and natural systems in a large variety of domains. Catering to human cognitive abilities, an OPM model represents the system under design or study bimodally in both graphics and text for improved representation, understanding, communication, and learning.

In OPM, an ''object'' is a thing that exists, or might exist, physically or informatically. Objects are [[stateful]]—they may have states, such that at each point in time, the object is at one of its states or in transition between states. A ''process'' is a thing that transforms an object by creating or consuming it, or by changing its state.

OPM is bimodal; it is expressed both visually/graphically in Object-Process Diagrams (OPD) and verbally/textually in Object-Process Language (OPL), a set of automatically-generated sentences in a subset of English. A software package called OPCAT, for generating OPD and OPL, is freely available.&lt;ref name="OPCAT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esml.iem.technion.ac.il/opcat-installation/ |title=Enterprise Systems Modeling Laboratory » OPCAT installation |website=technion.ac.il |accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The shift to the [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] (OO) paradigm for computer [[programming language]]s, which occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, was followed by the idea that programming should be preceded by [[object-oriented analysis and design]] of the programs, and, more generally, the systems those programs represent and serve. Thus, in the early 1990s, over 30 object-oriented analysis and design methods and notations flourished, leading to what was known as the "methods war".&lt;ref&gt;Booch, G. "Time for a ceasefire in the methods war". ''Journal of Object-Oriented Programming'', July/August 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around that time, in 1991, [[Dov Dori]], who then joined [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]] as faculty, realized that just as the procedural approach to software was not necessarily the most adequate one, neither was the "pure" OO approach, which puts objects as the sole "first class" citizens, with "methods" (or "services", or "operations") being their second-class subordinate procedures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} When he and colleagues from [[University of Washington]] were trying to model a system for automated transforming of [[engineering drawing]]s to [[CAD model]]s, he realized that not all the boxes in their model were really objects; some were things that happen to objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dori |first1=Dov |last2=Tombre |first2=Karl |title=From engineering drawings to 3D CAD models: are we ready now? |journal=Computer-Aided Design |date=1995 |volume=27 |pages=243-254 |url=http://dori2.technion.ac.il/opm/documents/articles/article172.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he circled those things, a bipartite graph emerged, in which the nodes representing objects—the things that exist—were mediated by those circled nodes, which were identified as processes—the things that transform the objects. Dori published the first paper on OPM in 1995.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1997, the "methods war" culminated in the adoption of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), by the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG), making it the de facto standard for software design. UML 1.1 was submitted to the OMG in August 1997 and adopted by the OMG in November 1997.

UML 1.X had nine types of diagrams. Following a 2001 initiative of the [[International Council on Systems Engineering]] (INCOSE), in 2003 OMG issued the UML for Systems Engineering Request for Proposals, and in 2006 OMG adopted SysML ([[Systems Modeling Language]]) 1.0 specification, which is based on UML 2. Since then, SysML has become the de facto standard for systems engineering.

The first book on OPM, ''Object-Process Methodology: a Holistic Systems Paradigm'', was published in 2002,&lt;ref name="Object-Process Methodology – A Holistic Systems Paradigm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dori |first=Dov |authorlink=Dov Dori |title=Object-Process Methodology: A Holistic Systems Paradigm |date=2002 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |location=Berlin, Heidelberg, New York |isbn=3540654712 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-56209-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and OPM has since been applied in many domains, ranging from the [[Semantic Web]] to defense and to molecular biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perelman |first1=Valeria |last2=Somekh |first2=Judith |last3=Dori |first3=Dov |title=Model verification framework with application to molecular biology |date=2011 |publisher=Society for Computer Simulation International |pages=140-145 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2048494 |ref=MolecularBiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition that models can and should become the central artifact in system lifecycles has been gaining momentum in recent years, giving rise to [[model-based systems engineering]] (MBSE) as an evolving field in the area of systems engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fischer |first1=Amit |last2=Nolan |first2=Mike |last3=Friedenthal |first3=Sanford |last4=Loeffler |first4=Michael |last5=Sampson |first5=Mark |last6=Bajaj |first6=Manas |last7=VanZandt |first7=Lonnie |last8=Hovey |first8=Krista |last9=Palmer |first9=John |last10=Hart |first10=Laura |title=3.1.1 Model Lifecycle Management for MBSE |journal=INCOSE International Symposium |date=2014 |volume=24 |doi=10.1002/j.2334-5837.2014.tb03145.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SysML and OPM have been serving as the two MBSE languages, but since SysML was adopted as a standard about eight years before OPM and has been backed by top-notch vendors, its adoption is currently more widespread. However, OPM is rapidly gaining acceptance in academia and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beier |first1=Grischa |last2=Figge |first2=Asmus |last3=Marwedel |first3=Stephan |title=A MBSE Approach for the Development of Complex Technical Systems |journal=Internnational Journal of Engineering Research and Applications (IJERA) |date=2017 |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=24-36 |doi=10.9790/9622-0709052436 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321193816_A_MBSE_Approach_for_the_Development_of_Complex_Technical_Systems |ref=industryusage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, after five years of work by ISO TC184/SC5, ISO adopted OPM as ISO/PAS 19450.&lt;ref name="ISO19450" /&gt;

A second book on OPM, which also covers SysML, was published in 2016.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dori |first=Dov |authorlink=Dov Dori |title=Model-Based Systems Engineering with OPM and SysML |date=2016 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |location=New York |isbn=9781493932955 |oclc=959032986 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-3295-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Opm methodology phases.png|alt=Opm methodology phases|thumb|OPM methodology phases]]
Object-Process Methodology (OPM) is a systems modeling paradigm that integrates two aspects inherent in any system: its structure and its behavior. Structure is represented via objects and structural relations among them, such as aggregation-participation (whole-part relation) and generalization-specialization ("is-a" relation). Behavior is represented by processes and how they transform objects: How they create or consume objects, or how they change the states of an object. Indeed, OPM is fundamentally simple; it builds on a minimal set of concepts: stateful objects—things that exist or might exist physically or informatically at some state, and processes—things that happen to objects and transform them by creating or consuming the objects or by changing their states.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

OPM offers a way to model systems of almost any domain, be it artificial or natural. OPM has an [[ontological commitment]] to a universal minimal ontology according to which objects exist, while processes transform them.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;{{rp|x}}&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{cite journal |last1=Herre |first1=Heinrich |last2=Heller |first2=Barbara |last3=Burek |first3=Patryk |last4=Hoehndorf |first4=Robert |last5=Loebe |first5=Frank |last6=Michalek |first6=Hannes |date=July 2006 |title=General formal ontology (GFO): a foundational ontology integrating objects and processes: part I: basic principles |journal=Onto-Med Report |volume=8 |page=3 |url=http://www.onto-med.de/publications/2006/herre-h-2006-a.pdf |quote=Current languages in use for conceptual modeling like the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), [[entity–relationship model]]ing in the database field, or the Object-Process Methodology can be examined according to their ontological commitments.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformation includes object creation and consumption, as well as change of the state of an object. Hence, stateful objects and processes that transform them are the only two concepts in OPM's universal minimal ontology. Two other cornerstones of OPM are its bi-modal graphical-textual representation and its built-in refinement-abstraction [[complexity management]] mechanisms of in-zooming and unfolding of a single type of diagram—Object-Process Diagram (OPD).

===Modeling===
OPM represents the system model simultaneously in two different modalities: Object Process Diagramׂs (OPD) and a corresponding set of sentences in a subset of English, called Object Process Language (OPL). OPL is generated automatically by OPCAT,&lt;ref name="OPCAT"/&gt; a software tool that supports modeling in OPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dori|first1=Dov|last2=Linchevski|first2=Chen|last3=Manor|first3=Raanan|title=OPCAT – A Software Environment for Object-Process Methodology Based Conceptual Modelling of Complex Systems|journal=Proc. 1st International Conference on Modelling and Management of Engineering Processes|date=2010|volume=University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, Heisig, P., Clarkson, J., and Vajna, S. (Eds.)|pages=147–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Object Process Diagram (OPD)
OPD is the one and only kind of diagram of OPM. This uniqueness of diagram kind is a major contributor to OPM's simplicity, and it is in sharp contrast to UML, which has 14 kinds of diagrams, and to SysML, which has nine such kinds.&lt;ref name="SysMLvsOPM"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grobshtein |first1=Yariv |last2=Perelman |first2=Valeriya |last3=Safra |first3=Eliyahu |last4=Dori |first4=Dov |title=Systems Modeling Languages: OPM Versus SysML |date=2007 |publisher=IEEE |location=Haifa, Israel |isbn=1-4244-0770-2 |pages=102-109 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4243724/authors#authors |accessdate=15 November 2018 |ref=SysMLvsOPM}}&lt;/ref&gt; An OPD graphically describes objects, processes and links among them. Links can be structural and procedural. Structural links connect objects to objects or processes to processes, expressing the static system aspect—how the system is structured. Procedural links connect objects to processes, expressing the dynamic system aspect—how the system changes over time. The entire system is represented by a set of hierarchically-organized OPDs, such that the root OPD, called the systems diagram (SD), specifies the "bird's eye" view of the system, and lower-level OPDs specify the system in increasing levels of detail. All the OPDs in the system's OPD set are "aware" of each other, with each showing the system, or part of it, at some level of detail. The entire system is specified in its entirety by the union of the details model facts) appearing in all the OPDs.

; Object Process Language (OPL)
Each OPD construct (i.e., two or more things connected by one or more link) is translated to a sentence in OPL—a subset of natural English. The power of OPL lies in the fact that it is readable by humans but also interpretable by computers. Since each model fact is expressed both graphically and textually, in a subset of natural English, it is readily accessible to non-technical stakeholders, enabling them to take part in the early, critical stages of the system requirements elicitation, architecting and development. These are the stages where the most important design decisions are made. The graphics-text bimodality of OPM makes it suitable to jointly model requirements by a team that involves both the customer or his domain expert on one hand, and the system architect, modelers, and designers on the other hand.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

; OPM model animated simulation
OPM models are not just static graphical and textual representations of the system—they are also executable. A correct OPM model constructed in OPCAT can be simulated by animating it, visually expressing how the system behaves over time to achieve its function at all detail levels. An incorrect OPM model will not execute all the way through, and will indicate where and why it is stuck, effectively serving as a visual debugger.

===Development===
In his forward to Dori's book ''Model-Based Systems Engineering with OPM and SysML'', [[Edward F. Crawley]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;OPM semantics was originally geared towards systems engineering, as it can model information, hardware, people, and regulation. However, in recent years OPM started to serve also researchers in molecular biology, yielding new published findings related to the mRNA lifecycle. This is a clear indication of the universality of the object-and-process ontology.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;{{rp|vi}}&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{cite web |url=http://esml.iem.technion.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Supplement-1.pdf |title=The mRNA Lifecycle |website=technion.ac.il |accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Basics==
[[File:OPMEntities.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM entities: object, object state and process]]
OPM has two main parts: the language and the methodology. The language is bimodal—it is expressed in two complementary ways (modalities): the visual, graphical part—a set of one or more Object-Process Diagrams (OPDs), and a corresponding textual part—a set of sentences in Object-Process Language (OPL), which is a subset of English.

The top-level OPD is the system diagram (SD), which provides the context for the system's function. For man-made systems this function is expected to benefit a person or a group of people—the beneficiary. The function is the main process in SD, which also contains the objects involved in this process: the beneficiary, the operand (the object upon which the process operates), and possibly the attribute whose value the process changes.

OPM graphical elements are divided into entities, expressed as closed shapes, and relations, expressed as links that connect entities.

===Entities===
Entities are the building blocks of OPM. They include objects and processes, collectively called things, and object states.
; Object : An object is a thing, which once constructed, exists or can exist physically or informatically. Associations among objects constitute the object structure of the system being modeled. In OPL text, the object name shall appear in bold face with capitalization of each word.
; Object state : An object state is a particular situation classification of an object at some point during its lifetime. At every point in time, the object is in one of its states or in transition between two of its states—from its input state to its output state.
; Process : A process is an expression of the pattern of transformation of objects in the system. A process does not exist in isolation; it is always associated with and occurs or happens to one or more objects. A process transforms objects by creating them, consuming them, or changing their state. Thus, processes complement objects by providing the dynamic, behavioral aspect of the system. In OPL text, the process name shall appear in bold face with capitalization of each word.

===Links===
[[File:OPM Sructural Links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM structural links]]
[[File:OPM Procedural Links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM procedural links]]
; Structural link : A structural links defines a structural relation. A structural relation shall specify an association that persists in the system for at least some interval of time.
; Procedural link : A procedural link defines procedural relation. A procedural relation shall specify how the system operates to attain its function, designating time dependent or conditional triggering of processes, which transform objects.
; Event and condition : The Event-Condition-Action paradigm provides the OPM operational semantics and flow of control. An event is a point in time at which an object is created (or appears to be created from the system's perspective) or an object enters a specified state. At runtime, this process triggering initiates evaluation of the process precondition. Thus, starting a process execution has two prerequisites: (1)  a triggering event, and (2) satisfaction of a precondition.
Once the event triggers a process, the event ceases to exist. The precondition is the existence of the required object instances in the preprocess object set, possibly in specific states, as modeled. If and only if the evaluation reveals satisfaction of the precondition, the process starts executing.

==Syntax and semantics==

===Things===
An OPM thing is a generalization of object and process. Objects and processes are symmetric in many regards and have much in common in terms of relations, such as aggregation, generalization, and characterization. OPM objects and OPM processes depend on each other in the sense that an object cannot be transformed without a process, while a process cannot happen without transforming at least one object.

To apply OPM in a useful manner, the modeler has to make the essential distinction between objects and processes, as a prerequisite for successful system analysis and design. By default, a noun shall identify an object.

===Thing generic attributes===
OPM things have the following three generic attributes:
# ''Perseverance'', which pertains to the thing's persistence and determines whether the thing is static, i.e., an object, or dynamic, i.e., a process.
# ''Essence'', which pertains to the thing's nature and determines whether the thing is physical or informatical. Accordingly, the values of the generic attribute Essence are physical and informatical.
# ''Affiliation'', which pertains to the thing's scope and determines whether the thing is systemic, i.e., part of the system, or environmental, i.e., part of the system's environment. Accordingly, the values of the generic attribute Affiliation are systemic and environmental. Graphically shading effects shall depict physical OPM things and dashed lines shall depict environmental OPM things.

OPM thing generic attributes have the following default values:
# The default value of the ''Affiliation'' generic attribute of a thing is systemic.
# System essence shall be the primary essence of the system. Like thing essence, its values are informatical and physical. Information systems, in which the majority of things are informatical, shall be primarily informatical, while systems in which the majority of things are physical shall be primarily physical.
# The default value of the ''Essence'' generic attribute of a thing in a primarily informatical [physical] system shall be informatical [physical].

===Object states===
[[File:OPM Things.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM things and object states]]
; Stateful and stateless objects : An object state is a possible situation in which an object may exist. An object state has meaning only in the context of the object to which it belongs. A stateless object shall be an object that has no specification of states. A stateful object shall be an object for which a set of permissible states are specified. In a runtime model, at any point in time, any stateful object instance is at a particular permissible state or in transition between two states.
; Attribute values : An attribute is an object that characterizes a thing. An attribute value is a specialization of state in the sense that a value is a state of an attribute: an object has an attribute, which is a different object, to which that value is assigned for some period of time during the existence of the object exhibiting that attribute.
; Object state representation : A state is graphically defined by a labelled, rounded-corner rectangle placed inside the owning object. It can not live without an object. In OPL text, the state name shall appear in bold face without capitalization.
; Initial, default, and final states : The initial state of an object is its state as the system starts executing or its state upon generation by the system during execution. The final state of an object is its state as the system completes executing or its state upon consumption by the system during execution. The default state of an object is its expected state—the state in which the object is most likely to be when randomly inspected. An object can have zero or more initial states, zero or more final states, and zero or one default state.
; Initial, final, and default state representation : A state that is initial is graphically defined by a state representation with thick contour. A state that is final is graphically defined by a state representation with double contour. A state that is default is graphically defined by a state representation with an open arrow pointing diagonally from the left. The corresponding OPL sentences shall include explicit indicators for an initial, final or default state.

===Links===

====Procedural links====
[[File:OPM Transforming Links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM Transforming Links]]
A procedural link is one of three kinds:
# ''Transforming link'', which connects a transformee (an object that the process transforms) or its state with a process to model object transformation, namely generation, consumption, or state change of that object as a result of the process execution.
# ''Enabling link'', which connects an enabler (an object that enables the process occurrence but is not transformed by that process) or its state, to a process, which enables the occurrence of that process.
# ''Control link'', which is a procedural (transforming or enabling) link with a control modifier—the letter e (for event) or c (for condition), which adds semantics of a control element. The letter e signifies an event for triggering the linked process, while the letter c signifies a condition for execution of the linked process, or connection of two processes denoting invocation, or exception.

; Procedural link uniqueness OPM principle :A process needs to transform at least one object. Hence, a process shall be connected via a transforming link to at least one object or object state. At any particular extent of abstraction, an object or any one of its states shall have exactly one role as a model element with respect to a process to which it links: the object may be a transformee or an enabler. Additionally, it can be a trigger for an event (if it has the control modifier e), or a conditioning object (if it has the control modifier c), or both. According to the procedural link uniqueness OPM principle, at a given extent of abstraction, an object or an object state shall link to a process by only one procedural link.
; State-specified procedural links : Each procedural link may be qualified as state-specified procedural links. A state-specified procedural link is a detailed version of its procedural link counterpart in that rather than connecting a process to an object, it connects a process to a specific state of that object.[[File:OPM Enabling Links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM enabling links]]
; Transforming links : A transforming link specifies a connection between a process and its transformee (the object it creates, consumes, or changes the object state). The three kinds of transforming links are:
# ''Consumption link'': A transforming link specifying that the linked process consumes (destroys, eliminates) the linked object, the consumee. Existence of the consumee is precondition (or part of the precondition) to the activation of the process. Graphically, an arrow with a closed arrowhead pointing from the consumee to the consuming process defines the consumption link. By assumption, the consumed object disappears as soon as the process begins execution. The syntax of a consumption link OPL sentence is: Processing consumes Consumee.
# ''Effect link'': An transforming link specifying that the linked process affects the linked object, which is the affectee, i.e., the process causes some unspecified change in the state of the affectee. Graphically, a bidirectional arrow with two closed arrowheads, one pointing in each direction between the affecting process and the affected object, shall define the effect link. The syntax of an effect link OPL sentence is: Processing affects Affectee.
# ''Result link'': A transforming link specifying that the linked process creates (generates, yields) the linked object, which is the resultee. Graphically, an arrow with a closed arrowhead pointing from the creating process to the resultee shall define a result link. The syntax of a result link OPL sentence is: Processing yields Resultee.

[[File:OPM State-specified transforming links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM state-specified transforming links]]
; Enabling links : An enabling link is a procedural link specifying an enabler for a process—an object that must be present for that process to occur, but the existence and state of that object after the process is complete are the same as just before the process began. The two kinds of enabling links are:
# ''Agent and agent link'': A human or a group of humans capable of intelligent decision-making, who enable a process by interacting with the system to enable or control the process throughout execution. It is an enabling link specifying that the agent object is necessary for the linked process to execute. Graphically, a line with a filled circle ("black lollipop") at the terminal end extending from the agent object to the process it enables defines an agent link. The syntax of an agent link OPL sentence is: Agent handles Processing.
# ''Instrument and instrument link'': An inanimate or otherwise non-decision-making enabler of a process that cannot start or take place without the existence and availability of the instrument. It is an enabling link specifying that the instrument object is necessary for the linked process to execute. Graphically, a line with an open circle ("white lollipop") at the terminal end extending from the instrument object to the process it enables defines an instrument link. The syntax of an instrument link OPL sentence is: Processing requires Instrument.

; State-specified transforming links : A state-specified transforming link connects one of the transformee states to or from that process.
# ''State-specified consumption link'': A consumption link that originates from a particular state of the consumee, meaning that the consumee must be in that state for it to be consumed by the process to which it is linked. Graphically, an arrow with a closed arrowhead pointing from the particular object state to the process, which consumes the object, defines the state-specified consumption link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Process consumes qualified-state Object.
# ''State-specified result link'': A result link that terminates at a specific state of the resultee, meaning that the resultee shall be in that resultant state upon its construction. Graphically, an arrow with a closed arrowhead pointing from the process to the particular object state defines the state-specified result link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Process yields qualified-state Object.
# ''State-specified effect links'':
#* Input and output effect links- An input link is the link from the object's input state to the transforming process, while the output link is the link from the transforming process to the object's output state.
#* Input-output-specified effect link: A pair of effect links, where the input link originates from a particular state of the affectee and the output link originates from that process and terminates at the output state of the same affectee. Graphically, a pair of arrows with a closed arrowhead from the input state of the affectee to the affecting process and a similar arrow from that process to the state of the affectee at process terminates defines the input-output-specified effect link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Process changes Object from input-state to output-state.
#* Input-specified effect link: A pair of effect links, where the input link originates from a particular state of the affectee and the output link originates from that process and terminates at the affectee without specifying a particular state. Graphically, a pair of arrows consisting of an arrow with a closed arrowhead from a particular state—the input state—of the affectee to the process, and a similar arrow from that process to the affectee but not to any one of its states defines the input-specified effect link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Process changes Object from input-state.
#* Output-specified effect link: A pair of effect links, where the input (source) link originates from an affectee, and the output link originates from the process and terminates at the output (destination, resultant) state of the same affectee. Graphically, a pair of arrows consisting of an arrow with a closed arrowhead from the affectee, but not from any one of its states, to the affecting process, and a similar arrow from that process to a particular state of that affectee— the output state— defines the output-specified effect link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Process changes Object to output-state.

[[File:OPM Basic transforming event links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM basic transforming event links]]
; State-specified enabling links : Originate from a specific qualifying state and terminate at a process, meaning that the process may occur if and only if the object exists at the state from which the link originates.
# ''State-specified agent link'': An agent link that originates from a specific qualifying state of the agent. Graphically, a line with a filled circle ("black lollipop") at the terminal end extending from the qualifying state of the agent object to the process it enables defines a state-specified agent link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Qualifying-state Agent handles Processing.
# ''State-specified instrument link'': An instrument link that originates from a specific qualifying state of the instrument. Graphically, a line with an empty circle ("white lollipop") at the terminal end extending from the qualifying state of the instrument object to the process it enables defines a state-specified instrument link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Processing requires qualifying-state instrument.

====Event-Condition-Action control====

; Preprocess object set and process precondition : In order for an OPM process to start executing once it has been triggered, it needs a set of objects comprising one or more consumes, some possibly at specific states, and/or affects, collectively called the preprocess object set. The pre-process object set determines the precondition that must be satisfied before execution of that process starts and as a condition for that process to start executing. At instance-level execution, each consume B in the pre-process object set of process P shall be consumed and stop to exist at the beginning of the lowest level sub-process of P which consumes B. Each affected (an object whose state changes) B in the preprocess object set of process P shall exit from its input state at the beginning of the lowest level sub-process of P.
[[File:OPM Basic Enabling event links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM basic enabling event links]]
; Post-process object set and process post-condition : A set of objects, comprising one or more results, some possibly at given states, and/or affects, collectively called the post-process object set, shall result from executing a process and carrying out the transformations associated with its execution. The post-process object set shall determine the post-condition, which shall be satisfied after execution of that process ends. Each resulted B in the post process object set of process P shall be created and start to exist at the end of the lowest level sub process of P which yields B. Each affected B in the post-process object set of process P shall enter its output state at the end of the lowest level sub-process of P.

====Control links====
An event link and a condition link express an event and a condition, respectively. Control links occur either between an object and a process or between two processes.

; Event links : An event link specifies a source event and a destination process to activate on event occurrence. Triggering a process initiates an attempt to execute the process, but it does not guarantee success of this attempt. The triggering event forces an evaluation of the process' precondition for satisfaction, which, if and only if satisfied, allows process execution to proceed and the process becomes active. Regardless of whether the precondition is satisfied or not, the event will be lost. If the precondition is not satisfied, process execution will not occur until another event activates the process and a successful precondition evaluation allows the process to execute.

[[File:OPM Invocation links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM invocation links]]
; Invocation links : An invocation link connects a source process to the destination process that it initiates.
# ''Process invocation'': Process invocation is an event of triggering of a process by a process.

# ''Implicit invocation link'': Implicit invocation occurs upon sub-process termination within the context of an in-zoomed process, at which time the sub-process invokes the one(s) immediately below it. Graphically, there is no link between the invoking and the invoked sub-processes; their relative heights within the in-zoom context of their ancestor process implies this semantics.

; Condition links : A condition link is a procedural link between a source object or object state and a destination process that provides a bypass mechanism, which enables system control to skip the destination process if its precondition satisfaction evaluation fails, otherwise the process waits for the precondition to become true.
# ''Condition consumption link'': A condition consumption link is a condition link from an object to a process, meaning that if in run-time an object instance exists, then the process precondition is satisfied, the process executes and consumes the object instance.

====Structural links====
Structural links specify static, time-independent, long-lasting relations in the system. A structural link connects two or more objects or two or more processes, but not an object and a process, except in the case of an exhibition-characterization link.

; Unidirectional tagged structural link : Has a user-defined semantics regarding the nature of the relation from one thing to the other. Graphically, an arrow with an open arrowhead. Along the tagged structural link, the modeler should record a meaningful tag in the form of a textual phrase that expresses the nature of the structural relation between the connected objects (or processes) and makes sense when placed in the OPL sentence whose syntax follows.
; Unidirectional null-tagged structural link : An unidirectional tagged structural link with no tag. In this case, the default unidirectional tag is used. The modeler has the option of setting the default unidirectional tag for a specific system or a set of systems. If no default is defined, the default tag is "relates to".
; Bidirectional tagged structural link : When the tags in both directions are meaningful and not just the inverse of each other, they may be recorded by two tags on either side of a single bidirectional tagged structural link. Each tag shall align on the side of the arrow with the harpoon edge sticking out of the arrowhead unambiguously determining the direction in which each relation applies. The syntax of the resulting tagged structural link is two separate tagged structural link OPL sentences, one for each direction. Graphically, a line with harpoon shaped arrowheads on opposite sides at both ends of the link's line shall.
; Reciprocal tagged structural link : A reciprocal tagged structural link is a bidirectional tagged structural link with no more than one tag. In either case, reciprocity indicate that the tag of a bidirectional structural link has the same semantics for its forward and backward directions. When no tag appears, the default tag shall be "are related". The syntax of the reciprocal tagged structural link with only one tag shall be: Source-thing and destination thing are reciprocity-tag. The syntax of the reciprocal tagged structural link with no tag is: Source thing and Destination-thing are related.
; Fundamental structural relations : The most prevalent structural relations among OPM things and are of particular significance for specifying and understanding systems. Each of the fundamental relations is elaborate or refine one OPM thing, the source thing, or refinee, into a collection of one or more OPM things, the destination thing or things, or refineables. The fundamental structural relations are; Aggregation, Exhibition-characterization, Generalization-specialization, and Classification-instantiation.
; Aggregation-participation link : A refinee—the whole—aggregates one or more other refineables—the parts. Graphically, a black solid (filled in) triangle with its apex connecting by a line to the whole and the parts connecting by lines to the opposite horizontal base shall denote the aggregation-participation relation link.
; Exhibition-characterization link : A thing exhibits, or is characterized by, another thing. The exhibition-characterization relation binds a refinee—the exhibitor—with one or more refineables, which shall identify features that characterize the exhibitor Graphically, a smaller black triangle inside a larger empty triangle with that larger triangle's apex connecting by a line to the exhibitor and the features connecting to the opposite (horizontal) base defines the exhibition-characterization relation link.
; Generalization-specialization and inheritance : These are structural relations which provide for abstracting any number of objects or process classes into superclasses, and assigning attributes of superclasses to subordinate classes.
# ''Generalization-specialization link'': The refinee—the general—generalizes the refineables, which are specializations of the general. Binds one or more specializations with the same persistence attribute value as the general, such that either the general and all its specializations are objects or the general and all its specializations are processes. Graphically, an empty triangle with its apex connecting by a line to the general and the specializations connecting by lines to the opposite base defines the generalization-specialization link.
# ''Inheritance through specialization'': Inheritance is assignment of OPM elements of a general to its specializations. A specialization inherits from the general thing through the generalization-specialization link the following four kinds of inheritable elements, if there are any: 1. all the general's parts from its aggregation-participation link; 2. all the general's features from its exhibition-characterization link; 3. all the tagged structural links to which the general connects; and 4. all the procedural links to which the general connects. [[File:OPM Condition state-specified enabling link.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM condition state-specified enabling link]]
# ''Specialization restriction through discriminating attribute'': A subset of the possible values of an inherited attribute may restrict the specialization. An attribute whose different values determine corresponding specializations is a discriminating attribute. [[File:OPM Fundamental structural relations and link.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM fundamental structural relations and links]]
; Classification-instantiation and system execution : The relation between a class of things and an instance of that class in the system at the operational level.
# ''Classification-instantiation link'': A source thing, which is an object class or a process class connect to one or more destination things, which are valued instances of the source thing's pattern, i.e. the features specified by the pattern acquire explicit values. This relation provides the modeler with an explicit mechanism for expressing the relationship between a class and its instances created by the provision of feature values. Graphically, a small black circle inside an otherwise empty larger triangle with apex connecting by a line to the class thing and the instance things connecting by lines to the opposite base defines the classification-instantiation relation link. The syntax is: Instance-thing is an instance of Class-thing.
# ''Instances of object class and process class'': These are two distinct kinds of classes. An instance of a class is an incarnation of a particular identifiable instance of that class, an actual object of some class of objects bearing the same classification identifier. A single actual object is an object instance, while the pattern of object, which all the instances follow, is an object class. A process class is a pattern of happening, which involves object classes that are members of the preprocess and postprocess object sets. A single actual process occurrence, which follows this pattern and involves particular object instances in its preporcess and postprocess object sets, is a process instance. Hence, a process instance is a particular occurrence of a process class to which that instance belongs. Any process instance have associated with it a distinct set of preporcess and postprocess object instance sets.
; State-specified structural relations and links : These provide for associating a state of one object with another object or with a state of another object. [[File:OPM State-specified structural relations and links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM state-specified structural relations and links]]
# ''State-specified characterization relation and link'': An exhibition-characterization relation from a specialized object that exhibits a value for a discriminating attribute of that object, meaning that the specialized object shall have only that value. Graphically, the exhibition-characterization link triangular symbol, with its apex connecting to the specialized object and its opposite base connecting to the value, defines the state-specified characterization relation. The syntax is: Specialized-object exhibits value-name Attribute-Name.
# ''State-specified tagged structural relations and links'': A structural relation between a state of an object or value of an attribute and another object or its state or value, meaning that these two entities are associated with the tag expressing the semantics of the association. In case of a null tag (i.e., the tag is not specified), the corresponding default null tag is used. Three groups of state-specified tagged structural relations exist: (1) source state-specified tagged structural relation, (2) destination state-specified tagged structural relation, (3) source-and-destination state-specified tagged structural relation. Each of these groups includes the appropriate unidirectional, bidirectional, and reciprocal tagged structural relation, giving rise to seven kinds of state-specified tagged structural relation link and corresponding OPL sentences.

===Relationship cardinalities===
[[File:Link cardinalities summary.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Link cardinalities summary]][[File:Object multiplicity in structural and procedural links.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Object multiplicity in structural and procedural links]]

; Object multiplicity in structural and procedural links
Object multiplicity shall refer to a requirement or constraint specification on the quantity or count of object instances associated with a link. Unless a multiplicity specification is present, each end of a link shall specify only one thing instance. The syntax of an OPL sentence that includes an object with multiplicity shall include the object multiplicity preceding the object name, with the object name appearing in its plural form. Multiplicity specifications may appear in the following cases:
# to specify multiple source or destination object instances for a tagged structural link of any kind;
# to specify a participant object with multiple instances in an aggregation-participation link, where a different participation specification may be attached to each one of the parts of the whole;
# to specify an object with multiple instances in a procedural relation.

; Object multiplicity expressions and constraints
Object multiplicity may include arithmetic expressions, which shall use the operator symbols "+", "–", "*", "/", "(", and ")" with their usual semantics and shall use the usual textual correspondence in the corresponding OPL sentences.

An integer or an arithmetic expression may constrain object multiplicity. Graphically, expression constraints shall appear after a semicolon separating them from the expression that they constrain and shall use the equality/inequality symbols "=", "&lt;", "&gt;", "&lt;=", and "&gt;=", the curly braces "{" and "}" for enclosing set members, and the membership operator "in" (element of, ∈), all with their usual semantics. The corresponding OPL sentence shall place the constraint phrase in bold letters after the object to which the constraint applies in the form ", where constraint".

; Attribute value and multiplicity constraints
The expression of object multiplicity for structural and procedural links specifies integer values or parameter symbols that resolve to integer values. In contrast, the values associated with attributes of objects or processes may be integer or real values, or parameter symbols that resolve to integer or real values, as well as character strings and enumerated values. Graphically, a labelled, rounded-corner rectangle placed inside the attribute to which it belongs shall denote an attribute value with the value or value range (integers, real numbers, or string characters) corresponding to the label name. In OPL text, the attribute value shall appear in bold face without capitalization.

The syntax for an object with an attribute value OPL sentence shall be: ''Attribute'' of ''Object'' is ''value''.

The syntax for an object with an attribute value range OPL sentence shall be: ''Attribute'' of ''Object'' range is ''value-range''. A structural or a procedural link connecting with an attribute that has a real number value may specify a relationship constraint, which is distinct from an object multiplicity.

Graphically, an attribute value constraint is an annotation by a number, integer or real, or a symbol parameter, near the attribute end of the link and aligning with the link.

===Logical operators: AND, XOR, and OR===
[[File:Logical AND procedural links.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Logical AND procedural links]]

; Logical AND procedural links
The logical operators AND, XOR, and OR among procedural relations enable specification of elaborate process precondition and postcondition. Separate, non-touching links shall have the semantics of logical AND.
In the example, opening the safe requires all three keys. [[File:Summary of XOR and OR converging consumption and result links.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|XOR and OR converging consumption and result links]]

; Logical XOR and OR procedural links
A group of two or more procedural links of the same kind that originate from, or arrive at, the same object or process shall be a link fan. A link fan shall follow the semantics of either a XOR or an OR operator. The link fan end that is common to the links shall be the convergent link end. The link end that is not common to the links shall be the divergent link end.

The XOR operator shall mean that exactly one of the things in the span of the link fan exists, if the divergent link end has objects, or happens, if the divergent link end has processes. Graphically, a dashed arc across the links in the link fan with the arc focal point at the convergent end point of contact shall denote the XOR operator.

The OR operator shall mean that at least one of the two or more things in the span of the link fan exists, if the divergent link end has objects, or happens, if the divergent end has processes. Graphically, two concentric dashed arcs across the links with their focal point at the convergent end point of contact shall denote the OR operator.

; State-specified XOR and OR link fans
Each one of the link fans in shall have a corresponding state-specified version, where the source and destination may be specific object states or objects without a state specification. Combinations of state-specified and stateless links as destinations of a link fan may occur.
[[File:Control-modified link fans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Control-modified link fans]]
; Control-modified link fans : Each one of the XOR link fans for consumption, result, effect, and enabling links and their state-specified versions shall have a corresponding control-modified link fan: an event link fan and a condition link fan. The example presents the event and condition effect link fans, as representatives of the basic (non-state-specified) links version of the modified link fans.
[[File:Link probabilities and probabilistic link fans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Link probabilities and probabilistic link fans]]
; Link probabilities and probabilistic link fans : A process P with a result link that yields a stateful object B with n states s1 through sn shall mean that the probability of generating B at each one of its states shall be 1/n. The single result link shall be used instead of the result link fan. Usually, probabilities of following a specific link in a link fan are not equal. Link probability shall be a value assigned to a link in a XOR diverging link fan that specifies the probability of following that particular link among the possible links in the fan link. A probabilistic link fan shall be a link fan with probability annotations on each fan link, where the sum of the probabilities shall be exactly 1. Graphically, along each fan link an annotation shall appear in the form Pr=p, where p is the link probability numeric value or a parameter, which denotes the probability of the system control to select and follow that particular link of the fan. The corresponding OPL sentence shall be the XOR diverging link fan sentence without link probabilities omitting the phrase "exactly one of…" and the phrase "…with probability p" following each things name with a probability annotation "Pr=p".
[[File:Execution path and path labels.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Execution path and path labels]]
; Execution path and path labels : A path label shall be a label along a procedural link, which, in the case that there is more than one option to follow upon process termination, prescribes that the link to follow will be the one having the same label as the one which we entered the process, A path label is a label on a procedural link that removes the ambiguity arising from multiple outgoing procedural links by specifying that the link to be followed is the one with the same label as the one with which the process was entered.

==Modeling principles and model comprehension==
System function and modeling purpose is to guide the scope and level of detail of an OPM model. The definition of system purpose, scope, and function in terms of boundary, stakeholders and preconditions is the basis for determining whether other elements should appear in the model. This determines the scope of the system model.
OPM provides abstracting and refining mechanisms to manage the expression of model clarity and completeness. The model has a hierarchy tree for refinement, elaboration, or decomposition obtained by unfolding.&lt;ref name="ISO19450"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;

; Stakeholder and system's beneficiary identification
In order to start an OPM model of a system, the first step is to determine the function of the system—the main process of the system. A beneficiary of the artificial, man-made system is a stakeholder who receives functional value and benefits from the function of the system. For man-made systems this function is expected to benefit a person or a group of people—the beneficiary. After the function of the system aligns with the functional value expectation of its main beneficiary, the modeler identifies and adds other principal stakeholders to the OPM model. Modeling a system starts by defining, naming, and depicting the function of the system, which is also its top-level process.

; System diagram
The resulting top-level OPD is the system diagram (SD), which includes the stakeholder group, in particular the beneficiary group, and additional top-level environmental things, which provide the context for the system's operation. The SD should contain only the central and important things—those things indispensable for understanding the function and context of the system. The function is the main process in SD, which also contains the objects involved in this process: the beneficiary, the operand (the object upon which the process operates), and possibly the attribute of the operand whose value the process changes. An OPM model fact needs to appear in at least one OPD in order for it to be represented in the model. SD should also contain an object representing the system that enables the function. The default name of this system is created by adding the word "System" to the name of the function. For example, if the function is Car Painting, the name of the system would be Car Painting System.

; OPD tree
[[File:OPD process tree.png|thumb|An OPD process tree with two nodes and one labelled edge]]
SD is always the only top-level OPD—it is the root of the OPD tree. The set of OPDs, organized as a process tree, which together specify the system. The OPD set keeps growing as additional OPDs are gradually constructed to increasingly refine the model and make it more concrete. The ability to add a descendant, subordinate OPD whenever the one currently under work reaches its congestion limits makes it possible to avoid over-cluttering any single OPD.

; Clarity and completeness trade-off
Clarity is the extent of unambiguous comprehension the system's structure and behavior models convey. Completeness is the extent of specification for all the system's details.  These two model attributes conflict with each other. On the one hand, completeness requires the full stipulation of system details. On the other hand, the need for clarity imposes an upper limit on the extent of detail within an individual model diagram, after which comprehension deteriorates because of clutter and overloading.  Establishing an appropriate balance requires careful management of context during model development. However, the modeler may take advantage of the union of information provided by the entire OPD set of an OPM system model and have one OPD which is clear and unambiguous but not complete, and another that focuses on completeness for some smaller part of the system by adding more details.

; Refinement-abstraction mechanisms
OPM shall provide abstracting and refining mechanisms to manage the expression of model clarity and completeness. These mechanisms make possible the specification of contextualized model segments as separate, yet interconnected OPDs which, taken together, shall provide a model of the functional value providing system. These mechanisms shall enable presenting and viewing the system, and the things that comprise it, in various contexts that are interrelated by the objects, processes and relations that are common amongst them. Explicitly depicting the states of an object in an OPD may result in a diagram that is too crowded or busy, making it hard to read or comprehend. The OPM refinement-abstraction mechanisms shall be the following pairs of inverse operations: State expression and suppression, unfolding and folding, and in-zooming and outzooming.

; State expression and state suppression
[[File:State OPM.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A stateful object with all its five states expressed (left) and a suppressed version (right), in which only the relevant subset of states are left while the rest are replaced by the ellipsis (…) state]]
OPM shall provide an option for state suppression, i.e., suppressing the appearance of some or all the states
within an object as represented in a particular OPD when those states are not necessary in that OPD's context.
The inverse of state suppression shall be state expression, i.e., refining the OPD by adding the information
concerning possible object states. The OPL corresponding to the OPD shall express only the states of the
objects that are depicted.

; Unfolding and folding
Unfolding is a mechanism for refinement, elaboration, or decomposition. It reveals a set of things that are hierarchically below the unfolded thing. The result is a hierarchy tree, the root of which is the unfolded thing. Linked to the root are the things that constitute the context of the unfolded thing. Conversely, folding is a mechanism for abstraction or composition, which applies to an unfolded hierarchical tree.

; In-zooming and out-zooming
In-zooming is a kind of unfolding, which is applicable to aggregation-participation only and has additional semantics. For processes, in-zooming enables modeling the sub-processes, their temporal order, their interactions with objects, and passing of control to and from this context. For objects, in-zooming creates a distinct context that enables modeling the constituent objects spatial or logical order. Graphically, the timeline within the context of an in-zoomed process flows from the top of its process ellipse symbol to the ellipse bottom.

==Meta modeling==
[[File:OPM Model.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM model structure]]
A metamodel is a model of a model. In particular, using OPM model to present aspects of OPM. The examples described here are a part of the comprehensive metamodels of OPM appear in an annex of ISO 19450.

; OPM model structure
[[File:OPM Model 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM model structure—OPL]]
OPM model is a metamodel, as shown in the image of OPM model on the right. Using OPM to specify the structure of an OPM model of a system. It depicts the conceptual aspects of OPM as parallel hierarchies of the graphic and textual OPM modalities and their correspondence to produce equivalent model expressions. An OPD Construct is the graphical expression of the corresponding textual OPL Sentence, which express the same model fact. An OPD and its corresponding OPL Paragraph are collections of model facts that a modeller places into the same model context.

; Model of OPD Construct and Basic Construct
[[File:OPD Metamodel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|OPD model]]
The model, as seen in the image of OPD metamodel, elaborates the OPD Construct concept. The purpose of this model is to distinguish Basic Construct from another possible OPD Construct. A Basic Construct is a specialization of OPD Construct, which consists of exactly two Things connected by exactly one Link. The non-basic constructs include, among others, those with link fans or more than two refinees.

A modeller could add a process to the model, by adding states disconnected and connected of Thing Set.
The purpose of the model thus includes the action of transforming a disconnected Thing Set to a connected Thing Set using the Link Set as an instrument of connection.

; OPM model of Thing
[[File:OPM model of Thing.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM model of Thing]]
OPM model of Thing, is a model for an OPM Thing, showing its specialization into Object and Process, as depicted in the image of model of thing below. A set of States characterize Object, which can be empty, in a Stateless Object, or non-empty in the case of a Stateful Object.

A Stateful Object with s States gives rise to a set of s stateless State-Specific Objects, one for each State.
A particular State-Specific Object refers to an object in a specific state. Modelling the concept of State-Specific Object as both an Object and a State enables simplifying the conceptual model by referring to an object and any one or its states by simply specifying Object.

; OPM model of Thing generic properties
[[File:OPM model of Thing generic properties.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM model of Thing generic properties]]
OPM model of Thing generic properties, depicts Thing and its Perseverance, Essence, and Affiliation generic properties modelled as attribute refinees of an exhibition-characterization link. Perseverance is the discriminating attribute between Object and Process. Essence is the discriminating attribute between Physical Object and Physical Process on the one hand, Informatical Object, and Informatical Process on the other hand. Affiliation is the discriminating attribute between Systemic Object and Systemic Process on the one hand, Environmental Object, and Environmental Process on the other hand.

; In-zooming and out-zooming models
[[File:Zoom OPM.png|thumb|upright=1.5|New-diagram in-zooming generic example]]
Both new-diagram in-zooming and new-diagram out-zooming create a new OPD context from an existing OPD context. New-diagram in-zooming starts with an OPD of relatively less details and adds elaboration or refinement as a descendant OPD that applies to a specific thing in the less detailed OPD.

New-diagram out-zooming starts with an OPD of relatively more details and removes elaboration or refinement to produce a less detailed, more abstract thing in an ancestor context.

New-diagram in-zooming elaborates a refineable present in an existing OPD, say SDn, by creating a new OPD, SDn+1, which elaborates the refineable by adding subprocesses associated objects, and relevant links. The new-diagram in-zooming and in new-diagram out-zooming processes are inverse operations.

New-diagram in-zooming and new-diagram out-zooming models depict the new-diagram in-zooming and new-diagram out-zooming processes. The model on the right uses in-diagram in-zooming of the model on the left to elaborate the two processes, one for creating a new-diagram in-zoomed context and one for creating a new-diagram out-zoomed context.

New-diagram in-zooming begins with Content Showing, followed by Link Refining. New-diagram out-zooming begins with Link Abstracting, the inverse process of Link Refining, followed by Content Hiding, the inverse process of Content Showing.

==Standardization==
[[ISO]]—the International Organization for Standardization—is an independent, non-governmental international organization with a membership of 162 national standards bodies, which develops voluntary, consensus-based, market relevant International Standards that support innovation and provide solutions to global challenges. These standards provide world-class specifications for products, services and systems, to ensure quality, safety and efficiency.

===ISO and OPM===
In June 2008, Richard Martin approached [[Dov Dori]] after his presentation at the [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]] International Symposium in Utrecht, the Netherlands, to inquire about the possibility of creating an International Standard for OPM.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Martin, convener of ISO TC184/SC5/WG1 for automation systems interoperability architecture and modelling, had for some time been searching for methodologies offering more than static information and process modeling.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} He provided Dori with a simple example to model that could demonstrate both the modelling capability of OPM and its dynamic simulation opportunity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In May 2010, Dori presented a brief overview of OPM and his demonstration model at the ISO Technical Committee 184/Sub-Committee 5 (TC184/SC5) plenary meeting, which then adopted a resolution to create and OPM Study Group for the purpose of examining the potential for OPM to enhance the standards created by SC5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dori |first1=Dov |last2=Howes |first2=David |last3=Blekhman |first3=Alex |last4=Martin |first4=Richard |title=OPM as a Basis for Model - Based Enterprise Standards, Report of the ISO TC184/SC5 OPM Working Group to the Plenary ISO TC184/SC5Meeting, Tokyo 26, 2010 |url=http://esml.iem.technion.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/OPM_WG_Report_to_TC184-SC5_Tokyo_March_26_2010.pdf |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OPM Study Group began its work in October 2010 and issued an interim report for the 2011 SC5 Plenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blekhman |first1=Alex |last2=Dori |first2=Dov |last3=Martin |first3=Richard |title=Model-Based Standards Authoring |url=http://esml.iem.technion.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Model-Based-Standards-Authoring-March-2011.pdf |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report included several uses of OPM to model existing SC5 standards and led to an initial motivation for the standardization of OPM with the realization that being text-based, ISO standards are prone to suffer from inconsistencies and incomplete information. This deficiency could be significantly reduced if the standards were model-based rather than text-based, and OPM offered a useful underlying modeling paradigm for this purpose.

A final OPM Study Group Report and a draft for a metamodel for model-based standards authoring document were delivered at the 2012 SC5 Plenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=SC 5 PLENARY MEETING |title=Meeting Report |url=http://esml.iem.technion.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ISO-TC184-SC5_N1185_2012_SC5_Plenary_Meeting_Report_-_Haifa_.pdf |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the OPM Study Group effort progressed, it became obvious that OPM could also serve as a solid and comprehensive basis for model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and for modeling both natural and man-made systems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===ISO 19450 Document===
TC184/SC5/WG1 participants received the first draft of the OPM PAS in September 2011 with 16 pages, 2 annexes and a bibliography for a total of 25 pages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Most of the content simply identified sub-clause headings and space holder graphics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} By the 2012 SC5 Plenary, the PAS draft included 10 full clauses describing OPM features and 6 annexes totaling 86 pages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} One annex was an EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form, used to formally specify context free languages, enabling parsing of programming languages) specification for OPL and another detailed OPD graph grammar. To facilitate verification of the EBNF specification, David Shorter wrote a script to evaluate consistency and completeness of the EBNF statement set.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Further effort to add meaningful examples and complete all of the identified sections resulted in a draft of 138 pages by the time of the 2013 SC5 Plenary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Subsequently, the working draft was registered with the SC5 Secretariat as a Committee Draft for initial circulation to SC5 members.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Because the SC5 resolution calling for the OPM specification indicated that the document was to be registered as a [[Publicly Available Specification]] (PAS), it would have only one acceptance ballot opportunity. In April 2014, the New Work Item Proposal and revised Committee Draft for ISO/PAS 19450 was delivered to SC5 for consideration.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} By now the Committee Draft was 98 pages plus front matter, four annexes and 30 bibliographic references, totaling 183 pages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} In March 2015, ISO registered the result of balloting for ISO/PAS 19450 as 8 Approve, 1 Approve with comments, and 1 abstain.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

ISO/PAS 19450 was formally published with a total of 162 pages by ISO on December 15, 2015, culminating a six-year effort to provide the standardization community with a formal specification for a new approach to modeling that binds together graphics and textual representations into a single paradigm suitable for automated simulation of model behavior.

== OPM vs. SysML and UML ==
; OPM vs. SysML
[[File:OPMvsSYSML.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Comparison between SysML and OPM attributes]]
OPM and [[SysML]] represent two different approaches to system modeling. SysML is defined as an extension of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) using [[profile (UML)|UML's profile mechanism]]. In SysML up to nine multiple models are used, which are independently derived, and may not be completely consistent.&lt;ref name="Object-Process Methodology – A Holistic Systems Paradigm"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}} In OPM, only one single model emerges. The need to integrate several kinds of models may be more complicated in OPM. In OPM there is a combination between complex—the inherent fact that a system contains many parts interacting in multiple, often inexplicable ways, and complexity—the way a system model is presented through a certain modeling language and is perceived by a user. OPM with its minimal ontology of stateful objects and processes favorably responds to the challenge of reducing the complexity of the representation to the bare necessities without sacrificing accuracy and details.&lt;ref name="SysMLvsOPM"/&gt;

; OPM vs. UML
The differences between OPM and UML are highly perceivable during the analysis and design stages. While UML is a multi-model, OPM supports a single unifying structure-behavior model. The crucial differences stem from the structure-oriented approach of UML, in which behavior is spread over thirteen diagram types, a fact that inevitably invokes the model multiplicity problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peleg | first1 = M. | last2 = Dori | first2 = D. | year = 2000 | title = The Model Multiplicity Problem: Experimenting with Real-Time Specification Methods | url = | journal = IEEE Tran. on Software Engineering | volume = 26 | issue = 8| pages = 742–759 | doi=10.1109/32.879812}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, using the OPM approach enables to view at main diagram (SD) the main process, objects and the connection between them.&lt;ref name="Object-Process Methodology – A Holistic Systems Paradigm"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}} In addition, it easy to understand what is the main system's benefit (presented at the SD). In OPM, it's also easier to understand the main three aspects of the system: behavior, structure and functionality (contrary to UML which describes these aspects with different types of diagrams).&lt;ref name="Object-Process Methodology – A Holistic Systems Paradigm"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}} Database unfolding modeling contributes to the understanding of system and all details which is stored in the system. In addition, creating in-zooming enables simplifying the model. OPM requires extensive knowledge of systematic processes such as how the system saved the path and gets decisions.

==Generating SysML views from an OPM model==
While both languages aim at the same purpose of providing a means for general-purpose systems engineering, these languages take different approaches in realizing this goal. SysML is a profile of UML (Unified Modeling Language). Therefore, it is possible to convert an OPM diagram to an UML or SysML diagram.

The OPM-to SysML translation is one-to-many in the sense that a single OPM element (entity or link) usually translates to several SysML elements that belong in different SysML diagram types. For example, an OPM process, which is defined as an entity that transforms (generates, consumes, or changes the state of) an object, can be mapped to any subset of the following SysML entities:

* Use case (in a Use Case Diagram)
* Action (in an Activity Diagram)
* State transition trigger (in a State Machine Diagram).

As OPM and SysML are two distinct and differently designed languages, not all the constructs in one language have equivalent constructs in the other language.

[[File:OPMtoUML SD0.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Figure 1: Use Case Diagram generation of SD0]]
[[File:OPMtoUML SD1.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Figure 2: Use Case Diagram generation of SD1]]

# The first type of diagram in UML that can be generated from an OPM diagram is the Use Case Diagram which is intended for modeling the usage of a system. The main elements comprising the Use Case Diagram are actors and use cases (the entities) along with the relationships (links) among them. Generation of a Use Case Diagram from OPM is therefore based on environmental objects (the actors) and the processes (the use cases) linked to them. Figure 1 is an example of Use Case Diagram generation of SD0. The figure shows the root OPM diagram (a), the corresponding OPL text (b), and the created Use Case Diagram (c). Figure 2 shows a SD1 level of OPD from the same OPM model (a), and the generated Use Case Diagram (b).
# The second type of diagram is the Block Definition Diagram (BDD) which defines features of blocks (like properties and operations) and relationships between blocks, such as associations and generalizations. Generating a BDD is based upon the systemic objects of the OPM model and their relationships—mainly structural relations to other model elements.
# The third type of diagram is Activity Diagrams which are intended to specify flow. Key components included in the Activity Diagram are actions and routing flow elements. In our context, a separate Activity Diagram can be generated for each OPM process containing child subprocesses, i.e., a process which is in-zoomed in the OPM model. There are two kinds of user parameters that can be specified via the settings dialog. The first one deals with selection of the OPM processes: One option is to explicitly specify the required OPM processes by selection from a list. The alternative, which is the default option, is to start with the root OPD (SD) and go down the hierarchy. Here we reach the second parameter (that is independent of the first one), which is the required number of OPD levels (k) to go down the hierarchy. In order to give the user control over the level of abstraction, the diagrams are generated up to k levels down the hierarchy. Each level will result in the generation of an additional Activity Diagram, which is a child activity (subdiagram) contained in the enclosing higher-level activity. The default setting for this option is "all levels down" (i.e., "k = ∞").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grobshtein |first1=Yariv |last2=Dori |first2=Dov |title=Creating SysML views from an OPM model |date=2009 |publisher=IEEE |location=Haifa, Israel |isbn=978-1-4244-2967-7 |pages=36-44 |url=https://doi.org/10.1109/MBSE.2009.5031718 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |ref=SysMLfromOPM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The OPM to Activity Diagram Map.jpg|centre|thumb|598x598px]]

==Study of model comprehension==
In order to assess and examine the effectiveness of the newly developed OPM-to-SysML algorithm and application, Dov Dori and Yariv Grobshtein performed a controlled experiment, which had two major goals:

# Since improved system comprehension was among the potential predicted benefits, they ventured to examine whether the additional SysML diagrams that had been generated automatically with their new application affected system model comprehension;
# They wished to test the quality of the autocreated diagrams, mainly in terms of modeling errors and inconsistencies with the original OPM model from which they were generated.

They carried out the experiment within a lecture of the course "Enterprise Systems Modeling" taught in 2008. Testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference in comprehension level between the OPM-only model and the combined OPM-and-SysML model, against the two-sided alternative that there is a difference, they rejected the null hypothesis in both cases. For both systems, the students' answers to comprehension questions relating the combined OPM-and-SysML models were significantly better than answers relating to OPM-only models.

It seems that the additional diagrams were helpful in answering some of the questions more than the others. Only one question of eight in each of the cases scored lower when the combined diagrams specification was used. The SysML diagram that seems to have the biggest added value is the Block Definition Diagram (BDD), which specifies system hierarchy and features of blocks like attributes and operations. The relatively high helpfulness of the BDD is evident from both the students'assessment of the contribution of this diagram type and from analysis of the scores in the individual questions in both systems. According to the results of the experiment, the Use Case diagram seems to have the least effect on system comprehension, and this is also in agreement with the students' assessment of the Use Case diagram type contribution. In between are the Activity diagram and the State Machine diagram, which appear to have a positive effect, albeit not as high as the effect of the BDD.

As noted, the other goal of the experiment was to assess the quality of the OPM-to-SysML application in terms of errors and inconsistencies between the source OPM model and the generated SysML diagrams. In this regard, the students did not find any issues of errors, inconsistencies, or contradictions associated with the SysML diagrams, indicating that the application has achieved a high level of model-to-model translation fidelity.

In the study an algorithm for automatic SysML views generation from an OPM model was developed and applied. For each SysML view, a mapping scheme from OPM elements to SysML elements constitutes the foundation for the OPM-toSysML sub algorithm and translation engine application. The mappings are partial and do not utilize all the available language elements. The software implementation was OPCAT, the OPM-supporting modeling tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grobshtein |first1=Yariv |last2=Dori |first2=Dov |title=Generating SysML views from an OPM model: Design and evaluation |journal=SYSTEMS ENGINEERING |date=February 2011 |volume=14 |pages=327-340 |doi=10.1002/sys.20181 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |ref=SysMLtoOPMEval |publisher=International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/sys.20181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[continuum mechanics]], a material is said to be under '''plane stress''' if the [[stress (mechanics)|stress vector]] is zero across a particular surface.  When that situation occurs over an entire element of a structure, as is often the case for thin plates, the [[stress analysis]] is considerably simplified, as the stress state can be represented by a [[tensor]] of dimension 2 (representable as a 2 × 2 matrix rather than 3 × 3). &lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt; A related notion, [[plane strain]], is often applicable to very thick members.

Plane stress typically occurs in thin flat plates that are acted upon only by load forces that are parallel to them.  In certain situations, a gently curved thin plate may also be assumed to have plane stress for the purpose of stress analysis. This is the case, for example, of a thin-walled cylinder filled with a fluid under pressure.  In such cases, stress components perpendicular to the plate are negligible compared to those parallel to it.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;

In other situations, however, the bending stress of a thin plate cannot be neglected. One can still simplify the analysis by using a two-dimensional domain, but the plane stress tensor at each point must be complemented with bending terms.

==Mathematical definition==

Mathematically, the stress at some point in the material is a plane stress if one of the three [[principal stress]]es (the [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]) is zero.  That is, there is [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in which the stress tensor has the form  
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} 
\equiv 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{x} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sigma_{y} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
 
For example, consider a rectangular block of material measuring 10, 40 and 5 [[centimetre|cm]] along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, that is being stretched in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction and compressed in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; direction, by pairs of opposite forces with magnitudes 10 [[newton (unit)|N]] and 20 N, respectively, uniformly distributed over the corresponding faces.  The stress tensor inside the block will be

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 
\begin{bmatrix}
500\mathrm{ Pa} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -4000\mathrm{ Pa} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if one chooses the first two coordinate axes arbitrarily but perpendicular to the direction of zero stress, the stress tensor will have the form
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} &amp; 0 \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} 
\equiv 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{x} &amp; \tau_{xy} &amp; 0 \\
\tau_{yx} &amp; \sigma_{y} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and can therefore be represented by a 2 × 2 matrix,
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22}
\end{bmatrix} 
\equiv 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{x} &amp; \tau_{xy} \\
\tau_{yx} &amp; \sigma_{y}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Constitutive equations ==
:''See [[Hooke's law#Plane_stress]]''

==Plane stress in curved surfaces ==
In certain cases, the plane stress model can be used in the analysis of gently curved surfaces. For example,
consider a thin-walled cylinder subjected to an axial compressive load uniformly distributed along its rim, and filled with a pressurized fluid.  The internal pressure will generate a reactive [[hoop stress]] on the wall, a normal tensile stress directed perpendicular to the cylinder axis and tangential to its surface.  The cylinder can be conceptually unrolled and analyzed as a flat thin rectangular plate subjected to tensile load in one direction and compressive load in another other direction, both parallel to the  plate.

==Plane strain (strain matrix)==
[[File:Plane strain.svg|600px|right|thumb|Figure 7.2 Plane strain state in a continuum.]]
{{main|Infinitesimal strain theory}}
If one dimension is very large compared to the others, the [[Strain (materials science)|principal strain]] in the direction of the longest dimension is constrained and can be assumed as zero, yielding a plane strain condition (Figure 7.2).  In this case, though all principal stresses are non-zero, the principal stress in the direction of the longest dimension can be disregarded for calculations. Thus, allowing a two dimensional analysis of stresses, e.g. a [[dam]] analyzed at a cross section loaded by the reservoir.

The corresponding strain tensor is:

: &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; 0 \\
\varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; \varepsilon_{33}\end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which the non-zero &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{33}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; term arises from the [[Poisson's ratio|Poisson's effect]]. This strain term can be temporarily removed from the stress analysis to leave only the in-plane terms, effectively reducing the analysis to two dimensions.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;

==Stress transformation in plane stress and plane strain==
Consider a point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in a continuum under a state of plane stress, or plane strain, with stress components &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \tau_{xy})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and all other stress components equal to zero  (Figure 8.1). From static equilibrium of an infinitesimal material element at &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 8.2), the normal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and the shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on any plane perpendicular to the &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; plane passing through &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with a unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; making an angle of &lt;math&gt;\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with the horizontal, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the direction cosine in the &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; direction, is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n} = \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y ) + \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x - \sigma_y )\cos 2\theta + \tau_{xy} \sin 2\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y )\sin 2\theta + \tau_{xy}\cos 2\theta \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

These equations indicate that in a plane stress or plane strain condition, one can determine the stress components at a point on all directions, i.e. as a function of &lt;math&gt;\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, if one knows the stress components &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \tau_{xy})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on any two perpendicular directions at that point. It is important to remember that we are considering a unit area of the infinitesimal element in the direction parallel to the &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;z\,\!&lt;/math&gt; plane.
[[File:Stress transformation 2D.svg|460px|left|thumb|Figure 8.1 - Stress transformation at a point in a continuum under plane stress conditions.]]
[[File:Stress at a plane 2D.svg|200px|none|thumb|Figure 8.2 - Stress components at a plane passing through a point in a continuum under plane stress conditions.]]

The principal directions (Figure 8.3), i.e., orientation of the planes where the shear stress components are zero, can be obtained by making the previous equation for the shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; equal to zero. Thus we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y )\sin 2\theta + \tau_{xy}\cos 2\theta=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\tan 2 \theta_\mathrm{p} = \frac{2 \tau_{xy}}{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This equation defines two values &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{p}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; which are &lt;math&gt;90^\circ\,\!&lt;/math&gt; apart (Figure 8.3). The same result can be obtained by finding the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; which makes the normal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; a maximum, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\sigma_\mathrm{n}}{d\theta}=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The principal stresses &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, or minimum and maximum normal stresses &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{max}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{min}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, can then be obtained by replacing both values of &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{p}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into the previous equation for &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. This can be achieved by rearranging the equations for &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, first transposing the first term in the first equation and squaring both sides of each of the equations then adding them. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[ \sigma_\mathrm{n} - \tfrac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y )\right]^2 + \tau_\mathrm{n}^2 = \left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
(\sigma_\mathrm{n} - \sigma_\mathrm{avg})^2 + \tau_\mathrm{n}^2 = R^2  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \sigma_\mathrm{avg} = \tfrac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is the equation of a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;R\,\!&lt;/math&gt; centered at a point with coordinates &lt;math&gt;[\sigma_\mathrm{avg}, 0]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, called [[Mohr's circle]]. But knowing that for the principal stresses the shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, then we obtain from this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1 =\sigma_\mathrm{max} = \tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x + \sigma_y) + \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_2 =\sigma_\mathrm{min} = \tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x + \sigma_y) - \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Principal stresses 2D.svg|400px|left|thumb|Figure 8.3 - Transformation of stresses in two dimensions, showing the planes of action of principal stresses, and maximum and minimum shear stresses.]]
{{Clear}}
When &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xy}=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; the infinitesimal element is oriented in the direction of the principal planes, thus the stresses acting on the rectangular element are principal stresses: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \sigma_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y = \sigma_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Then the normal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the principal stresses can be determined by making &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xy}=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n} = \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_1 + \sigma_2 ) + \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\cos 2\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\sin 2\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then the maximum shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{max}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; occurs when  &lt;math&gt;\sin 2\theta = 1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\theta = 45^\circ\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 8.3):

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{max} = \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then the minimum shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{min}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; occurs when  &lt;math&gt;\sin 2\theta = -1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\theta = 135^\circ\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 8.3):

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{min} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Earth-crust-cutaway-english.svg|thumb|The layers of the [[Earth]], a differentiated planetary body]]
In [[planetary science]], '''planetary differentiation''' is the process of separating out different constituents of a planetary body as a consequence of their physical or chemical behavior, where the body develops into compositionally distinct layers; the [[density|denser]] materials of a [[planet]] sink to the center, while less dense materials rise to the surface, generally in a [[magma ocean]]. Such a process tends to create a [[Planetary core|core]] and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Sometimes a chemically distinct [[Crust (geology)|crust]] forms on top of the mantle. The process of planetary differentiation has occurred on planets, [[dwarf planet]]s, the asteroid [[4 Vesta]], and [[natural satellite]]s (such as the [[Moon]]). 

==Heating==
When the [[Sun]] ignited in the [[solar nebula]], [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and other volatile materials were evaporated in the region around it. The [[solar wind]] and [[radiation pressure]] forced these low-density materials away from the Sun. Rocks, and the elements comprising them, were stripped of their early atmospheres,{{Citation needed|reason=it is not clear whether bodies with atmospheres precede the 'ignition' of the Sun or not|date=July 2012}} but themselves remained, to accumulate into [[protoplanet]]s.

Protoplanets had higher concentrations of [[radioactive]] elements early in their history, the quantity of which has reduced over time due to [[radioactive decay]]. Heating due to radioactivity, impacts, and gravitational pressure melted parts of protoplanets as they grew toward being [[planet]]s. In melted zones, it was possible for denser materials to sink towards the center, while lighter materials rose to the surface. The compositions of some [[meteorite]]s ([[achondrite]]s) show that differentiation also took place in some [[asteroid]]s (e.g. [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]), that are parental bodies for meteoroids. The short-lived radioactive isotope [[aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]] was probably the main source of heat.&lt;ref&gt;de Pater, I., and Lissauer, J.J. 2001. Planetary Sciences, Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prialnik D., Merk R., 2008. Growth and evolution of small porous icy bodies with an adaptive-grid thermal evolution code. I. Application to Kuiper Belt objects and Enceladus. Icarus 197: 211–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

When protoplanets [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accrete]] more material, the energy of impact causes local heating. In addition to this temporary heating, the gravitational force in a sufficiently large body creates pressures and temperatures which are sufficient to melt some of the materials. This allows [[chemical reaction]]s and [[density]] differences to mix and separate materials,{{Citation needed|reason=The mechanism is still unclear, specify|date=July 2012}} and soft materials to spread out over the surface.

On [[Earth]], a large piece of molten [[iron]] is sufficiently denser than [[continental crust]] material to force its way down through the crust to the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} In the outer Solar System a similar process may take place but with lighter materials: they may{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} be [[hydrocarbons]] such as [[methane]], [[water]] as liquid or ice, or frozen [[carbon dioxide]].

==Chemical differentiation==
Although bulk materials differentiate outward or inward according to their density, the elements that are chemically bound in them [[fractionation|fractionate]] according to their chemical affinities, "carried along" by more abundant materials with which they are associated. For instance, although the rare element [[uranium]] is very dense as a pure element, it is chemically more compatible as a trace element in the Earth's light, [[silicate]]-rich crust{{Citation needed|reason=how so|date=July 2012}} than in the dense metallic core.

==Physical differentiation==

===Gravitational separation===
High-[[density]] materials tend to sink through lighter materials. This tendency is affected by the relative structural strengths, but such strength is reduced at temperatures where both materials are plastic or molten. [[Iron]], the most common element that is likely to form a very dense molten metal phase, tends to congregate towards planetary interiors. With it, many [[Siderophile element|siderophile]] elements (i.e. materials that readily [[metal alloy|alloy]] with iron) also travel downward. However, not all heavy elements make this transition as some [[chalcophile|chalcophilic]] heavy elements bind into low-density silicate and oxide compounds, which differentiate in the opposite direction.

The main compositionally differentiated zones in the solid Earth are the very dense iron-rich metallic [[Planetary core|core]], the less dense [[talc|magnesium-silicate]]-rich [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and the relatively thin, light [[Crust (geology)|crust]] composed mainly of silicates of [[aluminium]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]] and [[potassium]]. Even lighter still are the watery liquid [[hydrosphere]] and the gaseous, nitrogen-rich [[atmosphere]].

Lighter materials tend to rise through material with a higher density. They may take on dome-shaped forms called [[diapir]]s when doing so. On Earth, [[salt dome]]s are [[salt]] diapirs in the crust which rise through surrounding rock. Diapirs of molten low-density silicate rocks such as [[granite]] are abundant in the Earth's upper crust. The hydrated, low-density [[serpentinite]] formed by alteration of [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] material at [[subduction zone]]s can also rise to the surface as diapirs. Other materials do likewise: a low-temperature, near-surface example is provided by [[mud volcano]]s.

===Moon's KREEP===
On the Moon, a distinctive [[basalt]]ic material has been found that is high in "incompatible elements" such as [[potassium]], [[rare earth element]]s, and [[phosphorus]] and is often referred to by the abbreviation [[KREEP]]. It is also high in [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]. These elements are excluded{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} from the major minerals of the lunar crust which crystallized out from its primeval [[Lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]], and the KREEP basalt may have been trapped as a chemical differentiate between the crust and the mantle, with occasional eruptions to the surface.

===Fractional melting and crystallization===
[[Magma]] in the Earth is produced by [[partial melting]] of a source rock, ultimately in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. The melt extracts a large portion of the "incompatible elements" from its source that are not stable in the major minerals. When magma rises above a certain depth the dissolved minerals start to crystallize at particular pressures and temperatures. The resulting solids remove various elements from the melt, and melt is thus depleted of those elements. Study of trace elements in [[igneous rock]]s thus gives us information about what source melted by how much to produce a magma, and which minerals have been lost from the melt.

===Thermal diffusion===
When material is unevenly heated, lighter material migrates toward hotter zones and heavier material migrates towards colder areas, which is known as [[thermophoresis]], thermomigration, or the [[Thermophoresis|Soret effect]]. This process can affect differentiation in [[magma chamber]]s.

===Differentiation through collision===
[[Earth]]'s [[Moon]] probably formed out of material splashed into orbit by the impact of a large body into the early Earth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Differentiation on Earth had probably already separated many lighter materials toward the surface, so that the impact removed a disproportionate amount of silicate material from Earth, and left the majority of the dense metal behind. The Moon's density is substantially less than that of Earth, due to its lack of a large iron core.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Density differences on Earth==
On [[Earth]], physical and chemical differentiation processes led to a crustal density of approximately 2700&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; compared to the 3400&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; density of the compositionally different mantle just below, and the average density of the planet as a whole is 5515&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:Rome-Pantheon-Interieur1.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] is an example of Roman concrete construction.]]

'''Roman concrete''', also called '''opus caementicium''', was a material used in construction during the late [[Roman Republic]] until the fading of the [[Roman Empire]]. Roman [[concrete]] was based on a [[hydraulic cement|hydraulic-setting cement]].  Recently, it has been found that it materially differs in several ways from modern concrete which is based on [[Portland cement]].  Roman concrete is durable due to its incorporation of [[volcanic ash]], which prevents cracks from spreading. By the middle of the 1st century, the material was used frequently, often brick-faced, although variations in aggregate allowed different arrangements of materials. Further innovative developments in the material, called the [[Concrete Revolution]], contributed to structurally complicated forms, such as the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] dome, the world's largest and oldest unreinforced concrete dome.&lt;ref name="Ancient Roman Concrete"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.romanconcrete.com/docs/spillway/spillway.htm | title=The Riddle of Ancient Roman Concrete | publisher=www.romanconcrete.com | work=S Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region | date=February 1993 | accessdate=20 May 2013 | author=Moore, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman concrete was normally faced with stone or brick, and interiors might be further decorated by [[stucco]], [[fresco]] paintings, or thin slabs of fancy colored marbles. Made up of aggregate and cement, like modern concrete, it differed in that the aggregate pieces were typically far larger than in modern concrete, often amounting to rubble, and as a result it was laid rather than poured.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Martin (ed), ''A Handbook of Roman Art'', p. 30, Phaidon, 1983, {{ISBN|0714822140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Roman concretes were able to be set underwater, which was useful for bridges and other waterside construction.

It is uncertain when Roman concrete was developed, but it was clearly in widespread and customary use from about 150 BC; some scholars believe it was developed a century before that.&lt;ref&gt;[[Axel Boëthius|Boëthius, Axel]], [[Roger Ling|Ling, Roger]], [[Tom Rasmussen|Rasmussen, Tom]], ''Etruscan and Early Roman Architecture'', pp. 128-129, Yale/Pelican history of art, 1978, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0300052901}}, 9780300052909, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1nZswjfqROUC&amp;printsec=frontcover Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic references==
[[File:Caesarea Concrete Bath.jpg|thumbnail|[[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] is the earliest known example to have used underwater Roman concrete technology on such a large scale.]][[Vitruvius]], writing around 25 BC in his [[De architectura|''Ten Books on Architecture'']], distinguished types of aggregate appropriate for the preparation of [[lime mortar]]s. For [[structural mortar]]s, he recommended [[pozzolana]] (''pulvis puteolanus'' in Latin), the volcanic sand from the beds of [[Pozzuoli]], which are brownish-yellow-gray in color in that area around Naples, and reddish-brown near Rome. Vitruvius specifies a ratio of 1 part lime to 3 parts pozzolana for cement used in buildings and a 1:2 ratio of lime to pozzolana for underwater work, essentially the same ratio mixed today for concrete used in marine locations.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Lechtman and Linn Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution", ''Ceramics and Civilization Volume 3: High Technology Ceramics: Past, Present, Future'', edited by W.D. Kingery and published by the American Ceramics Society, 1986; and Vitruvius, Book II:v,1; Book V:xii2&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the first century, the principles of underwater construction in concrete were well known to Roman builders. The city of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] was the earliest known example to have made use of underwater Roman concrete technology on such a large scale.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;

For rebuilding Rome after the [[Great Fire of Rome|fire in 64 AD]], which destroyed large portions of the city, [[Nero]]'s new building code largely called for brick-faced concrete. This appears to have encouraged the development of the brick and concrete industries.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Material properties==

Roman concrete, like any [[concrete]], consists of an [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] and hydraulic [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] – a binder mixed with water that hardens over time. The aggregate varied, and included pieces of rock, [[ceramic]] tile, and brick rubble from the remains of previously demolished buildings.

[[Gypsum]] and [[calcium oxide|quicklime]] were used as binders. Volcanic dusts, called [[pozzolana]] or "pit sand", were favored where they could be obtained. Pozzolana makes the concrete more resistant to salt water than modern-day concrete.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Erin. “The Secrets of Ancient Rome’s Buildings.” Smithsonian.com. 16 November 2011. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The pozzolanic mortar used had a high content of [[alumina]] and [[silica]]. [[Tuff]] was often used as an aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05xxl4t|title=Rome's Invisible City - BBC One|website=BBC|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete, and in particular, the hydraulic mortar responsible for its cohesion, was a type of structural ceramic whose utility derived largely from its [[Rheology|rheological plasticity]] in the paste state. The setting and hardening of hydraulic cements derived from hydration of materials and the subsequent chemical and physical interaction of these hydration products. This differed from the setting of [[lime mortar|slaked lime mortars]], the most common cements of the pre-Roman world. Once set, Roman concrete exhibited little plasticity, although it retained some resistance to tensile stresses.

The setting of [[geopolymer|pozzolanic cements]] has much in common with setting of their modern counterpart, [[Portland cement]]. The high silica composition of Roman pozzolana cements is very close to that of modern cement to which blast furnace [[slag]], [[fly ash]], or [[silica fume]] have been added.  

The strength and longevity of Roman ''marine'' concrete is understood to benefit from a reaction of [[seawater]] with a mixture of [[volcanic ash]] and quicklime to create a rare crystal called [[tobermorite]], which may resist fracturing. As seawater percolated within the tiny cracks in the Roman concrete, it reacted with [[phillipsite]] naturally found in the volcanic rock and created [[Aluminium|aluminous]] tobermorite crystals. The result is a candidate for "the most durable building material in human history". In contrast, modern concrete exposed to saltwater deteriorates within decades.&lt;ref name="WashPost2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guarino |first1=Ben |title=Ancient Romans made world's 'most durable' concrete.

[[File:Torbermorite_CSH_3D_Crystal_Structure_RasMol.gif|thumb|Crystal structure of tobermorite: elementary unit cell]] 

Compressive strengths for modern Portland cements are typically at the 50 MPa level and have improved almost ten-fold since 1860.&lt;ref&gt;N. B. Eden and J. E. Bailey, "Mechanical Properties and Tensile Failure Mechanism of a High Strength Polymer Modified Portland Cement", ''J. Mater. Sci.'', 19, 2677–2685 (1984); and Lechtman and Hobbs, "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt; There are no comparable mechanical data for ancient mortars, although some information about tensile strength may be inferred from the cracking of Roman concrete domes. These tensile strengths vary substantially from the water/cement ratio used in the initial mix. At present, there is no way of ascertaining what water/cement ratios the Romans used, nor are there extensive data for the effects of this ratio on the strengths of pozzolanic cements.&lt;ref&gt;Lechtman and Hobbs, "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"; see also: C. A. Langton and D. M. Roy, "Longevity of Borehole and Shaft Sealing Materials: Characterization of Ancient Cement Based Building Materials", ''Mat. Res. Soc. SYmp. Proc.'' 26, 543–549 (1984); and Topical Report ONWI-202, Battelle Memorial Institute, Office of Nuclear Waste Isolation, Distribution Category UC-70, National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismic technology==
For an environment as prone to [[earthquake]]s as the [[Italian peninsula]], interruptions and internal constructions within walls and domes created discontinuities in the concrete mass. Portions of the building could then shift slightly when there was movement of the earth to accommodate such stresses, enhancing the overall strength of the structure. It was in this sense that bricks and concrete were flexible. It may have been precisely for this reason that, although many buildings sustained serious cracking from a variety of causes, they continue to stand to this day.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. MacDonald, The Architecture of the Roman Empire, rev. ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1982, fig. 131B; Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technology used to improve the [[strength of materials|strength]] and stability of concrete was its gradation in domes. One example is the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], where the aggregate of the upper dome region consists of alternating layers of light [[tuff]] and [[pumice]], giving the concrete a density of 1,350&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The foundation of the structure used [[travertine]] as an aggregate, having a much higher density of 2,200&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;K. de Fine Licht, The Rotunda in Rome: A Study of Hadrian's Pantheon. Jutland Archaeological Society, Copenhagen, 1968, pp. 89–94, 134–35; and Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
Recent scientific breakthroughs examining Roman concrete have been gathering media and industry attention.&lt;ref&gt;Sezen Soyer-Uzun, Sejung Rosie Chae, Chris J. Benmore, Hans-Rudolf Wenk, Paulo J. M. Monteiro, "Compositional Evolution of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) Structures by Total X-Ray Scattering", Journal of the American Ceramic Society, Volume: 95 Issue: 2 Pages: 793-798, February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trebcap.com/fixing-canadas-infrastructure-with-volcanoes/ |title= Fixing Canada's Infrastructure with Volcanoes |publisher=Trebuchet Capital Partners Research |accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its unusual durability, longevity and lessened environmental footprint, corporations and municipalities are starting to explore the use of Roman-style concrete in North America, substituting the coal [[fly ash]] with volcanic ash that has similar properties. Proponents claim that concrete made with volcanic ash can cost up to 60% less because it requires less cement, and that it has a smaller environmental footprint due to its lower cooking temperature and much longer lifespan.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Compositional Evolution of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) Structures by Total X-Ray Scattering&lt;/ref&gt; Usable examples of Roman concrete exposed to harsh marine environments have been found to be 2000 years old with little or no wear.&lt;ref&gt;M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7030">'''&lt;big&gt;Rural management&lt;/big&gt;''' is the study of planning, organising, directing, and controlling of [[rural area]],  [[Cooperative|co-operatives]], [[agribusiness]] and allied fields. It merges the knowledge of [[Management|management studies]] and applying it in the rural context. Most of the courses are designed  in such a way that the concepts taught in the class is applied in the real life through training in the rural areas through [[Case study|case-studies]] and interaction with the rural people

== Rural Management Institutes in India ==

There are many academic institutions within India  offering courses on Rural Management.  Notable among them are Institute of Rural Management, Anand (www.irma.ac.in), KIIT School of Rural Management (KSRM), Bhubaneswar (ksrm.ac.in) and Xavier University, Bhubaneswar (ximb.ac.in).  They offer either two years' Post Graduate Diploma in Rural Management or Two Years' Masters in Business Administration (MBA-Rural Management).

Rural Management graduates work in the areas like sustainable rural livelihoods, agri-business management, cooperatives, climate change, micro-finance, [[corporate social responsibility]], [[Natural resource management|natural resources managemen]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t, rural marketing, commodity trading and marketing and  [[social entrepreneurship]].

Apart from the classroom based courses, IRMA and KSRM provide opportunities to their rural management students to undergo three field segments (internships) of 10–11 weeks duration. In other words, the curriculum is designed to make it contextual to develop rural areas through experiential learning, live projects.

== Growing scope of Rural Management in India ==
India has close to 4,000 management schools that produce over 300,000 graduates every year. But the country has  few niche management schools focusing on the rural sector. Rural management schools  produce less than 1,000  rural managers. The small number is surprising considering the importance of the rural sector, or Bharat, in India's economy.

According to a study by global consulting firm Accenture, the rural economy accounts for 50 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. It also makes up 70 per cent of the country's population and 50 per cent of the work force. About 75 percent of new factories built in the past decade have come up in rural India, which accounts for 75 per cent of all new manufacturing jobs. Since 2000, per capita GDP has grown at 6.2 per cent a year in rural India compared with 4.2 per cent in urban areas. And in terms of spending, Bharat has trumped India by a mile. Between 2009 and 2012, Indians in the countryside spent $69 billion compared with $55 billion in big towns and cities.

Harish Manwani, chairman of Hindustan Unilever Ltd, says rural India is a powerhouse with the potential to add $1.8 trillion, or the equivalent of the current GDP, to the country's economy. But this potential can be realised only if Bharat and India merge.

Mainstream management schools have not ventured into rural management for many reasons. The rural management courses are very niche and they call for students with a different set of attitudes. The teaching approach is also different. Most mainstream schools may not be prepared to handle such subjects," says Professor Abraham Koshy, professor of marketing at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.  Experts say there is room for more rural management schools. For a country of India's size and the number of problems we face, there is a need for lot more such institutions. There is a  need to create a lot of rural managers who are potential agents of change.

Rural Management is one such specialisation which gives you the chance to contribute towards uplifting and betterment of those sections of the society, where the light of development is yet to reach. The purpose of the rural managers is to promote sustainable, eco-friendly and equitable socioeconomic development of rural area  through professional management of their institutions and organisations. Previously, only a few people opted for this challenging course but nowadays, a lot of students are opting for this course of rural management as they want to learn and showcase their skills to ensure that the performance in the rural sector is enhanced..

== Unique areas of Rural Management in terms of course and career ==
The MBA (Rural Management) programme is unique in the sense that in addition to traditional management courses such as Project Management, Accounting, Quantitative Techniques, Managerial Analysis and Communication, Finance, Marketing Management, many specialised courses focusing on management of rural sector are offered.

Agribusiness Management, Rural Production and Livelihoods, Rural Finance and Commercial Banking, Natural Resources Management and Climate Change, Rural Marketing, CSR Management, Micro Finance, ICTs for Development, Innovation in Rural Development and Enterprises, Policy and Programme Interventions in Rural Development are some of the courses especially focusing on the rural sector.

Anyone who completes MBA (Rural Management) has the advantage of having career opportunities in any general management area.  In addition to that, Rural Management graduates alone are preferred in specific areas mentioned above.

'''''SciShow''''' is a series of science-related videos on [[YouTube]]. The program is mainly  hosted by [[Hank Green]] of the [[VlogBrothers]] and [[Michael Aranda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leib|first=Bart|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/03/scishow-crash-course/|title=Scishow &amp; Crash Course: Why Isn’t School This Cool?|publisher=''Wired''|work=Geekdad|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SciShow'' was launched as an [[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|original channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eördögh|first=Fruzsina|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/hank-green-vlogbrothers-scishow-youtube/|title=Watch the premiere of Hank Green's SciShow|publisher=''Daily Dot''|date=January 3, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hosting and production==
[[File:Hank Green Vlogbrothers 2016.jpg|thumb|Hank Green, host of ''SciShow'']]
Though Green hosts the majority of episodes, the show has alternate hosts; [[Michael Aranda]] has been with the show since its inception, and Olivia Gordon  of the Missoula Insectarium joined in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Ancient Human Fossils!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqeu49ENGYw|website=SciShow|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to her move to Chicago, [[Emily Graslie]] of ''The Brain Scoop'', also occasionally hosted on the channel. There have also been guest appearances by [[Lindsey Doe]], who hosts ''Sexplanations'', another channel launched by Green; and by longtime SciShow staffer Stefan Chin, who since 2018 has been a regular host. ''SciShow'' has grown since its 2012 launch; since then it has employed a full editorial, production, and operations staff.&lt;ref name=businessinsideradcampaign&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Madeline|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-scishow-and-hank-green-landed-a-national-ad-campaign-from-youtube-2014-10|title=Meet The Science Nerd Whose Face Is About To Be Plastered On YouTube Ads Everywhere|publisher=''Business Insider''|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''SciShow Space'' has three rotating hosts: Hank Green, Reid Reimers, and Caitlin Hofmeister.

''SciShow Kids'' is primarily hosted by Jessi Knudsen Castañeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SciShow Kids|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/scishowkids|website=Youtube|publisher=SciShow|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion and funding==
The channel was launched as an "[[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|original channel]]", which meant that [[YouTube]] funded the channel.&lt;ref name=marketwired1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/vlogbrother-hank-green-launches-science-channel-as-one-youtubes-much-publicized-original-1602880.htm|title=Vlogbrother Hank Green Launches Science Channel as One of YouTube's Much-Publicized Original Programming Channels|publisher=''Market Wired''|date=January 3, 2012|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hale|first=Mike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/arts/television/youtubes-original-channels-take-on-tv.html|title=Genres Stretch, for Better and Worse, as YouTube Takes On TV|publisher=''New York Times''|date=April 25, 2012|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's initial grant was projected to expire in 2014, and in response, on September 12, 2013 ''SciShow'' joined the viewer-funding site ''Subbable'', created in part by Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Hank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GE10lpp8O0|title=SciShow Needs You!|publisher=''YouTube''|work=SciShow|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eifler|first=Emily|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/multimedia/article.jsp?essid=124879|title=Crowdfunding Matures with a Lesson from Public Broadcasting|publisher=''KQED''|date=August 20, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the channel landed a national advertisement deal with YouTube. The educational program was featured on platforms such as billboards and television commercials, as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeSimone|first=Evan|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/10/hank-green-will-soon-be-stalking-you-with-science/|title=Hank Green Will Soon Be Stalking You With Science|publisher=''New Media Rockstars''|date=October 16, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green details that the advertisements had a positive effect on ''SciShow'', stating, "My Twitter exploded, our followers and subscribers exploded."&lt;ref name=businessinsideradcampaign/&gt;

After [[Patreon]] acquired ''Subbable'', the channel switched over to Patreon where it continues to receive support in exchange for various perks.

[[File:Space Engineers 5.jpg|thumb|''Space Engineers'' video game: 3D spatial navigation]]
'''Spatial ability''' or visuo-spatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/cty/STBguide.pdf|title = Spatial ability|date = |accessdate = |website = www.jhu.edu|publisher = Johns Hopkins University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual-spatial abilities are used for everyday use from navigation, understanding or fixing equipment, understanding or estimating distance and measurement, and performing on a job. Spatial abilities are also important for success in fields such as sports, technical aptitude, [[mathematics]], natural sciences, [[engineering]], economic forecasting, [[meteorology]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/cty/STBguide.pdf|title = What is spatial ability?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Johns Hopkins University|author = Johns Hopkins University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women in Science and Mathematics|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK23762/|date = 2006-01-01|first = National Academy of Sciences|last = (us)|first2 = National Academy of Engineering|last2 = (us)|first3 = and Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Maximizing the Potential of Women in Academic Science and|last3 = Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do spatial abilities involve understanding the outside world, but they also involve processing outside information and reasoning with it through visual representation in the mind.

== Definition and types ==
Spatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are four common types of spatial abilities which include spatial or visuo-spatial perception, spatial visualization, mental folding and [[mental rotation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact of cognitive imaging and sex differences on the development of laparoscopic suturing skills|journal = Canadian Journal of Surgery|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0008-428X|pmc = 3211902|pmid = 16248138|pages = 387–393|volume = 48|issue = 5|first = Tyrone|last = Donnon|first2 = Jean-Gaston|last2 = DesCôteaux|first3 = Claudio|last3 = Violato}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these abilities have unique properties and importance to many types of tasks whether in certain jobs or everyday life. For example, spatial perception is defined as the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emergence and Characterization of Sex Differences in Spatial Ability: A Meta-Analysis|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19086027_Emergence_and_Characterization_of_Sex_Differences_in_Spatial_Ability_A_Meta-Analysis|journal = Child Development|pages = 1479–1498|volume = 56|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00213.x|first = Marcia C.|last = Linn|first2 = Anne C.|last2 = Petersen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mental rotation]] on the other hand is the mental ability to manipulate and rotate 2D or 3D objects in space quickly and accurately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Lastly, spatial visualization is characterized as complicated multi-step manipulations of spatially presented information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These three abilities are mediated and supported by a fourth spatial cognitive factor known as spatial working memory. [[Spatial memory|Spatial working memory]] is the ability to temporarily store a certain amount of visual-spatial memories under attentional control in order to complete a task.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Comparison of Laboratory and Clinical Working Memory Tests and Their Prediction of Fluid Intelligence|journal = Intelligence|date = 2009-05-01|issn = 0160-2896|pmc = 2818304|pmid = 20161647|pages = 283|volume = 37|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2008.11.005|first = Jill T.|last = Shelton|first2 = Emily M.|last2 = Elliott|first3 = B. D.|last3 = Hill|first4 = Matthew R.|last4 = Calamia|first5 = Wm. Drew|last5 = Gouvier}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cognitive ability mediates individual differences in the capacity for higher level spatial abilities such as mental rotation.

=== Spatial perception ===
[[File:Видеоскриншот из игры S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Mobile.gif|thumb|Action shooting game: Use of spatial perceptual skills]]
Spatial perception is defined as the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It consists of being able to perceive and visually understand outside spatial information such as features, properties, measurement, shapes, position and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~asimmons/pdfs/PT%20Spatial%20Perception.pdf|title = Spatial Perception from a Cartesian Point of View|last = Simmons|first = Alison|date = 2003|journal = Philosophical Topics |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when one is navigating through a dense forest they are using spatial perception and awareness. Another example is when trying to understand the relations and mechanics inside of a car, he or she is relying on their spatial perception to understand its visual framework. Tests that measure spatial perception include the [[rod and frame test]], where subjects must place a rod vertically while viewing a frame orientation of 22 degrees in angle, or the [[water-level task]], where subjects have to draw or identify a horizontal line in a tilted bottle.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Spatial perception is also very relevant in sports. For example, a study found that [[cricket]] players who were faster at picking up information from briefly presented visual displays were significantly better batsmen in an actual game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inspection time and high-speed ball games|journal = Perception|date = 1989-01-01|issn = 0301-0066|pmid = 2628929|pages = 789–792|volume = 18|issue = 6|first = I. J.|last = Deary|first2 = H.|last2 = Mitchell|doi=10.1068/p180789}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study published in the ''[[Journal of Vision]]'' found that soccer players had higher perceptual ability for body kinematics such as processing multitasking crowd scenes which involve pedestrians crossing a street or complex dynamic visual scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessment of sport specific and non-specific biological motion perception in soccer athletes shows a fundamental perceptual ability advantage over non-athletes for recognizing body kinematics|journal = Journal of Vision|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1534-7362|pmid = &lt;!--none--&gt;|pages = 504|volume = 15|issue = 12|doi = 10.1167/15.12.504|first = Thomas|last = Romeas|first2 = Jocelyn|last2 = Faubert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study published in the ''Journal of Human Kinetics'' on fencing athletes found that achievement level was highly correlated with spatial perceptual skills such as visual discrimination, visual-spatial relationships, visual sequential memory, narrow attentional focus and visual information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Attention, Visual Perception and their Relationship to Sport Performance in Fencing|journal = Journal of Human Kinetics|date = 2013-12-31|issn = 1640-5544|pmc = 3916930|pmid = 24511355|pages = 195–201|volume = 39|doi = 10.2478/hukin-2013-0082|first = Mona Mohamed Kamal|last = Hijazi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review published in the journal of ''[[Neuropsychologia]]'' found that spatial perception involves attributing meaning to an object or space, so that their sensory processing is actually part of semantic processing of the incoming visual information.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visual cognition: a new look at the two-visual systems model|journal = Neuropsychologia|date = 2005-01-01|issn = 0028-3932|pmid = 15707914|pages = 301–312|volume = 43|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.11.016|first = M.|last = Jeannerod|first2 = P.|last2 = Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that spatial perception involves the [[Visual system|human visual system]] in the brain and the [[Parietal lobe|parietal lobule]] which is responsible for visuomotor processing and visually goal-directed action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Studies have also found that individuals who played first person shooting games had better spatial perceptual skills like faster and more accurate performance in a peripheral and identification task while simultaneously performing a central search.&lt;ref name="Wu 673–686"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Playing shooter and driving videogames improves top-down guidance in visual search|journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 1943-393X|pmid = 23460295|pages = 673–686|volume = 75|issue = 4|doi = 10.3758/s13414-013-0440-2|first = Sijing|last = Wu|first2 = Ian|last2 = Spence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggested that, in addition to enhancing the ability to divide attention, playing  action games significantly enhances perceptual skills like top-down guidance of attention to possible target locations.&lt;ref name="Wu 673–686" /&gt;

=== Mental rotation ===
[[File:Rubik's cube 2.svg|thumb|[[Rubik's cube]]: a popular puzzle that involves 3D mental rotation]][[Mental rotation]] is the ability to mentally represent and ''rotate'' 2D and 3D objects in space quickly and accurately, while the object's features remain unchanged. Mental representations of physical objects can help utilize problem solving and understanding. For example, Hegarty (2004) showed that people manipulate mental representations for reasoning about mechanical problems, such as how gears or pulleys work.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online Psychology Laboratory - About Mental Rotation|url = http://opl.apa.org/Experiments/About/AboutMentalRotation.aspx|website = opl.apa.org|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Schwartz and Black (1999) found that doing such mental simulations such as pouring water improves people's skill to find the solution to questions about the amount of tilt required for containers of different heights and widths.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the field of sports psychology, coaches for a variety of sports (e.g. basketball, gymnastics, soccer or golf) have promoted players to use mental imagery and manipulation as one technique for performance in their game. (Jones &amp; Stuth, 1997)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Recent research (e.g., Cherney, 2008) has also demonstrated evidence that playing video games with consistent practice can improve mental rotation skills, for example improvements in women's scores  after practice with a game that involved a race within a 3-D environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Same effects have been seen playing action video games such as [[Unreal Tournament]] as well as the popular mainstream game [[Tetris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The virtual brain: 30 years of video-game play and cognitive abilities|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|date = 2013-09-13|issn = 1664-1078|pmc = 3772618|pmid = 24062712|volume = 4|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00629|first = Andrew J.|last = Latham|first2 = Lucy L. M.|last2 = Patston|first3 = Lynette J.|last3 = Tippett}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jigsaw puzzle|Jigsaw]] puzzles and [[Rubik's Cube|Rubik's cube]] are also activities that involve higher level of mental rotation and can be practiced to improve spatial abilities over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Early Puzzle Play: A predictor of preschoolers’ spatial transformation skill|journal = Developmental Psychology|date = 2012-03-01|issn = 0012-1649|pmc = 3289766|pmid = 22040312|pages = 530–542|volume = 48|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/a0025913|first = S.C.|last = Levine|first2 = K.R.|last2 = Ratliff|first3 = J.|last3 = Huttenlocher|first4 = J.|last4 = Cannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Talent in autism: hyper-systemizing, hyper-attention to detail and sensory hypersensitivity|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2009-05-27|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 2677592|pmid = 19528020|pages = 1377–1383|volume = 364|issue = 1522|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0337|first = Simon|last = Baron-Cohen|first2 = Emma|last2 = Ashwin|first3 = Chris|last3 = Ashwin|first4 = Teresa|last4 = Tavassoli|first5 = Bhismadev|last5 = Chakrabarti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Adolescence: The Transitional Years|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sz20BQAAQBAJ|publisher = Academic Press|date = 2014-05-10|isbn = 9781483265650|first = J. Roy|last = Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental rotation is also unique and distinct from the other spatial abilities because it also involves areas associated with [[Motor skill|motor simulation]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroimaging studies of mental rotation: a meta-analysis and review|journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date = 2008-01-01|issn = 0898-929X|pmid = 17919082|pages = 1–19|volume = 20|issue = 1|doi = 10.1162/jocn.2008.20013|first = Jeffrey M.|last = Zacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial visualization is characterized as complicated multi-step manipulations of spatially presented information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It involves [[Mental image|visual imagery]] which is the ability to mentally represent visual appearances of an object, and [[Mental image|spatial imagery]] which consists of mentally representing spatial relations between the parts or locations of the objects or movements.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ideal-group.org/visualization-research/Spatial-Visualization-Visual-Imagery-and-Mathematical-Problem-Solving-of-Students-with-Varying-Abilities.pdf|title = Spatial Visualization, Visual Imagery, and Mathematical Problem Solving of Students With Varying Abilities|last = Van Garderen|first = Delinda|date = 2006|journal = JOURNAL OF LEARNING DISABILITIES VOLUME 39, NUMBER 6|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial visualization is especially important in the domains of science and technology. For example, an astronomer must mentally visualize the structures of a solar system and the motions of the objects within it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An engineer mentally visualizes the interactions of the parts of a machine or building that he or she is assigned to design or work with.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Chemists must be able to understand formulas which can be viewed as abstract models of molecules with most of the spatial information deleted; spatial skills are important in restoring that information when more detailed mental models of the molecules are needed in the formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Spatial visualization also involves imagining and working with visual details of measurement, shapes, motion, features and properties through mental imagery and using this spatial relations to derive at an understanding to a problem. Whereas spatial perception involves understanding externally via the senses, spatial visualization is the understanding internally through mental imagery in one's mind.

Another critical spatial visualization ability is '''mental animation'''.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental animation in the visuospatial sketchpad: evidence from dual-task studies|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|date = 1997-05-01|issn = 0090-502X|pmid = 9184484|pages = 321–332|volume = 25|issue = 3|first = V. K.|last = Sims|first2 = M.|last2 = Hegarty|doi=10.3758/bf03211288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental animation is mentally visualizing the motion and movement of components within any form of system or in general.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It is an ability highly crucial in mechanical reasoning and understanding, for example mental animation in mechanical tasks can involve deconstructing a pulley system mentally into smaller units and animating them in the corresponding sequence or laws in the mechanical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental animation: inferring motion from static displays of mechanical systems|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date = 1992-09-01|issn = 0278-7393|pmid = 1402712|pages = 1084–1102|volume = 18|issue = 5|first = M.|last = Hegarty|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.18.5.1084}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, mental animation is mental imagining how mechanical objects work by analyzing the motion of their smaller parts.

'''Mental folding''' is a complex spatial visualization that involves the ''folding'' of 2D pattern or material into 3D objects and representations.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental Paper Folding Performance Following Penetrating Traumatic Brain Injury in Combat Veterans: A Lesion Mapping Study|journal = Cerebral Cortex (New York, NY)|date = 2013-07-01|issn = 1047-3211|pmc = 3673178|pmid = 22669970|pages = 1663–1672|volume = 23|issue = 7|doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhs153|first = Leila|last = Glass|first2 = Frank|last2 = Krueger|first3 = Jeffrey|last3 = Solomon|first4 = Vanessa|last4 = Raymont|first5 = Jordan|last5 = Grafman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other studies, mental folding has had relatively little research and study. In comparison to mental rotation, mental folding is a non-rigid spatial transformation ability which means features of the manipulated object end up changing unlike mental rotation. In rigid manipulations, the object itself is not changed but rather its spatial position or orientation is, whereas in non-rigid transformations like mental folding the object and shapes are changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Understanding spatial transformations: similarities and differences between mental rotation and mental folding|journal = Cognitive Processing|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 1612-4790|pmid = 23397105|pages = 105–115|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s10339-013-0544-6|first = Justin|last = Harris|first2 = Kathy|last2 = Hirsh-Pasek|first3 = Nora S.|last3 = Newcombe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental folding in tasks usually require a series of mental rotations to sequentially fold the object into a new one. Classic mental folding tests are the Paper folding task which is similar to [[Origami]]. Origami also requires mental folding by assessing folding a 2D paper enough times to create a 3D figure.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

'''Visual penetrative ability''' is least common spatial visualization task which involves ability to imagine what is inside an object based on the features outside.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Spatial working memory ==
[[Spatial memory|Spatial working memory]] is the ability to temporarily store visual-spatial memories under [[attentional control]], in order to complete a task.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This cognitive ability mediates individual differences in the capacity for higher level spatial abilities, such as mental rotation. Spatial working memory involves storing large amounts of short-term spatial memories in relation to visuo-spatial sketchpad. It is used in the temporary storage and manipulation of visual-spatial information such as memorizing shapes, colours, location or motion of objects in space. It is also involved in tasks which consist of planning of spatial movements, like planning one's route through a complex building. The visuospatial sketchpad can be split  into separate visual, spatial and possibly kin-aesthetic (movement) components. Its neurobiological function also correlates within the right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2|last1 = Baddeley|first1 = A.D.|year = 2000|title = The episodic buffer: A new component of working memory?|url = |journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume = 4|issue = 11|pages = 417–423|pmid = 11058819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocational applications ==
Researchers have found that spatial ability plays an important role in advanced educational credentials in the science, technology, engineering or math (STEM).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/Wai2009SpatialAbility.pdf|title = Spatial Ability for STEM Domains: Aligning Over 50 Years of cumulative psychological Knowledge solidifies Its importance|last = Wai|first = Jonathan|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Educational Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0016127|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why do spatial abilities predict mathematical performance?|journal = Developmental Science|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 1363-755X|pmc = 3997754|pmid = 24410830|pages = 462–470|volume = 17|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/desc.12138|first = Maria Grazia|last = Tosto|first2 = Ken B.|last2 = Hanscombe|first3 = Claire M.A.|last3 = Haworth|first4 = Oliver S.P.|last4 = Davis|first5 = Stephen A.|last5 = Petrill|first6 = Philip S.|last6 = Dale|first7 = Sergey|last7 = Malykh|first8 = Robert|last8 = Plomin|first9 = Yulia|last9 = Kovas}}&lt;/ref&gt; From studies, it has been indicated that the probability of getting an advanced degree in STEM increases in positive relation to the level of one's spatial ability. For example, a 2009 study published in the [[Journal of Educational Psychology]] found that 45% of those with [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] PhDs were within top percentage of high spatial ability in a group of 400,000 participants who were analyzed for 11 years since they were in the 12th grade.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Only less than 10% of those with [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] PhDs were below the top quarter in spatial ability during adolescence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The researchers then concluded how important spatial ability is for [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] and as a factor in achieving advanced educational success in that field.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Spatial visualization is especially important in [[science]] and [[technology]]. For example, an [[astronomer]] must visually imagine the structures of a solar system, and the path of the bodies within it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An engineer must visually imagine the motions of the parts of a machine or building that he or she is assigned to work with.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Chemists must be able to understand formulas which are essentially abstract models supposed to represent spatial dynamics of molecules, and thus spatial skills are important in visualizing the molecule models that are needed in the formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Spatial manipulation ability is also important in the field of structural geology, when visually imagining how rocks change through time, such as migration of a magma body through crust or progressive folding of a strati-graphic succession. Another spatial visualization skill known as ''visual penetrative ability'' is important in geology as it requires geologists to visualize what is inside of a solid object based on past knowledge.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://nagt-jge.org/doi/pdf/10.5408/1.3559671|title = Characterizing and Improving Spatial Visualization Skills|last = Titus|first = Sarah|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Geoscience Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current literature also indicates that mathematics involves visuo-spatial processing. Studies have found that gifted students in math, for instance, perform better in spatial visualization than non-gifted students.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A 2008 review published in the journal of ''Neuroscience Biobehavioural Reviews'' found evidence that visuo-spatial processing is intuitively involved in many aspects of processing numbers and calculating in math. For example, meaning of a digit in a multi-digit number is coded following spatial information given its relation to its position within the number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visualizing numbers in the mind's eye: the role of visuo-spatial processes in numerical abilities|journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date = 2008-10-01|issn = 0149-7634|pmid = 18584868|pages = 1361–1372|volume = 32|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.05.015|first = Maria Dolores|last = de Hevia|first2 = Giuseppe|last2 = Vallar|first3 = Luisa|last3 = Girelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that numerical estimation might rely on integrating different visual-spatial cues (diameter, size, location, measurement) to infer an answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The role of visual information in numerosity estimation|journal = PLOS ONE|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 3355123|pmid = 22616007|pages = e37426|volume = 7|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0037426|first = Titia|last = Gebuis|first2 = Bert|last2 = Reynvoet}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 2014 also found evidence that mathematical calculation relies on the integration of various spatial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Doing arithmetic by hand: hand movements during exact arithmetic reveal systematic, dynamic spatial processing|journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology]]|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1747-0226|pmid = 25051274|pages = 1579–1596|volume = 67|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17470218.2014.897359|first = Tyler|last = Marghetis|first2 = Rafael|last2 = Núñez|first3 = Benjamin K.|last3 = Bergen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2015 study published in the journal of ''[[Frontiers in Psychology]]'' also found that numerical processing and arithmetic performance may rely on visual perceptual ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visual perception can account for the close relation between numerosity processing and computational fluency|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1664-1078|pmc = 4563146|pmid = 26441740|pages = 1364|volume = 6|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01364|first = Xinlin|last = Zhou|first2 = Wei|last2 = Wei|first3 = Yiyun|last3 = Zhang|first4 = Jiaxin|last4 = Cui|first5 = Chuansheng|last5 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study published in the journal of [[Cognitive science|''Cognitive Science'']] also found that spatial visualization ability is crucial for solving [[Kinematics|kinematic]] problems in physics. Nonetheless, current literature indicates that spatial abilities specifically mental rotation, is crucial for achieving success in various fields of chemistry, engineering and physics.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spatial Ability in Learning Engineering Mechanics: Critical Review|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282853648_Spatial_Ability_in_Learning_Engineering_Mechanics_Critical_Review|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-01-15|doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen C. Harrison''' is professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology, professor of pediatrics, and director of the Center for Molecular and Cellular Dynamics of [[Harvard Medical School]], head of the Laboratory of Molecular Medicine at [[Boston Children's Hospital]], and investigator of the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsrx.com/newsletters/AIDS-Vaccine-Week/2005-08-22/082220053336AV.html |title=Awards - Stephen C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4402">{{about|the approach to teaching law}}

'''Street Law''' (also known as ''StreetLaw'') is a global program of legal and civics education geared at secondary school students.  Street Law is an approach to teaching practical law to grassroots populations using interactive teaching methodologies.  Elements of practical law taught include awareness of human rights/civil rights, democratic principles, conflict resolution, the advocacy process, criminal and civil law, employment law, family law, and consumer rights.

==History==

The Street Law approach began in 1972 when [[Georgetown University Law Center]] developed a program that sent law students into high schools in Washington, DC to teach practical law lessons to high school students. Street Law, Inc., an outgrowth of the Georgetown program, develops and implements practical law education programs around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.georgetown.edu/news/street-law-clinic-celebrates-40-years-in-operation.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Street Law, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Its main offices are located in Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.

==Organizational structure==

Although Street Law traces its founding to Georgetown Law, it has spread to many law schools globally.  Neither Georgetown Law nor Street Law, Inc. exercise vertical or indirect control over local Street Law programs.  Within U.S. law schools, Street Law is typically run as a [[legal clinic]] or experiential learning module, where law students receive law school academic credit for participation.  At other law schools, Street Law is run as a [[student organization]] or as an extracurricular activity, typically under direct faculty supervision.

==Pedagogical methodology==

One core Street Law module is a teaching program wherein law students are sent into community schools to teach high school students age appropriate lessons in the law.  Within the U.S., this means that second and third year law students are paired with secondary school classes where they regularly teach courses on law and legal subjects.  There is significant autonomy and differentiation in the way that Street Law is taught nationally in the U.S. and globally, and Street Law expressly encourages law schools and law students to experiment with different teaching methodologies to account for different learning styles depending on age, culture, regional and state differences, and so on.

Other Street Law approaches include: teaching Legal Life Skills to underserved populations; Teacher Professional Development courses; partnerships with the legal community (both law firm and corporate) to teach about the law and legal careers to secondary students; teaching about rule of law, democracy and civil rights to populations in countries outside of the US; and publishing teaching resources.

==Teaching resources==

Among other publications, [[McGraw-Hill]] has published a high school social studies textbook using this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Street Law: A Course in Practical Law|last1=Arbetman|first1=Lee|last2=O'Brien|first2=Edward L.|publisher=Glencoe/McGraw-Hill|year=2016|isbn=9780021429257|edition=9th|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McGraw-Hill]] has also published a high school government textbook co-authored by Street Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Remy, Ph.D.|first1=Richard C.|last2=Ritchie, Ph.D.|first2=Donald A.|last3=Arbetman, M.Ed., J.D.|first3=Lee|last4=Hanson, M.S.|first4=Hanson|last5=Morreale Scott, Ed.M.|first5=Lena|title=United States Government: Our Democracy|date=2018|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780076681136|edition=1st|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McGraw-Hill]] also publishes ''Street Law: Understanding Law and Legal Issues'', an informative law-based, civic learning text for use in the community college program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arbetman|first1=Lee|last2=O'Brien,|first2=Edward|title=Street Law: Understanding Law and Legal Issues|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780076624058|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''systems integrator''' (or '''system integrator''')&lt;ref name=howtoworkwith&gt;[http://www.controleng.com/single-article/how-to-work-with-a-system-integrator/3c1415491ee4507df6083049b64978ff.html How to Work with a System Integrator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whatdoesitmean&gt;[https://www.thinkesi.com/System-Integrator-Paul-Oswald What Does It Mean To Be A System Integrator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fixdata&gt;[http://dvsum.com/automated-testing-data-quality-integrity-missing-weapon-system-integrators-arsenal/ Fix Data: How System Integrators Can Ensure Project Success]&lt;/ref&gt; is a person or company that specializes in bringing together component subsystems into a whole and ensuring that those subsystems function together,&lt;ref name=whatdoesitmean/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/52450/systems-integrator Definition of: systems integrator] From PC World&lt;/ref&gt; a practice known as [[system integration]]. They also solve problems of [[automation]].&lt;ref name=howtoworkwith/&gt; Systems integrators may work in many fields but the term is generally used in the [[information technology]] (IT) field such as [[computer network]]ing, the [[defense industry]], the [[mass media]], [[enterprise application integration]], [[business process management]] or manual [[computer programming]].&lt;ref name="Info"&gt;{{Citation| last=Moore | first=June | date =13 December 1982| contribution= Software Reviews, BusinessMaster II+, ledger for CP/M systems| title=InfoWorld | publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc| page = 31 | issn=0199-6649}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data quality]] issues are an important part of the work of systems integrators.&lt;ref name=fixdata/&gt;

== Required skills ==
A system integration engineer needs a broad range of skills and is likely to be defined by a breadth of knowledge rather than a depth of knowledge.  These skills are likely to include [[software architecture|software]], [[systems architecture|systems]] and [[enterprise architecture|enterprise]] architecture, [[software engineering|software]] and [[hardware engineering|hardware]] engineering, [[Protocol (computing)|interface protocols]], and general problem solving skills. It is likely that the problems to be solved have not been solved before except in the broadest sense. They are likely to include new and challenging problems with an input from a broad range of engineers where the system integration engineer "pulls it all together."&lt;ref name="BUPT"&gt;{{Citation |title=An Introduction to School of Information Engineering, Information Engineering Program|publisher=Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications|location=Beijing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance technology Integration==

Systems integrators generally have to be good at matching clients needs with existing products. An [[inductive reasoning aptitude]] is useful for quickly understanding how to operate a system or a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]. A systems integrator will tend to benefit from being a generalist, knowing a lot about a large number of products. Systems integration includes a substantial amount of diagnostic and troubleshooting work. The ability to research existing products and software components is also helpful. Creation of these information systems may include designing or building customized vehicle prototypes or concepts for future investors and sponsors for a good model or example of the revamped  integrations to come - [[Hybrid Technology]], [[Electric]]{{dn|date=September 2017}}, [[Turbocharged]], [[Svt]]{{dn|date=September 2017}}, [[McLaren]], Greenwood, [[Ac shnitzer]],[are some of the specialized teams of Factory/Performance integration that drives auto designers to stay competitive and keep the cutting edge feel in any Brand from Dodge to Pagani there are areas for improvement that can only be tweaked and twisted to stay a cut above the rest and maintain the physical appearance of the specialty teams trademark modifications.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

==In the defense industry==

In the defense industry, the job of 'Systems Integration' engineer is growing in importance as defense systems become more 'connected'.  As well as integrating new systems, the task of integrating current systems is attracting a lot of research and effort.  It is only in recent years that systems have started to be deployed that can interconnect with each other; most systems were designed as 'stovepipe' designs with no thought to future connectivity.

The current problem is how to harness all the information available, from the various information generators (or sensors) into one complete picture.

As well as the design of the actual interfaces much effort is being put into presenting the information in a useful manner.  The level of information, needed by the different levels in the military structure, and the relevance of the information (information can become outdated in seconds) is so variable that it may be necessary to have more than one system connected.

Another problem is how information is networked.  The Internet may seem to be an obvious solution, but it is vulnerable to [[denial of service]] and physical destruction of the key 'hubs'.  One answer is to use a dedicated military communication system, but the [[Throughput|bandwidth]] needed would be astronomical in such a system.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Army [[Warrant Officer (United States)]] military occupational specialty (MOS) 140A - Command and Control Systems Technician is an example of a systems integrator in the defense industry.
140A Warrant Officers assigned to Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) integrate systems with multiple [[operating systems]] (OS) and hardware configurations – that include: 
[[UNIX]], [[Linux]] &amp; [[Microsoft Windows]]
Others can fill a similar role at the Division level and higher.

==In Entertainment and architectural controls==

In entertainment and architectural installations, systems integrators function as a designer/engineer, bringing together a wide array of components from various manufacturers to accomplish the goal of creating a unified, functioning system that meets the needs of the client.  Systems Integrators are usually involved in the selection of instruments and control components from among various [[OEMs]] to determine the specific mix of output, function, interconnection, program storage, controls, and user interfaces required for specific projects.  The integrator is generally responsible for generating the control riser, collaborating with the lighting consultant/ AV consultant on the function programming, and will commission the system once installed.  Often (but not always) the system integrator will also be the vendor for projects they are commissioning, and will collaborate with the lighting designer on the artistic design.  As lighting and A/V systems increase in their level of sophistication, and the number of manufacturers for components of these systems increases, so does the demand for systems integrators.
 
Common data protocols involved in entertainment and architectural systems are [[DMX512-A|Digital Multiplexing (or DMX512-A)]], [[RDM (lighting)|Remote Device Management (or RDM)]], [[Art-Net]], [[Architecture for Control Networks|ACN]] or sACN (Streaming Architecture for Control Networks), Analog, and various proprietary control software from a variety of manufacturers.  Systems Integrators design many distributed nodes in traditional star or ring topologies, or customize system layout for specific installations.  The network will have a hierarchy of main and sub-control stations with varying degrees of access.  The network can be designed such that the controls for this system can be on an established timeline, or controlled in real time by astronomical clocks, audio/motion/IR sensors, or various means of user interface (buttons, touch-pads, consoles).  This system might utilize a primary controller that can access the entire system, and satellite control interfaces linked via a network backbone that would determine functionality based on access codes.  For example, a casino might use a networked system that interfaces with architectural lighting, stage lighting, special effects (such as fog machines or fountains), and media content routed to a media server.  The primary controller would have access to all devices on the network, while individual control stations could have varying levels of functionality.  A ballroom might have a multi-button panel that would adjust lighting only in that ballroom, while a cabaret space with a stage would require an access code that would give employees access to the stage lighting, while the IT manager could use the same panel to access the main controls for the networks.

== In the automation industry ==
{{main article|Automation integrator}}
System Integrators in the automation industry typically provide the product and application experience in implementing complex automation solutions.  Often, System Integrators are aligned with automation vendors, joining their various System Integrator programs for access to development products, resources and technical support.  System integrators are tightly linked to their accounts and often are viewed as the engineering departments for small manufacturers, handling their automation system installation, commissioning and long term maintenance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3148">In [[political science]], international and comparative [[law]] and [[economics]], '''transitology''' is the name for the study of the process of change from one political [[regime]] to another, mainly from [[authoritarian]] regimes to [[democracy|democratic]] ones.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Transitology tries to explain processes of [[democratization]] in a variety of contexts, from bureaucratic authoritarianism and other forms of dictatorship in [[Latin America]], [[southern Europe]] and [[northern Africa]] to [[postcommunist]] developments in [[eastern Europe]]. The debate has become something of an academic "turf-war" between [[Comparative politics|comparative studies]] and [[area studies]] scholars, while highlighting several problematic features of [[social science]] [[methodology]], including [[generalization]], an overemphasis on [[elite]] attitudes and behavior, [[Eurocentrism]], the role of [[history]] in explaining [[causality]], and the inability to produce testable [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2501122]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>I only changed the way the vector \mathbf{r} was written in terms of the unit radial vector. That is, I only made the text clearer, following the standard convention. Before, it was written (r,0,0) leading to a possible misunderstanding, since it leads someone to think about cartesian components of a vector.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12924">In [[mathematics]], '''vector spherical harmonics (VSH)''' are an extension of the scalar [[spherical harmonics]] for use with [[vector field]]s. The components of the VSH are [[complex-valued]] functions expressed in the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinate basis vectors]].

==Definition==
Several conventions have been used to define the VSH.&lt;ref&gt;
R.G. Barrera, G.A. Estévez and J. Giraldo, ''Vector spherical harmonics and their application to magnetostatics'', Eur. J. Phys. '''6''' 287-294 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Carrascal, G.A. Estevez, P. Lee and V. Lorenzo '' Vector spherical harmonics and their application to classical electrodynamics'', Eur. J. Phys., '''12''', 184-191 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
E. L. Hill, ''The theory of Vector Spherical Harmonics'', Am. J. Phys. '''22''', 211-214 (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
E. J. Weinberg, ''Monopole vector spherical harmonics'', Phys. Rev. D. '''49''', 1086-1092 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Morse and H. Feshbach, ''Methods of Theoretical Physics, Part II'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1898-1901 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; 
We follow that of Barrera ''et al.''. Given a scalar [[spherical harmonic]] {{math|''Y&lt;sub&gt;ℓm&lt;/sub&gt;''(''θ'', ''φ'')}}, we define three VSH:

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm} = Y_{lm}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm} = r\nabla Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm} = \mathbf{r}\times\nabla Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[unit vector]] along the radial direction in [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; the vector along the radial direction with the same norm as the radius, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;. The radial factors are included to guarantee that the dimensions of the VSH are the same as those of the ordinary spherical harmonics and that the VSH do not depend on the radial spherical coordinate.

The interest of these new vector fields is to separate the radial dependence from the angular one when using spherical coordinates, so that a vector field admits a [[multipole expansion]]

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}=\sum_{l=0}^\infty\sum_{m=-l}^l\left(E^r_{lm}(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}+E^{(1)}_{lm}(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}+E^{(2)}_{lm}(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The labels on the components reflect that &lt;math&gt;E^r_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; is the radial component of the vector field, while &lt;math&gt;E^{(1)}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{(2)}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; are transverse components (w.r.to the radius vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;).

==Main Properties==

===Symmetry===
Like the scalar spherical harmonics, the VSH satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{Y}^*_{lm}\qquad\mathbf{\Psi}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{lm}\qquad\mathbf{\Phi}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

which cuts the number of independent functions roughly in half. The star * indicates [[complex conjugate]].

===Orthogonality===

The VSH are [[orthogonal functions|orthogonal]] in the usual three-dimensional way at a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}=0\qquad\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}=0\qquad\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}=0&lt;/math&gt;

They are also orthogonal in the Hilbert space

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{Y}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = \delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = l(l+1)\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = l(l+1)\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

An additional result at a single point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; (not reported in Barrera et al, 1985) is (for all &lt;math&gt;l,m,l',m'&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Psi}_{l'm'}=0\qquad\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{l'm'}=0&lt;/math&gt;

===Vector multipole moments===
The orthogonality relations allow one to compute the spherical multipole moments of a vector field as

:&lt;math&gt;E^r_{lm} = \int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{Y}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E^{(1)}_{lm} = \frac{1}{l(l+1)}\int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E^{(2)}_{lm} = \frac{1}{l(l+1)}\int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

===The gradient of a scalar field===
Given the [[multipole expansion]] of a scalar field

: &lt;math&gt;\phi = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \phi_{lm}(r) Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

we can express its gradient in terms of the VSH as

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla\phi = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r} \mathbf{Y}_{lm}+
\frac{\phi_{lm}}{r}\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence===
For any multipole field we have

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}f\right)Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right) = -\frac{l(l+1)}{r}fY_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

By superposition we obtain the [[divergence]] of any vector field

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E^r_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}E^r_{lm}-\frac{l(l+1)}{r}E^{(1)}_{lm}\right)Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

we see that the component on {{math|'''Φ'''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓm''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is always [[solenoidal]].

===Curl===
For any multipole field we have

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\right) =-\frac{1}{r}f\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}f\right)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right) = -\frac{l(l+1)}{r}f\mathbf{Y}_{lm}-\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}f\right)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

By superposition we obtain the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of any vector field

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l
\left(-\frac{l(l+1)}{r}E^{(2)}_{lm}\mathbf{Y}_{lm}-\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E^{(2)}_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+
\frac{1}{r}E^{(2)}_{lm}\right)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}+
\left(-\frac{1}{r}E^r_{lm}+\frac{\mathrm{d}E^{(1)}_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}E^{(1)}_{lm}\right)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Laplacian===
Action of the [[Laplace operator]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta = \nabla\cdot\nabla&lt;/math&gt; separates as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\left(f(r)\mathbf{Z}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right)\mathbf{Z}_{lm}
+ f(r)\Delta \mathbf{Z}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_{lm} = \mathbf{Y}_{lm}, \mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}, \mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{Y}_{lm} = -\frac{1}{r^2}(2+l(l+1))\mathbf{Y}_{lm} +\frac{2}{r^2}\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm} = \frac{2}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{Y}_{lm} -\frac{1}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm} = -\frac{1}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also note that this action becomes [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]], i.e. the off-diagonal coefficients are equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{r^2}\sqrt{l(l+1)}&lt;/math&gt;, for the properly [[Unit vector|normalized]] VSH.

==Examples==

===First vector spherical harmonics===

* &lt;math&gt;l=0&lt;/math&gt;

:* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{00}= \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

:* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Psi}_{00}= \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;

:* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{00}= \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;l=1&lt;/math&gt;

:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{10}= \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression for negative values of m are obtained applying the symmetry relations.

==Applications==

===Electrodynamics===
The VSH are especially useful in the study of [[Electromagnetic wave equation#Multipole expansion|multipole radiation fields]]. For instance, a magnetic multipole is due to an oscillating current with angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and complex amplitude

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{J}}= J(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding electric and magnetic fields can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{E}}= E(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{B}}= B^r(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}+B^{(1)}(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into Maxwell equations, Gauss' law is automatically satisfied

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\hat{\mathbf{E}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

while Faraday's law decouples in

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\hat{\mathbf{E}}=-\mathrm{i}\omega\hat{\mathbf{B}}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
\left\{\begin{array}{l}\displaystyle \frac{l(l+1)}{r}E = \mathrm{i}\omega B^r \\ \ \\ 
\displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}r} +\frac{E}{r}= \mathrm{i}\omega B^{(1)}\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Gauss' law for the magnetic field implies

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\hat{\mathbf{B}} = 0\quad\Rightarrow \quad\frac{\mathrm{d}B^r}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}B^r - \frac{l(l+1)}{r}B^{(1)}=0&lt;/math&gt;

and Ampère-Maxwell's equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\hat{\mathbf{B}} = \mu_0 \hat{\mathbf{J}} + \mathrm{i}\mu_0\varepsilon_0\omega \hat{\mathbf{E}} \quad\Rightarrow\quad -\frac{B^r}{r}+\frac{\mathrm{d}B^{(1)}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{B^{(1)}}{r} = \mu_0J+\mathrm{i}\omega\mu_0\varepsilon_0E&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, the partial differential equations have been transformed into a set of ordinary differential equations.

===Fluid dynamics===

In the calculation of the [[Stokes' law]] for the drag that a viscous fluid exerts on a small spherical particle, the velocity distribution obeys [[Navier-Stokes equations]] neglecting inertia, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot \mathbf{v} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0} = -\nabla p + \eta \nabla^2\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

with the boundary conditions

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}\quad (r=a)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = -\mathbf{U}_0\quad (r\to\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

being '''U''' the relative velocity of the particle to the fluid far from the particle. In spherical coordinates this velocity at infinity can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}_0 = U_0\left(\cos\theta\, \hat{\mathbf{r}} - \sin\theta \,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right) = U_0 \left(\mathbf{Y}_{10} + \mathbf{\Psi}_{10}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The last expression suggest an expansion on spherical harmonics for the liquid velocity and the pressure

:&lt;math&gt;p=p(r)Y_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = v^r(r) \mathbf{Y}_{10} + v^{(1)}(r) \mathbf{\Psi}_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution in the Navier-Stokes equations produces a set of ordinary differential equations for the coefficients.

A '''waverider''' is a [[hypersonic]] [[aircraft]] design that improves its supersonic [[lift-to-drag ratio]] by using the [[shock wave]]s being generated by its own flight as a lifting surface, a phenomenon known as [[compression lift]]. To date the only manned aircraft to use the technique was the [[Mach number|Mach]]&amp;nbsp;3 [[supersonic]] [[XB-70 Valkyrie]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The waverider remains a well-studied design for high-speed aircraft in the Mach 5 and higher hypersonic regime, although no such design has yet entered production. The [[Boeing X-51]]A [[scramjet]] demonstration aircraft was tested from 2010 to 2013.  In its final test flight, it reached a speed of to {{convert|5.1|Mach|sigfig=2|60,000}}.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Graham.

==History==

===Early work===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
The waverider design concept was first developed by [[Terence Nonweiler]] of the [[Queen's University of Belfast]], and first described in print in 1951 as a re-entry vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Nonweiler Waverider|url=http://www.astronautix.com/n/nonweilerwaverider.html|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consisted of a [[delta-wing]] platform with a low [[wing loading]] to provide considerable surface area to dump the heat of re-entry. At the time, Nonweiler was forced to use a greatly simplified 2D model of airflow around the aircraft, which he realized would not be accurate due to [[wikt:spanwise|spanwise]] flow across the wing. However, he also noticed that the spanwise flow would be stopped by the shockwave being generated by the aircraft, and that if the wing was positioned to deliberately approach the shock, the spanwise flow would be trapped under wing, increasing pressure, and thus increasing lift.

In the 1950s, the British started a space program based around the [[Blue Streak missile]], which was, at some point, to include a manned vehicle. [[Armstrong-Whitworth]] were contracted to develop the re-entry vehicle, and unlike the U.S. space program they decided to stick with a winged vehicle instead of a ballistic [[space capsule|capsule]]. Between 1957 and 1959, they contracted Nonweiler to develop his concepts further. This work produced a [[pyramid]]-shaped design with a flat underside and short wings. Heat was conducted through the wings to the upper cool surfaces, where it was dumped into the turbulent air on the top of the wing. In 1960, work on the Blue Streak was canceled as the missile was seen as being obsolete before it could have entered service. Work then moved to the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE), where it continued as a research program into high-speed (Mach 4 to 7) civilian [[airliner]]s.&lt;ref name=iwm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/record.php?id=1060021486&amp;media_id=78 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224154513/http://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/record.php?id=1060021486&amp;media_id=78 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-24 |title=Supersonic Hypersonic Flight |author1=Dr J Seddon |author2=Dr J E Gordon |author3=Dr R R Jamison |work=UK Government (via Imperial War Museum) |year=1962 |accessdate=2012-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work was discovered by engineers at [[North American Aviation]] during the early design studies of what would lead to the [[XB-70]] bomber. They re-designed the original "classic" delta wing to incorporate drooping wing tips in order to trap the shock waves mechanically, rather than using a shock cone generated from the front of the aircraft. This mechanism also had two other beneficial effects; it reduced the amount of horizontal lifting surface at the rear of the aircraft, which helped offset a nose-down trim that occurs at high speeds, and it added more vertical surface which helped improve the lateral stability, which decreased at high speed.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Caret wing===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Nonweiler's original design used the shock wave generated by the aircraft as a way to control spanwise flow, and thereby increase the amount of air trapped under the wing in the same way as a [[wing fence]]. While working on these concepts, he noticed that it was possible to shape the wing in such a way that the shock wave generated off its leading edge would form a horizontal sheet under the craft. In this case, the airflow would not only be trapped horizontally, spanwise, but vertically as well. The only area the air above the shock wave could escape would be out the back of the sheet where the fuselage ended. Since the air was trapped between this sheet and the fuselage, a large volume of air would be trapped, much more than the more basic approach he first developed. Furthermore, since the shock surface was held at a distance from the craft, shock heating was limited to the leading edges of the wings, lowering the thermal loads on the fuselage.

In 1962 Nonweiler moved to [[Glasgow University]] to become Professor of Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics. That year his "Delta Wings of Shapes Amenable to Exact Shock-Wave Theory" was published by the ''Journal of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]]'', and earned him that society's [[Gold Medal]].  A craft generated using this model looks like a delta wing that has been broken down the center and the two sides folded downward. From the rear it looks like an upside-down V, or alternately, the "[[caret]]", ^, and such designs are known as "caret wings". Two to three years later the concept briefly came into the public eye, due to the airliner work at the RAE that led to the prospect of reaching [[Australia]] in 90 minutes. Newspaper articles led to an appearance on [[Scottish Television]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Hawker Siddeley]] examined the caret wing waverider in the later 1960s as a part of a three-stage lunar rocket design. The first stage was built on an expanded Blue Steel, the second a waverider, and the third a nuclear-powered manned stage. This work was generalized in 1971 to produce a two-staged reusable spacecraft. The {{convert|121|ft|adj=on}} long first stage was designed as a classical waverider, with [[air-breathing engine|air-breathing propulsion]] for return to the launch site. The upper stage was designed as a lifting body, and would have carried an 8000-pound (3.6&amp;nbsp;t) payload to [[low Earth orbit]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Cone flow waveriders===
Nonweiler's work was based on studies of planar 2D shocks due to the difficulty understanding and predicting real-world shock patterns around 3D bodies. As the study of hypersonic flows improved, researchers were able to study waverider designs that used different shockwave shapes, the simplest being the conical shock generated by a cone. In these cases, a waverider is designed to keep the rounded shockwave attached to its wings, not a flat sheet, which increases the volume of air trapped under the surface, and thereby increases lift.&lt;ref name= "Jones_Lifting_Configs"&gt;Jones, J.G., K.C. Moore, J. Pike and P.L. Roe. [http://www.jackpike.co.uk/JonesEtAl.html "A Method of Designing Lifting Configurations For High Supersonic Speeds, Using Axisymmetric Flow Fields"]. Ingenieur-Archiv, 37, Band, 1, Heft, pp. 56-72, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the caret wing, the cone flow designs smoothly curve their wings, from near horizontal in the center, to highly drooped where they meet the shock. Like the caret wing, they have to be designed to operate at a specific speed to properly attach the shock wave to the wing's leading edge, but unlike them the entire body shape can be varied dramatically at the different design speeds, and sometimes have wingtips that curve upward to attach to the shockwave.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Further development of the conical sections, adding canopies and fuselage areas, led to the "osculating cones waverider", which develops several conical shock waves at different points on the body, blending them to produce a single shaped shock. The expansion to a wider range of compression surface flows allowed the  design of waveriders with control of volume,&lt;ref name="Jones_Lifting_Configs"/&gt; upper surface shape, engine integration and centre of pressure position. Performance improvements and off-design analysis continued until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, J. [http://www.jackpike.co.uk/ConeWing340.html "Experimental Results from Three Cone-Flow Waveriders"]. Agard Conference Proceedings 30, Hypersonic Boundary Layers and Flow Fields, [[Royal Aeronautical Society]], London, Ref. 12, p. 20, 1–3 May 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pike, J. [http://www.jackpike.co.uk/OffCaret.html "The Pressure on Flat and Anhedral Delta Wings with Attached Shock Waves"]. The Aeronautical Quarterly, Vol XXIII, Part 4, Nov. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period at least one waverider was tested at the [[Woomera Test Facility|Woomera Rocket Range]], mounted on the nose of an air-launched [[Blue Steel missile]], and a number of airframes were tested in the wind tunnel at NASA's [[Ames Research Center]]. However, during the 1970s most work in hypersonics disappeared, and the waverider along with it.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Viscous optimized waveriders===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
One of the many differences between supersonic and hypersonic flight concerns the interaction of the [[boundary layer]] and the shock waves generated from the nose of the aircraft. Normally the boundary layer is quite thin compared to the streamline of airflow over the wing, and can be considered separately from other aerodynamic effects. However, as the speed increases and the shock wave increasingly approaches the sides of the craft, there comes a point where the two start to interact and the flowfield becomes very complex. Long before that point, the boundary layer starts to interact with the air trapped between the shock wave and the fuselage, the air that is being used for lift on a waverider.

Calculating the effects of these interactions was beyond the abilities of aerodynamics until the introduction of useful [[computational fluid dynamics]] starting in the 1980s. In 1981, Maurice Rasmussen at the [[University of Oklahoma]] started a waverider renaissance by publishing a paper on a new 3D underside shape using these techniques. These shapes have superior lifting performance and less drag. Since then, whole families of [[Projective cone|cone]]-derived waveriders have been designed using more and more complex conic shocks, based on more complex software. This work eventually led to a conference in 1989, the ''First International Hypersonic Waverider Conference'', held at the University of Maryland.

These newest shapes, the "viscous optimized waveriders", look similar to conical designs as long as the angle of the shock wave on the nose is beyond some critical angle, about 14 degrees for a Mach 6 design for instance. The angle of the shock can be controlled by widening out the nose into a curved plate of specific radius, and reducing the radius produces a smaller shock cone angle. Vehicle design starts by selecting a given angle and then developing the body shape that traps that angle, then repeating this process for different angles. For any given speed, a single shape will generate the best results.

==Design==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
During [[re-entry]], hypersonic vehicles generate lift only from the underside of the [[fuselage]]. The underside, which is inclined to the flow at a high [[angle of attack]], creates lift in reaction to the vehicle wedging the airflow downwards. The amount of lift is not particularly high, compared to a traditional [[wing]], but more than enough to maneuver given the amount of distance the vehicle covers.

Most re-entry vehicles have been based on the [[Riabouchinsky solid|blunt-nose]] reentry design pioneered by [[Theodore von Kármán]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} He demonstrated that a [[shock wave]] is forced to "detach" from a curved surface, forced out into a larger configuration that requires considerable energy to form. Energy expended in forming this shock wave is no longer available as heat, so this shaping can dramatically reduce the heat load on the spacecraft. Such a design has been the basis for almost every re-entry vehicle since,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} found on the blunt noses of the early [[ICBM]] warheads, the bottoms of the various [[NASA]] capsules, and the large nose of the [[Space Shuttle]].

The problem with the blunt-nose system is that the resulting design creates very little lift, meaning the vehicle has problems maneuvering during re-entry. If the spacecraft is meant to be able to return to its point of launch "on command", then some sort of maneuvering will be required to counteract the fact that the Earth is turning under the [[spacecraft]] as it flies. After a single [[low Earth orbit]], the launching point will be over {{convert|1000|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} to the east of the spacecraft by the time it flies over again after one full orbit{{clarify|reason=are we talking about a polar orbit? Otherwise this doesn't make sense|date=October 2018}}. A considerable amount of research was dedicated to combining the blunt-nose system with wings, leading to the development of the [[lifting body]] designs in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

It was while working on one such design that Nonweiler developed the waverider. He noticed that the detachment of the shock wave over the blunt [[leading edge]]s of the wings of the Armstrong-Whitworth design would allow the air on the bottom of the craft to flow spanwise and escape to the upper part of the wing through the gap between the leading edge and the detached shock wave. This loss of airflow reduced (by up to a quarter) the lift being generated by the waverider, which led to studies on how to avoid this problem and keep the flow trapped under the wing.

Nonweiler's resulting design is a [[delta-wing]] with some amount of negative [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] — the wings are bent down from the [[fuselage]] towards the tips. When viewed from the front, the wing resembles a [[caret]] symbol ([[File:Arial caret.svg|25px]]) in [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]], and these designs are often referred to as carets. The more modern 3D version typically looks like a rounded letter 'M'. Theoretically, a star-shaped{{clarify|reason=what kind of star? 5 sided? 12 sided? What?|date=October 2018}} waverider with a frontal cross-section of a "+" or "×" could reduce drag by another 20%. The disadvantage of this design is that it has more area in contact with the shock wave and therefore has more pronounced [[heat|heat dissipation]] problems.

Waveriders generally have sharp noses and sharp leading edges on their wings. The underside shock-surface remains attached to this. Air flowing in through the shock surface is trapped between the shock and the fuselage, and can only escape at the rear of the fuselage. With sharp edges, all the lift is retained.

Even though sharp edges get much hotter than rounded ones at the same air density, the improved lift means that waveriders can glide on re-entry at much higher altitudes where the air density is lower. A list ranking various space vehicles in order of heating applied to the [[airframe]] would have [[space capsule|capsules]] at the top (re-entering quickly with very high heating loads), waveriders at the bottom (extremely long gliding profiles at high altitude), and the [[Space Shuttle]] somewhere in the middle.

Simple waveriders have substantial design problems. First, the obvious designs only work at a particular [[Mach number]], and the amount of lift captured will change dramatically as the vehicle changes speed. Another problem is that the waverider depends on [[radiative cooling]], possible as long as the vehicle spends most of its time at very high altitudes. However these altitudes also demand a very large wing to generate the needed lift in the thin air, and that same wing can become rather unwieldy at lower altitudes and speeds.

Because of these problems, waveriders have not found favor with practical aerodynamic designers, despite the fact that they might make long-distance hypersonic vehicles efficient enough to carry [[air freight]].

Some researchers{{who|date=October 2018}} controversially{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} claim that there are designs that overcome these problems. One candidate for a multi-speed waverider is a "[[caret wing]]", operated at different angles of attack. A caret wing is a [[delta wing]] with longitudinal conical or triangular [[leading edge slot|slots]] or [[strake (aviation)|strakes]]. It strongly resembles a [[paper airplane]] or [[rogallo wing]].  The correct angle of attack would become increasingly precise at higher mach numbers, but this is a control problem that is theoretically solvable. The wing is said to perform even better if it can be constructed of tight mesh, because that reduces its drag, while maintaining lift. Such wings are said to have the unusual attribute of operating at a wide range of mach numbers in different [[fluid]]s with a wide range of [[Reynolds number]]s.

The temperature problem can be solved with some combination of a [[transpiring]] surface, exotic materials, and possibly [[heatpipe|heat-pipes]]. In a transpiring surface, small amounts of a [[coolant]] such as water are pumped through small holes in the aircraft's skin (see [[transpiration]] and [[perspiration]]). This design works for Mach&amp;nbsp;25 spacecraft [[Atmospheric_entry#Ablative|re-entry shield]]s, and therefore should work for any aircraft that can carry the weight of the coolant. Exotic materials such as [[Reinforced carbon-carbon|carbon-carbon composite]] do not conduct heat but endure it, but they tend to be [[brittle]]. [[Heatpipe]]s are not widely used at present. Like a conventional [[heat exchanger]], they conduct heat better than most solid materials, but like a [[thermosiphon]] are passively pumped. The Boeing X-51A deals with external heating through the use of a tungsten nosecone and space shuttle-style heat shield tiles on its belly. Internal (engine) heating is absorbed by using the JP-7 fuel as a coolant prior to combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/8428-hypersonic-51-scramjet-launch-test-flight.html |title=Hypersonic X-51 Scramjet to Launch Test Flight in May |publisher= Spaceflight Now |year = 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other high temperature materials, referred to as SHARP materials (typically [[zirconium diboride]] and [[hafnium diboride]]) have been used on steering vanes for ICBM reentry vehicles since the 1970s, and are proposed for use on hypersonic vehicles. They are said to permit Mach 11 flight at {{convert|100000|ft|abbr=on}} altitudes and Mach 7 flight at sea level. These materials are more structurally rugged than the [[Reinforced Carbon Composite]] (RCC) used on the space shuttle nose and leading edges, have higher radiative and temperature tolerance properties, and do not suffer from oxidation issues that RCC needs to be protected against with coatings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02364.x/abstract |title=Thermal Conductivity Characterization of Hafnium Diboride-Based Ultra-High-Temperature Ceramics - Gasch - |work=Journal of the American Ceramic Society |publisher= Wiley Online  |year = 2008 |accessdate=2012-08-14 |doi=10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02364.x |volume=91 |pages=1423–1432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=dti&amp;id=news/DTIHSV.xml&amp;headline=Sandia%20Materials%20Enable%20Hypersonic%20Flight{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoltán Gárdonyi''' (25 April 1906 – 27 June 1986) was a Hungarian [[composer]] and [[musicologist]]. He taught at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] for 26 years.

== Life and work ==
Gárdonyi was born in [[Budapest]]. His mother, the pianist Maria Weigl, studied at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] with [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s pupil, [[István Thomán]], at the same time and in the same class as [[Béla Bartók]]. At the age of 17, Gárdonyi began his studies in composition with [[Zoltán Kodály]] at the Liszt Academy in Budapest.{{r|bio}} After studying with [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Arnold Schering]] in Berlin, he taught as a professor at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest from 1941 until 1967.{{r|bio}} He also led the faculty for Protestant sacred music until it was closed by the communists in 1949.{{r|augsburg}}

His oeuvre includes sacred music, orchestral works and chamber music.{{r|bio}} Three of his motets for choir [[a cappella]] were published in German by [[Schott Music|Schott]], "Finnisches Busslied", "Der Herr ist mein Hirte" ([[Psalm 23]]) and "Singet dem Herren" ([[Psalm 96]]).{{r|schott}} Gárdonyi's musicological research yielded findings related to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]. His works were published in Germany, Sweden and the United States. Gárdonyi lived in Germany with his family beginning in 1972. He died in Westfalian [[Herford]] a few weeks after his 80th birthday.{{r|bio}}

His son is the composer and concert [[Organ (music)|organist]] [[Zsolt Gárdonyi]].

== Performances and recordings ==
Some of Gárdonyi's works were recorded, including his three organ sonatas and the ''Partita sopra Veni Creator Spiritus'', played by Dezső Karasszon, as well as several further organ works and German motets.{{r|Naxos}} The ''Partita'' is a symphonic organ composition, consisting of the following mouvements: introduction (Largo), theme (Lento), four variations and finale (Allegro maestoso), based on [[Martin Luther]]'s [[hymn]] for [[Pentecost]] "{{lang|de|[[Komm, Gott Schöpfer, Heiliger Geist]]}}".{{r|hannover}}
